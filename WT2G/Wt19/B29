Richard Teske <br>

Heritage Foundation's Resource Bank Conference<br>

I would first like to thank Mitch Pearlstien for his generous introduction.  <p>

I would also like to thank Mitch and Robert Rector for mentioning Marvin
Olasky.  Marvin is a senior fellow at Progress & Freedom Foundation.  We have
just completed publishing his new book with Free Press called Renewing
American Compassion.  It will be available in a store near you after May 7th.<p>

This is the end of the commercial announcement.<p>

To be the fourth speaker in the late afternoon, before a conservative
audience speaking on Medicaid before the cocktail hour is a difficult
assignment.<p>

One suspects that anyone interested in these subjects must be a liberal, but I
submit to you that these very issues are the ultimate test of our political
philosophy.<p>

I come from a genetic Republican family; My grandfather was so conservative he
believed Roosevelt ruined the country..but he meant Teddy!<p>

You have heard I do health care consulting at Greenberg Traurig and am a
vice-president for External Affairs at Progress & Freedom Foundation.<p>

I've worked in health care public policy for over twenty years<p>

But my first experience was in 9th grade when my debate topic was "Should we
Nationalize Health Care"<p>

If I'm able to fight this issue for twenty more years I can retire.<p>

The Progress & Freedom Foundation is a conservative think tank with a twist:
 we are not dedicated to reforming the liberal welfare state.  We are
dedicated to replacing it!  Based upon Traditional American Values as we
enter the information age.<p>

And it is this very information age that is driving the force of
devolution: the subject of this years Heritage Resource Bank Conference..<p>

The previous three speakers have done an excellent job describing the present
Medicaid and welfare programs.<p>

We all know that the Congressional Leadership is just now deciding on its
welfare and Medicaid strategy.<p>

The Medicaid plan, based upon the Governor's proposal, has been drafted.<p>

The key questions remaining between the administration and Republican
Leadership are:<p>
<ol>
<li>If medicaid remains an entitlement or is block granted
<li>If benefits remain defined at federal level
<li>If states will be responsible for paying for the program's called
"umbrella" provisions
</ul><p>
Powerful interests are arrayed against reform or replacement.<p>

If we reprise our tactics from last year's Medicare debate we will be "school
lunched" again.  It will be the political equivalent of Picketts Charge at
Gettysburg.  After failing to turn the Democrats flank we decide to charge up
the middle at their strength!  The same result for Pickett at Gettysburg will
be repeated by Republicans in the fall election.<p>

What I want to talk about in my remaining time is how conservatives can win
on the Medicaid issue, not only politically but most importantly for the
people we intend to serve.<p>

A Basic Truism:<p>

In what is called the caring professions, compassion will trump a balanced
budget every time.<p>

The issue shouldn't be a balanced budget when it comes to Medicare, Medicaid
and Welfare, but it should be the role of government.<p>

And what should that role be?<p>

As our first Republican President Abraham Lincoln said 'To help those who
can't help themselves.'<p>

To win we need to learn and change the language of the debate.<p>

I wish to make three brief points and then await your questions.<p>

I.  First Question:  Who is in the Medicaid program?<p>
<ul>
<li>70% are mothers and children through AFDC  program.
<li>In 1965 Medicaid was an afterthought it has grown like topsy ever since.
 The reason is 70% of costs are not for AFDC mothers and children but for
nursing homes, primarily elderly and primarily female.
<li>Medicaid is a welfare program, but we should think health care when talking
about it.
<li>When I worked for a corporation, people who talked about "consumers" were
liberals;  People who talked about "customers" were conservatives.  You knew
who they were by the language they used.
<li>It is the same in Medicaid: welfare workers talk of "caseloads" and Liberals
talk of consumers.
<li>When I see my mother-in-law in her nursing home she isn't a "caseload" or a
"consumer," she's a patient!
<li>So the answer to the first question: Who is in the program? Is Patients.
<li>"Consumers" look for bargains, "Patients" look for quality health care.
<li>Let us look at the issue politically  There is a gender gap: women are
voting 15-20% more Democratic than men.  There is also a generation gap: 18-29
women vote almost the same as men.  But as you go up the age scale to those
over 65 these women are voting 35% more Democratic than men!
</ul><p>
Something Democrats know and Republicans don't:  'If Bill Clinton is
re-elected Grandmothers will make the difference.'<p>

Democratic ads play on these fears:  That "Grandma" is coming home from the
nursing home because of Republican budget cuts.<p>

We don't have to emulate Bill Clinton by cynically pandering to the special
interests that make up his political coalition.<p>

Rather we must remember what the health care and Medicaid debate are all
about:  helping patients.<p>

It's not about hospitals, doctors, providers, patient pressure groups or
trial lawyers.  We must remember:  if the patient wins then we can't lose!<p>

If, at the end of day, the health care of the Medicaid patient hasn't
improved, then we've failed!<p>

II.  Second Question:  What is the key measurement that should dominate all
others?<p>
<ul>
<li>When I joined HCFA my deputy was a career official from the Daly machine in
Chicago He was one of the three people chosen by Lyndon Johnson to put the
Medicaid program together.
<li>I asked him, "how do you determine what's important?"
<li>He responded, halfway joking "ask yourself four questions:  who wins, who
loses, how much does it cost and who cares."  Mayor Daly would have been
proud.  In health care, we talk about cost, quality and access.
<li>If you change one of these elements you change the other two.
<li>In the old Soviet System:  To preserve egalitarian access, and with little
money, they had poor quality care.
<li>In European socialist countries:  They wanted high quality, but to control
cost they had to ration access to care.
<li>In the US:  we want high quality and universal access, thus costs
skyrocketed.
<li>Medicare and Medicaid: costs are increasing at 10% per year They are the
federal governments fastest growing programs.  If Medicaid was returned to
the states it would constitute up to 40% of the entire state budget. The
Medicaid and Medicare programs rival the Defense Department in size.
<li>Liberals emphasize access and the uninsured, but poor and the uninsured
have universal access: they use hospital emergency rooms!
<li>The question is not access, but who pays for them and where they get care!
<li>Conservatives emphasize costs and it reinforces our Ebenezer Scrooge image.
<li>Look at the marketplace for solutions.  Take advantage of its
lessons: private health insurance costs are trending down.
</ul><p>

We must take advantage of four marketplace trends if we want to change
Medicaid:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devolution vs. Centralization:  Shown by the trend to provide care at the
most cost-effective site-be it a hospital, SNF or at home.
<li> Prevention vs. Acute Care:  Prevention is cost-effective and it provides
better care.
<li> Capitation vs. Fee for Service:  Capitation provides incentives for cost
-effective behavior. It means providers concentrate on competing on the basis
of quality not maximizing re-imbursement.
<li> Distributive vs. "One Size Fits All":  This stresses the benefits of
Medical Innovation and Technology rather than assuring that everyone gets the
same,-albeit mediocre, care
</ol><p>
Thus the answer to the second question:  What is very measure that drives all
others?<p>
<ul>
<li>It is not cost nor access, but quality!
<li>The poor have access, not in right place, maybe in emergency rooms, but they
do have access.
<li>Costs can be controlled in capitated or HMO systems.
<li>Therefore the key is quality:  "We need a single instrument to measure
quality of care to patients regardless of the site where the care is given.
</ul><p>

III.  Third Question:  What is the one policy element that conservatives have
and liberals don't?<p>
<ul>
<li>Of my deputy at HCFA I asked:  "How do you solve all these problems?"
<li>He answered "no matter what the problem, there are only three solutions!:
 Changes in eligibility, reimbursement or coverage."
<li>Eligibility, reimbursement and coverage are the three bureaucratic policy
elements that correspond to access, cost and quality
<li>My deputy was right, in a bureaucratic, top down, one size fits all, command
and control system you can only change these three things.
<li>But in the 1980s, we conservatives were permitted only to change one
element while trying to reform Medicaid.
<li>Liberals refused to limit eligibility: in Medicaid, thanks to Henry Waxman,
they actually greatly expanded it!
<li>Liberals also refused to limit coverage in Medicaid, thanks to Henry
Waxman, benefits were never touched and often expanded.
<li>But because liberals think all providers, like doctors, hospitals,
administrators and manufacturers are Republicans, they gladly permitted us to
cut reimbursement.
<li>This is why at Progress & Freedom we stress replacement not reform.  Reform
did not work in the 80's.
<li>Reform models leave us with the tyranny of the three elements: eligibility,
reimbursement and coverage.
<li>So what is the conservative fourth element?
<li>A clue:  The debate on Medical Savings Accounts.
<li>The reason liberals oppose MSA's as one liberal Congressman recently said:
"The poor will not choose to spend their money on health care, but keep it!"
<li>In other words: we can't trust the poor to do the right thing!  We need a
bureaucrat to tell them.  The poor can't be trusted to choose correctly.
</ul><p>

Well I have some news for our liberal friends:<p>

Poverty is not a mental handicap but an economic condition.<p>

The poor are capable of choosing and that's the answer to the third Question
that terrifies liberals:<p>
The fourth public policy element conservatives have is choice.<p>

Choice: It may define the single most important difference between liberals
and conservatives.<p>
<ul>
<li>We believe in markets, they believe in bureaucracy and bureaucracy is
incompatible with choice.
<li>Don't accept the argument that the marketplace doesn't work in health care.
<li>If you believe this, that means choice doesn't work;  and you must rely on
changes in eligibility, coverage or re-imbursement. You must rely on a
regulatory system to "fix" the market.
<li>When any conservative hears the phrase "Fix the market" their skin should
crawl.
<li>You now have the three words that will change the language of the debate:
<li>Talk of Patients not consumers
<li>Talk of Quality, not costs or access
<li>Talk of Choice, not eligibility, coverage or reimbursement.

<li>Patients, Quality and Choice are the high ground of the debate.
<li>Their focus is consistent with where the private sector is heading. 
<li>They are the basis for a replacement not a reform model for Medicaid.
<li>They will enable not only conservatives to win, but more importantly "we
will truly help those who can't help themselves."
</ul><p>
Thank You.<p>

of Christians in Politics</CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">With another presidential election fast approaching,
secularists are once again fanning the flames of fear against politically
conservative Christians. &quot;I can&iacute;t remember a time when the danger
to civil liberties and fundamental constitutional rights was more extreme
or more pervasive than it is today,&quot; writes Ira Glasser, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Glasser goes on to accuse
the Christian Coalition of seeking &quot;to amend the Constitution to put
religious indoctrination back into the public schools.&quot; Other secularists
routinely condemn Christians for seeking to legislate their religious beliefs
into law.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">There is a valid point lurking somewhere in this undeniably
overblown rhetoric. Like most religions, Christianity has been employed
on occasion as an engine of intolerance as some sought to propagate its
doctrines by law. However, Christianity also has been one the most powerful
defenders of freedom in the history of the world. Between these paradoxical
extremes lie the peril and the promise of Christians in politics today.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">Nathaniel Hawthorne aptly captured this peril and
promise in his stories about the American Puritans. Repelled by the Puritans&iacute;
religious intolerance, Hawthorne admired their realism and their unswerving
devotion to principle. The latter trait he lucidly depicted in his short
story &igrave;The Gray Champion&icirc; (1835), where a first-generation
Puritan mysteriously returns to Boston in 1689 to thwart the subjugation
of the colonies by King James II. Like a fiery Old Testament prophet, the
old Puritan  --the &quot;Gray Champion&quot; of the story's title-- denounces
the usurpations of Royal Governor Sir Edmund Andros and urges the people
to resistance. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">In this story Hawthorne showed how the same rigid
idealism that spawned the Puritans&iacute; religious bigotry also produced
a powerful commitment to moral principle that made them resist political
tyranny. Hence the paradox of Christianity: its religious intolerance may
subvert republican government, but its rigorous attachment to moral principle
may be necessary to defend it.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">One of the greatest achievements of American constitutionalism
was the manner in which it resolved this paradox by harnessing the moral
idealism of Christianity while restraining its potential for bigotry. America's
Founders harnesssed Christianity&iacute;s moral idealism by stressing the
importance of morality in civic life and by acknowledging the crucial role
churches played in fostering that morality. Indeed, several Founders argued
that ministers had the responsibility to speak up about moral problems pressing
society. In the words of John Adams, &quot;It is the duty of the clergy
to accommodate their discourses to the times, to preach against such sins
as are most prevalent, and recommend such virtues as are most wanted.&quot;
At the same time, the Founders sought to temper Christianity's intolerance
by removing theological questions from the political arena, which greatly
reduced the consequences of religious intolerance by ensuring that state
power would never be used to resolve theological controversies. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The Founders' arrangement produced an institutional
separation between church and state even while forging a practical tie between
religion and politics on the basis of morality. Christians were discouraged
by the nature of the regime from using the government to promote their theological
beliefs; but the door was left open for them to enter the political arena
as citizens in order to promote government policies in accord with both
the principles of the Constitution and the &igrave;&quot;laws of nature
and nature&quot;s God&quot; on which those principles are premised. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The political activities of Christians in the new
nation reflected the Founders&iacute; understanding of the role of religion
in society. Many Protestant evangelicals opposed state funding of churches
because they thought it corrupted religion, and gradually even the congregationalists
who supported establishments of religion changed their minds. When Christians
did become involved in politics in the early nation, they generally sought
to do so on the basis of principles of civic morality that were held in
common by both reason and revelation. In the years before the Civil War
they entered the political arena by the thousands to spearhead crusades
against duelling, lotteries, war, poverty, prostitution, alcoholism, and
slavery. These political activities on behalf of secular concerns proved
that evangelicals could fulfill a vital political function by serving as
the political conscience of the nation.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the
controversy over Cherokee removal from Georgia. Federal treaties had guaranteed
the Cherokees their lands upon the condition that they become both peaceful
and &quot;civilized.&quot; The Cherokees kept their part of the bargain.
They embraced agriculture, became educated, adopted Christianity, and pursued
republican self-government. The Georgians, however, had no intention of
respecting Cherokee treaty rights, and in 1828 and 1829 the Georgia legislature
tried to legislate the Cherokee Nation out of existence, extending its laws
over Cherokee lands and demanding that the federal government remove the
recalcitrant Indians. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The evangelical missionaries who had been working
among the Indians rose to the Cherokees' defense, led by the corresponding
secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Jeremiah
Evarts. Evarts, a lawyer, helped turn the removal issue into a major national
controversy. Under the nom de plume &quot;William Penn,&quot; he wrote twenty-six
essays defending the Cherokees for the <I>National Intelligencer</I>. The
essays were a tour de force of logic, morality, and law. Evarts and other
evangelicals based their arguments against removal not simply on Biblical
morality, but on the natural right of property, the inviolability of contracts,
and the God-given equality of all men proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence,
which they argued applied to Indians as well as white men. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">Unfortunately, both Congress and the President rebuffed
evangelicals' efforts on behalf of the Cherokees, and the government eventually
relocated the Indians further West in a scandalous episode of American history
known as the Trail of Tears. The controversy nevertheless demonstrated that
Christians could fulfill the role that the Founders had created for them:
they could put their idealism to constructive use by intervening in politics
on the basis of principles of natural justice rather than doctrines of sectarian
theology.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">In responding to the modern secularists who attack
them, Christians today ought to learn from their predecessors in the early
nineteenth century. Contrary to the rhetoric of Patrick Buchanan, the battle
over public morality need not be a &quot;religious war.&quot; Public policy
ought to be based on public principles, and modern Christians can make this
clear by appealing to the same &quot;laws of nature and nature's God&quot;
that their forebears invoked in the public arena more than a century ago.
By articulating anew the moral common ground shared by all human beings,
contemporary Christians can silence the claim that legislating morality
is the same as legislating theology and assure their place as equal participants
in the public debate.</FONT> <BR>

<font size=3><b>The Impact Of The Ordinary Income Tax On Saving<br>

<hr>

<b>Executive Summary</center></b>
<P>
The financial strength of taxpayers at all economic levels, as
well as the financial strength of our government and our nation,
is being increasingly eroded year after year by the taxation of
private savings and investment growth.  A change from the ordinary
income tax treatment of saving to an expanded IRA-type tax treatment
of saving would benefit the economy, the taxpayer, and ultimately
the Treasury, too, by promoting higher rates of saving and economic
growth.  An example based on historical market returns on savings
will illustrate this fact.
<P>
Two taxpayers invested $100 of after-tax income in an actual mutual
fund on January 1, 1926.  Sixty-seven years later on 12/31/92
both taxpayers sold their fund.  This sixty-seven year period
included depressions, recessions, wars, and good times, too. 
This period also provides a reasonable illustration of what the
reward to saving might be in the many decades ahead.
<P>
Let's assume that one taxpayer, Larry Lo-bracket, was always in
the 15% tax bracket, and the other, Harry Hi-bracket, was always
in the 50% tax bracket (many, if not most, of those years had
tax brackets exceeding 50%).  On 12/31/92 Larry's $100 investment
was worth $57,708 and Harry's was only worth $9,195.  These compare
with values of $141,940 and $241,296 if Larry's and Harry's income
and investment <I>had not been subjected to the ordinary income
tax.</I>
<P>
In short, the ordinary income tax reduced Larry's otherwise invested
capital by 59% and Harry's by 96%!  Interestingly, Larry Lo-bracket's
loss was <I>four</I> times his tax bracket, and Harry Hi-bracket's
loss was <I>two</I> times his tax bracket!
<P>
In contrast, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, Larry would
have avoided the 15% tax ($17.65) on his income, and, thus, his
investment would have been $117.65.  Harry would have avoided
the 50% tax ($100) on his income, and his investment would have
been $200.00.  These larger investments provide the proper IRA
comparison with a $100 after-tax investment by each taxpayer under
the ordinary income tax.
<P>
Larry's <I>after-tax</I> value under the IRA-type plan on 12/31/92
would have been $120,649, <I>as would have Harry's.</I>  The $120,649
after-tax value for each man equals 85% of the $141,940 untaxed
value for Larry and 50% of the $241,298 untaxed value for Harry
(see above).  Larry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(15%), and Harry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(50%).  This is fair and proper taxation.
<P>
<I>As illustrated, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, both
men had the same after-tax value, $120,649, because each man's
out-of-pocket contribution consisted of $100, with the government
deferring its tax, i.e., $17.65 for Larry and $100 for Harry.</I>
<P>
Upon the IRA withdrawal on 12/31/92, the government not only recovered
its full tax deferral ($17.65 for Larry &amp; $100 for Harry),
it also enjoyed the entire untaxed, free-market investment return
on these tax deferred amounts.  While collecting the full free-market
growth on these IRA tax deductions, the government gave up the
yearly taxation of investment return and realized gain that it
would have otherwise collected under the ordinary income tax.
 <I>It is this yearly ordinary income tax on investment return
that punishes saving so harshly, and it is solely this second
layer of tax that is properly removed by tax-deductible IRAs.</I>
<P>
As illustrated above, each $100 of a taxpayer's IRA-type <I>net</I>
saving (i.e., <I>net</I> of the tax that's deferred) will enjoy
the same investment growth from the same investment <I>regardless
of tax bracket</I>.  This is so, because there is no further tax
on the <I>net</I> saving.  In short, this means that all of every
taxpayer's investment return and realized gain derived from <I>net
</I>IRA saving is received totally tax free.  This is sound economics,
as well as sound and fair tax treatment, because every dollar
of private saving adds equal economic value to our nation's success,
regardless of the source of the saving, be it from Larry Lo-bracket
or from Harry Hi-bracket.
<P>
The <I>new</I> saving generated by such a proper reversal of our
nation's existing and punitive ordinary income tax treatment of
saving will be very large and ongoing.
<P>
Clearly, the ordinary income tax destroys each taxpayer's investment
values that would otherwise be available for his or her own future
use.  The ordinary income tax also concurrently destroys the capital
available for the economy as a whole.  After all, capital saved
and invested by each taxpayer is used over and over again by others,
thereby generating more production, more jobs, and more taxes.
<P>
The negative bias of the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
has led to an increasing Congressional awareness that corrective
legislation must take place.  As a result, bipartisan legislation,
the Individual Investment Account Act, S. 929 and H.R. 3179, has
been sponsored in the 103rd Congress by Senator John Breaux (D-LA)
and Representative Jim McCrery (R-LA).  Briefly, this Act establishes
IRA-type accounts that permit-
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions by any taxpayer.<p>
<LI>No tax on the account's investment return or realized gain.<p>
<LI>No penalty taxes nor forced distributions at any age.  Taxes
are paid solely upon withdrawals.<p>
<LI>No income tax nor estate tax at death.  Beneficiary has benefactor's
tax basis.<p>
<LI>Up to $15,000 of tax-deferred &quot;rollover&quot; for first-time
home buyers.  The tax basis of the home is reduced by the rollover.<p>
<LI>The proceeds from the sale of a primary residence may be rolled
over without tax into the tax-deferred IRA-type account, including
the $125,000 tax-free home sale proceeds after age 55.  The account's
tax basis is increased by the former residence's tax basis and
the $125,000 tax-free proceeds.<p>
<LI>The tax-deductible purchase of life insurance, provided the
proceeds are added to the tax-deferred account.
</UL>
<P>
These universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans without
penalty taxes and forced distributions will create such an upsurge
in new saving that any revenue loss will soon be outweighed by
the tax revenue gains arising from a greatly increased saving
rate.  Such increased saving leads to more investment, more production,
reduced costs of capital, more jobs, a higher standard of living,
and yes-more tax collections from sound economic growth.
<P>
The dynamic economic gains that flow from universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs can be measured in trillions of dollars of
increased GDP (Gross Domestic Product).  And, these GDP gains
translate into net dynamic tax revenue gains vs. the ordinary
income tax.  An appropriate report by the respected economics
consulting firm, Fiscal Associates, and included herein as Appendix
B, forecasts the static and dynamic economic results flowing from
the proposed legislation.
<P>
For example, three years after the adoption of universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, a healthier economy would bring in about
$17 billion in new federal tax revenue.  This would offset all
but about $10 billion of static revenue loss, as measured in the
erroneous &quot;tax expenditure&quot; manner utilized by government
analysts.  Within eight years, the real dynamic gains would (a)
fully offset the government's erroneous static revenue losses
and (b)<I> increase most taxpayers' after-tax income by approximately
15% to 20%.</I>  The bulk (85%) of this increase in after-tax
income would flow to taxpayers (including joint returns) with
adjusted gross incomes of under $100,000 per year.
<P>
Further, in a relatively short period of time (years 2000 - 2010),
annual GDP would be $500 billion to $1 trillion higher than otherwise,
thereby creating up to an additional two million more jobs than
otherwise.  Because of faster economic growth, annual tax revenues
would gradually grow each year to 30 billion dollars higher than
otherwise by the year 2010.  By the year 2060, GDP would be $32
trillion higher than otherwise and over 5 million more jobs than
otherwise would be created.
<P>
It is relevant to point out that the government relies upon its
staff-formulated &quot;static&quot; tax expenditure figures when
tax legislation is being considered.  This static tax expenditure
methodology is seriously flawed in that, among other things, it
ignores rational taxpayer reactions to tax law change.
<P>
Moreover, the government's 1995 Budget document admits for the
first time that the present value of its static IRA tax expenditure
figures for 1994 overstates IRA costs by over three times!  Thus,
it can be observed that not only is the government's static method
for measuring revenue loss flawed, the government's own numbers,
even using its own erroneous static method, are three times too
high!  In real life, the more realistic &quot;dynamic&quot; tax
revenue forecasts, as portrayed in this analysis, are superior.
 
<P>
Enacting universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans has
many very favorable, interrelated consequences for taxpayers,
our government, and our nation.  Similarly, there are often-heard
and generally superficial objections to expanding IRA-type plans.
These consequences and objections are addressed individually
and thoroughly in the &quot;perspectives&quot; section of this
analysis.
<P>
<U><I><b><center>Conclusions</I></U></b></center>
<UL>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving and investing
imposes enormous, ever-growing economic losses on our nation.
The net result is an ongoing compounding of economic injury to
savers, workers, users of capital, and the Treasury itself.<p>
<LI>The existing governmental tax revenue estimation methods that
neglect the dynamics of saving, and hence completely mismeasure
the tax revenue impact of tax-deductible IRA-type plans, are a
major driving force of our nation's erroneous tax policy as applied
to saving.<p>
<LI>The government's existing methods of estimating tax revenues
from IRA-type plans must be scrapped in favor of a more accurate
estimating process.<p>
<LI>The next sixty-seven years of savings and investment results
will have economic ups and downs not unlike the past sixty-seven.
Thus, the economic results, as portrayed in this analysis, that
flow from continuing the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
are a reasonable harbinger of a dismal economic future for our
nation if this irrational taxation of saving is not corrected
promptly.  On the other hand, tax-deductible IRA-type saving helps
everyone-including the user of capital, the government, and our
nation-not just the taxpayer.<p>
<LI>IRA-type plans must be improved, expanded, and promoted.<p>
<LI>Rather than limiting and discouraging the use of tax-deductible
IRA-type plans by taxpayers, the government should remove all
tax impediments to these plans and extol their use by everyone.<p>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving creates an ever-growing
atrophy of the economic strength of taxpayer/voters, the users
of capital, government, and our nation.  Expanded and improved
tax-deductible IRA-type plans will reverse this economic emaciation
and create sound, robust growth.

<h2>Hearings on Spectrum Allocation</h2><br>
Before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation</h3> 
<b>Testimony of <a href="/pff/people/afellow.html#Pitsch">Peter K. Pitsch</a> <br>
Adjunct Fellow, The Progress & Freedom Foundation </b><p>
July 27, 1995
<p> 
It is an honor to have this opportunity to testify before this Committee on one of the most 
important telecommunications opportunities facing America--reforming our management of the 
electromagnetic spectrum.  I do not come recently to this issue.  I was in the thick of FCC deliberations on 
spectrum policy in the 1980s, first as Chief of the FCC's Office of Plans & Policy for Chairman Mark 
Fowler and second as Chief of Staff to Chairman Dennis Patrick.  During those years I strongly espoused 
reforms that would give licensees more technical and operational control over how they use their spectrum 
and the use of auctions for initial assignments where there are mutually exclusive applications.  Since then 
I have consulted for various telecom companies on spectrum and other FCC-related issues.   
<p>
Most recently, I and several other analysts from a wide range of think tanks helped write The 
Progress & Freedom Foundation's report on the FCC, "The Telecom Revolution, An American 
Opportunity."  In it, we recommended privatizing spectrum management.   
<p>
The overarching goal in managing the electromagnetic spectrum should be to maximize its value 
to the American people.  As in the rest of our economy, the best means of achieving efficient use of the 
spectrum is to rely principally on market forces.  In my brief remarks today, I would like to catalog various 
types of failure systemic to the current centrally-planned, government-run spectrum regime, then identify 
the two ways in which spectrum reform can be achieved, and lastly spend a few moments discussing the 
tremendous importance of spectrum reform to America's economic and competitive prospects. 
<p>
There are three fundamental problems with the current system.  They span the 60-year history of 
the FCC and continue to this day.  They are systemic.  One, the FCC like other central planners lacks the 
information necessary to make efficient decisions.  Two, the administrative process has been used by 
special interests to delay competition and innovation.  Three, the current system has held fallow or 
underutilized a substantial portion of the spectrum for government purposes.   
<p>
First, determining efficient use is a complex task requiring vast amounts of continually updated 
information that is hopelessly beyond the abilities of an administrative process.  Markets, of course, 
"parallel-processes" information gathered by millions of businesses and consumers to continually provide 
price signals on the relative usefulness of the myriad competing demands and uses of spectrum.  In the case 
of spectrum, the information required to make the necessary tradeoffs is greater than in most other areas of 
the economy, because the pace of technological development has created a raft of new uses for "wireless" 
communications and new ways in which spectrum can be efficiently deployed.   
<p>
As a result, the FCC has consistently made simplistic and overly rigid decisions that misallocated 
spectrum, created inefficient industry structures, and locked in outdated technical standards.  For example, 
in the 1950s the FCC dramatically underallocated spectrum to VHF television reducing the availability of 
television channels and impeding the development of a third, fourth and fifth national television network.  
In the 1970s it long delayed and then underallocated spectrum to cellular mobile telephony, creating only 
two cellular companies.  This delay alone cost America $85 billion dollars.  Time and again it imposed a 
nationwide grid that did not account for local differences--underallocating forestry spectrum in Idaho and 
overallocating it in New York City and vice versa for taxicab spectrum.  Finally, the FCC locked in an 
analog technical standard for cellular telephony that was 20 years old and out of date by the time the FCC 
got around to assigning cellular licenses.   
<p>
The second systemic failure of the current spectrum regime is its susceptibility to capture by 
special interests opposed to innovation and competition.  In the face of political pressure, the FCC has 
again and again delayed the allocation of spectrum to innovative new services.  Examples include Direct 
Broadcast Television, so called "wireless cable", low power TV, VHF drop ins, new FM channels, and 
satellite-delivered radio service to cars.  Few companies and no trade association can resist the temptation 
to use the current regulatory scheme to disadvantage new competition or innovation.  The sad reality is that 
in this "regulatory game", the established concentrated economic interests typically triumph over the 
amorphous and diffuse interests of consumers.   
<p>
The FCC's public interest standard has been used as a weapon against consumers.  Regulated 
companies frequently have embraced special public interest obligations in exchange for protection from 
competitors and innovation.  This "taxation by regulation" by unelected regulators, followed by the 
inevitable quid pro quo, has been extremely costly to consumers.  Any such deals should be made 
explicitly and only by Congress. 
<p>
The third systemic failure of the current system of spectrum management is the underutilization of 
spectrum by the government sector.  While there is some debate on how much spectrum is effectively 
denied to the private sector, there can be little doubt that it is in absolute terms a huge amount.  Many 
governmental uses of spectrum are vital; others are not.  All of these uses should be justified economically.  
Today government users of spectrum have access to spectrum at far less cost than that available to non 
government users.  Recall that in the recent PCS auctions the winners paid over $7 billion for 60 MHz of 
PCS spectrum.  The government has exclusive or "shared" access to thousands of MHz.   
<p>
The simple solution to the current spectrum gridlock is to give existing and new spectrum users 
more operational and technical flexibility to use their spectrum the way they see fit so long as they do not 
interfere with their cochannel and adjacent channel "neighbors."  The logic of this reform is easily 
illustrated.  Typically, a licensee has two choices: (1) use his spectrum for a narrow purpose with the 
specific technology that the FCC has designated or (2) give it back to the FCC.  Given this choice, the 
current spectrum use will be economic to the licensee as long as it has any positive value.  In economic 
terms the "opportunity cost" of the spectrum to the licensee is zero.  The cost to society, of course, is any 
foregone alternative use that is more valuable.   
<p>
Once a licensee is given the freedom to use his spectrum for a broad range of uses, however, he 
has a strong economic incentive to consider the relative merits of alternative uses.  The more flexibility he 
has the more likely it is that his use will be the highest and best use reflecting the spectrum's true 
opportunity cost to society.   
<p>
In "The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity," the Progress & Freedom working group 
proposed a four-part plan to reform spectrum management.  For brevity sake, this plan can be reduced to 
two mechanisms.  First, the FCC should make unallocated private sector spectrum and underutilized 
government spectrum available to private users.  The spectrum should be structured in highly flexible 
parcels with minimal government constraints.  These parcels should give the legal protection and freedoms 
that attach to property, viz., technical and operational freedom, protection from trespass or unlawful 
takings, and the ability to assign, lease or sell.  Of course, these new users should be subject to antitrust and 
other laws that apply to businesses generally.  Where there are mutually exclusive bids for these new 
parcels, winners should be selected by auctions.   
<p>
A few words about auctions are in order.  They are the most efficient means of assigning licenses 
where there are mutually exclusive applicants for three reasons.  First, they make assignments more 
quickly than administrative hearings and lotteries.  A three-year delay imposed by comparative hearings or 
lotteries can easily wipe out a full one-fourth of the present value of the license.  Second, they assign the 
spectrum to those who are most likely to put them to their highest valued use.  Third, they make these 
assignments at less cost to society.  Instead, of using scarce resources in expensive lotteries and 
comparative hearings, applicants compete by adding zeros to the size of the transfer payment they are 
willing to make to the government.   
<p>
Note that the primary value of auctions is not that they raise money for the government.  Care 
should be taken that auctions do not become an obstacle to the principal goal of reducing spectrum 
scarcity.  Spectrum should be released as rapidly and efficiently as possible, even if that reduces the 
government's auction proceeds, because the goal is to free up spectrum for the benefit of the American 
economy.  Where there are mutually exclusive applicants, however, auctions will be a highly efficient way 
to raise government funds.   
<p>
The second way to achieve spectrum reform is to deregulate or privatize existing spectrum users.  
As with the newly allocated spectrum, the Congress should move to give existing users full flexibility to 
use their spectrum subject to interference and international treaty constraints.  Licensees should be 
encouraged to negotiate with their "neighbors" to reach mutually beneficial agreements on possible new 
uses of their spectrum.  This approach creates a private incentive to "reallocate" spectrum and take on the 
vested interests that can be counted to oppose new competition and innovation.  Likewise, the government 
agencies should be encouraged to sell or sublease their spectrum to the private sector.  I applaud Senator 
Steven's amendment to the Senate's telecom legislation that is designed to create such an incentive for 
government users to free up spectrum.   
<p>
Those who see privatizing existing spectrum as a government "giveaway" miss the point.  The 
existing users have for the most part purchased their spectrum in the resale market.  It is not fair, efficient 
or politically feasible to require them to pay for their spectrum again.  Furthermore, top down grants of 
flexible spectrum will be difficult because the existing users will collectively oppose the release of 
hundreds of MHz in flexible allocations.  Privatizing existing spectrum will create a competition among 
existing licensees to move "beach front" spectrum from its current "land dump" uses.  In this parlance, the 
current "beach property owners" may not appreciate these efforts, but they will not be able to stop them.  
Indeed, they might well choose to join them.  In the end, America's "beach-consuming public" will benefit.   
<p>
It should be noted that these approaches do not require all or nothing.  You can do them in degree.  
In fact the Commission, under Chairmen Fowler, Patrick, Sikes and Hundt, has increasingly utilized the 
concepts of flexibility and privatization.  Working within the limits of the administrative process and the 
current law has been a difficult task and they and their fellow commissioners and many key staffers 
deserve credit for what they have done.   
<p>
The time has come, however, for Congress to dramatically speed up this process.  A centrally-
planned, government-run allocation system probably never made sense.  It has cost Americans billions of 
dollars in foregone wealth and prosperity, but the accelerating pace of technical change and the increasing 
complexity of the spectrum allocation decisions that have to be made make the case for dramatic reform 
more compelling than ever before.   
<p>
We are all familiar with the rapid change in the computer industry.  In the space of seven years, 
IBM lost roughly $70 billion dollars of market capitalization.  In the same period, many small hardware 
and software companies grew exponentially, more than offsetting those mainframe losses.  Who can 
seriously question that if Apple, Intel, Compaq and Microsoft had required FCC spectrum to get to the 
market that the personal computer revolution would have been postponed? 
<p>
In the same way, spectrum gridlock is a primary obstacle to the full exploitation of the computer 
revolution.  Few things will promote wireless computer applications and local telephone competition as 
much as driving down the cost of spectrum by several orders of magnitude.  Fundamental spectrum reform 
would build on the U.S.'s current but perishable lead in the global digital derby.  America is positioned to 
leave other countries in a cloud of silicon dust.  A regulatory framework that slows innovation in this area, 
despite any plausible shortrun efficiency gains it might achieve, will foreclose a tremendous opportunity 
for the American people.

   <H1>McNamara's Anniversary Gift to Hanoi</H1>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>

<P>
The political leaders of Hanoi were assured a joyful 20th 
Anniversary of their victory over South Vietnam after 
unwrapping a priceless gift.  It was a retrospective book of 
our involvement in Southeast Asia, authored by former 
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, in which one line 
takes precedence over all others:  . . .We were wrong, 
terribly wrong.

<P>
President Clinton, not unexpectedly, has praised the 
book and commended the courage it took to write it.

<P>
Don't for a moment believe that this is a book of self-
deprecation.  It is, instead, a book in which the author 
misses few opportunities to praise himself, even including 
a picture of a mountain he climbed in Wyoming.  He 
modestly concedes that President Johnson wrote in a letter 
that the President never liked or admired anyone more 
than Robert McNamara.  

<P>
It is written in the same kind of confusion in which he 
served as Secretary of Defense:  one sentence contradicts 
another sentence, one paragraph impugns another 
paragraph, one point is made with strength, and then 
nurtured with weakness.  Those with whom he worked, 
including Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, are criticized 
and complimented all at once.  It appears to be his way of 
covering all bases.  Mr. McNamara even devotes one short 
paragraph in praise of the Americans who gave their lives 
in Vietnam.  (It's on page 333 for those who may easily 
miss it.)

<P>
He further writes  that I do not know to this day 
whether I quit or was fired.  Maybe it was both. Maybe.  
Everything seems to be uncertain.  Nevertheless, when all 
the contradictory points, incidents, and dialogues are put 
aside, McNamara clearly blames President Johnson for 
not accepting much of  McNamara's wisdom.

<P>
The book, by its own omissions, encourages the spread 
of an American amnesia, a disease with which President 
Clinton has already been stricken.  Robert McNamara 
stops his history when he departed his job, thereby 
conveniently leaving out the evidence that we were not 
wrong, terribly wrong in becoming involved, but instead 
that our Congress was wrong, terribly wrong during the 
two-and-one-quarter years after our military came home.  
Those two-and-one-quarter years have been wiped from 
America's memory as our amnesia makes us believe that 
when our troops left, Vietnam fell.

<P>
It was January of 1973 when our military engagement 
ended under the Paris peace accords in which both sides 
agreed to be permitted to make periodic replacement of 
armaments, munitions and war material which have been 
destroyed, damaged, worn out or used up after the cease-
fire, on the basis of piece-for-piece. . . .  North Vietnam 
replaced their losses on a four-to-one ratio rather than 
keeping the agreement of piece-for-piece, and the 94th 
Congress of the United States voted against supplying any 
replacements for South Vietnam's losses, stopping all aid 
of any kind to both Cambodia and South Vietnam, making 
defeat inevitable.  In April of 1975, both nations fell.

<P>
We signed those accords because Chapter Four, 
Article Nine of the agreement states that the South 
Vietnamese people shall decide themselves the political 
future of South Vietnam through genuinely free and 
democratic elections under international supervision.  
Article Eleven stipulates the insurance of the democratic 
liberties of the people; personal freedom, freedom of 
speech, freedom of the press, freedom of meeting, 
freedom of organization, freedom of residence, freedom of 
work.

<P>
None of this is recorded in the McNamara book, nor 
will President Clinton remind the American people of 
those accords when, as expected, he gives diplomatic 
recognition to a government that to this day refuses to 
keep its word on an agreement that was the very reason we 
left Vietnam.

<P>
By McNamara concluding the book where he does 
there is no mention of the horrors that came about when 
the communists won the war.  There is not even a footnote 
recording the over one million fleeing boat people, the 
genocide in Cambodia, or the post-war concentration 
camps in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  The morality of 
what we tried to do has been proven by the immorality of 
the victors.

<P>
In the chapter entitled <B>The Lessons of Vietnam</B>, he 
generously sets in print his recommendations for future 
foreign policy.  With the depth of a single piece of saran-
wrap, we are told that we should achieve a nuclear-free 
world in which multilateral decision-making takes place 
within a burden-sharing context, while we assure 
preservation of the global environment.  That should work. 

<P>
It's entirely possible that waiting for Robert McNamara 
to mature may take more time than patience will allow.  It 
is my hope, however, that the time will come when  he 
will review what he wrote in the mid-1990s and conclude 
that his anniversary gift to Hanoi was wrong, terribly 
wrong.

<H1><CENTER>The Military as Metaphor</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold</I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR>The United States defense establishment is approaching the verge
of open rebellion and internal collapse. If Mr. Clinton is re-elected, it
will probably happen in 1997. If Mr. Dole wins, it might take a little longer.
At this point, perhaps the only thing that can avert it is getting the American
people involved. The most pressing defense issue in this country is now
the need for a new covenant between the people and the military they support
with their treasure, their lives, and their blood.<BR>
<BR>
The revolt will begin over money. It no longer matters whose figures you
play with; the money to sustain and modernize the armed forces, in their
present configuration, simply isn't there. After the 1997-1999 projected
cuts, an additional twenty percent force reduction (personnel, weaponry,
readiness) may be inevitable. &quot;Rationing the poverty&quot; among the
services is no longer an option. Nor should it be, given the long-acknowledged
and long-ignored need to restructure for the 21st century.<BR>
<BR>
The rebellion could begin with a single service, reminiscent of the 1949
&quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot; after cancellation of the &quot;supercarrier&quot;
that eventually evolved into the modern aircraft carrier. It could easily
erupt into open and vicious inter-service rivalry and turf battles, with
each service protecting its favored systems, and the roles and missions
that justify them. (One of the great technological truths of 20th century
warfare is that, while weapons systems have proliferated, effects have converged.
It is now possible to do things in many different ways: a fact studiously
ignored when it points to the need for major changes in service tasks.)
The revolt may also have an intense - and intensely public -- reserve aspect,
as the services attempt to siphon dollars to the active forces. However
it happens, it won't be pretty.<BR>
<BR>
The internal collapse will come about - indeed, it's already underway -
because of money, and because of the continuing subjection of the military
to civilian social and cultural agendas and experiments, and the continuing
refusal of the senior leadership to (as the beer commercial has it), &quot;know
when to say when,&quot; even at the cost of their careers.<BR>
<BR>
Jim Webb, decorated Marine veteran and former Navy secretary, made the point
loud and clear in his recent speech at the Naval Academy. But Jim Webb can't
do it alone. It's time for the American people to get loud and be clear
about what they expect from their military.<BR>
<BR>
A new covenant between people and military might sound something like this.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Listen up, Pentagon. You too, Commander-in-Chief (assuming that you
happen to be on active duty). You've got three primary missions. The first
is to defend We the People against that which threatens us the most. Currently,
that's weapons of mass destruction, especially small numbers of crude weapons
in the hands of small, crude nations and unlovely subnational groups. Deterrence
can't do it all. We expect to be defended, even if it means interfering
with some of your bureaucratic priorities. It's doable. Just do it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Your second task is to maintain conventional forces strong enough
to deter conventional aggressors, or whup them handily. This doesn't mean
large standing forces. It means restructuring to take maximum advantage
of U.S. technological superiority (especially in aerospace), and making
maximum use of the reserves and National Guard. Mobilizing the reserves
is We the People's de facto veto on going to war. If you don't have the
political support to invite us along, don't go.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Your third task is to conduct (from time to time) humanitarian and
short-of-war operations, such as Bosnia, also with maximum use of the Guard
and reserves. We don't want to be the world's policeman; we'd rather not
be the world's nanny, guru, or sociopolitical therapist. But sometimes we'll
need to use a little muscle, just to remind the planetary DINGOs (Disturbers
of International Good Order) that we're capable of it.<BR>
&quot;Now, regarding who serves, and how, and why.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Get two things straight. (And pay attention, federal government, because
we're demanding some major policy and legislative changes here.) First,
nobody has a right to serve. Second, nobody should be excluded from service
simply because somebody else doesn't like his, or her kind messing up the
club. As a society, we're dedicated to equality. But equality doesn't mean
sameness. And equality of opportunity includes the right to honest failure.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Minorities, women, and gays are in the military to stay. They should
have exactly the same rights, and be held to the same standards, as all
others in their positions. It's no disgrace for a woman not to be able to
fly an F-14; few people can. (By the same token, the Air Force has no need
of white male pilots; women and minorities can provide adequate numbers
and skill levels.) It's no disgrace for most women to be weaker than men.
But it is a disgrace for people to be recruited or promoted according to
quotas or &quot;guidelines.&quot; It is a danger for people to fly airplanes
they're not qualified to pilot. And it is preposterous when the Army, for
example, evaluates co-ed basic training on the basis of &quot;equality of
effort,&quot; not equality of results.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are no gender-normed battlefields.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And speaking of battlefields, let's talk about sex. When homosexuality
is practiced within a unit, that unit becomes vulnerable to collapse. Ditto
heterosexuality. Sex within the same chain of command compromises that chain.
Sexual harassment is abhorrent. Zero tolerance. But the criterion for action
against offenders should be behavior, not gender or inclination It certainly
should not be unsubstantiated and anonymous allegations, the Tailhook Transgression
(guilty by virtue of just being there), or a single slip of the tongue,
no matter how boorish.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Finally, we're going to help you do all this in two ways. First, we'll
give you about a quarter-trillion a year to play with. More when you're
out there doin' it for fair. That should be enough, if you get your priorities
in order and use it right. Second, we're going to lessen the social and
cultural pressures upon you by severely limiting your vulnerability to lawsuits
from the civilian sector. Your minorities, your women, and your gays are,
by and large, competent and dedicated. But many of their self-styled civilian
defenders are more interested in scoring points - and wrecking institutions
- than in providing for the common defense. They impose their agendas on
you, whose reason for being is to defend us, not submit to their demands.
We want you to be free of endless predatory litigation and threat of litigation
while you're figuring out how to function in this post Cold War world and
this post racist, post patriarchal, post homophobic society that We the
People - fine People that we are - have become.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there is no reason to believe that, short of national emergency,
the American people will devote much thought to their military. They rarely
have before, and for that reason, many worry about the military becoming
a world too-apart. Yet perhaps the opposite is happening. In many ways,
the military has become a metaphor for the larger civilization - the loss
of purpose to peripheral concerns; the surrender to intimidation and expediency;
the vicious, wanton destruction of reputations, careers, and life. Why should
Americans think about the military now? Because it's like looking into a
mirror.<BR>
<BR>
Do we like what we see?

<title>Renewing American Civilization: Class Ten -- PFF</title>
Renewing American Civilization: Class Ten

Citizenship And Community In 21st Century America<br>
<br>
Reinhardt College<br>
<br>
March 11, 1995<br>
<p>


The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College
television, in Waleska, Georgia.  From Reinhardt College in Waleska,
Georgia, this is "Renewing American civilization." In this, the final of 10
class presentations, congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at
Reinhardt College, will continue his course, which presents the
foundational principles necessary to the renewal of American civilization.
This week's lesson, Citizenship in America, focuses on civic leadership,
communities, and the voluntary community sector as a third part of the
American public-private society.
<br><br>
Welcome to Reinhardt College for the last session.  I want to welcome the
students of Mind Extension University all over America.  And I understand,
also, parts of Canada and Mexico.  I want to remind everyone that they can
mail their comments to: renewing American civilization, post office box
6008, Marietta, Georgia 30065.  Or they can fax their comments to
404-528-9806.  Or they can e-mail their comments to America online,
renewam@aol. com.  Or they can get class transcripts and other class
materials on the Internet web page http://www. pff. org.  Or if they just
want to go to the standard technology of the last 25 years, they can order
"American Civilization" newspaper, video and audio tapes, and course
readings by calling 1-800-to-renew.
<P>
I also want to let everyone know that Mind Extension University will
rebroadcast starting Saturday, march 18th, 9:30 am.  To 11:30 am.  Eastern
time, so people around the country who want to take the course can pick it
up on Mind Extension University for free.  And, of course, we give
permission to videotape it and keep it and share with your friends and
neighbors.
<P>
And an interesting -- a very interesting development.  Michael Ciamarra and
Marty Connors are -- new area code 334-242-7116, they are offering the
course in Alabama at the state capitol, with Governor Fob James as the host
and sponsor, and that will be starting in, I think, late March, early
April.  Anybody who's interested in that can call them at that number,
334-242-7116, and they're bringing together quite a team to help teach the
course in Alabama as an experiment where the governor of the state is
encouraging state senior executives and others to take the course.
<P>
I also want to make a point that this course has been offered here at
Reinhardt College.  Reinhardt College is a tremendous liberal arts college
with a long tradition of giving students an unusual background, unusual
opportunities.  And anybody who is interested in Reinhardt College as an
excellent liberal arts college can either write the college admissions in
Waleska, Georgia, or can call 404-720-5526.  But it's a very, very
interesting blend of the very traditional and the very modern.  And they
have in their broadcast studio I think as fine a facility as anything we've
seen, so it's very, very impressive.
<P>
Now, let me just say -- remind everyone that the five pillars of American
civilization are, first, the Historic Lessons Of American Civilization.
Second, Personal Strength.  Third, Entrepreneurial Free Enterprise.
Fourth, the Spirit of Invention and Discovery.  And, Fifth, Quality as
Defined by Deming.  And that these are the five core things.  We spent two
hours on each one looking at how they apply to America.  And then we have
been applying them to four areas to look at how the pillars apply.  And
that the four areas we've been applying them to are, first, the third wave
and American civilization.  Second, creating American jobs in the world
market.  Third, replacing the culture of violence and poverty with a
culture of productivity and safety.  And, fourth, citizenship and community
in the 21st century.
<P>
And, of course, this is the fourth of these areas and the last class.  And
today's class is going to be on citizenship and community in the 21st
century.  And I think this is, in a sense, the capstone class.  Because
community and citizenship, I believe, are the keystones to the entire
course.  Without commitment to community and citizenship, nothing works.
<P>
And I think one of the things that Dr.  Kathleen Minnix and I have
concluded is that we have to drive very hard at the cultural framework and
at getting across the idea, these are not things your government can
necessarily pass a law about.  They're a part of your culture.  They're
part of the background framework.  They're the way you wake up and how you
think about things in the morning.  They're not what the IRS does to you or
what the FBI does to you.
<P>
Now, this entire two hours is going to emphasize a level of activism people
are not used to.  And part of our core discussion is going to be that you
can't solve our problems within the framework of a government-dominated,
bureaucratically delivered system.  That in a free society, you have to
rely on the culture, on individuals, on values in a way that is different
than, what does the government do?  And a lot of people will say, "well,
gee I'm too busy," or, "I really can't afford it."
<P>
And I want to take you back to something we used very early in the course
which we thought was so powerful emotionally, and we frankly liked so much,
we want to use it again.  And I want you all the way through, this -- we're
going to show you once again Chamberlain talking to the main mutineers.
<P>
Remember, it's on the way to Gettysburg.  The regiment had mutinied because
they thought they had signed up for two years, and the government had now
decided it was for three years, and so they were -- they thought they were
legitimately standing on their rights, that they could not be coerced into
serving.  They'd volunteered, they'd fought for two years, but they didn't
want to be coerced into serving.
<P>
And so the army on the edge of Gettysburg has said to Chamberlain, who is
himself from Maine, that these folks are now in your charge.  Do with them
whatever you want to.  And the officer who comes by says, "you can shoot
them if you want to because they're mutinied, they're refusing to keep
doing things." I want you just to remember what we're going to talk about
for the next two hours is to ask a few hours of time, to ask a little bit
of commitment.
<P>
And as you listen to what Chamberlain is talking about and you think about
what he was asking them to do as citizenship, I just want you to put in
context the person who says, "well, I'm really too busy.  "I really don't
have the time." Or, "that would really be awkward," and consider how tiny
the request we're making for people to be citizens compared to what
Chamberlain had to ask.  So let's take a minute or two and let's look at
Chamberlain just before Gettysburg.
<PRE>
>>I've been talking with Private Bucklin.  He's told me about your problem.
>>There's nothing I can do today.  We're moving out in a few minutes.
>>We'll be moving all day.  I've been ordered to take you men with me.  I'm
>>told that -- that if you don't come, I can shoot you.  Well, you know I
>>won't do that.  Maybe somebody else will, but I won't, so that here's the
>>situation.  The whole Reb army is up that road a ways waiting for us, so
>>this is no time for an argument like this, I tell you.  We could surely
>>use you fellows.  We're now well below half strength.  Whether you fight
>>or not, that's -- that's up to you.  Whether you come along is -- is,
>>well, you're coming.
</pre>
You know who we are, that we're doing here, but if you're going to fight
along side us, there's a few things I want you to know.  This regiment was
formed last summer, in Maine.  There were 1,000 of us then.  There are less
than 300 of us now.  All of us volunteered to fight for the union, just as
you did.  Some came mainly because we were bored at home, thought this
looked like it might be fun.  Some came because we were ashamed not to.
Many of us came because it was the right thing to do.  All of us have seen
men die.
<P>
This is a different kind of army.  If you look back through history, you
will see men fighting for pay, for women, for some other kind of loot.
They fight for land, power, because a king leads them, or just because they
like killing.  But we are here for something new.  This has not happened
much in the history of the world.  We are an army out to set other men
free.  America should be free ground, all of it.  Not divided by a line
between slave states and free.  All the way from here to the pacific ocean.
No man has to bow, no man born to royalty.  Here we judge you by what you
do, not by who your father was.  Here you can be something.  Here is the
place to build a home.  But it's not the land.  There's always more land.
It's the idea that we all have value, you and me.  What we're fighting for
in the end, we're fighting for each other.
<P>
Sorry.  I didn't mean to preach.  You go ahead, you talk for a while.  If
you -- if you choose to join us, you want your muskets back, you can have
them.  Nothing more will be said by anybody anywhere.  If you choose not to
join us, well, you can come along under guard, and when this is all over, I
will do what I can to see you get a fair treatment, but for now, we're
moving out.  Gentlemen, I think if we lose this fight, we lose the war.  So
if you choose to join us, I'll be personally very grateful.
<PRE>
>>Now, we used that to try to drive home the point that, you know, it's not
>>just enough to say, "we want to honor our veterans," or, "we sure are
>>proud that they're willing to die for freedom." But the question is, in a
>>sense, from Valley Forge through the war between the states, to San Juan
>>hill, to the troops at Chateau-Thierry in World War I, to Guadal Canal at
>>Normandy all the way up, what are you prepared to do to now to live out
>>what they sacrificed for?
</Pre>
And so in a context, in a sense -- and I think this is ultimately a moral
argument.  You cannot have a free society which lacks courage.  And the
courage isn't just, well, if it was a real battle and I was there and I had
to stand, you know, of course I'd get up and fight.  Nonsense.  The
question is, are you prepared to spend some time every month, some time
every day or every week, are you willing to be a citizen in peacetime to
actually use the freedom that your parents or grandparents bought for you
in wartime? And we want to drive this home.
<P>
I should also say I want to correct something.  The last time we used this,
I misspoke myself.  Chamberlain was not at the -- did not meet with Lee.
Grant and Lee met alone in a private home in the county seat of Appomattox.
However, two days later, when the Confederate army -- the army of Northern
Virginia surrendered, quote, the road leading into town was lined by
federal soldiers under the command of Brigadier General Joshua
Chamberlain."
<P>
Chamberlain had been picked for this duty.  He had won the medal of honor,
he'd been severely wounded, they thought he would die.  He had consistently
been courageous.  And at, "the impressive sight of the approaching
soldiers, Chamberlain was so moved that he recorded, quote, I thought it
imminently fitting to show some token of our feeling.  And he instructed
his officers to bring their troops to the position of the marching salute
as each body of the confederates passed.  When General Gordon rode opposite
him, Chamberlain had the bugle blown to bring the line to attention
preparatory to executing the marching salute movement successfully by
regiment."
<P>
And so you had Chamberlain, who is an American, sees himself as an
American, who understands the tragedy of the Civil War, which is that it's
between Americans, consciously, much as grant had two days earlier trying
to communicate this sense of mutual respect, of rebonding the country.
<P>
And Chamberlain's quite a remarkable person.  He goes back to Maine,
becomes governor, becomes President of Bowdon college, and dies, I think,
at 84 still suffering from the wound which had never quite healed from the
war.  But I'm not asking anybody to be Chamberlain.  I mean, very -- you
get one or two Chamberlains in a generation.  What I am suggesting is that
we have to bring into peacetime civilian life a sense of responsibility for
our society.
<P>
Now, because we're going to talk about our society, we're going to try out
something some of you may have seen before.  This is an old consultant's
gimmick.  This is the nine dot problem, called because there are nine dots.
With me so far? I don't want to get too far ahead of you.  I think we can
-- can we put the nine dots up as Chyron there? Okay, here we go.  You're
going to see the nine dot problem on TV.  See, somebody else did these
because they wanted them to be square, and when I do the nine dots, they
don't necessarily come out square.
<P>
Okay, now, what I want all of you to do is draw nine dots, three rows of
three.  Very important psychological gimmick.  And I want you -- making
sure they're all lined up just like they were in the Chyron.  I want you
now draw four lines, and the pencil can't come up, though, because you can
cover them in three lines.  You're going to cover all nine dots in four
lines.  And you can cross the lines if you want to, but they've got to be
straight lines.  All of you, you look frozen.  It's okay.  If it doesn't
work the first time, do another set of nine dots.  I mean, the trick is to
try it.
<Pre>
>>Can you solve it? At the rate you're going, I'm not sure you're-- who
>>knows how to do it? That's because you two took the course.  Tell us how
>>you do it.

>>you go outside the lines.

>>you've got to go outside the lines.

>>go outside what?

>>got to go outside the --

>>all of you listen very carefully.  You have to go outside --

>>you have to work outside the structure that you've created.

>>It's not a line.  What happens is people psychologically create a box.
>>There are no -- there's no box.  The people -- you can go back -- this is
>>really a very powerful -- it's from a book by Watslovic, et al., Called
>>"Change Problem Perception/Problem Resolution."  It's a brilliant opening
>>up to your own mind.  This is why we have trouble talking about balancing
>>the budget or we have trouble talking about replacing the culture of
>>poverty or we have trouble dealing with all sorts of questions, is that
>>people start out, they mentally impose the boundary.
</pre>
The solution is actually, you have to go outside twice, but there is no
outside.  See, watch, they're going to show it right there.  This is one of
Bob Head's fancy Chyrons.  Now, notice how what you create here is two
elbows that are totally legitimate given the definition of the problem, but
that you have psychologically --
<P><PrE>
>>I know.  They said, also a map to the alien's home from that.

>>got to go outside the lines.

>>To understand, so that people who are not in this room can understand
>>this, one of the cameras, pick up his shirt.  Pick up his shirt for a
>>second.  Come on.  Stand there and get him on camera.  The guys here have
>>made t-shirts of the newspaper story about me meeting with an alien, and
>>so that's why they're off - this is alien week at Reinhardt College.  But
>>if I can bring you back to this more normal thing here, okay.

>>yeah, right.

>>This last week is getting a little punchy, I can tell.  What people do is
>>people artificially create a framework.  Now -- and I'll tell you, it
>>took me two years of teaching this class to figure this out.  And one of
>>the break points was, I knew we were doing this last section wrong.  And
>>I couldn't get out of it.  I mean, I kept coming in, it was too
>>political, political in the sense of talking about politics, talking
>>about government, talking about citizenship written narrowly.
</Pre>
And then three things -actually, three things happened.  One was I went and
talked to an Amway group of about 15,000 people, and when we left, my wife
Marianne said to me, "that speech was wrong."  She said, "you reduced their
citizenship to voting."  She said, "these folks are citizens when they work
all day.  "they're citizens when they take care of their children.
"they're citizens when they're involved in Boy Scouts."  She said, "they're
putting in hours of citizenship every week, and you didn't talk to them
about what they were doing right."  And a light went on in my head, and I
said, I think I'm beginning to understand how I'd gotten trapped inside my
own nine dots here, because I didn't have a good enough definition.
<P>
The second thing, which I'll show you in a second, is that Gordon Woods
developed -- helped me understand the model that the Founding Fathers used
and that Jefferson, in particular, used for thinking about America.
<P>
And the third thing that happened was I read Olasky's book on "the tragedy
of American compassion," and Olasky says that in the 19th century, there
was so much volunteerism that there was one volunteer for every two poor
people.
<P>
Now, you think about the scale of involvement, the number of people who
thought, I better put in part of Saturday -- remember, these folks did not
have an easier life than we do.  They did not work shorter hours.  They
didn't have more labor-saving devices at home.  They didn't have fewer
malls to go to.  And, you know, I mean, these people put in very long hours
in a fairly hard life and still found time to be volunteers and citizens,
because they thought it was how they defined being an American.
<P>
And so I began to realize that we have been trying to solve some problems
by being trapped inside the dots in a way that doesn't work.  And that
you've got to have the moral courage to break out and rethink it.
<P>
Now, what compounded that, frankly, was sitting down and having dinner one
night with Dr.  Gordon woods, who's written two brilliant works.  One, "the
Origins of the American Revolution."  And the other on "the Radicalism of
the American Revolution."  And as we talked, he was trying to explain to me
why Jefferson so passionately believed in limited government.  That it
wasn't that he was just anti-government, it was that he was pro-freedom.
<P>
And as we talked about it, it seemed to me you could represent it in a box
that had four quadrants.  That the first and most important one was culture
and society.  That is, when you get up in the morning, who are you?  What
expectations do you have of yourself?  What expectations do you have of
others?  Do you expect to get up and go to work?  Do you expect to obey the
law?  Do you expect to participate fully in your community?  What -- and
what do you teach your children and your neighbors and your friends?  How
do you begin every day all day?  What are you modeling as a way to behave?
<P>

The second was civic responsibility.  That you had to have a sense of your
church or your synagogue, your volunteer association, your involvement in
your community, your help in creating new opportunities, new
philanthropies.  You know, if you don't have a public library, voluntarily
getting together to create one.  Benjamin Franklin is sort of the greatest
of the founding fathers at this, because he found -- he creates the
American philosophical association, the first fire department, the first, I
think, fire insurance company, the first public library in north America.
Helps found the post office.  And it goes through a whole range of these
things where he just -- whenever he'd see a need, he'd get a group
together.  And so he left behind him in Philadelphia this trail of things
where people got together because of Franklin and did something good.
<P>
And again, you see it, for example, in American volunteer fire departments,
which are a huge network of people who get together to do good things.
<P>
The third box is free markets and the pursuit of happiness.  Remember that
Jefferson almost wrote "the Pursuit of Property," and that the Founding
Fathers had -- in the Declaration of Independence, that the Founding
Fathers had a very deep belief that you had to be able to own property, you
had to be able to pursue better economic future.
<P>
And, now, it's within this framework that you get limited effective
government.  This is not weak government.  People misinterpreted Jefferson.
He is, after all, a man who bought half a continent in the Louisiana
purchase, sent Lewis and Clark across the continent on a scientific
expedition, and sent the marines to Tripoli.  But the point is, when governm
ent gets bigger, it crowds out the other three.  When government takes over
the job of acculturating, so we say, "well, I'm not really going to teach
my children anything.  "that's the teacher's job.  "I pay taxes.  "let a
bureaucrat do it."  When government starts trying to create jobs, which
it's inherently bad at, when government starts to take over what
historically -- and this is Olasky's whole point about welfare.  That
government, when it becomes unlimited, becomes ineffective, and in the
process, it crowds out the free society.
<P>
So what today's session is about is, how do we reestablish, in particular,
the core values of our culture and society, and then how do we reassert for
every American civic responsibility?  And we wanted to start with
Chamberlain to just say, you know, how can you with any sense of moral good
faith tell us you're too busy?  It's too hard?  It's too much?  If you're
going to be free, you have to be willing to bear some of the responsibility
of freedom.
<P>
Now, we're also not going to talk about government.  We're talking about
community, which is a much broader idea.  Community is the broad system
within which we live, which nourishes us and upon which we depend.  So
we're really concerned about the entire community.
<P>
And if you'll notice, by the way, the very language of the constitution is
a community language.  The preamble to the Constitution says, "we the
people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union,
establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common
defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty
to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution
for the United States of America."  But notice the broad goals, the broad
interest.  The Founding Fathers did not intend, therefore, to automatically
do all that through a bureaucracy.  But they wanted a government which
reinforced the general direction of society.
<P>
Another way to look at it is that citizenship is the duties, obligations,
rights, and responsibilities necessary to maintain community.  Not
necessary to maintain government.  Notice the difference.  This is not
about paying taxes.  It's about doing what you need.  And I would suggest
to you that people have struggled with the concepts of community and
citizenship for all of recorded time.
<P>
If you go back and look at Hammurabi the Lawgiver or at Moses, if you read
Leviticus and the 10 commandments in that whole process as the rise of an
effort to come to grips with an urban community.  If you look at Confucius'
work in China around 400 BC. , The rise of Athenian democracy with
Aristotle and Plato and the effort to figure out, how do people live
together?  The Roman Republic and the effort to create an orderly world for
the entire Mediterranean.
<P>
And then if you come to the capitol, you can see a reproduction of the
Magna Carta written in 1215 in which the English barons say to King John
that if you will concede that you can only get money from us with our
consent -- this was a very small group, now.  This was not average people,
this was not even knights.  This was only the great barons.  But they wrote
what was called the Magna Carta, or great charter, and it's the beginning
of the change.  It's a process by which you begin to have the government
recognizing that the consent of the governed matters.  And that taxes have
to be given because people are willing to be taxed, as opposed to the
divine right of kings.
<P>
The English Civil War, which was a terrible period in British history in
the mid 16th century -- 17th century in which you begin again to wrestle
with this, what's the power of the king?  What's the power of the House of
Commons?  How do people defend their rights?  And many of our laws, much of
our constitution, defending you, for example, against being tortured -you
can't be forced to testify against yourself -- comes directly out of the
English Civil War, and in the sense of the king using what was called a
star chamber, where you could be taken in and held without Habeas Corpus
and tortured to force you to confess.
<P>
And so a lot of the lessons of that period get embedded in the American
system.  And then, of course, the American revolution and the Founding
Fathers and the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution become our codification of the lessons of freedom.
<P>
And you have to -- again, I want to come back to the notion that America is
a unique civilization, and that part of our uniqueness is the radical
statement of where our power comes from.  Because, remember, you start with
the divine right of kings.  Then the barons sort of fight and say, "you've
got to give us power."  Then you have the English self war, and there's a
tension between commoners and king.  But the American system breaks loose
and goes to something very different.  The American system says, "we hold
these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they
are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
<P>
So the assertion is made at the beginning of the American political
experience that power comes from God to you, and then you loan power to the
government.  Which is why you go back to the constitution, we the people
decide to form the government.  This was not, God gives the king the power,
the king then tells you what to do.  This is, God gave you the power, you
then decided to loan it back to form a common government.  It's the most
radical statement of human rights, I think, ever written in terms of where
power comes from.
<P>
Now, the challenge, however, and what we have not been teaching, I think,
since the mid 1960s, is that freedom requires personal strength.  You have
to have integrity, courage, hard work, perseverance, discipline, respect
for yourself and for others, and responsibility.  And here you get into one
of those great test questions about how the world works.
<P>
If you try to design a government which does not have those values, and I
want -- see if they can put that back up just for one second real quick,
John.  Because I want everybody who's watching this on tape and television
to also get a sense of this.  What we've tried to do is we've tried for the
last 30 years to design a government for people who don't have courage,
won't work hard, lack perseverance, have no discipline, have no self-
respect, and are not willing to be responsible.
<P>
So we say, how can we define a welfare state for an irresponsible victim
without any hope of a better future?  And surely you can't actually
challenge them to have self-respect and discipline.  The whole core of this
entire course is, that's hopeless.  You cannot have a free society in which
you have no integrity, no courage, you don't have a work ethic, you're not
willing to persevere, you have no discipline, and you lack respect for
yourself and for others and you're not willing to be responsible for your
actions.
<P>
It is impossible.  You can't build the formula.  And this is at the core of
everything we've tried to say for 20 hours here.  That if you start over
and you say, okay, I'm going to stipulate that's what America has to be
like, now how do I design a government that works, then you can get there.
<P>

And when I talk about big words like "transformation," this is an example.
Designing a government for victims who are irresponsible and unable to take
care of themselves is so different from designing government for people
with self-respect, hard work, and perseverance, that they're two different
worlds and they're not compatible.
<P>
Now, let me give you, again, an example of somebody who personified this
commitment and who understood this, and let's look for a second at
citizenship as defined by Max Cleland, the secretary of state of Georgia.
<PRE>
>>but ultimately, you've got to have a passion for it.  You've got to
>>really believe that this system is yours, that it's truly yours.  That
>>seems to be the toughest thing to sell.  That's what makes people so
>>cynical today, is they really don't believe that.  They think, likeJack
>>Parr said, the comedian, he said, "I don't vote."  He said, "it only
>>encourages them."  The Greek word for "citizen" is "politicos."  And the
>>word "apathy" comes from the Greek word meaning "idiot."  So the Greeks
>>felt that if you didn't participate, you were an idiot.  And that if you
>>did participate, you had a high standard, you were a politicos, you were
>>a citizen.  And that was to be respected.  I think that's what we're
>>after.
</pre>
The Founding Fathers really felt that democracy itself was inherently fully
demanding of participation.  The story goes that Ben Franklin was rushed
after the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, and they said, "Mr.. .
Franklin, what kind of government do we have? " And he said, "you have a
republic, if you can keep it."  Democracy is built on the little person.
God knows it's not built on corporate and labor interests and special
interests and lobbyists.  We have all of those players, but that's not what
gives me hope.  What gives me hope is that individual citizen who has
nothing to gain and still finds his or her way to the polls and makes the
-- and takes their best shot.  Wow! You lose that, and you've lost a
country.
<P><pre>
>>Now, I think we came in, frankly, pretty good danger of losing that.  And
>>again, we want to emphasize this notion that when you come back over here
>>to culture and society, it starts here.  Do you teach your children to be
>>responsible?  Do you teach them to work hard?  Do you teach them to tell
>>the truth?  This is why Washington and the cherry tree wasn't -- whether
>>it was factually true or not, it was morally true.  It was useful to say
>>to young kids, "don't lie."  And compare that to a lot of the situation
>>ethics nonsense that goes -- that passes for wisdom today.
</pre>
Similarly, here, is it your expectation that as you get more successful,
that means you can leave for the lake on the weekend and skip all your
civic responsibilities, and as long as you're selfishly fine, you're okay?
Or does that mean we need to build a little sense of guilt in that says,
hey, what have you done for your country lately?  What have you done for
your neighbors?  If God's been good to you, what are you doing to help
somebody who's had a tougher time?  These two things are at the core of
this.
<P>
When we talk about citizenship, we get to hear a fourth.  You design this
after you've designed the first three.  In that framework, citizenship and
community are far broader than government and politics.  And we've got to
start with the notion of looking at how broad it is.  You know, if you
think about it, community life, working, raising a family, participating in
religious activities, volunteerism, these are at the core of what de
Tocqueville described as America, and these are at the core of what we have
to be willing to reassert is at the essence of this country.
<P>
So I'm more interested in, how much time are you willing to put in to
rejuvenating America, not how much can I raise your taxes to rejuvenate
America.  Because I don't think hiring another bureaucrat to replace a free
citizen gets the job done.  Just as in education, if we don't convince the
parents to care for their children and we don't convince the parents to
carry that their kids learn, it's very hard to substitute for that kind of
psychological commitment, which leads to, I think, some key questions, are
you a citizen?  What do you do?  How do you live out your citizenship?
What is your community?  And how do you help renew it?
<P>
And, of course, one of the points I made last week is our community
ultimately should be every citizen in this country.  Every child is an
American child.  Every neighborhood is an American neighborhood.  And so we
have to somehow draw people together.
<P>
Now, Woodrow Wilson described this in a way that I thought was just
tremendous, and talked about the notion of the refugees who come to America
having an obligation to live out their new Americanism, and he talked about
the idea that people who came to America were seeking freedom.  And that in
that process of seeking freedom, they had an opportunity to continue to
expand.  So he actually said, in a way, your love of freedom as an
immigrant increases our love of freedom, because sometimes we've inherited
it and we lose some of the spirit of freedom.
<P>
Similarly, in "American Civilization," in the newspaper this month on the
front page, they have a quote from F.  Scott Fitzgerald which is just
interesting.  Fitzgerald, who's often a cynic, said the following and wrote
the following in his diaries.  He said, "America is a willingness of the
heart."  I want you to just think psychologically about that concept.  That
it's -- that America is about a heart.  It's about a sense that's romantic.
In fact, I would argue that citizenship and community are the historic
lessons of American Civilization.  That you can't understand what America's
like unless you look at the wagon train, you look at the pilgrims coming
over together in a ship, you look at the barn-raising.
<P>
If you saw the movie "Witness," a wonderful scene of the Amish raising the
barn, and realized that was a standard 17th, 18th, 19th century scene in
America.  That in many ways, America's more about the Boy Scouts, the Girl
Scouts, Big Brother/Big Sister.  It's about people working together more
than about the lone individual living in an isolated kind of environment.
<P>
Ultimately, the essence of community is spiritual, and the essence of
citizenship is moral.  And I think because for a long period of time we
went through sort of a secular fetish where people didn't want to delve in
and explore this, it's been very hard to communicate.
<P>
I think I mentioned in here one time that I was reading Gary wills'
description of George Washington in his book on inventing America, which is
his study of the Declaration of Independence, and he says that modern
academics find it very hard to understand Washington because he was a
spiritual, psychological force, because it was his character that shaped
everything.  It wasn't his writings, it wasn't his rationality.  It was the
fact that he was Washington.
<P>
And I realized all of a sudden there was a profound insight into all of
modern academics, that as it drives out the romantic, as it drives out the
poetry that makes America so remarkable, as it shrink -- as it tries
desperately to shrink the Founding Fathers, and in Flexner's new edition of
his one- volume biography of Washington, he has an almost bitter section
where he talks about the way in which in the modern era, there's an effort
to reduce Washington to wooden teeth and a stiff personality, and that it's
a -- in Flexner's mind, it's an assault on the concept of America, because,
in fact, Washington was a very powerful central organizing figure for 200
years.
<P>
People said, "what is the spirit of freedom? " It's Washington giving up
the army to go back to Valley Forge -- I mean, to go back to Mt.  Vernon.
It's Washington saying his farewell address, when he could have won a third
term.  It's Washington literally dedicating his life to the cause of
freedom.  Spending seven years away from home fighting the war.
<P>
And that people used to know that and they used to teach it from first
grade on, and there was a sense of, this is what it takes to be free.
<P>
And, of course, none of us are going to be Washington.  But every child can
try to be honest.  Every child can try to have courage.  Every child can
learn perseverance.  Every child can learn the work ethic.
<P>
And so you have this sense of, how do you rebuild and reestablish the
spiritual and moral framework?  In fact, if you'll look at two recent
books, "the Demoralization of Society" by Getrude Himmelfarb, and "Building
a Community of Citizens" by Don Eberly, which as you know, we use here in
the course, both of them begin to make this point that our core problem is
not government.  Our core problem -- so it's not down here in this box
four.  Our core problem is culture and society.  That until we're prepared
to have leadership that hammers away at the need to rebuild the spiritual
and moral fabric of citizenship, we can't solve it over here with
government.
<P>
Bureaucracy cannot replace culture as a way of organizing a society.  And,
in fact, I would argue that the opposite is true.  That the genius of
America lies in liberating each citizen to seek community and to define
citizenship in the broadest possible way.  So take church, synagogue, Boy
Scouts, Girl Scouts, Rotary, Kiwanis, business and professional women, the
Audubon society, the Friends of Zoo Atlanta, the Appalachian Trail Club,
the Atlanta Lawn Tennis, the Hash House Harriers, they're all ways of
organizing.  Anybody here know anything about the Hash House Harriers?
<PRE>
>>no.

>>some of you have taken the class.  Do you belong?

>>no.  I've read about it.  I'm not up to that kind of running.

>>My younger daughter and her husband have run marathons, and there's a
>>group founded in the 1920s in Malaya by British soldiers who would go out
>>on Fridays, and they'd carry a bag of flour and they'd send a guy out
>>running, and he would drop it along the -he'd drop a little flour along
>>through the jungle, and they would chase about it, and after three to
>>five miles, which was their standard route, they'd end up at a bar.  And
>>they described themselves as drinkers with a running problem.  And, I
>>think there are four clubs in the Atlanta area.
</Pre>
This is an example of the information age and of Toffler's Third Wave.
They have an 800 number.  You pay $3. 00 a year.  It is a worldwide system
of runners.  When my daughter and her husband went to London and he ran in
the marathon, the Hash House Harriers had a relief station part of the way
through so you could stop and get a drink as you were running in the
marathon, and then later they found a whole group who were, I think, from
the isle of Wight, and they went out with them in the evening.  And they
had this common bond.  And it is just all sorts of unusual people who like
to run and who get together, and they go do it.
<P>
Now, my point is, America is about the right of a free people.  And we have
led the planet in this sense.  That government gets out of your face so you
can organize your life to do whatever neat thing you like.  You like to go
spot whales?  Go join a club that goes and spots whales.  You like to hang
glide?  Go hang glide.  You want to go help people in hospitals?  Form a
group that goes -- you know, that the genius of the system is to liberate
the energy to allow you.
<P>
And again, let me go back to what the pathology of Hollywood doesn't get
today if you see the Hollywood movies, which are in many ways just -- would
be -- would I think literally, in many ways, be seen as sick by any kind of
reasonable -- you know, "Pulp Fiction" and "Natural Born Killers" and this
kind of thing.  Because they are describing a society which is ignomic, in
which people are so isolated from each other that they don't have a clue
how to live in a common human decent system.
<P>
And so the elite culture of Hollywood doesn't get America.  It doesn't
understand how America works.  In fact, and this is one of the great
paradoxes, the freedom to be alone becomes the freedom to join.  We don't
have to have the government force people together.  If you allow people --
because people are natural social animals -- if you get out of their way,
don't raise their taxes, give them enough take-home pay, let them have a
chance to go do it, the natural bias of people is to work with each other.
<P>

And so you see in America, and it was the point de Tocqueville drove at
hardest, was that he was stunned as a Frenchman at the way in which all of
this freedom didn't become, sit around, don't do anything, get drunk, and
be indigent.  It became, be energetic, be excited, pursue your dreams, have
a wonderful life.  Go do something that's fun.  And fun could be becoming a
millionaire.  Fun can be being the best golfer.  I mean, fun is how you
define it.  The pursuit of happiness.  Which is a very broad statement.
<P>
Now, it led to an extraordinary explosion of energy and creativity.  And
yet joining and citizenship in America have been built on a sense of duty.
Again and again for 200 years, you had people saying, of course you're
going to be active.  Of course you're going to do something.  That's what
citizenship requires.  And you didn't have a sense of dignity if you
weren't involved as a civic leader.  You wanted to be involved.
<P>
And if you go back and look at the movies of the '30s and '40s, you see all
sorts of examples where people would go out and they would organize a
better future and they would do things that were positive, and they had a
sense of, how do we come together in order to improve our collective
future?
<P>
Marvin Olasky picks it up when he points out that the word "compassion"
means "to suffer with."  And his whole concern is that in the 19th century,
it wasn't enough just to pay taxes.  In the 19th century, you also had an
obligation to give of yourself.  That you had to be involved.  And that
true compassion didn't mean just writing the check or giving the homeless
person five bucks.  True compassion meant stopping and saying, why are you
on the street?  What can I do to help you?
<P>
And, in fact, deliberately not giving the five bucks until you found out
how you could help them and begin the process of moving them into a better
future on the premise that if you gave them the five bucks without knowing,
you could actually be buying the alcohol that killed them or buying the
drugs that killed them.  You could actually be worsening their life by a
phony compassion that really was designed to make you feel good.
<P>
Morris Schechtman describes it brilliantly when he says the difference
between caring and caretaking.  If I truly care, I have to stop and find
out what's wrong.  If I'm just caretaking, I do something for you that
makes me feel good about myself.  It may ruin you, but that's not my fault.
There's a huge difference between caring and caretaking, and in our
lifetime, caretaking has driven out a lot of caring.
<P>
Much of this goes back, frankly, to the very nature of the religious
underpinnings and the moral underpinnings.  I mean, think about, first of
all, the religious origins of the English Civil War, which was a war over
the nature of man's relationship to God.  Think about the notion of and
Methodism and the great awakening.  Look at the spiritual and religious
underpinnings of the abolitionist movement, the sense of the progressives
that they were carrying out a doctrine of Christian concern.  That what
they saw as their effort was bringing religion into civic life.  The Civil
Rights movement, the profound reason that it is reverend Dr.  Martin Luther
King, jr.  That there was a moral force, a moral basis for what he was
doing.
<P>
Eisenhower's description of what happened in Europe.  His book is called
"Crusade in Europe."  His statement to the troops at Normandy, "we have
embarked upon a crusade," a religious phrase, a sense of moral superiority.
The way in which we tried to do the war on poverty and the war against
drugs implies that these are bad enough things to wage war on.  That
there's a decisive moral difference.
<P>
And, in fact, I would argue that there has always been a deep moralistic
force in American society.  And that as over the last 30 years an
anti-religious bias built into both the elite culture and to elite
institutions, it undermined and it misunderstood the core nature of the
moral force.  This is not about morality in the small sense of, do you
drink or do you dance?  This is about a deeper sense, are your commitments
ultimately coming from a spiritual sense of God, or is it just secular?  Is
that person -- and again, think about it in terms of shooting or raping
somebody.  If you truly believe that other person has been endowed by God
and is equally legitimately authentically a creature of God, now to attack
them is a dramatically higher threshold.
<P>
Whereas, if you think they're just randomly gathered protoplasm, and why
not, I mean, blow them away?  What the heck?  And if you watch a lot of the
sicker parts of the Hollywood elite in terms of the movies they make and
the things they describe, it's clearly man as protoplasm, human beings as
protoplasm.
<P>
Whereas, the core belief system that made America unique was, in fact,
moral and spiritual, and I would suggest it is that moral commitment which
has sustained citizenship and a commitment to community.  That as de
Tocqueville said, America is to be found in its churches and in its
volunteer activities, not in its government.
<P>
Now, let's take just a minute and look at Jimmy Carter, who really, I
think, in a speech he gave during the Atlanta Project process, gave us a
sense of how this all weaves together into a basic framework.
<Pre>
>>I was in a middle school not long ago, bright kids asking me questions
>>that were very hard to answer.  Stimulating questions, questions I didn't
>>hear anywhere else and wouldn't.  Afterwards, I asked the principal,
>>"what are their main problems here? " She said, "Mr. President, the boys
>>believe that their future success, their status in life, is dependent
>>upon their ownership of a semi-automatic weapon."  And I said, "what
>>about the girls? " She said, "pregnancy is a growing problem.  "what you
>>don't know is that the worst problem is among the sixth graders."  I was
>>shocked.  "the drug pushers and pimps prefer sex with the little girls,"
>>she said.
</Pre><br>
That's not Bangladesh, and that's not Addis Ababa, and that's not Lusaka.
That's Atlanta, Georgia.  And the problem is that we don't really know how
to relate to people whose 12-year-old daughters get pregnant, who are
living just a few hundred yards from where we live a sequestered life.
It's no reflection on us except that we need to reach out now in a genuine
way individually with our stimulating capability of analyzing complicated
problems and say, "let me participate in bringing about a change."
<P>
But, you know, what gives me most hope is what I saw yesterday, with
homeless people building each other a little tar paper shack, and the 30
formerly homeless mostly alcoholics who are now every day preparing about
350 meals for other homeless people.  That's the kind of spirit that can
bind us together and bridge the chasm between the rich like us and the poor
who are still waiting for a better life.  So I'm convinced that the
situation is not hopeless.  I'm convinced that it's not an impossible
dream.  The only real failure is not to try.
<Pre>
>>Now, if I could just come back and summarize this first hour for -- very
>>briefly, because I think it is the heart of the course.  America is a
>>romantic, moral, spiritual fantasy.  It's what makes us different.  Take
>>every one of us, drop us off in another country, same body, same mind,
>>and say, "okay, you're not endowed by your creator, you don't have a
>>right to pursue happiness," and we would learn how to change differently.
>>We'd behave differently.
</Pre><br>
But people come from all over the world here, and they become different.
They somehow cross into a magic land where everybody thinks their kids can
be president.  Everybody thinks their kids can be an NFL quarterback or a
ballet star or could do whatever they want to do.
<P>
And somehow, what we have to do is come back here as we start to solve
problems.  What's killed us for 30 years is trying to solve the problems
down in this one box, government.  And government, by definition, cannot
effectively be cultural, because you would have to be a police state.
<P>
I mean, you would go nuts if government tried to do the things Olasky wants
to do.  You'd say, "by what right does some paid bureaucrat tell me about
these things? " And yet what Olasky is saying is, you've got to have people
involved in civic responsibility so they can then teach the right cultural
values, because this is the heart of America, not government.
<P>
The heart of America is a mystical belief that each of us is endowed by
God, that each of us is unique, and then the living out of that belief to
the best of our abilities.  And that's what makes us remarkable.  And when
we come back, we're going to talk about how this fits into the structure of
government and politics.  (break)
<Pre>
>>Let me pick up -- somebody brought me this little note, I think, from a
>>magazine that sort of starts us back on the same theme.  It's a quote from
>>John Adams, who once explained how the framers of the U.S.  Constitution
>>presupposed the necessity of God's grace for the survival of the new form
>>of government.  He said the following, quote, "our constitution was
>>designed only for a moral and religious people.  "it is wholly inadequate
>>for the government of any other."
</Pre>
Because, again, it goes back to the notion that these three sides have to
be working.  You've got to have culture and society working, you've got to
have civic responsibility, you've got to have free markets and the pursuit
of happiness in order to have limited effective government.  And as these
three decay, the natural pressure of government will be to reach out and
take over more and more.
<P>
Now, it's going to lead us to some very interesting implications as we go
through looking at the structure of government which grows out of this
cultural sense of a spiritual and moral society and a free society.
<P>
First of all, remember, the Founding Fathers start with the notion that no
human is perfect, and none can be fully trusted with power.  It's very
important.  Because again, the modern cynicism expresses itself by saying,
either we stipulate that everybody is so sinful that there's no point to
worry about it, or if you're not that, then you must be a saint, so the
minute we can find out that you're not, we can prove you're -- that you're
even worse than somebody who's sinful because you're a hypocrite and
sinful, and therefore, nobody has any moral standing to say anything.
<P>
Who are you to say that using drugs is bad?  Or who are you to say that
whatever the next?  And you can find case after case of this argument for
the inappropriateness of moral assertion.  And yet the Founding Fathers
knew that if everybody involved in a free society was human, that you had
this really core problem.  And they said it well in the Federalist Papers.
The Founding Fathers understood the dilemma, and they said, quote, "if men
were angels, no government would be necessary."  And yet since men aren't
angels, you need government in order to restrain the passions of men.  But
by definition, since the government's going to be made up of men, you're
now giving the power to restrain to the people who you're trying to
restrain.
<P>
Lord Acton captured this in the middle of the 19th century.  He said,
quote, "all power tends to corrupt.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely."
Notice the drop of the word "tends."  Now, this means that people say,
well, you're now Speaker of the House.  You're talking about yourself.  Of
course.  You think if I had power, forever surrounded by people who wanted
me to feel good, and so whatever I did they said, "oh, that's wonderful."
"mud looks good on you" is the right response of a sycophant when you fall
on your face on a rainy day.  And, of course, all power tends to corrupt,
and therefore, everybody is susceptible to it.  Every person in this room
is susceptible to it.
<P>
Now, the Founding Fathers faced with that said -- and this is one of the
great works of genius in human history.  They said, all right, if in order
to be free we have to give power to the very people we fear, ourselves, how
do we structure it so we don't just create a new tyranny?  And this was
their answer.  The American Constitution, to avoid tyranny, they designed a
machine so inefficient that no dictator could force it to work.
<P>
This is a very conscious design.  And you're going to see it happen with
the Contract, because it's going to leave the House, which is designed to
be fast.  Somebody once said -- there was a quote I saw this week that I
thought was a reminder.  One of the Founding Fathers had described, he said
the House is like a cup of hot coffee, and the Senate is designed to be the
cooling saucer that you pour the coffee in.
<P>
So when you see the Senate go slower, every one of the Founding Fathers
would have said, "yes."  And then when you see the bills go down to the
president, who may veto them, and that is his right, the Founding Fathers
would have said, "yes."  And then when the bill's finally passed, it can be
taken to the Supreme Court to see whether or not it's constitutional, and
the Founding Fathers would have said, "yes."  And everybody gripes about it
until you get to something like health reform, where a year ago people
didn't want it to pass.  And guess what?  The American Constitution worked.
<P>

If we had been a European parliamentary system, we would have passed health
reform like that.  But in the American system, where an idea gets beaten up
at every stage, and you better have a really powerful idea and you better
have a lot of people prepared to spend a long time to get it through.  And
that's not bad if your greatest value's freedom.  It's terrible if your
greatest value's efficiency.  For efficiency's sake, get a good dictator.
<P>
For freedom's sake, you've got to start with two notions.  One is -- let me
walk one more step.  Because the corollary of stopping the dictator is that
the American system disperses power so thoroughly, we can barely make it
work when we want to.  Now, you'd better approach all this with a good
sense of humor.  You'd better say, "well, I guess we're going to get messed
up today again."  And instead of seeing that as cynical, it's the price of
freedom.  And you've got to respect that you may have a good idea, but
somebody else does, too.  And the price of freedom is frustration.
<P>
I have two phrases I try to teach people: life is hard.  Freedom is
frustrating.  So when you get up and you say to me, "boy, life is really
hard," the answer is, "yes.  "next question? " That's the thing we don't
teach the poor.  Life is hard.  You want to succeed?  You've got to work.
If you're poor, you've got to work harder than people who aren't poor, by
definition.  And by the way, when you start to succeed, you're still going
to be frustrated as long as you're free.
<P>
I mean, Ross Perot is a billionaire, and he's frustrated, too.  Because
there are 260 million of us, and each one of us is endowed by God with
certain unalienable rights.  So every time you think you've got the right
answer, you've now got to convince everybody else.  And we don't teach -- I
don't believe we teach correctly just how hard and how frustrating and how
difficult a free society is.  And so it's a little bit like thinking you
can play pro football without exercising.  We tell people, well, you're a
citizen, you have all these rights.  Sure, but first you have all these
responsibilities.  You have to work hard to be a citizen of a free society.
And if you're not prepared to work hard, you're not going to keep your
rights very long.
<P>
And I believe that this frustration is at the heart of the permanent
tension between direct democracy and republican representation.  It's a
very important issue and one you'll see come up in the term limits debate
where I favor term limits, but there's still this very real tension.  On
the one hand, direct democracy says, "okay, how do we feel this week? " We
all raise our hand.  Let's rush off and do it.  The concept of republican
representation, which is very clear in the Founding Fathers, is you hire
somebody who you send to a central place.  They study the issues.  They, by
definition, learn things you don't learn, because you don't want to -- I
mean, you sent them.  You didn't send you.  You want to be able to go live
your life.
<P>
They are then supposed to use their judgment to represent you in a
republic, which is very different than a direct democracy, and the Founding
Fathers are very clear about this.  They feared the passion of the moment.
They feared the idea that you could establish a dictatorship with a good
demagogue and the right six weeks of campaigning, and they wanted to create
very hard problems of getting through.
<P>
Now, in that context, let me just say that I think Daniel Yankelovich, who
really developed this, talks about the difference between public opinion
versus coming to public judgment.  I found this to be one of the most
helpful explanations of what I experience.  Public opinion is that you got
a call this morning and say, "what do you think about 'x'? " Public
judgment is six or eight weeks from now, when you've read about it for a
while, you've talked to your neighbors, you've had a discussion at Sunday
school, you've chatted about it over lunch, you've listened to somebody
talk about it on the radio, and now you've formed an opinion.
<P>
There is a huge -- I mean, a judgment.  There is an enormous difference
between public opinion, what's the snapshot this morning, and public
judgment, what do people think after they've talked about it for a while?
And fairly consistently, the judgment is more cautious and remarkably
smart.  I mean, if you look over time at the wisdom of the American people,
the system works, but it takes time.  Takes six weeks to three months, as a
General principle, for the country to talk to itself.
<P>
So when you get a poll that says, "well, this morning, 82% said 'x,'" the
next question is, "yeah, and what are they going to say after they think
about it, after they put it in context, after they talk it out? " Because
then they're going to begin to have public judgment.
<P>
I believe that the sense of frustration is at the heart of the permanent
tension between reform and reality.  What you get is people who jump up and
they say, "I have a new idea," and they're on fire and they're ready and
they're excited.  But the fact is that it's going to be slow.  It's going
to take awhile.  It's going to be hard.  And it's easy, I think, at that
point to break down and to start getting cynical, when, in fact, very often
the system's working.  It is doing what the Founding Fathers designed it to
do.  It's making you prove that your reform is strong enough and good
enough to really be worth changing and having people have to obey a
difference.
<P>
One of the things about entrepreneurial free enterprise is that it tries to
solve the frustration by applying common sense.  That if you think about
this model, what the Founding Fathers wanted to do was have as few things
as possible in limited effective government.  Because they expected it to
be slow and frustrating.
<P>
So they wanted to decentralize away from the government creating wealth,
owning property, what you do with your money.  They wanted to decentralize
away from the government your right to organize any civic group you want to
go and do the things you believe in.  They wanted to decentralize away from
the government establishing the cultural values of the society.  Because
here you can allow people to do things very quickly, because they're not
government.
<P>
But then they wanted to say, now, wait a second.  When you start using the
power of the state -- and there's a great phrase from Washington where he
talks about the danger of the state, and that the power of the state is
like fire, that it can burn you and it's very dangerous.  And in that
framework, they wanted to make sure that this was deliberately limited and
deliberately difficult, because they thought it was the power to destroy.
And they were very cautious about giving the government power.  So
tremendous opportunities in the society at large, very hard in the
government itself.
<P>
Somebody who I think did describe -- and I mentioned this last hour --
somebody who I thought really described the emotion and the spirit and the
sense of being an American is Woodrow Wilson.  And this is from a speech he
gave to a group of brand new citizens who had just become Americans, people
who were first- generation immigrants.  I think you'll find it very
interesting.
<Pre>
>>this is the only country in the world which experiences constant and
>>repeated rebirth.  Other countries depend upon the multiplication of
>>their own native people.  This country is constantly drinking strength
>>out of new sources.  It is as if humanity had determined to see to it
>>that this great nation, founded for the benefit of humanity, should not
>>lack for the allegiance of the people of the world.
</Pre>
You have just taken an oath of allegiance to the United States, of
allegiance to whom?  Of allegiance to no one unless it be to God, certainly
not of allegiance to those who temporarily represent this great government.
You have taken an oath of allegiance to a great ideal, to a great body of
principles, to a great hope of the human race.  You cannot dedicate
yourself to America unless you become in every respect and with every
purpose of your will thorough Americans.
<P>
You cannot become thorough Americans if you think of yourselves in groups.
America does not consist of groups.  A man who thinks of himself as
belonging to a particular national group in America has not yet become an
American, and the man who goes among you to trade upon your nationality is
no worthy son to live under the stars and stripes.  My urgent advice to you
would be not only always to think first of America, but always also to
think first of humanity.
<P>
You do not love humanity if you seek to define humanity into jealous camps.
Humanity can be welded together only by love, by sympathy, by justice, not
by jealousy and hatred.  It is a very interesting circumstance to me, in
thinking of those of you who have just sworn allegiance to this great
government, that you were drawn across the ocean by some beckoning finger
of hope, by some belief, by some vision of a new kind of justice, by some
expectation of a better kind of life.
<P>
No doubt, you have been disappointed in some of us.  Some of us are very
disappointing.  But remember this, if we had grown at all poor in the
ideal, you brought some of it with you.  A man does not hope for the thing
that he does not believe in.  And if some of us have forgotten what America
believed in, you at any rate imported in your own hearts a renewal of the
belief.  You are enriching us if you came expecting us to be better than we
are.
<P>
You have come into this great nation voluntarily seeking something that we
have to give, and all that we have to give is this, we cannot exempt you
from work.  No man is exempt from work anywhere in the world.  We cannot
exempt you from the strife and the heart-breaking burden of the struggle of
the day.  That is common to mankind everywhere.  We cannot exempt you from
the loads that you must carry.  We can only make them light by the spirit
in which they are carried.  That is the spirit of hope.  It is the spirit
of liberty.  It is the spirit of justice.
<Pre>
>>Now, that's Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, talking at a
>>time when we had massive immigration.  I mean, there was an effort to
>>figure out, how do you define this thing we call America?  And, in fact,
>>he is one of the people who defined the modern American tradition of
>>liberty.
</Pre>
But I want to now walk you through what I -- I spent a lot of time thinking
about what's gone wrong, and I believe one of the things that's gone wrong
is in the core values of the elite.  And in particular, in the way in which
the elite, whether it's in the academic world or in Hollywood or in the
news media, has misunderstood how a free society operates.
<P>
And it seems to me that there are two traditions that are in conflict, and
I want to walk you through these two.  I do it building around two
particular individuals who happened to be at the "Baltimore Sun."  But I
think you can make a pretty strong case that these two traditions are
remarkably different.
<P>
And the two people I want to use are H. L,  Mencken and Frank R.  Kent.
Now, now, Frank Kent is not well known today, because his tradition was
defeated intellectually.  Mencken represented the sort of cynical,
contemptive humanity kind of view that assumes that everybody is somehow a
crook, everybody somehow has failings, everybody somehow is doing something
that is contemptible.
<P>
Frank Kent was the political reporter in the same period, where Mencken was
sort of a social critic, and literary types love him.  Frank Kent loved
politics.  He wrote a book called "the great game of politics."
<P>
I was introduced to Frank Kent by reporter-turned-editor named Paul walker
who'd been a reporter in the '30s and '40s and then had opened up a paper
called the "Harrisburg Home Star," whichwas a weekly give-away paper.  And
I'd gotten to know him as almost in the William Allen White -- "the Andy
Griffith show" model of the local newspaper editor who's a wise man and
who's very nice.
<P>
And he took me under his arm and he had me read Kent's works, because he
said Kent understood how politics really works.  We actually have a -- I
guess we don't have Kent's book here.  But it's out of print now, but it's
worth -- it's in libraries.  And Kent went out and really looked at and
lived with and enjoyed politics.  And he was honest about it.
<P>
Now, the difference is that the cultural elites despise politics.  I
believe they despise politics, first of all, because most of the modern
cultural elite starts with the Whig reaction to Andrew Jackson.  And the
Whigs disliked the way in which Jacksonian democracy took over Washington.
<P>

In fact, you don't get a really good biography of Jackson for about a
century and -- about 140 years, 130 years after he's President.  It's only
when Schlesinger writes his book which reestablishes Jackson as a precursor
to FDR, but for a long period, the Whig historians didn't like Jackson
because he represented the rise of populist sheer numbers, democracy in the
masses.  Then you get what is largely a Protestant, economic elite in the
progressive movement reacting to the Catholics who are taking over the big
cities.
<P>
And so you get this fury that here are these Catholics who are organizing,
particularly the Irish, who are organizing the cities and winning, and you
get the rise of the Progressive movement, which is a deliberate effort to
replace politics with bureaucracy.
<P>
And this tradition goes all the way up to present, as you'll see in a
minute, and is involved with people like Nader and Common Cause, and is an
anti-politics movement.  Politics is bad.  Raising money is bad.
Campaigning is bad.  Advertising is bad.  Organizing political power is
bad.  What you really want is some nice, elite intellectual, preferably a
good Protestant, who will then make the decisions outside of politics.
<P>
Go back and read the writing of the Progressive Movement.  It is remarkably
anti-democratic, and it says, "we'll do good things by making sure
politicians aren't in charge."  And Mencken not only had that tradition,
but Mencken personally despised people.  I think it's fair to say he was a
misanthrope.  And as you read his diaries and his letters, I mean, Mencken
came at life from a standpoint of extraordinary cynicism, and he became for
the journalism schools and for much of the modern media the sort of
archetype of the good critical cynic who stands aloof from the game and who
is all wise and all knowing and all contemptuous.
<P>
Now, the problem with that is that cynicism combined with moralism to
produce anti-politics.  So now you have these morally superior people who
are inherently cynical who dislike the process of politics.  And it's
utterly -- and let me tell you what the distinction is.  And it took -- the
person who helped me first begin to break this was Theodore White in "the
Making of the President" in 1960, where he says of Adlai Stevenson, that
Stevenson was like a man who liked the idea of romantic love, but despised
the idea of sex.  And that he was perfectly willing to become President,
but he did not want to do any of the things politicians did to become
President.
<P>
It was a wonderful paragraph.  When I first read it, I had to stop and
think, now, what is he getting at here?  Well, let me draw the distinction
for you.  And you can listen to this tone, and you'll instantly know
whether you're dealing with an elitist or not.  It's the difference between
liking people and liking the people.
<P>
I am always suspicious when somebody tells me about "the people."  Now,
tell me you like people, you're willing to go out and spend time with
people, you're willing to sit around a table and listen to people, and it's
one by one, because that's how people live.  Now you've got the makings of
a politician.  Tell me that you don't really like people, because after
all, they're messy and they're confused and they're strange and they have
desires.
<P>
I mean, it's just -- and it's frustrating.  Takes hours.  People are very
time-consuming, but as an intellectual elitist, you're prepared to help the
people.  I mean, read editorial writers who love the people.  And are quite
willing to dictate to them exactly how they should live.  Usually from a
morally superior position.  But my question to them, there's a great
phrase, and Martin Luther King, jr. , had led his crusade north to Chicago
and ran into the last great old political system, which still exists today.
And Mayor Daley held a press conference, and martin Luther King, jr. ,
went to the press conference and said, "there are people on the south side
who don't have running water."  And Mayor Daley, said, "what are their
names? "
<P>
And Dr. King stopped, because that wasn't the correct answer.  And he said,
"what do you mean, 'what are their names? '" he said, "if there are people
on the South Side who don't have running water, I'm the mayor, I want them
to have running water.  "give me their names.  We'll have somebody down
there by this afternoon, they'll get running water."  He didn't have any
names.  He was making a rhetorical statement about the people.
<P>
This is the -- and I'd never thought about it until today.  This is the
essence of the Olasky argument.  You can't help the homeless.  You can help
Sam.  So when Sam sits there and says, "give me a dime," if you stop and
say, "Sam, would you like to work for a little while?  "I'll be glad to pay
you 20 bucks, but I have some things that need to be fixed.  "would you be
willing to come over and help? " If Sam then says, "no, I'm too busy
begging," you know you shouldn't give him a dime.  But you've got to stop,
focus, and take care of Sam.
<P>
Now, one of the great books -- and the reformers will go nuts at my
reciting this -- but it is a great book, "Plunkitt of Tammany hall."
Plunkitt was a genuine machine politician.  He knew how the machine worked.
And late in his career, he told a young reporter, "this is how we did it."
And the truth was, in many ways, if you were an immigrant, if you were
Catholic in a Protestant world, if you didn't understand the government, if
you had a hard time speaking English, if you were a little scared by the
world around you, the big-city machines delivered, and they were a world
that was different.
<P>
Now, if you want to see what I think is -- and I believe in fiction and in
learning things, and if you want to see a great way to learn about it, take
a look at Edwin O'connor's "the Last Hurrah."  I think we have it on
Chyron, also.  But it is a great book.  This is a novel.  It's easy
reading.  It was a movie with Spencer Tracy.  And it's about -- based on
James Michael Curley, the Mayor of Boston, who was once reelected while in
jail.  Because their theory was the Protestant lawyers had put him in jail,
but he was a good Catholic, and he was going to take care of them.  I mean,
part of the reason I'm emphasizing this is, a, it's historically true, and,
b, as you now look at the rise of Black politicians and Hispanic
politicians and Asian politicians, this is nothing new.
<P>
In Benjamin Franklin's time, the fight was between the English, the
Quakers, who were English but of a particular religious sect, the Germans,
and they had all sorts of ethnic fights in Pennsylvania politics before we
were a state, when Pennsylvania was still a colony.
<P>
So all of these arguments and all these patterns are not new.  In Georgia,
the fight between the mountain poor who had their own farm and no slaves
and the folks down in the plantation area who were very rich and owned
slaves, totally different political styles.  In Louisiana, you have the
Cajuns, you have New Orleans, and you have the North Country, which is
Protestant.  And it's okay.
<P>
Part of the way the American system works is you're allowed to have your
own particular group, to be involved, to be active, and this Edwin
O'connor's book is a great novel about the last great mayor of his cycle
and what the machine was like and how it worked and what he did and why he
did it.  And you'll learn a lot about the process of a free society.  As I
mentioned, in Riordan's "Plunkitt of Tammany hall," you really learn how
power in a free society really works, and it gives you a real introduction
to thinking about it.
<P>
In the modern period, I can say as a practitioner, there may be no single
novel better about the U.S.  Congress than "Advise and Consent."  It's
about the Senate, but the essence of its lessons on the legislative body
are just fabulous.  And I reread it in 1990, and I was stunned at how
accurate it is and how much -- if you read this, it's as good as any
textbook you're going to get.
<P>
But the people who like politics, the people who understand individual
people -- remember the difference between individual people and the people
-- have certain characteristics.  People are human.  All humans have
weaknesses.  Politics will involve humans, politicians will have
weaknesses.  This is like a geometry set of principles, right?  It's
important to understand that.  So when you have the modern scandal
mongering, and again, I mean, I did file charges against the sitting
Speaker of the House.  I did move to expel the member who is a convicted
felon.  I do think there are lines you draw.
<P>
But the general shock of the news media discovering, once again, that
everybody in politics is a human being, unlike the reporters, because, of
course, you could have -- we didn't do it, but you could have done the same
Chyron, people are human.  All humans have weaknesses.  Reporting will
involve humans.  Reporters will have weaknesses, which is fine.
<P>
I mean, the glory of the system for a guy like Ernie Pyle, who's the
greatest war correspondent in World War II, was he knew that.  He covered
the soldiers with a sense of fondness because they were humans, and he was
himself regarded by the soldiers with a sense of fondness because he was a
human, too.  And so they had a common bond.  They didn't have any sense of
either one being morally superior, which didn't mean that they weren't
fighting to a moral end.  But it was the moral end which transcended them.
It was not their personal judgments.
<P>
Now, a fun book to really get a view of this is Franz de Waal's "chimpanzee
politics."  Franz de Waal's a Dutchman who's now actually at Emory.  This
is a study of the chimpanzee colony at the Arnhem Zoo.  Chimpanzees are
primates, they're social animals.  They have hierarchical struggles.
<P>
The book actually starts with a story about a male gorilla who is very
strong and who intimidates another male and two females till the three of
them get so mad at him that they bond together and the three of them almost
kill him, and they have to take him out of the cage.  And -- which is the
nature of politics.  And you start saying, "all right, tell me about
political organisms.  "how do they work? " And what you discover is that
there are all sorts of trappings, whether it's "Hail to the Chief" before
the President walks in, whether it's the Speaker walking in and banging the
gavel and saying, "the house is now in order."
<P>
And that you begin to sort of -- and you can see it in a room, you can see
it -- if you watch C-Span with the sound off when we're voting and just
watch the transactions, Marianne says it's like watching kindergarten at
recess and all the little kiddies running around and chatting with each
other.  But it's good for us to relax about the humanness of what we're
doing.  It's good for us to accept that we're going to get the best 435
humans in the house and the best hundred humans in the Senate and the best
human we can for President and Vice-President, and then they're all going
to be humans with all the passions, all the confusion, all the
complexities, all the ego problems, all the insecurities that are what
being human's about, and then you can relax, and you have a much richer and
deeper and more interesting experience.
<P>
Two really good books on this are both by Edward T.  Hall.  One is called
"the Silent Language," and the other is called "Hidden Communication."
What Hall did is he studied, how do people interact nonverbally?  How close
do people stand?  Greeks stand much closer than Germans.  What does being
on time mean?  It means very different for Germans than Brazilians.  And
you begin to look at different kinds of body language.
<P>
I was given by a Texan who had been assigned by Texaco to be the
Vice-President of computing.  He'd never been out of the state of Texas,
and he arrived in Brussels, and he walked in this room and he said about a
month later, he figured out that the body language of a Swede and an
Italian is radically different.  That a Swede can be furious and give you
no body language signals that they're mad.  An Italian can just be making a
point and you think that they're enraged.  And that he literally went to
these two books -- as a businessman, he read these two books to begin to
get the cross- cultural sense of, what are people saying to each other?
<P>
And what I'm driving at here, of course, is that you have to start with all
of the nonverbal biological natures of being human as an underpinning of
politics.  This is why the Founding Fathers were geniuses, because they
said, okay, we don't care how much you tell us you're going to be
wonderful.  You're a person.  Sooner or later, you're going to break down.
Sooner or later you're going to want to seize power.  Sooner or later
you're going to forget everybody else.  How do I design a machine so when
you are at your worst, you can't do too much damage to the country?  It is
a brilliant design for avoiding dictatorship.
<P>
Now, what Frank Kent did in his book "the Great Game of Politics" is he
came along and he said, "look" -- and this was written in the 1920s.  "here
is how the game is played."  I was looking at it last year.  It's
remarkably similar today.  Now, we do it with television, not with
newspapers nearly as much.  We do it with different kinds of advertising.
We have more consultants.  You know, our political bosses are electronic,
they're consultants rather than being geographic, but you still have very
similar processes, and it's well worth you studying.
<P>
Robert Heinlein wrote a little book just before World War II called "Take
Back Your Government," and it's a practical handbook for the private
citizen who wants democracy to work.  And it's a fun little book.  It's
been republished recently, and I really recommend it to you just as a way
of seeing -actually, I'm sorry, it was written in 1946, and I really
recommend it to you.  It's in paperback, and it's just an interesting
introduction from a guy who was a science fiction writer and a patriot and
understood how hard it was to get a free society to work.
<P>
Now, the dilemma of Common Cause and Ralph Nader is that they love the
concept of helping the people.  But they despise the process by which
politics operates.  Any contribution given must be corrupt.  Any appearance
of corruption must be evil.  Therefore, since -- so in essence, they can
end up in a totally socialist system in which all politics would occur
within government.  And it's a model which is, in fact, I think, in the
long run very, very dangerous to a free society.
<P>
The dilemma of the newsroom and the editorial boards is a different
dilemma.  It is, on the one hand, how do they cover as a legitimate
skeptic?  Difference between a skeptic and a cynic.  A skeptic says, I'd
like to believe you're sincere, but you've got to convince me.  A cynic
says, I know you're not sincere, so let me find -- let me figure out how to
get the mask to be pulled off.  And starting with Watergate, I think, and
with Vietnam, we went from a healthy, skeptical news media that loved
politics and understood it.
<P>
Go back and read the great legislative reporters of the 1950s, their
attitude towards the President, their attitudes towards the congress.  They
loved the business they covered.  They thought it was incredibly important.
Didn't mean they didn't report scandals.  Didn't mean they didn't report
human foibles, but they did it within a larger framework of saying,this is
this remarkable American romanticism, and then look starting with the mid
to late '60s, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Vietnam, and Watergate,
somebody could do a fascinating study of the change in tone, the change in
assumptions, and the change in what was legitimate behavior by the media.
<P>
And you now have a devastatingly more cynical, devastatingly more
adversarial system, which makes it harder to report the truth.  Because the
truth isn't always cynical.  The truth is often romantic and wonderful.
America is a great country with a good people.  And if you're not allowed
to report that because that would clearly not be cynical enough and you'd
be laughed at in the newsroom, you literally distort the whole context of
how America operates.
<P>
What we have to do is invent honest self-government and politics for the
21st century.  We've got to go back -- and notice the term I used, honest
self-government.  Yes, I think standards matter, and, yes, I think you have
to say, we're determined to have an honest system.  That means you've got
to, I think, invent citizenship and community for the 21st century, and
you've got to apply the Spirit of Invention and Discovery.
<P>
You've got to go back out and say, how can we get this to work?  What are
the things, whether it's computerization, whether it is town hall meetings
that are electronic, whether it is putting the Congress on-line as we have
with Thomas at the Library of Congress, how do we reestablish in the 21st
century this sense of citizenship and community?  How do we apply quality
to create citizenship and community?  You know, how would Deming have
approached all this?  And how could we have continuous improvement and a
sense of all of us as a large American team working to create a better way
of doing things?
<P>
I would suggest to you that as part of that, that there are four roles of a
leader, and that we often do this backwards.  That the first role of a
leader is to set the agenda and communicate goals and standards.  That the
second role of a leader is to convey symbolic power.  That is, when the
mayor or the governor or the President shows up, the act of their being
there makes the meeting more important.  They symbolize their community.
The third is to gather resources outside their own system.  That is, they
say, "let's go and create something," and they get volunteers, they get
private-sector money, they focus the attention of the community on doing
something.  Only the fourth is managing their own bureaucratic system.
<P>
Now, what happens to you in Washington and what happens to you at state
capitals is running the government narrowly defined, running this part of
your society.  Remember, the leader is the leader of all of this.  But
instead, what you've got is overfocus on running the government and an
underfocus on leading the culture.  So if you look at them all together,
notice where we place those, the four roles of a leader.  First, the top
one is to set the agenda, to communicate goals and standards.  The second
one is to convey symbolic power.  The third is to gather resources.  Only
fourth comes managing your own system.
<P>
Now, let me show you how this works at three major levels.  The President
of the United States sets the agenda for the nation by leading the American
people, symbolizes, symbolizes, the American nation, is the head of the
American community, and manages the American government.
<P>
But that's his least important job.  By contrast, a governor sets the
agenda for the state by leading the people of the state, symbolizes the
state, is the head of the state community, and manages the state
government.
<P>
But again, notice the thing we normally report on is the least important of
their assignments.  At a local level, a mayor sets the agenda for the city
by leading the people of the city, symbolizes the city, is the head of the
city community, and manages the city government.  And we don't train our
leaders to understand that their most important jobs are not the government
part.  It's the leadership part.
<P>
Now, what will happen is Toffler's third wave information revolution will
lead to new forms of citizenship and community.  And everybody, I think,
gets to play in this.  I mean, just as the Founding Fathers were codifying
the second wave transition from agriculture to industry, and in a sense,
you can see the rise of the constitution as an effort to figure out how
humans live together in that setting, every American can be asked, what is
your vision of 21st century citizenship and community?
<P>
And you can start thinking about, as you see everything that's changing
around you, how are we going to operate?  How is the system going to
evolve?  And then what are the right strategies to implement that vision?
Once we start figuring out whether it's town hall meetings or it's
computers or it's volunteerism or whatever it is, and I think this takes a
lot of discussion, and then finally, what projects and tactics will
implement your vision and your strategies?
<P>
Now, that's the dialogue, I think, of the next four or five years, and it's
a dialogue that the entire nation has to be involved in.  Because in
essence, what is at stake is doing the hard work of freedom.  That we have
to say to a generation, to quote Franklin Delano Roosevelt, that we have a
rendezvous with destiny, and that we have to be reengaged in rebuilding our
understanding of America and creating it.
<P>
And it starts, in part, with myths.  Remember, every civilization has
heroic myths, because that's how people teach themselves.  I mean, one of
the most famous, Frankly, is David defeating Goliath, a very important part
of the Bible, and it's a very important sense of mythology.  Here's this
young kid, he goes out there, and because he's on the right side, he kills
this giant, and therefore as it is described in the bible, the good guys
win.
<P>
Go back and read that and think about all the different lessons that are
inherent in that in terms of why you should have courage.  Why as long as
you're right, as long as you're standing for the right side, you should
take an interest.  In the Roman tradition, it was Horatio at the bridge,
the idea of the individual who stood there and who stood off the enemy and
who saved the society, even at the risk to their life.
<P>
That gets modernized in our system with Patrick Henry, the schoolteacher,
who said, "give me liberty or give me death."  I think he was 23 at the
time.  And imagine the courage, you get captured by the British, you're a
spy, and they say, "do you have any final words" -- I'm not -- I'm sorry,
it wasn't Patrick Henry.  It was Nathan Hale, which I'll get to in a
second.  But Patrick Henry, in a sense, sets up Nathan Hale, because
Patrick Henry in his speech says, "give me liberty or give me death," and
you're going to see this in the series.  The next one is John Paul Jones,
who says, "I have not yet begun to fight" when the British were sinking his
ship, so he had to actually capture their ship in the fight.  Then you get
to Nathan Hale, who says, "my only regret is that I have but one life to
give for my country."
<P>
Now, in a sense, look at the pattern, from David who goes down as a young
man risking everything for his team, to Horatio at the bridge who risked
everything for Rome, to Patrick Henry who says, "give me liberty or give me
death," to John Paul Jones, who was a figure of heroic courage.
<P>
And again, imagine what schools would be like in the inner city if this
kind of heroism were taught again.  If young children learned, well, of
course -- I mean, tell me how hard your problem is.  You think it's as hard
as Nathan Hale's?  And they hung him.  You think the fight you're involved
in is dramatically worse than John Paul Jones'?  His ship was sinking.  But
there was a spirit which is at the heart of a free society, a spirit of
enormous courage.
<P>
In Washington's case, frankly, it's his nobility.  That Washington comes to
personify the sense of duty, honor, country, which is at the heart of a
free society.  And then Washington, who is in some ways a very austere
figure, particularly because he's an older man bythe time he's President,
Washington then is matched in the pantheon of American heroes by Lincoln,
and I think it's because of Abraham Lincoln's compassion and martyrdom, the
fact that he's killed at the very end of the war at Ford's theater.
<P>
But when you look at the Lincoln figure, I mean -- and these, again, are
literally -- I mean, I'm using myth here in the best anthropological sense,
an organizing story which helps a society tell itself about life.  And so
you go from the nobility and courage of Washington to Lincoln's dedication
and compassion, the sense that Lincoln bled for every person killed in the
war on both sides.  That he thought it was a terrible -- if you read his
second inaugural.  If you come to Washington, go to the monument and read
the second inaugural.  You feel the pain.  And so you capture this spirit.
<P>
<P>
And then with the emergence of America as the leading industrial power in
the world, what more perfect mythology than Teddy Roosevelt charging up San
Juan hill?  If you ever get to see a fine little movie called "the Wind and
the Lion," which has a just brilliant portrait by Brian Keith of Theodore
Roosevelt, you get this sense of -- that he was the perfect evocation of an
emerging optimistic, buoyant, adventurous America.
<P>
Remember I read earlier that he's the first President to ride in a car, and
there's newspapers congratulating for his courage in actually riding in a
car.  Remember that he doesn't shoot the baby bear that they've captured,
and so the invention of the teddy bear.  You could argue that in some ways,
he may have been the most popular person ever to be President just as an
individual.  And yet he personified this explosion of energy that is
America at the turn of the century.
<P>
As I've said before, we get into the Depression, the country has deep
doubts, there is a tremendous collapse of belief in America, and then on a
rainy morning on March 4th, 1933, a man who is in braces gets up and says,
"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself," and literally you see just
the country begins to relax.  And, I mean, one of the great stories of
modern times, I was talking to a still photographer the other day who was
saying they never showed FDR in a wheelchair, because they had a sense of
the dignity of the presidency and they had a sense of his personal dignity.
<P>
<P>
And here's a man who by sheer will and discipline stood in his braces, and
if you watch -- I saw the other day some footage of him walking to the
podium that day.  He has somebody on each side helping him, because the
truth is, he could barely -- he couldn't move his legs.  I mean, it's a
remarkable effort of sheer will.  And yet he comes out of all this, having
been through polio, having been told basically -- I mean, his wife strongly
wanted him to quit and his family wanted him to quit.
<P>
He works his way back, he gets a call from Al Smith, who says, "we have to
have you" on the ticket to run for governor in 1928.  He believes in his
heart he's beginning to learn to walk again, and he's faced with the
choice, do I serve my party, run for Governor, and probably never walk the
rest of my life, or do I stay out of politics and recover?  And they say,
"you've got to do it," you know, and so he runs, he wins, when Smith is
losing the Presidency, and then four years later, he's not just a man of
enormous discipline, but he does something that I don't know of any other
American politician who's ever done it.  He has an automatic contagious
buoyant optimism.
<P>
You see it twice.  First as the depression.  The country's a mess, 25%
unemployment, and FDR just picks the country up.  It goes back to this.  He
leads by faith.  He leads the country by just creating a mood that is
amazing that, "we can do it."  And then, of course, it re-creates it in
1941 at Pearl Harbor, and no matter how bad things were the first six
months of World War II, he was always optimistic, he was always positive.
We were going to get there.
<P>
And, of course, in a way, his direct psychological descendant, a Reagan
Democrat turned Republican, is Ronald Reagan.  If you think of, "we have
every right to dream heroic dreams."  He says it two different places in
his first inaugural, "we have every right to dream heroic dreams."  After
all, we are Americans.  And you have this same buoyant, positive sense.
<P>
Now, I want to wrap up this part by bringing together two different
feelings.  One, this is a great country with a good people.  Optimism,
buoyancy, positivism makes sense.  Two, life is hard and freedom's
frustrating.  That underpinning the optimism is brute hard work.
Underpinning the sense that we're a good people is a very tough-minded
willingness to stop the ones who don't want to be good people.  And it's a
- it's complex.  It's not obvious or simple or easy, and yet that's the
magic that for 300 years has grown the process of freedom.
<P>
And to go back to where we started with Chamberlain, we got a section from
Burn's fabulous "the Civil War" I want to share with you.  This is a letter
written by Sullivan Ballou to his wife.  And again, I want you to listen to
this letter and think about what we're asking.  We're saying to you, in
peacetime, you have to take responsibility, you have to give some of your
time, you have to be willing to be an American, which is an act of being.
It means you've got to invest yourself in your community, in your
neighbors, in your children, in your parents.  You have to do things to be
an American.  But we're asking you to do it in peacetime of the richest
society in the history of the world.  Listen for a few minutes to what
Sullivan Ballou wrote his wife.
<Pre>
>>a week before the Battle of Bull Run, Sullivan Ballou, a Major in the 2nd
>>Rhode Island Volunteers, wrote home to his wife in Smithfield.

>>July the 14th, 1861, Washington, D.C.  Dear Sarah: the indications are
>>very strong that we shall move in a few days, perhaps tomorrow, and lest
>>I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write a few
>>lines that may fall under your eye when I'm no more.  I have no misgiving

Sarah, my love for you is deathless.  It seems to bind me with mighty
cables that nothing but only omnipotence break, and yet my love of country
comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly with all those
chains to the battlefield.  The memory of all the blissful moments I have
enjoyed with you come crowding over me, and I feel most deeply grateful to
God and you that I've enjoyed them for so long.
<P>
And how hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes and
future years when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved
together and see our boys grown up to honorable manhood around us.  If I do
not return, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I loved you, nor that when
my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.
<P>
Forgive my many faults and the many pains I have caused you.  How
thoughtless, how foolish I have sometimes been.  But, oh, Sarah, if the
dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they love, I
shall always be with you in the brightest day and the darkest night,
always, always.  And when the soft breeze pans your cheek, it shall be my
breath, or the cool air your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit
passing by.  Sarah, do not mourn me dead.  Think I am gone, and wait for
me.  For we shall meet again.
<Pre>
>>Sullivan Ballou was killed a week later at the first battle of bull run.

>>Isn't that great?  One of the things Bill Fortune, who's writing a book
>>with me, is a historian of this period, one of the points he makes is
>>that when you go back and read the letters of the period, that it is
>>astonishing how idealistic they are, and how muchit meant.

>>it seems like we're in this period where we're all motivated by
>>self-interest.

>>One of the -- or that if -- that your self-interest also includes God and
>>it also includes your spiritual being and it also -- I mean,
>>self-interest broadly defined is what they've died for.  If you see the
>>wonderful movie Glory, and I get tearied up, too.  I think it's an
>>amazing thing.  Anyway, the point is you listen to that, and then you get
>>told, "I'm too busy shopping to be a citizen."  And you know that right
>>here is what this is all about.  You're either going to turn this culture
>>around and say to people, grow up.  You want to be free, you've got to be
>>responsible, or it ain't going to work.
</Pre><br>
Let me just say in closing, this has been an extraordinary 20 hours.  This
is the close of the cycle of three courses.  I want to thank Dr.  Minnix,
who's right here because -- (applause) and President Floyd Falany, who I
think is in the next room, but without him, we would not have been able to
do this (applause).  I want to thank Bob Head and all the crew both here at
Reinhardt and the crew from VTA that made this possible, and there are most
of them downstairs, although we have several folks around here, but they've
done a wonderful job.
<P>
Jeff Eisenach, who brought us Sullivan Ballou, and who ran the whole thing
for three years.  Nancy Desmond, who did the original story.  Steve Hanser,
who's been our chief intellectual advisor in all.  John McDowell sitting
back there, who's put all this together this time and who stayed on top of
all of it.  Pattie Stechschulte, who is, I think, in the other room.  Maury
Kennedy, who produces the newspaper.  And I want to thank my wife,
Marianne, because this has all been tough.  And we want to thank you.

<P>
The skyrocketing increase in the use of illegal drugs has been accompanied by a softening of attitudes toward drug abuse.  A clear, moral appeal to "Just Say No" has been replaced with mixed messages of tolerance and moral ambivalence toward drug use.  This ambivalence can be seen in both the White House and the schoolhouse:

<LI>  Teen attitudes towards drug use have softened significantly since 1992.
<LI>  The non-partisan Partnership for a Drug-Free America concluded, "Todays teens are less likely to consider drug use harmful and risky, more likely to believe that drug use is widespread and tolerated, and feel more pressure to try illegal drugs than they did just tow years ago."
</UL></blockquote></td>
<td col width=400 valign=top><blockquote>
<UL>
<LI>  Despite the surge in drug use, little has been said by the national government about the dangers of drug use.  Studies show that during the first nine months of 1995, out of more than 1000 interviews, statements, remarks and proclamations, the President mentioned drugs only 18 times.  As a recent <I>Newsweek</I> article reported:  "It is simply beyond argument that Bill clinton has failed to use the power of his office to lead the war on drugs."
</UL><P>
With the abdication of leadership in the war on drugs, public resolve has been eroded.  Conflicting messages about the acceptability of drug use have left American children more open and more vulnerable to drug use than ever before.</blockquote></td></tr>

<h2>Statement by<br>
 National Republican Congressional Committee Chariman<br>
 Bill Paxon</h2>
January 23, 1996
</center>
Contact:  Craig Veith 202.479.7070<P>

<blockquote>
National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Bill Paxon (R-
NY) made the following statement tonight regarding Bill Clinton's State 
of the Union address.
<P>
"Tonight Bill Clinton proved one thing beyond the shadow of a doubt -- 
he's a congenital liberal who believes that a bigger, more intrusive 
government is the answer to what ails the nation.  Nothing could be 
further from the truth.  
<P>
''Bill Clinton gave a speech that was designed to make people feel good -- 
that's what he does best: make promises to make people like him, then 
break the faith with the American people. 
<P>
"The Republican-controlled 104th Congress is different. We have 
advanced an agenda that is in line with the values and priorities of the 
American people -- balancing the out-of-control federal budget, saving, 
and strengthening Medicare, providing real reform to a failed welfare 
system and giving over-taxed working families much needed tax relief.
<P>
"Bill Clinton and Congressional Democrats should face the facts: 
Republicans are fighting for Americans, young and old.  Democrats are 
fighting for nothing more than re-election.
<P>
"In 1992, Clinton and the Congressional Democrats campaigned for 
change.  In 1994, the voters saw the truth -- Democrats were fighting for 
the failed status quo and they elected a Republican majority to Congress.  
Today, Leon Panetta said this debate is about competing visions for the 
future of America. Republicans want a government that performs better, 
spends less and is less intrusive in the daily lives of every-day Americans.  
Bill Clinton and the Democrats in Congress want a bigger government 
that spends more, taxes more all to fund the failed policies of the status 
quo in Washington.
<P>
"In 1994, the voters said Republicans had a better idea. In 1996, they will 
vote to increase our majority to work with a Republican president so that 
we are able to continue the changes we began in January 1995."
<P>
Many American parents were offended by the "challenge" from the 
President to cherish their children.  Parents don't need the President to tell 
them to love their children and be their "firth teachers."
<P>
The first step toward meeting America's challenges is for Bill Clinton to 
do his part, to transform the "say anything, but do nothing" presidency 
into one that fulfills its responsibilities.  Republicans challenge Bill 
Clinton to do his part by keeping his campaign promises and start telling 
the truth about Medicare. We challenge him to balance the budget, 
provide tax relief for families and for economic growth, and genuinely 
reform welfare. We challenge him to stop trying to scare senior citizens 
about Medicare and act to preserve it for the next generation. The 
Republican Congress already has done the hard work. They already 
consulted the American people for the best solutions, turned them into 
legislation and passed it. All Clinton has to do is put down his veto pen 
and fulfill his campaign promises by using his pen to sign the Republican 
balanced budget into law.

   <H1>Hitler vs. The United Nations</H1>
   <h2>Liberty and the Bosnian Conflict</h2>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>

Hitler was born sixty years too early to serve his ambitions.  Had he come to power in the 1990s instead of the 1930s, he would have won.

<p>
In the 1990s he would have been faced with the United Nations organization and the current leadership of the United States, and they would have offered little resistance.  I do not mean to suggest that they would have done nothing:

<p>
The U.N. forces would have stood at the railway stations, monitoring the families that were split apart among screams and tears.  U.N. monitors would also have stationed themselves outside Buchenwald and Dachau to monitor smoke when it was seen coming from the crematoriums.  But their orders would have been not to take a side in the conflict.

<p>
The United States leadership would adamantly oppose any aid to Great Britain on the grounds that it would "Americanize" the war, and the President would reject any weapons going to the underground movements in Europe, saying this would only "cause the death of innocent civilians."

<p>
In the 1990s the U.S. Presidents foreign policy has turned the nation into a Maxi-Switzerland, with his perception of our military as little more than a uniformed Peace Corps.  But its not only the administration.  Prominent voices in the opposition party are saying that engagement in Bosnia would not be in our national interest.  Are they saying the prevention of genocide would not be in the interest of the people of the United States?  And both major political parties concur that we must not send in U.S. ground troops to help the 
victims of Serbian aggression.

<p>
Without the will, our power (if we still have it), means nothing.  Militarily, Rule Number One is never to announce what <i>will not</i> be done.

<p>
The larger tragedy of contemporary times is that the word "peace" is given more importance than the word "liberty."  As is always the case when peace takes precedence over liberty, neither are achieved.  It is only when liberty is paramount that liberty and peace can both be realized.

<p>
President Lincoln could have had peace easily, saving 500,000 American lives.  He could have done that by ordering U.S. troops from Fort Sumter and allowing South Carolina and any other state to secede from the Union.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt could have had peace if on the morning of December 8, 1941 he would have asked Congress, not for a Declaration of War, but for a Declaration of Accommodation with the Axis powers, as an Asian and European War would not be worth the death of one more American.  And we would have had peace.

<p>
President Bush could have had peace in this decade by allowing Sadam Hussein to keep his troops in Kuwait and to allow him entry into Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman.  Surely Sadam Hussein would have sold us oil as he would have needed the dollars.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
In all cases there would have been the peace of the slave for the many, the peace of the master for the few, and the peace of the grave for the rest.

<p>
As President Clinton rejects any troops to protect the Bosnian civilians, he does not rule out 25,000 U.S. troops to safeguard the U.N. forces.  Why does he care more about the uniformed who were misplaced there by the U.N. than about the civilians who were born there--or who went there to be in a U.N. "safe area"?

<p>
What should we do?

<p>
Ignore the U.N.  Lift the arms embargo.  And with or without NATO, bomb all military targets of the Serbs, including all missile deployments, all anti-aircraft sites, all roads, supply lines, bridges, and arms factories, whether in Bosnia or Serbia, all the way to Belgrade with no privileged sanctuaries.  (The lesson we should have learned from the Vietnam war.)  And we should be willing to send in ground troops if necessary after the bombing, and make our willingness known.

<p>
Why should we do this?

<p>
Because were alive at this time.  Our obligation as human beings is to stop the atrocities of which we once said, "Never again."

<p>
But we said that a long time ago.  It was, after all, more than a half century ago that Hitler encountered a difficulty too large for him to overcome. The difficulty was that back then there were leaders in the world who held liberty as the most cherished human right.

<title>Speech by Jeff Eisenach before the U.S. Conference of Mayors -- PFF</title>

<h2>Conservatism</h2>
<b>Speech before the U.S. Conference of Mayors
<br>By Jeff Eisenach</b>
</center>
<p>
Thank you for having us here today.
<p>
As President of the PFF and Advisor to Speaker Gingrich ....Ive been given to understand that part of my role here is to present the "conservative" agenda for renewing Americas cities.
<p>
I will fail this task, for three reasons.
<p>
First, I cannot tell you today what the term "conservative" means.  For the last six decades, or so, it could have been defined in part as "not giving a damn about the cities."  Yet I have flown 2000 miles to be here with you today, accompanied by my partner and collaborator in thinking through these issues -- a life-long Democrat who may cause you bodily harm if you even think about calling her a conservative.
<p>
Secondly,  neither conservatives -- whatever they are -- nor liberals -- whatever they are -- have an approach to the cities worthy of the word "agenda." There are inklings, beginnings, first glimpses and hopeful signs.
 But an agenda:  I dont think so.
<p>
Finally, its not even quite clear what we mean by "city."  The City Limits?
 The SMSA?  Whoever participates in the local Council of Governments?  Is a city an economic unit, a cultural one, or a governmental unit where the Federal government sends checks for handing out to the poor?  Why do we have cities? Should we have cities?
<p>
So let me start by being honest.  I dont know what a city is or ought to be, I have no agenda for how to make one successful if I did, and I cant even tell you what ideology I bring to the table as I approach the issue.
<p>
Now, before you pack me back off to Washington in disgust, let me tell you a few things I do know, which I think might be helpful.
<p>
First, the information revolution is real, it is here right now and it is forcing profound change in virtually every institution in society.  If you have not already done so, I strongly encourage you to buy and read a copy of Alvin and Heidi Tofflers new book, Creating a New Civilization, which is the most elegant and concise description of the changes now happening to all of us.
<p>
Second, the central implication of the information age for government is the death of bureaucracy as a means of accomplishing human goals.  It worked for nearly a century, and thats a pretty good accomplishment for any system.
 But centralized control through hierarchical institutions is no longer a good way to get things done.
<p>
Third, the Federal government is in the process of dealing with the fact I just mentioned.  The most successful bureaucratic system ever on the planet is being torn asunder by the same forces that have already changed IBM, General Motors and the Soviet Union.  You are feeling the impact of that change right now, and you will continue to feel it for many years into the future, regardless of which party controls Congress or the White House.
<p>
Fourth, the reason the information age is killing bureaucratic systems is that it permits the creation of something better:  agile, just-in-time, customized, "virtual" systems that permit flexibility and diversity, accomodate constant change and produce results.  In short, it is now possible, thanks to the collapse in the price of information, to create "institutions" over night, do what needs to be done during the day, and close them before sundown the following evening.  And the new virtual organization respects no geographic or legal boundaries.  (Gage story)
<p>
Now, based on items three and four, let me make a couple of suggestions regarding economic development and your relationship with the Federal government.
<p>
First, do not ask today what your Federal government can do for you, or even what you can do for it.  Its lucky to take care of itself on an average weekday, and its already getting plenty of advice.  Instead, ask what your Federal government can stop doing to you.  Ask, as Rudy Guiliani said recently, for your freedom.  In fact, dont just ask for it:  Demand it.
<p>
And, getting it, figure out how you can use that freedom to your advantage.
 Let me give you an example of what I mean:
<p>
On the way down on the plane, I read the materials you provided on Senator Hatfields Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act of 1995.  And it gave me the following idea:
<p>
Suppose the Federal government were to say to metropolitan mayors that it would entertain proposals to eliminate regulatory and spending restrictions for any metropolitan area that applied.  Eliminate restrictions on Section 8 spending; eliminate Davis-Bacon Act requirements; Eliminate unfunded mandates.  Any metropolitan area -- including surrounding jurisdictions -- could apply to become a "free city," on one condition:  The mayor of the central city had to make the application.
<p>
I think the implications for relationships between cities and their surrounding jurisdictions are obvious:  You would have a bargaining chip -- a very large bargaining chip, I suspect -- you do not now have.  And you could use that bargaining chip to achieve one of the most pressing objectives of any sensible urban policy:  Reintegrating the suburbs and the central cities into coherent social and economic units.
<p>
Is this proposal too radical to be considered.  I frankly dont think so.
 Let me ask Jane, who has been involved in the Federal relationship with the cities for many years, tell you a little bit about what she is now seeing -- really what she is now creating -- in Washington.

<CENTER>Before the U.S. House of Representatives,  Subcommittee on Rules and Organization, Committee on Rules<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>

<P>
<P><P>
<B>Testimony of Jeffrey A. Eisenach, PH.D.
<BR>

</B>
<P>




May 24, 1996<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,
it is an honor to appear before you today to discuss the impact
of the information revolution on the legislative process and the
structure of Congress.<BR>

<P>
Before continuing, I should note that while
I serve as President of The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,
a non-partisan research and educational institution, the views
I express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of
the Foundation, its board or other staff. I would, however, like
to thank Mr. Kent Lassman, a researcher at the Foundation, for
his assistance in helping me prepare for this testimony.<BR>

<P>
My testimony today is based in large measure on the work of 
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation, as well as my own 
studies on the impact of the information revolution
on government and society.  In particular, I will draw heavily
on lessons learned in preparing and teaching a course titled <I>The
Role of Government in the 21st Century</I> at Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government last fall.  For the record, I have attached
a copy of my curriculum vitae as well as the syllabus for that
course.<BR>

<P>
In addition, much of what I have to say this
morning is framed in a larger set of ideas about the nature of
the information age and its impact on government.  Many of these
ideas are expressed in testimony I gave before the Senate Committee
on Governmental Affairs last year, a copy of which is also attached
to this statement. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
Mr. Chairman, what I would like to do this
morning is address what I believe are four myths about the impact
of the information revolution on Congress, myths which, if they
are allowed to masquerade as truth, could lead you and your colleagues
to take steps that are not only unproductive but counterproductive.
<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>Myth Number #1<I><B>:  The information
age will make government, and therefore Congress, less important.</B></I></B>
</UL>

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Myth Number #2:  <I><B>The information
age will enhance the functioning of mass democracy.</B></I></B>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Myth Number #3:</FONT></B><I><B>The information age will make Congress in its present formwork more efficiently.</B></I>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Myth Number #4:</B>
<I><B> The questions of how to structure Congress and the legislative
process are mostly internal issues about how Congress operates
and have little to do with the larger question of restructuring
government.</B></I>
</UL>

<P>
<P>
Let me address each of these myths, and as
I do so, offer some corresponding thoughts which I believe are
closer to the truth in each case.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<CENTER>*   *   *<BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Myth Number #1<I><B>:  The information age
will make government, and therefore Congress, less important.</B></I></B>
<HR>

<P>
It is argued by many that the impact of the
information age will be to lessen the role of government, especially
the Federal government, and reduce its impact on society.  This
is said to be the case because the information revolution heralds
a time of less centralization (hence less centralized government),
smaller institutions (hence smaller government), greater specialization
and customization (hence less national government relative to
states and localities) more individual empowerment (hence less
government, period), and so forth.<BR>
<P>
Furthermore, since the task before Congress,
it is argued, is little more than rolling back the size of government,
and this is inherently a much less complex effort than creating
new government programs, the role, relevance, responsibilities
and overall importance of Congress will diminish commensurate
with the role, relevance, responsibilities and overall importance
of the Federal government.<BR>
<P>
These arguments are misguided, and the conclusions
are simply wrong.<BR>

<P>
First, they are wrong because the role of the
Federal government -- while it will be very different from what
it was during the Industrial Age -- will if anything grow in importance
in the coming decade.  The Federal government will indeed be less
centralized, meaning that fewer decisions will be made by bureaucratic
hierarchies; it will be characterized by smaller programs, meaning
that it will spend less money and raise less in taxes; it will
grant greater flexibility to states and localities, meaning less
micromanagement from Washington; and it will, indeed, facilitate
greater freedom and opportunity for individuals, meaning citizens
will spend less time worrying about how to comply with detailed
Federal laws, rules and regulations.<BR>
<P>
But it will not be less important.  It will
be more important, for three reasons.  First, markets which in
the past have been regarded as statewide or regional in nature
are becoming national markets, requiring national approaches.
 Second, markets which in the past have been national markets
are becoming international markets, requiring the Federal government
to negotiate appropriate international arrangements.  Third, as
society becomes more complex and diverse, the Federal government
-- as the expression of our national democratic process -- will
be challenged to devise institutional arrangements which permit
and enhance freedom while preserving our shared principles.<BR>

<P>
Second, these arguments are wrong because the
challenge before us today is not simply to reduce and abolish,
cut and tear down the government of the Industrial Age:  It is
to replace that government with laws and institutions appropriate
to the Information Age.  That challenge is the most difficult
and complex ever faced by any government at any time in history
-- because the society in which we now live is the most sophisticated
and complex ever constructed.  As Chicago Law Professor Richard
Epstein argues in an important recent book by this title, creating
&quot;simple rules for a complex world&quot; is no easy task.
<BR>

<P>
Third, even if one were to believe that the
Federal government will <I>someday</I> become less important,
the challenge of making the transition from an Industrial Age,
Progressive model of government to a digital age model will occupy
us for probably a decade to come -- and perhaps much longer. 
In this context, I would point out that our efforts as a nation
to come to terms with the implications of the Industrial Revolution
took at least 70 years -- from the creation of the Interstate
Commerce Commission in 1870 to the culmination of the New Deal
in 1940 -- and that this period was marked by tremendous turbulence
and spirited debate on very fundamental issues.  <BR>
<P>
A similar debate is now getting underway, and
the focal point of that debate will be the U.S. Congress.  And,
just as the decisions we made during the early part of this century
literally determined the nature of the society in which we now
live, the decisions Congress makes during the course of the next
decade or two will influence the entire future history of our
nation.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Myth Number #2:  <I><B>The information age
will enhance the functioning of mass democracy.</B></I></B>
<HR>

<P>
Perhaps the most pervasive myth currently being
promulgated about the impact of the information age on government
and politics -- and the Congress in particular -- is that the
information age in general, and the Internet in particular, will
enhance the functioning of mass democracy.  Because we can all
watch Congress on C-SPAN, access copies of bills on THOMAS and
send E-mail to our Representatives about how we feel, this argument
goes, we will all be more empowered as citizens.  And Congress,
conversely, will be better informed and more responsive to us
because of all the E-mail we send them.  As a result, Congress
will be able to make ever more decisions, ever more wisely.<BR>
<P>
This myth is ridiculous on its face.  First,
information about the activities of Congress has been widely available
to the interested public for many years,  and while C-SPAN and
THOMAS make it easier to obtain raw data about what Congress is
doing, anyone who has ever listened to a floor debate or tried
to read a bill knows that raw data is not always all that useful
in understanding the real issues behind a piece of legislation.
 Second, and more to the point, the notion that E-mail on the
Internet is going to give every American their own direct line
to their Representative is simply silly.  No human being can have
550,000 pen pals, and whether the mail shows up via snail mail
or a &quot;T1&quot; line doesn't change that simple fact.  Third,
Congress already has extraordinarily good data on public opinion
in the form of surveys, focus groups, etc. -- and has for at least
30 years.<BR>

<P>
But this myth is also potentially very destructive,
if, simply because we are technologically able to do, we find
ourselves drawn away from representative democracy towards direct
democracy -- i.e. frequent plebiscites, digital or otherwise,
on issues now voted upon by Congress.<BR>

<P>
The problem facing Congress today is not that
it does not have enough information about the decisions before
it, it is that it is trying to make too many decisions.  To quote
Alvin and Heidi Toffler,<BR>
<P>
 The diversity and complexity of a Third Wave
society blow the circuits of highly centralized organizations.
 Concentrating power at the top was, and still is, a classic Second
Wave way to try to solve problems.  But while centralization is
sometimes needed, today's lopsided, over-centralization puts too
many decisional eggs in one basket.  The result is &quot;decision
overload.&quot;  Thus, in Washington today, Congress and the White
House are racing, trying to make too many decisions about too
many fast changing, complex things they know too little about.
<BR>

<P>
Imposing the same decision load on 260 million
people, instead of 535, is no answer to this problem.  The answer
is what the Tofflers refer to as &quot;decision division,&quot;
or what I would call &quot;virtual democracy.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Moving from "mass democracy" to "virtualdemocracy" means
putting the communities that are most knowledgeable
about and most affected by specific decisions in charge of making
them.  In some cases, these communities are well-represented by
current political boundaries (e.g. states, cities, counties, congressional
districts); in others, they cross jurisdictional bounds, and will
require the creation of regional governing bodies, often specialized
ones to address specific issues (such as environmental concerns);
in still others, they are non-geographical communities of interest,
and will create governing bodies that bear no relationship to
geography at all.<BR>

<P>
What we must recognize is that governance,
like everything else about out society, is becoming dramatically
more complex.  The traditional interest groups (with the important
ones represented physically in Washington) and the traditional
system of geographic representation (embodied in the Constitution
itself) will not be replaced -- but they will be supplemented
by a plethora of pseudo-governmental bodies of every kind.<BR>
<P>
Congress' can and should use information technology
-- not, you will be glad to hear, to try to respond personally
to each and every income E-mail message -- but to facilitate its
interactions with a growing number of increasingly important "virtual
communities." The bi-partisan "Internet caucus"
recently formed by Congressman White, Senator Leahy and others
-- complete with Internet site -- is a good example of an effort
to do just this.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Myth Number #3:</B>
 <I><B>The information age will make Congress in its present form
work more efficiently.</B></I>
<HR>

<P>
The third myth I'd like to challenge today
relates directly to the internal functioning of Congress.  Through
internal E-mail (and eventually video conferencing), greater access
to research and information through the Internet, remote voting,
etc., some believe, the functioning of Congress will be made more
efficient, allowing Congress to address more issues more effectively,
without making fundamental structural changes.<BR>

<P>
This argument flies in the face of the experience
of every private sector institution in America and the world,
to say nothing of the experience of other governments, or of Congress
itself. <BR>

<P>
Do not misunderstand me:  improving the information
technology support systems within the Congress -- which are shamefully
outdated -- is a necessary condition for improving the way Congress
functions.  But better information technology will only have the
desired effect if it is used to enable an improved  structure.
<BR>
<P>
What are those changes? First, one of the things
information technology can do is facilitate the operation and
integration of increasingly complex and dynamic institutions within
Congress.  For example, by placing the deliberations of a committee
or subcommittee on an &quot;Intranet&quot; site, information technology
can make it possible for all members to participate -- in &quot;real
time&quot; or at a time of their choosing -- in the deliberations
of the committee or subcommittee.  The question that arises is,
why would they bother?  Having no vote or direct influence over
the committee's deliberations, and plenty of other things to do,
most members would not take the time to get involved.  The result
-- lots of information, no demand.<BR>
<P>
A potential answer to this quandary is to supplement
committee membership through "virtual membership."
Suppose, for example, members were allocated a certain number
of votes during each session <I>which they could use to vote in
any committee, on any bill or amendment.</I>  Members with particular
interests and/or expertise would thereby be empowered to participate
in a meaningful way in this key step in the legislative process.
<BR>

<P>
Second, expanding on this same idea, suppose
members were also empowered to create "virtual committees."
Under such a system, members would be permitted to choose, in
addition to their current committee assignments, to serve on two
virtual committees of their choosing, formed voluntarily by groups
of members and funded out of supplemental budgets provided to
their offices for this purpose.  Such committees would have standing
only for the current session, and could address issues of immediate
importance to the members involved.  Through the use of information
technology, they could meet, deliberate and vote from any location,
with research and staffing provided by virtual staff, potentially
located anywhere in the world.<BR>

<P>
Third, coming to an issue that I know raises
strong feelings on both sides, the arguments for permitting remote
voting seem to me to dramatically outweigh the arguments on the
other side.  As every member knows, being dragged back from the
district to vote on a few procedural matters every Monday or Tuesday
makes little sense, and detracts significantly from members abilities
to be with their constituents.  And once you are here in Washington,
being dragged across the street several times a day to vote is
debilitating and makes it almost impossible to construct a coherent
schedule or be productive at work.  As for the arguments on the
other side, it ought to be noted that members managed to get to
know one another -- to form that bond of community that only face-to-face
contact can allow -- even in times when Congress was in session
much less than at present.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Myth Number #4:</B>
<I><B> The questions of how to structure Congress and the legislative
process are mostly internal issues about how Congress operates
and have little to do with the larger question of restructuring
government.</B></I><HR>

<P>
The fourth myth is that the structure and process
of Congress can or should be seen independently from the larger
question of how government is structured.  While it might be hard
to find anyone to defend this view, the relative paucity of attention
paid to the question of restructuring -- certainly through 1994
and even since -- suggests that many believe it implicitly.  Or,
that the thought of real restructuring is sufficiently threatening
to members that it ends up on the back burner.<BR>

<P>
As my comments above, and elsewhere, have suggested,
the structure of Congress has a profound impact on how it interacts
with the public and on how well it functions in the most basic
sense.  More broadly, however, the structure of Congress determines
the way power is allocated and exercised.  Committee Chairs have
a natural interest in preserving and expanding the authority of
their committees -- and that means preserving and expanding the
programs over which they have control.<BR>

<P>
This phenomenon is a natural part of both human
nature and the democratic process, but in times of rapid change,
it can also be a debilitating barrier to meaningful change.  I
would suggest to you that the creation of an information age government
will necessitate the creation of an Information Age Congress --
one organized according to the ideas and principles and institutions
of the future, not the past.<BR>

<P>
As consideration is given to reorganizing Congress,
I hope the ideas discussed above, and more broadly the issues
you are addressing in this hearing today, will be taken into consideration.
 In particular, would hope that such deliberations would begin
by recognizing that what is happening to us today is not a move
from one steady state to another, but rather a move from one rate
of change (intermittent and slow) to another (constant and fast).
 Government must be prepared -- for the indefinite and probably
unlimited future -- to respond much more rapidly to changing circumstances
than ever before in history.<BR>

<P>
Information technology makes it possible to
create institutions with the requisite degree of fluidity and
responsiveness needed to deal with constant, rapid change.  Indeed,
it is the creation of such institutions outside of government
-- dynamic, constantly innovating corporations and other private
sector entities -- that has created the demand for a more rapidly
responsive government.<BR>

<P>
But information technology alone will not make
Congress more responsive.  Fundamental structural changes are
absolutely necessary to make this key component of our democratic
system work for our future.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER>*   *   *<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Let me conclude my comments by quoting from
two of the leading thinkers about the impact of information technology
on the corporate world, William H. Dawidow and Michael S. Malone.
 In their recent book, <U>The Virtual Corporation</U>, they describe
how information technology is changing the modern corporation:
<BR>

<P>
In the end, unlike its contemporary predecessors,
the virtual corporation will appear less a discrete enterprise
and more an ever-varying cluster of common activities in the midst
of a vast fabric of relationships.<BR>

<P>
I would like to suggest to you that this sentence,
applied to the U.S. Congress, is worthy of your consideration.
 A virtual Congress will be more fluid and flexible internally,
more dynamic in its decisionmaking and, increasingly, woven almost
seamlessly into &quot;a vast fabric of relationships&quot; that
will constitute the American political system.<BR>

<P>
Information technology will make that possible.
 You, Mr. Chairmen, the Members of this Committee, and all of
your colleagues in both houses, have the opportunity to make it
real. <BR>

<P>
<CENTER>*   *   *<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Mr. Chairman, that completes my prepared remarks.
 I look forward to addressing any questions you may have.<BR>

FRC's staff of public policy experts -- and extramural family experts recommended by FRC -- are frequently called to testify before Congressional committees debating pending legislation or seeking guidance on vital family issues.  FRC also routinely submits unsolicited testimony to House and Senate Committees open to informed public opinion.  Topics range from the mundane and technical to the speculative and controversial.  Congressional testimony represents one of FRC's prime educational functions as a nonprofit organization located in the nation's capital.

<FONT SIZE=5>in the Film &quot;Shadowlands&quot; </CENTER>

<P>It is understandable why the film<I> Shadowlands</I> (now available on
videotape) won rave reviews from almost everybody. The acting is splendid,
the script is literate, and the production design is first-rate. All things
considered, the film is a wonderful piece of cinema and well worth seeing.
For those of us who never had the rare privilege of meeting C. S. Lewis
in person, <I>Shadowlands</I> brings Lewis and his world to life in a new
way.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, despite its beauty and its pathos, <I>Shadowlands</I> is not
without major failings in the realm of accuracy. Unfortunately, many people
seem to take at face value the film's opening claim that &quot;this is a
true story.&quot; The reviewer for <I>Christianity Today</I>, for instance,
wrote that although &quot;the filmmakers have taken some liberties with
facts&#133;and simplified some of Lewis&iacute;s complex musings&#133; the
film is generally true to Lewis's life.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As a matter of fact, it isn't. The names of the principal characters are
the same, but much of the plot has been contrived to fit the point of view
of scriptwriter William Nicholson.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not complaining about the numerous small inaccuracies. I expected those.
After all, it doesn't really matter that Joy had two sons instead of one
(though it might matter if you were the son who was left out). Nor does
it really matter that the marriage between Joy and Jack went on a lot longer
than the film indicates (more than three years in reality). Such errors
are minor and certainly fall within the domain of legitimate dramatic license.
<BR>
<BR>
What is more difficult to accept are the two huge errors on which the whole
plot seems to hinge.<BR>
<BR>
The first of these errors is the depiction of Lewis's life before he met
Joy. The film portrays Lewis as leading a cloistered existence in which
he avoided women, children, and --above all-- commitments to any relationship
or situation that offered him the potential for risk or pain. This depiction
of Lewis is a convenient way to set up him up for the film's subsequent
love story. But the portrayal invents a C. S. Lewis who never existed. <BR>
<BR>
Contrary to the storyline of the film, Lewis had lived a life that was anything
but cloistered or free from pain or commitment. During World War I, the
supposedly cloistered Lewis served in the trenches in France, where he was
wounded in action. After the war, the supposedly sexless Lewis apparently
became infatuated with Mrs. Moore, a widow old enough to be his mother.
When the affair ended and Lewis became a Christian, Lewis the uncommitted
somehow felt obliged to support Mrs. Moore for the rest of her life, and
she lived with Lewis and his brother until she had to be moved to a rest
home (where he visited her every day). Meanwhile, the Lewis who did not
associate with children had three children come and stay with him during
World War II (they had been sent out of London because of the air raids
(just like Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy in the <I>Lion, the Witch, and
the Wardrobe</I>). Similarly, the Lewis who supposedly avoided women also
developed a close friendship with English poetess Ruth Pitter; he even told
a friend that were he the kind of man to get married, he would marry her!
And the Lewis who walked through life without painful experiences had to
deal with his rejection by Oxford's academic community, which never saw
fit to select this brilliant scholar for a professorship (Cambridge finally
did in the 1950s). <BR>
<BR>
The second huge error of the film is its suggestion that Lewis's faith in
God was undermined by Joy's death. While the film shows grief-torn Lewis
saying (quite tentatively) to his stepson that he still believes in heaven,
there is little indication in the film that Lewis still believes in a loving
God. Indeed, in an outburst before his friends, Lewis is shown railing at
the brutality of a God who acts as cosmic vivisectionist. Although this
scene is invented (Lewis&iacute;s grief was intensely private), the speech
against God that William Nicholson puts in Lewis's mouth is actually inspired
from a passage in Lewis's <I>A Grief Observed.</I> The problem is that Nicholson
is slipshod in the thoughts he chooses to lift from Lewis: He appropriates
Lewis's struggles from <I>A Grief Observed</I> but doesn't bother to give
any sense of the reaffirmation of faith found in the rest of that book --
or in the many other letters, interviews, and articles by Lewis during the
rest of his life. It seems that Mr. Nicholson wasn't interested in portraying
an orthodox Christian who experienced intense grief and yet maintained both
his faith and his intellect. <BR>
<BR>
Here is where the pernicious aspect of <I>Shadowlands</I> becomes evident.
Lewis's writings -- including his intimate confessions in <I>A Grief Observed</I>
--were largely efforts to vindicate God's often unfathomable ways to man.
Lewis sought to remove the obstacles that separate us from a living relationship
with the One who truly loves us. <I>Shadowlands</I> does precisely the opposite
by setting up Lewis's faith as a straw man and then proceeding to knock
it down. <BR>
<BR>
The film repeatedly shows Lewis delivering a simplistic speech about how
God uses painful experiences to make us listen to Him. The facile confidence
with which Lewis delivers the speech is gradually contrasted with personal
hell he goes through during Joy's sickness and eventual death. By the end
of the film, Lewis has presumably recognized that his simplistic theological
dogmas won't wash. He doesn't find God in suffering; he finds a silent void.
Thus is the most cogent defender of Christian orthodoxy of the twentieth
century transformed into a modern champion of anguished doubt.<BR>
<BR>
I tend to think that most people who view <I>Shadowlands</I> will overlook
the underlying contempt the film displays for Lewis's faith because Lewis
is portrayed so sympathetically. And make no mistake: Despite the biographical
inaccuracies mentioned above, Lewis <I>is</I> portrayed sympathetically.
This film is not anti-Lewis. But perhaps that is because the villain in
this story is not Lewis, but God. <BR>
<BR>
The great irony of <I>Shadowlands </I>is that it even as it draws people
closer to Lewis, it may drive them further away from the One in whom Lewis
found the meaning of life. What a tragedy it would be if those who see the
film come away thinking that Lewis's earlier faith was somehow refuted by
reality. Mind you, I am not claiming that this <I>will</I> be the result
of <I>Shadowlands</I>. One can only speculate about the effect of the film
on individual viewers, and this sort of speculation is rather dubious anyway.
I can only suggest that given the film's script that some viewers may conclude
that Lewis's defense of Christianity could not stand the scrutiny of real
life. <BR>
<BR>
There is another possibility, of course: The film may inspire those who
see it to read Lewis's writings for themselves and discover the reality
of the faith to which he pointed. I hope that this second possibility will
turn out to be the reality.

   <H1>Transferring the USIA to the Department of Many Umbrellas</H1>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>


<p>
The dismemberment of the Soviet Union has brought many in Congress to the conclusion that the United States can close or cut those foreign policy entities that took a lead role in the Cold War.  As a result, the United States Information Agency (USIA) may soon be slated for takeover by the U. S. State Department, with a commensurate and severe cut in the funds of USIA's radio arm, the Voice of America (VOA).  The VOA could then be virtually destroyed by the Chamerlainesque policies of State.  The hallways of the State Department are lined with dripping umbrellas, even when it isn't raining outside.

<p>
Is the USIA and its VOA still valuable with the Soviet Union gone?  Of course it is.  The death of the Soviet Union does not guarantee that democracy is the one and only outlook for Russia and other former Soviet Republics.  Nor does it mean that totalitarians around the world will applaud U.S. policy.  The VOA is the SDI of information.  Its stories about the United States have balanced the movies, rap songs, and gang activities which many citizens of the world would otherwise think consume this nation.  Its truth-telling of world news and events has encouraged the citizens of the world to accept nothing less than liberty.

<p>
On the sixth anniversary of the Tiananman Square massacre, the VOA's transmitters reached tens of millions of people in China despite their government's attempts at jamming it.  Would our State Department be so insistent?

<p>
When the Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Ms. Saw Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was released from house arrest this month, she told reporters that during those six years of confinement the VOA was her outside line to the free world.  Everyday at 6:00 PM she stopped everything to listen to its broadcasts.

<p>
The National Spiritual Assembly of Bahai's of the United States officially expressed its appreciation to the VOA for keeping the Teheran regime of Iran aware of America's commitment to the cause of the Bahai's human rights.

<p>
The representative of the Dalai Lama recently contrasted the truth of the VOA to the propaganda from the People's Republic of China media to Tibet.  He wrote, "The Voice of America's Tibetan Language News Service is the only independent source of news for the Tibetan speaking areas of the world."

<p>
What would our State Department say to Cuba, Burma, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Vietnam, Serbia, and Libya as it directs the Voice of America?  What would it say to Tibet?

<p>
There are areas of the USIA that I believe can be eliminated without risk.  The Fulbright scholarship programs should not be part of the workings of the federal government and the exchange programs should be served by private institutions.  But the USIA's libraries in 130 countries, its publications, its films and television programs and, of course, the Voice of America, are invaluable allies of those who want to know what the United States is all about, and what liberty is all about, and what truth is all about.

<p>
The 104th Congress is magnificently doing what has not been done since the birth of our nation. Its members, like our Founders, are acting against political nature by giving power to the states, the localities, and the people.  James Madison wrote that the federal government's duties "will be exercised principally on external objects," meaning foreign affairs.  The power now being surrendered by our federal government in foreign affairs will, of course, not revert to the states, the localities, and the people, as it will in domestic affairs.  

<p>
If the USIA is stripped of its influence, that power will not go to the people of California, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, and Delaware.  It will go to Kim Jong Il, Mu'ammar el-Qaddafi, Fidel Castro, Hafez al-Assad, and Deng Xiaoping.

Liberal Republicans in the Senate are at it again, doing their best to derail the conservative
revolution -- and if you don't call or write today, they'll get away with it!<p>

Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, has introduced and passed an appropriations
bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services that reverses the hard-fought
gains we made during House consideration of the measure last month.  <p>

The bill as it came out of the House was the single most dramatic example of the conservative
revolution at work.  Among other things, the House version of the Labor-HHS appropriations
bill:<p>
<ul>
     <li>Ended welfare for lobbyists by placing new restrictions on taxpayer funding for political
     advocacy groups;<br>
    <li> Terminated funding for the Office of the Surgeon General;<br>
     <li>Ended taxpayer financing of abortions through Medicaid;<br>
     <li>Abolished the liberal Goals 2000 Program;<br>
    <li> Overturned President Clinton's executive order barring the use of striker replacements by
     federal contractors;<br>
    <li> Established tough new restrictions on the regulatory authority of OSHA and the NLRB.<br>
</ul>
But Senator Specter stopped the train in its tracks!<p>

Senator Specter -- who has a lifetime ACU rating of just 39, making him the 4th most liberal
Republican in the Senate -- decided to sabotage the work of his party's members in the House,
and refused to even consider any of these tough legislative riders.<p>

As you read this, the Specter version of the appropriations measure may already have passed the
full Senate -- but it's not over yet, because the two competing versions will still have to be
reconciled in a House-Senate Conference Committee.<p>

Call,  write or fax Senator Specter today, and let him know what you think of his arbitrary and
capricious decision to abandon his party's principles and support higher spending, more
regulation, and other failed liberal policies.<p>

You can reach him at:<br><br>

     SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER<br>
     530 Hart Senate Office Building<br>
     Washington, D.C.  20510-Concord, N.H. 03301<br>
     Phone:  (202) 224-4254   FAX (202) 224-1893<br><br>

Or, if you'd like, email your thoughts directly to the Senator at <a href="mailto:Specter@bizserve.com">Specter@bizserve.com</a>
<p>

Remember, it's not too late to act -- but to have an impact on this debate, you must call or write
Senator Specter today!<p>

Tell him you want him to support the original House-passed language in the Labor-HHS
appropriations bill.  Demand that he do his part to further the progress of the conservative
revolution, and overturn four decades' worth of failed liberal policies.<p>

Call or write Senator Specter TODAY and let him know just you think about his decision to
become a turncoat Republican.<p>

Together, we can fight Senator Specter's plan to let business as usual reign on in Washington. 
We'll keep putting the pressure on him here in Washington, but we need the help of good
conservatives like you to make it work at the grass-roots level.  <p>

So contact Senator Specter TODAY, and we'll be able to get a good, tough Labor-HHS
appropriations bill, like the one they originally passed in the House.<p>


Remember -- Senator Specter is running for President. If he has a campaign office in your state,
call there, too.<p>

   <H1>Restoring  Conservative  Unity</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn</H3>

</center>

The radical change of the 1994 election was produced by a unity of conservatives as strong as in the days of Reagan.  All the elements of the Reagan coalition functioned together magnificently in the congressional races and a forty-year lock on the Congress was broken.  Economic and social conservatives stood arm in arm.

<p>
Now, that harmony strains and threatens to break.  Last week, a long report on the <i>McNeil-Lehrer News Hour</i> presented a parade of conservatives chastising one another and threatening to break ranks.  Social conservatives threaten to walk away from the coalition if the moral agenda is not given priority.  Economic conservatives claim that religious zealots are attempting to control politics in the name of a faith they do not share.  Of course, the liberal journalist reported all of this with delight.

<p>
The correspondent for <i>McNeil-Lehrer</i> drew the obvious conclusion:  If this division deepens, the chances of the new majority will be ended.  Real reform requires an enduring majority, a majority broadly-based and stable over time. 	

<p>
The warning signs are then apparent, and we can avoid the danger they portend only if we recover the foundation upon which all stable majorities in America must stand.  That foundation lies among the simple truths that were the basis of our country at the beginning.  When our nation stood upon that foundation, no one divided the "economic" from the "social"  issues, and no one fought about the difference between them.

<p>
These simple truths are the central principles of our country.  They address themselves to our status as human beings and citizens, and cover all of our rights and all of our duties. Conservatives should understand that these principles apply just as much and in the same way to the economic as to the social issues, and just as much to the protection of the family as to the defense of private property.  

<p>
These truths receive their finest expression in the Declaration of Independence, where they are described as certain "self evident truths."  They stem from something called "the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God."  What are these truths, and what are these laws?  They have a lot to do with common sense.  They tell us that we are free and equal citizens.  They tell us that we are on the one hand entitled to our liberty and on the other responsible for our own actions.

<p>
First of all, these principles provide the strongest foundation in history for what we now call "economic liberty."  The authors of the Declaration and of the Constitution assert this belief with simple eloquence.  Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1812 that "To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who...have not, exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it."  In the <i>Federalist</i>, James Madison writes that the "chief object of government" is to "protect the different and unequal faculties of acquiring property."

<p>
The right to property is then a sacred right, no less firmly established than the right to speak one's mind or worship God in one's own time and way.  The right to property gives a vital assurance that these other rights can be secured.

<p>
What do these principles say about the importance of moral behavior?  Consider the Virginia Bill of Rights and its assertion "That no free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles."  

<p>
A conservative movement built upon these ideas would then encourage moral behavior.  It would reform the welfare system for example, because it encourages young women to conceive children out of wedlock.  It would not tax more heavily those who are married than those who are not.  It should support the authority and responsibility of parents over children and the obligations of husband and wife.

<p>
A conservative movement united upon the ideas of the founding would also encourage religion.  George Washington affirmed the importance of religion during his farewell address when he said that "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports...reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."  

<p>
A conservative policy on religion would respect the freedom to practice any religion that encourages good citizenship.  It would not supplant the role of religious and other charities in social welfare.  It would encourage prayer in school and upon public occasions.

<p>
A conservative movement united under these policies would act under the principles of our founding.  It would adhere to the Constitution and those higher laws, the laws of nature and of nature's God, upon which that Constitution stands.  

<p>
Such a conservative unity can lead America from its troubles.  Such a unity can be built only by a people who know as well as Jefferson the meaning of their country, and who fight as bravely as Washington for its principles.

<title>Don Devine "PREPARING FOR THE TRAIN WRECK" -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>Preparing For The Train Wreck</h2>
<a href="/townhall/ACU/devine.html">Don Devine</a><br>
The Washington Times -- August 20, 1995
<hr>
</center>
<p>
All Washington is talking about the Fall "train wreck," when
government borrowing authority ends, and the Republican Congress
refuses to pay the bills unless their spending cuts and tax
decreases survive the President's veto. Readers of this space over
the past few months already know that President Bill Clinton has
long been playing the shrewder traffic-management game.
<p>
Top GOP engineer Newt Gingrich now concedes that two key
Contract With America priorities are dead for the year--the line
item veto for the president, and product-liability reforms to limit
the litigation explosion. Of the 21 Contract promises, only three
have become law and most others are in trouble or worse. Senate
Leader Bob Dole, too, has been forced to delay regulatory reform
after three attempts to force moderate Republicans into line. Each
of the 13 appropriations bills has tripped upon major fissures
between moderates and conservatives which, in turn, is exploited by
President Clinton saying this or that is "unfair."
<p>
On most bills, the GOP itself was enough to drive the 1994
revolution off track. Six hundred million additional dollars were
added to House housing appropriations, and a modest loosening of
environmental regulations survived only by a tie vote. The Senate
committee voted to add $815 million more. The House refused to cut
$1.6 billion from the space station. The WIC nutrition program was
increased $260 million. Senator Ted Stevens saved the expensive
helium-cooled graphite reactor. Even an appropriations rider to
eliminate a regulation that only unionized transit could receive
government subsidies--surely a no-brainer for a Republican House--lost 288 to 
186.
<p>
It was all foreseeable. For those interested in the future,
they only need to consult the Rescissions Bill. It was the first
appropriations law entirely the product of the GOP. It claimed $16
billion in cuts, all of which received due attacks in Congress and
from the President for unfairness to some group or other. Now,
seven weeks after President Clinton's veto, $733 million more in
spending demanded by him for education and training allowed him to
sign. But $7 billion was also added for new projects, so total
spending was reduced only $9 billion.
<p>
The Republicans could claim credit for cutting spending. Bill
Clinton could crow: "This is how we should work together. We agree
we should balance the budget. We disagree on how. But this shows we
can work together." The GOP took months of criticism for being
unfair to children, the poor, the ill, infirm, old, women and the
environment, among others. Then the President restored the "unfair"
cuts and it all turned out ok. It is no coincidence the President's
standing in the polls improved. As predicted here, his strategy is
to concede the Republican agenda to balance the budget, even the
necessity for spending cuts; but to argue that a Democratic
president is necessary to assure the cuts are not too extreme.
<p>
Each chamber of Congress has thirteen appropriations bills
scheduled to pass through the same process before the train wreck
of the Reconciliation Bill. The president or his representatives
have already threatened to veto seven. At this rate, presidential
approval may hit the 60 percent mark. It already hit 50 percent,
and showed Bill Clinton defeating any Republican, even with Jesse
Jackson in the race. It is time to question whose train will wreck.
The conventional wisdom is that Mr. Clinton does not have Ronald
Reagan's stomach for a fight that would shut down the government.
The rescissions example suggests he does not have to have much
intestinal fortitude to claim he made things "better."
<p>
The other possibility is for the GOP to stop playing Snively
Whiplash to Mr. Clinton's Dudley DoRight. The first thing that
needs to be done is to stop the appropriations locomotives in their
tracks. The Democrats did the last time. Why take multiple hits for
every small change over the next few months? Why focus the media on
each appropriations bill in sequence as each reaches the floor for
its own vote and own time on nightly TV, "unfairness" horror
stories and all? Better the confusion of 26 bills moving at the
same time and not converging until the Reconciliation Bill itself.
Then throw Medicaid and Medicare into the mix too, with only modest
changes before 1997. Take the heat and glory together. If there is
going to be a train wreck, why not make it a big one?
<p>
What should the Republicans in Congress be doing in the
meantime? They should raise a "fairness" issue of their own. Before
his major policy speech on affirmative action, White House
officials told the Washington Times that President Clinton would
"insist, as have a generation of politicians, that quotas are not
the same as setting 'goals and timetables' to assist minorities in
hiring and promotion." The "goal" is to make "as few changes as
possible." As the speech showed, Mr. Clinton says "mend it, don't
end it," but retains the same goals and timetables--and still
insists they are not quotas. In other words, the same unfairness of
quotas remains national policy. The Republicans should accept the
challenge. These programs exist in enough different forms and in so
many agencies that hearings could be held in almost every committee
of Congress, to discuss the issue of fairness fully, in a manner
the media could not ignore.
<p>
Jesse Jackson could do his part to lead the national debate on
fairness in employment. There is a project sponsored by the U.S.
Conference of Mayors called CityVote that will be an informal
"primary" for presidential candidates to give "disenfranchised
urban dwellers a real voice in the process," according to Mayor
Larry Agran. It will be held November 7, a full 100 days before the
New Hampshire primary. What better forum for Mr. Jackson to debate
the issue with Mr. Clinton, and have the possibility of winning the
following test vote? With a poll showing the President could win
with Mr. Jackson in the race as a third party candidate, this turns
from a partisan to a classic issues debate. Rather than speculate
about train wrecks, we could have a real national debate on the
very fundamental issue, what is fairness in employment?

Bruce Herschensohn has been a television and radio political commentator 
for the last two decades.  After service in the U.S. Air Force he began his own motion picture 
company and then was appointed Director of Motion Pictures and TV for the United States 
Information Agency.  During his tenure the USIA received more awards for films and television 
productions than all other departments and agencies of the U.S. Government combined, 
including the Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.  

<p>

In 1969 he was selected as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men in the Federal Government.  He received the second highest civilian award, the Distinguished Service Medal, and then became Deputy 
Special Assistant to President Nixon.  His travels to over ninety countries gave him unique 
insight of world-wide political affairs.

<p>

Herschensohn taught "The U.S. Image Abroad" at the University of Maryland, and occupied the Nixon Chair at Whittier College teaching "U.S. Foreign and Domestic Policy."  He was Chairman of the Board of Pepperdine University, and was appointed a member of the Reagan Transition Team.  He was the 1992 Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in California and was defeated while winning over one million votes more 
than the national ticket of the Party. 

<p>

He is now a Claremont Institute Distinguished Fellow, and the author of numerous articles on politics and public policy, and the recently released book, <i>Lost Trumpets</i> (Claremont Institute Press, 1994).

   <H1><i>United States v. Lopez</i></H1>
   <h2>Restoring a Constitutionally Limited Government</h2>
   <H3>By Edward J. Erler</H3>

</center>

<p>
For the first time in more than sixty years, the Supreme Court has put restrictions on Congress' 
use of the Commerce Clause.  Under the Constitution, Congress is delegated the exclusive power 
to regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the states.  Since the New Deal 
revolution, the Supreme Court has allowed Congress to regulate those purely state and local 
matters that substantially affect commerce between states either directly or indirectly.  


<p>
Accordingly, in <i>Wickard v. Filburn</i> (1942) the Court upheld a fine assessed against a farmer who 
planted 12 acres of wheat in excess of the allotment permitted under the federal Agricultural 
Adjustment Act of 1938, even though the excess wheat was used only for private consumption.  
As the Court noted, the wheat supplied a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be 
fulfilled by purchases in the open market.  Homegrown wheat in this sense competes with wheat 
in commerce.  


<p>
In the intervening years, the Court has routinely deferred to the judgment of Congress whether 
the regulated activity, although on its face not obviously related to interstate commerce, 
nonetheless substantially affected interstate commerce.  The result has been a tremendous 
expansion of centralized federal power over the states.  


<p>
The Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Lopez</i> signals that Congress may no 
longer have unlimited discretion to expand its power under the Commerce Clause.


<p>
At issue in <i>Lopez</i> was a challenge to the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a 
federal offense for any individual to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows is a 
school zone.  Almost all states have laws prohibiting guns in or near schools, and in the Lopez 
case a state indictment was dismissed in order for federal charges to be brought.  


<p>
Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for a 5-4 majority, declared the act unconstitutional because it 
neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be 
connected in any way to interstate commerce.  In oral argument, the government maintained that 
the presence of guns in schools so disrupts the quality of education that economic activities are 
affected.  Future citizens will be less educated and consequently less productive; the cumulative 
affect on the nation's economic well being will thus be  substantial.


<p>
The danger of accepting such a weak causal argument was pointed out by the Chief Justice.  It 
would allow Congress to regulate <i>any</i> activity that it found was related to the economic 
productivity of individual citizens; including family law (marriage, divorce, and child custody).  
Indeed, the Chief Justice rightly concluded that under the Government's theory it would be 
difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law 
enforcement or education where states historically have been sovereign.


<p>
The appropriate constitutional argument was detailed in Justice Thomas' incisive concurring 
opinion.  Thomas noted that in adopting the substantial affects test the Court has drifted far from 
the original understanding of the Commerce Clause.  Indeed, taken to its logical extreme, the 
substantial affects test would give Congress police power over all aspects of American life.  


<p>
Thomas notes that the Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence comes close to turning the Tenth 
Amendment on its head.  The Tenth Amendment generally reserves the powers not delegated to 
the federal government to the states or to the people.  This is a confirmation of the fact that the 
Federal Government is limited to the exercise of constitutionally delegated powers or to those 
that are reasonably inferred to be a necessary and proper exercise of delegated powers.  


<p>
As Thomas rightly points out, the Commerce Clause that emerged from the New Deal revolution 
allows Congress to exercise all powers not specifically prohibited, thus reversing the federal 
relationship contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution.  The New Deal interpretation of 
the Commerce Clause was explicitly calculated to allow the federal government to extend and 
magnify the reach of its regulatory powers.  


<p>
<i>Lopez</i> is a welcome reevaluation of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause, and it may 
well presage the beginning of a series of decisions that will reestablish the federal relationship as 
envisioned by the Framers.  The threat posed to the administrative state by the Court's decision 
may be gauged by President Clinton's frantic reaction.  Not only has the President severely 
criticized the <i>Lopez</i> decision, but he has also ordered the Attorney General to find a way around 
the ruling!

<P>	 <B>CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND - The 20th Century has witnessed an unprecedented
expansion of scientific knowledge. It has also seen episodes of human- rights
abuse unparalleled both in magnitude and cruelty.</B><BR>
<BR>
	 Even as the double-helix discovery, the quantum theory and the development
of a polio vaccine have manifested some of man's most ennobling capabilities,
the gulags and gas chambers have demonstrated with equal force that scientific
prowess alone does not confirm the existence of civilization--if civilization
is to be measured by a commitment to protecting human rights.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Indeed, in a great many places during the 20th Century, human rights have
been an imperiled commodity. Yet in every situation, the protections accorded
human rights have reflected what cultures and governments think about the
value and dignity of man. The scientific disciplines, which have increasingly
helped to define our century's view of mankind, have indirectly played an
important role in the discussion of human rights, precisely because man's
idea of man ultimately decides the respect such rights receive.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Human rights might be defined as the legal and political manifestation
of a culture's perception of human dignity. Yet cultures do not create human
dignity any more than governments create human rights; at best, societies
will acknowledge dignity by preserving rights. Former Harvard law professor
Harold J. Berman has detected this assumption at the heart of American constitutionalism.
In the United States, he notes, &quot;the fundamental rights of individual
persons exist independently of the state.&quot; Under Soviet Marxism, by
contrast, &quot;all rights are granted by the state and are inevitably subordinate
to (its) power.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
	 But which way should it be? Do human rights have validity apart from government
decree or are they merely granted by it?  <BR>
<BR>
	 In the Western tradition, human rights have been said to exist independently
of the state because they have been based upon human dignity. The American
Bill of Rights, for example, offers what Supreme Court Justice William J.
Brennan Jr. has called &quot;a sublime oration on the dignity of man.&quot;
The word dignity comes from the Latin dignitas, meaning &quot;glory.&quot;
Historically, Western society has derived its belief in the dignity of man
from its Judeo-Christian belief that man is the glory of God, made in his
image. According to this view, human rights depend upon the Creator who
made man with dignity, not upon the state. In the American formulation,
&quot;men . . . are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.&quot;
 <BR>
<BR>
	 Many educated citizens in the West, however, have abandoned the traditional
view of man and replaced it with a more contemporary scientific view--one
that promulgates a less exalted view of man. In purely material, scientific
terms, human beings are insignificant oddities cast up by chance in an immense
and impersonal universe. As British philosopher Bertrand Russell concluded,
&quot;Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they
were achieving&quot; and which, in turn, predestine him &quot;to extinction
in the vast death of the solar system.&quot; Such pessimism has persisted
despite the spectacular advances that have occurred in science during the
20th Century. Though Einsteinian and quantum concepts have revolutionized
accepted ideas of matter, space and time, science has discovered nothing
to elevate the modern view of man. In this modern scientific view, only
man's material complexity distinguishes him from the other biological structures
that inhabit the universe.  <BR>
<BR>
	 This loss of what is distinctively human will in time require either promoting
animals to the human estate, or more likely, relegating man to the level
of animals. UC Berkeley biologist Thomas H. Jukes has declared that in a
few years we will hear of &quot;the rights of bacteria,&quot; since all
that differentiates bacteria from humanity is a &quot;disparity in the length
and sequence of DNA molecules.&quot;  <BR>
	 Such predictions are not merely theoretical. Dolphin experiments prompted
John Lilly to say that &quot;the day that communication is established the
(dolphin) becomes a legal, ethical, moral and social problem.&quot; The
dolphin will have qualified for &quot;human rights.&quot; A court case in
California about a great ape that learned sign language further illustrates
the point. With research funds exhausted, the ape's teachers claimed that
because the ape had learned language, it qualified for legal protection
and that to return it to the zoo would be &quot;dehumanizing.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
	 While some researchers have &quot;personified&quot; their apes, others
have mechanized their concept of man. One Carnegie-Mellon robotics researcher
has suggested that those who deny the &quot;consciousness&quot; of his mobile
robots display a gross chauvinism in favor of their own form of mental machinery.
A conference at Yale last year on artificial intelligence produced several
informal discussions about the problem of defining the political rights
of &quot;thinking&quot; machines. In his widely read article in Science,
&quot;The New Biology: What Price Relieving Man's Estate?&quot; Leon R.
Kass of the University of Chicago wrote &quot;we are witnessing the erosion,
perhaps the final erosion, of the idea of man as something splendid or divine,
and its replacement with a view that sees man, no less than nature, as simply
more raw material for manipulation and homogenization. Hence our peculiar
moral crisis.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
	 In the face of this situation, Western nations have signed the U.N. Declaration
of Human Rights. Most all still abide by its provisions. Without the concept
of &quot;the distinctively human,&quot; however, governments are inevitably
playing a global game of &quot;let's pretend.&quot; The most impassioned
appeals for human rights by politicians and scientists will mean nothing
if they have abandoned belief in the distinctive dignity of man. Without
this conviction there is no logical ground for supporting human rights in
the West or in the Soviet Union; there is no logical ground for human rights
at all. In such a context, those who advocate human rights practice species
chauvinism.  <BR>
<BR>
	 In response to such absurd but seemingly inescapable conclusions, some
have hoped that merely reiterating the Judeo-Christian doctrine of creation
will restore the grounds for preserving human dignity. But no doctrine can
give man dignity, let alone one that is no longer believed. No &quot;useful
fiction&quot; can rescue man from his current moral dilemma; for fictions
remain useful only as long as they are not regarded as such. Even so, Judaism
and Christianity do not teach that the doctrine of man's creation in the
Divine image establishes his dignity. They teach that the fact of man's
creation has established human dignity. Only if man is (in fact) a product
of special Divine purposes can his claim to distinctive or intrinsic dignity
be sustained. Indeed, if dignity is built into man by his Creator, then
certain rights are &quot;inalienable.&quot; Moreover it follows that if
man's dignity is a fact of his origin, human rights are independent of his
religious or philosophical convictions, just as they are independent of
the state. In short, if the traditional view of man's origin is correct,
people have human rights whether they believe they do or not.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Voltaire said that madness is to have erroneous perceptions and to reason
correctly from them. Historically, from the standpoint of human rights,
madness has prevailed in the Eastern Bloc under Soviet domination. Moreover,
the Soviet madness adheres to the pattern Voltaire described: Soviet indifference
to human rights is reasoned correctly from an erroneous perception of man
called Marxism--a materialist perception that Karl Marx himself held to
be scientific.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Yet we in the West with our own scientific view of man have created a
curious situation. The orthodoxy of Judaism and Christianity contends that
man has dignity because he has been created in the image of God. If the
orthodox view is false, as is now widely assumed in the academic and legal
professions, then one wonders how long it will be until we in the West reason
correctly from a strictly scientific perception of human nature.  <BR>
	 As renewed Soviet-American dialogue again raises the question of human
rights, we might well remember that neither the edifice of Western technical
sophistication nor the &quot;science&quot; of Marx can provide any firm
ground for asserting these rights. Instead, productive proclamations of
human rights depend upon a shared conviction that man's dignity is inherent--safe
from any political expedient--as our Western religious heritage once asserted.
 <BR>
<BR>
	 Public, and especially political, references to this heritage can doubtless
offend the sensibilities of a secular age. Yet if the traditional understanding
of man is correct, if it is not only doctrinal but factual, then governments
can derive human rights from a dignity that actually exists. But if the
traditional view is false and the modern scientific view prevails, then
there is no dignity and human rights are a delusion, not only in Moscow
but here in the West as well.<BR>

<h2>Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 [PUHCA]</h2><br>
<h3>Before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance
and Subcommittee on Energy and Power Committee on Commerce</h3>
</center>
<b>Statement of Thomas M. Lenard<br>
Senior Fellow and Director of Regulatory Studies, The Progress & Freedom Foundation</b><p>
August 4, 1995
<p>
<br>
The Security and Exchange Commissions report, The Regulation of
Public-Utility Holding Companies, describes a depression-era regulatory
program enacted under vastly different circumstances than exist today.  In
the current marketplace, the benefits from PUHCA are not sufficient to
outweigh the potentially substantial costs.
<p>
Increases in competition in both the electric and gas markets diminish the
need for regulation in general.  But even in the absence of these competitive
pressures, the pervasiveness of other regulatory programs makes the PUHCA
requirements duplicative and unnecessary.  If unchanged, PUHCA will be a
significant impediment to the competitive restructuring of the electric
utility industry in the future.  For the gas industry, which has to a large
extent already been restructured, the PUHCA restrictions may be even more
burdensome
<p>
The social costs of PUHCA restrictions are estimated to be between $3 and
$12.6 billion in present value terms.  The major sources of these costs are
the Acts geographic restrictions on mergers, and its limitations on
diversification into non-utility lines of business.
<p>
Because of these costs, the case for unconditional PUHCA repeal seems
compelling.  There is currently ample regulatory authority without PUHCA to
protect consumers of electricity and natural gas.  At the same time, these
markets are growing more competitive, diminishing the need for regulation. 
<p>
<b> Statement of Thomas M. Lenard</b>
<p>
Chairman Fields, Chairman Schaefer and Members of the Subcommittees.  It is
pleasure have this opportunity to discuss the recent Security and Exchange
Commission (SEC) report on the regulation of public utility holding companies
 and the merits of various options for modifying or repealing the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA).
<p>
This issue is of great interest to us, in part because The Progress &
Freedom Foundation is in the process of assembling a team of scholars who
will undertake a major project on The Future of Energy Transmission.  The
purpose of this project is to develop an operational model that will provide
the legal structure necessary for a more competitive electricity market,
including a policy agenda aimed at eliminating artificial constraints on the
structure, scope and activities of electric power producers.  While
additional analysis on the promotion of competition may be developed during
the course of our project, enough is known now to conclude that retention of
PUHCA is not in the public interest.  The economic costs of the restrictions
PUHCA imposes on electric and gas holding company activities will only grow
larger as competition increases in this sector of our economy.  Competitive
forces will require market participants to adapt in 
 unpredictable ways.  If unchanged, PUHCA will be a significant impediment to
the competitive restructuring of the electric utility industry in the future.
 For the gas industry, which has to a large extent already been restructured,
the PUHCA restrictions may be even more burdensome. 
<p>
PUHCAs relevance extends to the rapid changes occurring in
telecommunications, an area on which we also have been working.   The
electric utility industry has a large and growing network of fiber optic
cable and appears to be well positioned to compete in telecommunications
markets.  Under PUHCA, however, the participation in these markets by
registered holding companies would be severely limited.   
<p>
The Division of Investment Management of the SEC should be commended for
producing a very informative report on PUHCA and I agree generally with its
conclusions.  The report describes a depression-era regulatory program
enacted under vastly different circumstances than exist today.  In the
current marketplace, the benefits from PUHCA are not sufficient to outweigh
the potentially substantial costs.
<p>
PUHCA was enacted in order to address a public-utility holding company
structure believed to concentrate control of vast utility empires in a few
hands, which led to deception of investors, excessive rates for consumers,
and obstruction of state utility regulation.   In order to address these
purported problems, the Act required the integration and simplification of
holding company systems into single integrated public-utility systems, a
process largely completed by 1952.  Currently, registered holding companies
require SEC approval to issue or sell securities, acquire utility or
nonutility assets, sell utility assets or enter into service arrangements
with sister companies.  
<p>
Both the structure of the utility industry itself and the other regulatory
programs to which it is subject have changed dramatically since 1935.  At the
time PUHCA was enacted, its rules applied to over 200 registered utility
companies, a large share of the utility industry.   In 1932, for example,
three holding companies accounted for about half of the investor-owned
electric utility market.  Today, only 14 active holding companies remain
registered under the Act.  The 11 registered electric utility holding
companies account for about 20 percent of investor-owned utility retail
electricity sales.  Most of the largest electric utilities and most of the
gas industry are not regulated under the Act, leading to a system that
arbitrarily imposes a stringent set of regulatory requirements on a small
subset of industry for no apparent economic reason.    
 <p>
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in competition in
both the electric and gas markets and this diminishes the need for regulation
in general.  But even in the absence of these competitive pressures, the
pervasiveness of other regulatory programs makes the PUHCA requirements
duplicative and unnecessary:
<p>
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is responsible for
regulating rates for the interstate wholesale electricity and natural gas
markets.   FERC also has the authority to review in advance mergers and
securities issuances.  As part of its regulatory functions, FERC collects
detailed financial information and has established uniform systems of
accounts to which regulated utilities must adhere. 
<p>
State regulators also have expanded their authority over both electric and
gas utilities.   States regulate securities issuances, acquisition and
diversification activities and prescribe uniform systems of accounts for
regulatory purposes.
<p>
The SEC itself regulates public-utility holding companies as it does all
other issuers of securities, requiring disclosure of comprehensive financial
data in a standardized form. 
<p>
The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have the
authority to challenge utility mergers they deem to be anticompetitive.
<p>
Finally, and importantly, the market itself demands a level of disclosure
unheard of in the days when PUHCA was passed into law for any company that
wants to attract outside capital. 
<p>
The SEC Reports chapter on legislative recommendations goes into
considerable detail concerning why PUHCAs provisions are both unnecessary
and harmful.   A study by Carpenter and Graves estimated the social costs of
PUHCA restrictions to be between $3 and $12.6 billion in present value terms.
<p>
The major sources of these costs are the Acts geographic restrictions on
mergers with utilities in non-contiguous areas, which preclude the
realization of economies associated with overhead expenses and coordination
activities, and the Acts limitations on diversification into non-utility
lines of business. 
<p>    
 With respect to entrance into non-utility activities, Carpenter and Graves
stress the potential benefits of utility entry into cable TV and other
telecommunications services, pointing out that the electric utility industry
already has laid down 10,000 miles of fiber optic cable for its own data
transmission and other purposes, with the vast majority of this cable
capacity being unutilized and available for other purposes.  Many anticipate
that electric utilities will find significant efficiencies in having homes
wired for improved energy-use metering and applications such as real time
pricing of electricity.  In the event this takes place, utilities will
obviously be in a good position to utilize the same wires to offer
telecommunications services at very competitive prices.  Restrictions on the
offer of such services, through PUHCA or otherwise, would clearly be costly
to consumers.  This is only one example of the potential benefits of
diversification.
<p>
For all these reasons, the case for unconditional PUHCA repeal seems quite
compelling.  With respect to access to books and records, utilities generally
have the burden of proof in rate proceedings.  Therefore, as a practical
matter, even when a state commission does not have independent access to the
books and records of a utility affiliate, the utility will be required to
provide such records to the extent that they relate to the recovery of costs.
Similarly, the issue of the reasonableness of affiliate transactions can be
addressed by  FERC and the states through their normal ratemaking
authorities.  
<p>
There is currently ample regulatory authority without PUHCA to protect
consumers of electricity and natural gas.  At the same time, these markets
are growing more competitive, diminishing the need for regulation.  The costs
of retaining PUHCA can be quite significant in terms of foregone
opportunities for realization of economies through acquisition and
diversification and the ability of heavily regulated industries to adapt to a
more competitive environment.  Given the remaining regulatory protections and
the increasingly competitive environment, the risks of PUHCA repeal seem
small.  The SEC has been recommending PUHCA repeal, albeit in slightly
different forms, for over a decade.   It seems time for the Congress to act.

   <H1>How to Beat the Supreme Court on School Prayer</H1>
   <H3>By Harry V. Jaffa</H3>

</center>

"We are a religious people, whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."

<p>
There is no better way to confirm the truth of the foregoing aphorism of the late Justice William O. Douglas, 
than to take a tour through the state constitutions.  Forty-seven of the fifty states have preambles invoking the 
name of Almighty God.  A joint resolution of the Congress could declare that children in public schools might 
lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing only such acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is 
present in their own state constitution, or in the constitutions of any of the other states.  When this resolution is 
signed by the President--and it is difficult to imagine any reason to object to it--it could take effect 
immediately.  It is also difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court could take exception to such a resolution.  
To do so would not only put it in direct opposition to the elected branches of government, but also would 
require it, in effect, to declare the state constitutions unconstitutional!


<p>
Consider the perfectly nonsectarian piety embodied in the fundamental laws of the states:

<blockquote><i>We the people of Alabama, in order to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and to secure the blessing 
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and 
establish the following Constitution and form of government . . .</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>We the people of the State of California, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure and 
perpetuate its blessings, do establish this Constitution.</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The people of Connecticut, acknowledging with gratitude the good providence of God, in having permitted them 
to enjoy a free government . . .</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
This selection should be sufficient to illustrate the consistency in the patterns of all the preambles. Who could 
ask more in a school prayer than to acknowledge that it is through Divine Providence that we enjoy our civil 
and religious liberty, and that we reaffirm our faith in and constant reliance upon God to preserve and 
perpetuate it?


<p>
It is notable that the state constitutions have provisions equivalent to the "no establishment" and "free exercise" clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  One example that will suffice for present 
purposes is that of California:

<blockquote>
<i>Free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.  This liberty of conscience does not
excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State.  The legislature shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
From this it is apparent that the people of the states have seen no inconsistency between the guarantees of 
religious freedom in their constitutions, and the expressions of gratitude to God for the enjoyment of that 
freedom in the same constitutions.

<p>
American constitutions whether federal or state, rest ultimately upon the theology of the Declaration of 
Independence.  This fact has been obscured by the domination of a legal positivism which is simply unable to 
understand the relationship between natural and divine law on the one hand, and human law on the other.  Yet 
this relationship was axiomatic for our Founding Fathers.  If however we ask why we have an obligation--that 
is to say, a moral duty--to obey the laws, either of our State, or of the United States, there is only one answer.  
It is because those laws exist "to secure these rights," rights with which we have been "endowed by [our] 
Creator."  Constitutional governments have no other purpose but to render valuable rights whose origin is 
altogether independent of human will, rights which are unalienable because they are fixed eternally in "the laws 
of nature and of nature's God."  Through the ages many governments which did not respect the rights of the 
individual have claimed to be based upon the consent of the governed.  But the consent of the governed 
required by our republican constitutions is derived from the equal and unalienable rights of each human person.


<p>
Legal positivists deny to the Declaration any role in constitutional interpretation.  However, according to the 
United States Code, adopted by the Congress, it is the first of the Organic Laws of the United States.  That this 
is not merely formal or ceremonial is shown by the fact that every enabling act by the Congress for the 
admission of a State to the Union since the Civil War has had the following provision.  


<p>
<blockquote>
<i>The Constitution of the State of ______ shall always be republican in form and shall not be repugnant to the 
Constitution of the United States and the principles of the Declaration of Independence.</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
It can be seen that the rights secured to us by the human law, whether of the states or of the United States, are 
means of implementing antecedent rights whose origin is in a Supreme Being.  It is difficult to imagine how we 
can teach citizenship to future citizens, without inculcating in them an understanding of and a reverence for this 
origin.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/taxcut"><i>Why America Needs a Tax Cut</i></a></b>,   Foreword by Steve Forbes, edited by Angela M. Antonelli and Christianna L. Shortridge. (October, 1996) 
<p>
Lower taxes followed by sweeping tax reform is a recipe for renewal. This book should arm American taxpayers with the information they need to spread the word about the benefits of a pro-growth tax policy. 
  
<p> 
<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1091.html">Backgrounder #1091,</a> <i>The Case for Repealing the Estate Tax,</i></b> by William W. Beach (August 21, 1996)<p> 
   "Virtually from the beginning of government in human society, death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable. The passing of well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors. Most nations today impose death, estate, and inheritance taxes, and the United States is no exception." In this careful analysis of the short and long-term effects of estate taxes in the United States, Beach demonstrates the negative impact of such taxes from both an economic and a philisophically liberal position.  Warning that the apparently minor significance of the tax makes it easy and dangerous to overlook, Beach sees its repeal as a source of a better economy, more jobs, and higher wages. 
<p>
<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090.html">Backgrounder #1090,</a> <i>How to Measure the Revenue Impact of Changes in Tax Rates,</i></b> by Daniel J. Mitchell (August 9, 1996) <p>
One of the most important fiscal policy debates developing in the 1996 election involves the question of whether changes in tax policy have "supply-side" effects. In other words, will lower tax rates increase economic growth, resulting in more jobs, higher wages, and bigger profits?  Using decades of empirical evidence, Mitchell explains why government officials should take such economic variables into account when determining the budgetary effects of tax reductions.

Economic evidence proves that when tax rates are reduced, the economy prospers, tax revenues grow, and lower-income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden. Examining three decades--the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s--Mitchell shows how tax policy can affect the economy and the Treasury, and provides suggestions for changes to tax policies in the 1990s.

Comparing the two dominant schools of thought on the causes of economic growth, Mitchell examines whether a balanced budget or a lower tax rate will achieve greater economic response. The lecture analyzes the impact of a flat tax on economic growth and investment.

This report examines the effects of the 1993 federal budget plan, and uses an economic model to measure the "Clinton Crunch," a combination of higher tax rates and lower real wages. The study shows how the Clinton economic plan resulted in slower growth as compared with previous economic expansions.

Government taxation and spending have reached intrusive levels in our economy and personal lives. The best way to solve the problem, the panelists argue, is to enact a flat tax that reduces the tax burden on workers and businesses, while restricting Congress's ability to take money out of the economy. Additionally, by limiting government spending and enacting laws requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote to raise taxes, Congress would go a long way toward alleviating the fiscal burden the federal government places on citizens.

<p>
A widely quoted analysis of the economic effects of the flat tax on housing prices shows a 15% drop in housing values. That study's methodology, however, is seriously flawed. This Heritage econometric analysis shows a 7% to 14 % increase in home values.

<title>Telecommunications: More Computing than Communications -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h1>Telecommunications: More Computing than Communications</h1>

<b>By <a href="people/director.html#Keyworth">G. A. (Jay) Keyworth, II</a></b>

<P>
The challenge that we are addressing is no less than how to best succeed,
as a nation, in the transition from what Alvin and Heidi Toffler describe
as going from the second wave industrial age to the "third wave" knowledge
age -- a transition in which we are already, irreversibly immersed. The
objectives we emphasize are enhancing economic growth and empowering
individuals.
<P>
Yet, as I delve into the rich media treatment of telecommunications policy
and the information superhighway, I am often left with the impression that
breaking the local access monopoly in voice telephony and adding a few
hundred more cable channels will somehow, inexplicably, lead us to a better
world. The problem is that the metaphor telecommunications is strong in
terms of communications, which only weakly signifies the magnitude of the
issue, but which, in turn, is weak in terms of computing, the term that far
better describes the pathway to those twin objectives -- enhancing economic
growth and empowering individuals.
<P>
From an overarching technology perspective, what we all want to accomplish
is the conversion of today's outmoded, analog communications
infrastructure, designed for voice communications, to a broader-band,
digital one, designed to connect all kinds of computers. Whether labeled
PC's, digital-TV's, digital phones, digital appliances, faxes or whatever,
they are all digital devices whose enabling "brain" is a computer.
<P>
Information is, of course, the item of value, while communications is the
means to move it and computing is the means to make it useful. Taken
together they comprise cyberspace, the environment of the information age.
<P>
Although perhaps powerful in content, this perspective lacks that one
element so essential to human communication -- analogy with things that
comprise real-world experience. But it need not be so. While the world of
ubiquitous digital connectivity is relatively new, with the Internet as its
precursor, the world of pervasive computing is already here, with hackers
as its first-generation of offspring. From the PC revolution we learned a
lot about those two objectives -- economic growth and individual
empowerment -- more than we sometimes realize, and most of it is applicable
directly to how we view telecommunications policy.
<P>
In fact, converting the existing, analog telecommunications infrastructure
to digital is largely an extension of the revolution that began in
computing a generation ago. Manifested in more than one hundred million PCs
in just the United States alone, and having already spread to a third of
our homes, that revolution is now straining at its analog bonds, crying out
to be "connected." To calibrate the term "pervasive," or rather the pace of
that term, in referring to the PC revolution, it is noteworthy that it took
four times longer to reach the same proportion of homes with telephones,
even with the stimulus of mandated universal service.
<P>
The race for leadership in computing, concern over which was largely
responsible in the 1980s for making the word competitiveness part of our
daily lexicon, is, for the moment, over. And we Americans won that race. No
"Fifth Generation Computer Project" in Japan nor "Eureka" program in Europe
affected the outcome, at least not as was intended. Although hotly
contested, we won that race "fair and square," simply by providing the
value customers wanted, and at an affordable price. And not least, we won
by being a nation of people quick to adapt to new technology. As a result,
the U.S. computer industry experienced complete restructuring, capped with
upstart Microsoft's market valuation surpassing IBM's. This kind of
wholesale change is not without disruption, but it did occur without
intervention by government, and few view the change as anything but
beneficial to the nation.
<P>
The computer industry is the first "third wave" segment of our economy, and
we weathered this step of the transition well. If our goal is to create
another with the telecommunications segment, then we need to take heed from
the lessons of the computer industry's success. Nowhere else in today's
world is there a better example of how to enhance economic growth, or to
empower individuals. Yet, at the same time, while the example needs to be
viewed as a model for how digital communications, very much the extension
of computing, can flourish, it also need to be viewed as an equally valid
example of how difficult, and dangerous, it can be to try to predict
progress. Looking for people who even vaguely foresaw what has taken place
in the PC revolution is like looking for Sovietologists who predicted the
collapse of the Soviet Empire. What we can say, however, is that America
did something right.
<P>
At The Progress & Freedom Foundation, we believe America's future success
depends on replicating the success of the American computer industry
throughout the telecommunications and information industries.
<P>
Our strategy to help make this happen is a threefold one: First, it is to
develop, promote and win broad agreement on the principles that should
govern society's telecommunications and information frontier, drawing
heavily on lessons from the successes of the computer industry. Second, it
is to develop and promote a public policy agenda to replace the current
regulatory regime with a lean, clean and effective framework of law and
property rights.
<P>
Third, it is to build a coalition that crosses traditional party and
ideological lines to further our vision.
<P>
The projects that are underway to implement this strategy include keeping
current our existing document "Cyberspace and the American Dream: A Magna
Carta for the Knowledge Age." While based initially on the views of four
authors -- Esther Dyson, George Gilder, Alvin Toffler and myself -- it is a
"living" document, expanding to reflect the views of countless others,
aided by the Internet. It seeks to redefine for the Knowledge Age the
meaning of freedom, structure of self-government, definition of "property,"
nature of "competition," conditions for "cooperation," sense of community
and the nature of "progress."
<P>
Derived from the Magna Carta, we will issue a "Statement of Principles" for
the governance of this new frontier. A series of monographs designed to
enhance public understanding of the task before us, beginning with Alvin
and Heidi Toffler's "Politics of the Third Wave" is underway. We have begun
a project, called "Portal 96," to define a new legal environment for the
electronic frontier. This will be put forth as guidelines to replace the
current regulatory regime with means to enable to the telecommunications
and information industries to replicate the computer industry's success.
<P>
We are preparing, this year, four topical papers, each focused on an issue
that is timely and critical to telecommunications policy. The first will
address reducing barriers to new entrants in providing local access,
something computer industry experience has shown to be even more important
than balancing current contenders. Another will focus on property and
privacy issues, to be done in collaboration with the Center for Democracy
and Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. A third will seek to
place in the context of today those two concepts so central in the history
of telephony -- universal service and common carriage. Finally, the fourth
paper will focus on trends in technology and the implications for
telecommunications policy. The purpose of this more technical paper will be
to point out the need for a fundamental reevaluation of many of the basic
premises that underlay the debate over telecommunications policy. One
example is the potential obsolescence of the idea of spectrum scarcity, in
light of spectrum sharing being enabled by spread-spectrum radio
technology.
<P>
Common to all of these projects will be an effort to expand our reach -- to
gain access to the widest possible range of knowledge, while preserving our
central vision.
<P>
We view our role as one that is more strategic than tactical, where we
emphasize the development of sound principles and deep understanding to
support the writing of laws and regulations. Our objective remains to make
the path that we have, irreversibly, embarked on a better one. We view,
with interest, ongoing legislative efforts to bring current law and
regulations into the "third wave," and we recognize the process to
accomplish that will comprise many steps. While as impatient as any of you,
we're committed to staying the course and to making a difference.
<P>

An Article By Gracie S. Hsu

<p>

Since joining the Family Research Council in September 1993, Gracie 
Hsu's research skills -- honed at the Johns Hopkins University -- 
have served as an asset to the work of the pro-family advocacy group's 
policy department.  In her current position as policy analyst, she is 
responsible for managing the Family Research Council's efforts in the 
fields of adolescent sexuality and life issues.  As part of FRC's 
outreach to the academic, media and legislative arenas, Miss Hsu's 
work consists of tracking, analyzing, and writing critical essays on 
new research, policy trends, and legislative initiatives concerning 
teen sexuality and abortion issues. She also represents FRC, 
explaining pro-family policy to audiences from capitol hill to the 
<i>CBS Evening News</i>. Her craftsmanship with the written word is 
a special skill she brings to FRC. As an op-ed writer, Miss Hsu 
(pronounced "Shoe") has been published in the <I>San Diego Union 
Tribune, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Orange County Register</I>, and 
other leading publications.

<p>

Miss Hsu began her work at the Family Research Council as a research 
assistant for health policy issues during the crucial first phases of 
health care reform.  Her project opposing abortion in health care 
reform contributed to U.S. Senate hearings on the subject. Prior to 
joining the Family Research Council, her research experience included 
work at Johns Hopkins on health issues and at the University of 
California at Los Angeles in a study of urban poverty.

<p>

Work in adolescent issues is also a task to which Miss Hsu comes 
well-prepared.  She served as a student health advocate under the 
University of California's Department of Student Health Services 
from 1990-1991, advising her peers on an individual basis regarding 
their various emotional and physical health concerns.  She also 
gained experience by participating in California's Watts Public 
Library Literacy Program, in which she worked as a tutor for inner 
city youth.

<p>

Miss Hsu graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with College Honors from 
the University of California at Los Angeles, receiving a Bachelor 
of Arts degree in English.  She went on to graduate <I>summa cum 
laude</I> with a Masters of Health Sciences degree from the Johns 
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore, 
Maryland.

The year was 1951, and England was embroiled in a bitter general election
campaign. Six years earlier the Conservative Party of Winston Churchill
had been thrown out of power. Now the same party, still led by the same
indomitable Churchill, was attempting a comeback. The conventional wisdom
was that the attempt would fail. The conventional wisdom was wrong. Voters
went to the polls on October 25, and the next morning the whole world knew
that the the Conservative Party had recaptured control of Parliament and
Churchill had regained the post of Prime Minister. <BR>
<BR>
Within a few weeks of the change of power, Churchill's office sent a letter
to C. S. Lewis, inviting him to receive the honorary title &quot;Commander
of the British Empire.&quot; One can only guess what Lewis thought when
he first read the letter, but one suspects that he appreciated it, for he
greatly admired Churchill.<SUP>1 <BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Despite his admiration, however, Lewis declined the proposed honor. He wrote
back to Churchill's secretary that he was grateful for the recognition,
but he worried about the political repercussions: &quot;There are always&#133;
knaves who say, and fools who believe, that my religious writings are all
covert anti--Leftist propaganda, and my appearance in the Honours List wd.
of course strengthen their hands. It is therefore better that I shd. not
appear there.&quot;<SUP>2</SUP> The letter is characteristic of Lewis, for
it shows how diligently he tried to steer clear of partisan entanglements.
He was never a party hack like John Milton; he never founded a political
movement like G.K. Chesterton and Hillaire Belloc; he even shunned giving
money to political causes. Prior to World War II, one of Lewis's students
informed him of his work on behalf of the Communist--backed loyalists in
the Spanish Civil War. Lewis quickly told the student that he had a rule
about not donating money &quot;to anything that had a directly political
implication.&quot;<SUP>3</SUP> After the War, Lewis continued to keep his
distance from politics. According to stepson David Gresham, Lewis was skeptical
of politicians and not really interested in current events.<SUP>4</SUP>
Lewis's own writings seem to bear this out. His wry poem &quot;Lines During
a General Election&quot; presents the following rather bleak assessment
of politicians: &quot;Their threats are terrible enough, but we could bear/
All that; it is their promises that bring despair.&quot;<SUP>5</SUP> And
as far as caring about the &quot;great issues&quot; of his day, Lewis wrote
his brother in 1940: &quot;Lord! how I loathe great issues&#133;'Dynamic'
I think is one of the words invented by this age which sums up what it likes
and I abominate. Could one start a Stagnation Party--which at General Elections
would boast that during its term of office no event of the least importance
had taken place?&quot;<SUP>6</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Paradoxically, none of this means that Lewis never said anything important
about politics. In fact, he said a great deal--more than most people probably
realize. It is startling to note just how many political topics Lewis broached
in his writings: crime, obscenity, capital punishment, conscription, communism,
fascism, socialism, war, vivisection, the welfare state, the atomic bomb.<SUP>7</SUP>
When Lewis talked about these matters, however, it was not in the way most
politicians do. He was wholly unconcerned with what political scientists
today like to call &quot;public policy&quot;--that conglomeration of compromise,
convention, and self--interest that forms the staple of much of our own
political diet. If you expect to find a prescription for solving air pollution
or advice on how to win an election, don't bother reading Lewis. He has
nothing to tell you. His concern was not policy but principle; political
problems of the day were interesting to him only insofar as they involved
matters that endured. Looked at in this light, Lewis's penchant for writing
about politics and his simultaneous detachment from the political arena
seem perfectly explicable. It is precisely because Lewis was so uninterested
in ordinary political affairs that he has so much to tell us about politics
in the broad sense of the term. By avoiding the partisan strife of his own
time, he was able to articulate enduring political standards for all time.
<BR>
<BR>
Nowhere is this clearer than in Lewis's writings on tyranny and morality.
<BR>
<BR>
Fascism and communism were the two most obvious manifestations of tyranny
about which Lewis wrote, but they were far from the only kinds of tyranny
about which he was concerned.<SUP>8</SUP> Tyranny comes in many forms, most
of which are more subtle than Stalin's gulag or Hitler's death camps. Lewis
knew this, and his most compelling writings on tyranny for us today focus
on these more subtle forms of oppression. In particular, Lewis was concerned
about the tyranny that could result from the union of modern science and
the modern state. <BR>
<BR>
To understand the dangers of a scientific state, one must first understand
something about modern science. <BR>
<BR>
Modern science is premised on the notion that all things are determined
by material causes. It proposes strict laws that explain natural phenomena
in terms of physical, environmental or hereditary necessities--e.g., the
ball falls when dropped because of the law of gravity; the dog salivates
at the sound of the bell because of environmental conditioning; the mosquito
generates other mosquitoes because of its genetic code. Now no matter how
necessary such materialistic determinism may be in the study of the natural
world, it cannot be applied indiscriminately to humans without destroying
the very possibility of knowledge and virtue. Such determinism destroys
the possibility of knowledge, according to Lewis, because it undermines
the validity of human reasoning;<SUP>9</SUP> it destroys the possibility
of virtue because it denies the free choice upon which all virtue depends.
<BR>
<BR>
If modern science is correct that human thought and conduct are functions
of non--rational causes, then the nature of politics changes fundamentally.
Under the old order, politics involved serious reflection about justice
and the common good. But the more man thinks he is determined by non--rational
causes, the less important serious reflection becomes. Under the new order,
all that matters is achieving the end result. The only deliberation is among
social science bureaucrats, and the only question is not &quot;What is just?&quot;
but &quot;What works?&quot; Moreover, since the new order has dispensed
with the notion of man as a moral agent, &quot;what works&quot; will almost
inevitably be intrusive. As long as man was regarded as accountable for
his actions, there were certain limits beyond which the state was not supposed
to tread. Laws promulgated under the old system promised punishment, but
they could not compel obedience. This is because the very idea of punishment
presupposes free choice: One can only be punished after one has done something
meriting punishment. If a person is willing to face the consequences of
his actions, he can still break the law. His ability to choose is left intact.
<BR>
<BR>
If people act because of environmental and biological necessities, however,
the government no longer need deal with them as free moral agents. Under
the new system, preemption replaces punishment as the preferred method of
social control. Instead of punishing you for making the wrong choice, the
state simply eliminates your choice. So instead of laws telling us to wear
seat--belts, we have passive restraints that automatically strap us into
our car seats. Instead of simply being told to pay our taxes, our taxes
are automatically deducted from our paychecks. <BR>
<BR>
In this brave new world, the relationship between citizen and state begins
to resemble the relationship between master and slave, as Lewis pointed
out so perceptively in his essay, &quot;Willing Slaves of the Welfare State.&quot;
The cardinal difficulty with this type of scientific paternalism is that
it undercuts that which makes us human; in the name of saving man from his
problems, it abolishes man: &quot;The question&#133; has become&#133; whether
we can discover any way of submitting to the worldwide paternalism of a
technocracy without losing all personal privacy and independence. Is there
any possibility of getting the super Welfare State's honey and avoiding
the sting? Let us make no mistake about the sting. The Swedish sadness is
only a foretaste. To live his life in his own way, to call his house his
castle, to enjoy the fruits of his own labour, to educate his children as
his conscience directs, to save for their prosperity after his death--these
are wishes deeply ingrained in &#133; civilised man.&quot;<SUP>10<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis's most haunting portrait of this kind of despotism came in his <I>novel
That Hideous Strength.</I><SUP>11</SUP> There the spirit of modern social
science becomes incarnate in the National Institute for Coordinated Experiments--NICE,
for short. Of course, there is nothing nice about NICE; its social scientists
are exactly the type of bureaucratic manipulators that Lewis attacked in
nonfiction works like <I>The Abolition of Man</I>.<SUP>12<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
At this point one can anticipate several objections: First, isn't Lewis
being unfair to science by implying that it inevitably leads to tyranny?
And isn't he being unfair to scientists by implying that all they want is
power to enslave others? And don't many modern problems--from air pollution
to congestion on our freeways--require technological solutions that can
be provided only by scientific experts?<BR>
<BR>
Lewis was aware of such objections and replied that he wasn't against science
or scientists per se and that of course he did not think that science would
necessarily lead to tyranny of the sort depicted in <I>That Hideous Strength.</I><SUP>13</SUP>
One might be tempted to conclude from this that Lewis's objection to science
was narrow--that all he really opposed was the abuse of science. But such
a conclusion would be misleading. For when Lewis said he wasn't attacking
&quot;science&quot; or &quot;scientists&quot; he seems to have had a very
specific meaning in mind. He was not attacking science insofar as it was
the quest for greater knowledge; he was attacking it insofar it was a quest
for power--in particular, for power over man. In practice this meant that
while Lewis accepted the legitimacy of natural science he rejected much
of the social sciences. Learning about chemistry or biology was acceptable,
if not honorable; trying to use chemical or biological maxims to understand
the nature of man was not. A glimpse of this view can be found in the character
of William Hingest in <I>That Hideous Strength.</I> Hingest is Lewis's prototype
for the &quot;good scientist,&quot; a brilliant and crusty physical chemist
who thinks more highly of his family tree than of his scientific prowess.<SUP>14</SUP>
Hingest is interested in science for the sake of knowledge rather than power,
and he takes a dim view of those who want to use science to control man.<SUP>15</SUP>
Indeed, he does not regard as science at all those disciplines that try
to use the scientific approach to analyze man. When Mark Studdock talks
to him about &quot;sciences like Sociology,&quot; Hingest coldly replies:
&quot;There <I>are</I> no sciences like Sociology.&quot;<SUP>16</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
As for the objection that we must rely on the advice of scientists, because
only they have the answers to today's complicated problems, Lewis could
not agree. Lewis does not dispute that scientists have plenty of knowledge;
the problem is that most of it is irrelevant. Political problems are preeminently
moral problems, and scientists are not equipped to function as moralists.
Said Lewis: &quot;I dread specialists in power because they are specialists
speaking outside their special subjects. Let scientists tell us about sciences.
But government involves questions about the good for man, and justice, and
what things are worth having at what price; and on these a scientific training
gives a man's opinion no added value.&quot;<SUP>17 <BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
The cardinal danger of depending on science for political solutions, then,
is that science is divorced from those permanent principles of morality
upon which all just political solutions depend. Indeed, words like &quot;justice,&quot;
&quot;virtue,&quot; &quot;mercy&quot; and &quot;duty,&quot; are terms without
meaning within the scientific framework. And so while science is not necessarily
tyrannical, it can easily become a tool for tyrants because it has no firm
grounding in morality. The same goes for politics: Without a firm grounding
in a firm morality, politics easily slides into tyranny. <BR>
<BR>
But if morality is what we need, how do we go about achieving it? Lewis's
answer to this query is far more controversial than one might suppose. <BR>
<BR>
Many Christians today argue that morality must be founded upon the Bible.
The extent to which this belief holds sway can be seen in the catchwords
Christians use when they become involved in politics; most argue for a return
to &quot;Biblical values,&quot; &quot;Christian values,&quot; &quot;transcendent
religious truths,&quot; or (to use the dominant phrase) &quot;traditional
values&quot; based on the &quot;Judeo--Christian tradition.&quot; The terms
differ slightly, but the bottom--line remains the same: The only real source
of morality is Christian revelation.<SUP>18<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis was aware of this view, but rejected it. As he wrote in his posthumously
published essay on ethics: <BR>
<BR>
It is often asserted&#133; that the world must return to Christian ethics
in order to preserve civilization&#133; Though I am myself a Christian,
and even a dogmatic Christian untinged with Modernist reservations and committed
to supernaturalism in its full rigour, I find myself quite unable to take
my place beside the upholders of &#133;[this] view&#133; <BR>
<BR>
It is far from my intention to deny that we find in Christian ethics a deepening,
an internalization, a few changes of emphasis in the moral code. But only
serious ignorance of Jewish and Pagan culture would lead anyone to the conclusion
that it is a radically new thing.<SUP>19</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Rejecting the notion of a peculiarly &quot;Christian&quot; morality, Lewis
argued for the existence of a natural moral law known by all through human
reason. This natural moral code cannot be escaped; it is the source from
which all moral judgments come. Its fundamental truths--maxims like good
should be done and evil avoided, that caring for others is a good thing,
that dying for a righteous cause is a noble thing--are known independently
of experience. They are grasped in the same way that we know that 2+2=4.<BR>
<BR>
Lewis was certainly not the first to articulate the idea of natural law.
As any good medievalist could tell you, &quot;It's all in Aquinas.&quot;
It is also in Paul, Augustine, Cicero, Grotius, Blackstone, and the Declaration
of Independence. But this idea of natural law is precisely what many Christians
reject, even those who cite Lewis. Unintended ironies often result. In an
essay on &quot;Law and Nature&quot; written by one prominent evangelical,
for example, extensive favorable citations of Lewis's Abolition of Man appear
on one page, while this denunciation of natural law appears on another:
&quot;Even if man can treat the so--called natural laws as absolutes for
society and government, the consequence is cruelty to man. Without the reference
point in the Bible, there is no basis to judge which laws of nature are
applicable to government and man. Depending upon the man or elitist group
in power, many different things can be perpetrated and be justified on the
basis of natural law.&quot;<SUP>20<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis regarded this point of view as the cobelligerent of modern philosophy.
For just as modern philosophy attacked the ability of reason to know an
objective moral law, this sort of Christianity considered reason to be too
corrupted by sin to know objective morality apart from the Bible. Lewis
found this belief disheartening, as he wrote his brother: &quot;Did you
fondly believe --I did--that where you got among Christians, there at least
you would escape from the horrible ferocity and grimness of modern thought?
Not a bit of it. I blundered into it all, imagining that I was the upholder
of the old, stern doctrines against modern quasi--Christian slush; only
to find that my sternness was their slush&#133;. They all talk like Covenanters
or Old Testament prophets. They don't think human reason or human conscience
of any value at all&#133;.&quot;<SUP>21 <BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
As far as I know, Lewis never directly addressed the political difficulties
of this rejection of natural law by Christians; yet these difficulties must
be understood in order to fully grasp the importance of Lewis's natural
law teaching for us today. <BR>
<BR>
The problem with tying all morality to the Bible is that it implies that
those who don't believe in the Bible cannot really be good citizens. After
all, if only believers can have access to true morality through the Bible,
perhaps only they can be trusted to make the laws. What has been called
the theological--political problem resurfaces with a vengeance, for in this
situation there exists no common ground on which believers and non--believers
can meet for debate and joint action in the political arena. The natural
law rescues us from this quagmire by articulating a morality shared by believer
and unbeliever alike. <BR>
<BR>
This is not to say that the only justification for natural law is political.
The overarching reason for Christians to believe in natural law is because
it is demanded by revelation itself. Lewis knew this with full force, but
before examining his comments we would do well to refer to the Apostle Paul.
In chapter two of Romans, Paul argues that &quot;when Gentiles&#133; do
by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even
though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of
the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness,
and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.&quot;<SUP>22</SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
Now according to Paul, the Gentiles have a knowledge of morality even without
having Old Testament revelation. They do that which is right &quot;by nature.&quot;
That &quot;by nature&quot; does not mean &quot;by instinct&quot; here is
clear from the context, for Paul goes on to describe the process by which
the Gentiles come to moral knowledge &quot;by nature&quot;--and the process
is a rational one. It consists of the inner mental dialogue of the conscience
with &quot;thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.&quot; Nor does
Paul diminish the rationality of this knowledge by the phrase &quot;written
on [or 'in'] their hearts.&quot; As Lewis argued in <I>The Discarded Image,</I>
Paul's statement here is in complete harmony with the ancient view that
morality is dictated by &quot;right reason&quot;--and more particularly,
with the Stoic conception of natural law: &quot;The Stoics believed in a
Natural Law which all rational men, in virtue of their rationality, saw
to be binding on them. St. Paul['s]&#133; statement in Romans (ii 14 sq.)
that there is a law 'written in the hearts' even of Gentiles who do not
know 'the law' is in full conformity with the Stoic conception, and would
for centuries be so understood. Nor, during those centuries, would the word
hearts have had merely emotional associations. The Hebrew word which St.
Paul represents by kardia would be more nearly translated 'Mind'.&quot;<SUP>23</SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
Though Romans 2:14--15 is the single explicit reference in the New Testament
to natural law theory, its importance should not be minimized on that account.
For it is the context in which this reference to natural law appears that
shows us its true importance, not the absence of other references to natural
law in the Bible. In the immediate context of the passage, Paul is trying
to explain how a just God can condemn wicked Gentiles who have not had the
benefit of the Mosaic law. Paul argues that the Gentiles have &quot;no excuse&quot;
because they themselves recognize the substance of the moral law by nature.
In other words, the natural law allows God to justly condemn wicked Gentiles.
<BR>
<BR>
In the broader context of Pauline theology, the necessity of a natural law
becomes even more evident once one focuses on the proper function of Old
Testament law. Paul emphasized that Old Testament law was worthless as a
method to save people from their sins because no one could ever hope to
perfectly fulfill it. All the Old Testament law did was to make the Jews
conscious of sin so that they would know that they needed a savior; the
law demonstrated their need for repentance before God.<SUP>24</SUP> But
Christ died to save Gentiles as well as Jews. Because God never promulgated
the moral law to them through revelation, Gentiles must have been conscious
of their sin through some other route, or they never would have known of
their need to repent. This &quot;other route&quot; is natural law. Without
it, the Gentiles could not repent and be saved.<BR>
<BR>
Viewed in this way, it does not matter that Romans is the only place where
Paul explicitly delineates the natural law for the Gentiles, because the
need for a natural law is presupposed by the very preaching of the gospel
of repentance to anyone who is not a Jew. As Lewis noted in his essay on
ethics: &quot;The convert accept[s]&#133; forgiveness of sins. But of sins
against what Law? Some new law promulgated by the Christians? But that is
nonsensical. It would be the mockery of a tyrant to forgive a man for doing
what had never been forbidden until the very moment at which the forgiveness
was announced&#133;Essentially, Christianity is not the promulgation of
a moral discovery. It is addressed only to penitents, only to those who
admit their disobedience to the known moral law.&quot;<SUP>25<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis made this same argument somewhat more fully in <I>The Problem of Pain</I>.<SUP>26</SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
Lest one think that I am overstating the case for natural law, let me present
a caveat: Natural law provides a basis for Christians to enter politics,
but it does not provide simple--minded solutions to specific political problems.
Nor did Lewis claim that it would--nor for that matter has any other thinker
within the natural law tradition. As Lewis more than once explained (echoing
Aristotle's <I>Ethics</I>): &quot;[M]oral decisions do not admit of mathematical
certainty.&quot;<SUP>27</SUP> Natural law only supplies general moral precepts;
prudence is required to correctly apply those precepts in particular situations.
Hence there is always the chance that one's political decision will be wrong.<SUP>28<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Contrary to those Christians who reject natural law, however, this problem
of uncertainty cannot be solved by replacing the law of nature with the
law of revelation as expressed in the Bible. The Bible rarely gives particular
advice on specific political issues. It does not tell us whether to build
nuclear missiles or invade Panama; it does not inform us what type of social
programs to enact, if any; it does not guide us in our choice of the best
tax system. The Bible invariably requires interpretation if it is to be
used as a political guidebook, and interpretation opens the door for misconstruction.
The Bible is infallible; but its interpreters are not. So the Bible can
be abused and misused as much as natural law. <BR>
<BR>
Now I am not arguing--and I know Lewis would not argue--that the Bible has
no role in the area of morality. But in a society that is not a theocracy
the Bible can never be the only standard of morality. The Christians who
lived during the American Founding recognized this fact, and their political
rhetoric was fashioned accordingly. They spoke regularly of the &quot;Laws
of Nature and Nature's God&quot; and of acting in accord with both &quot;reason
and revelation.&quot; They saw natural law as the necessary meeting point
for citizens of all religious beliefs.<SUP>29</SUP> Like the early American
Christians, Lewis recognized the inescapable need for natural law. Christians
today would do well to heed his advice.<BR>

<title>Current Proposals</title>

<center>
<font size=5><strong>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO CHANGE THE TAXATION OF 
SAVING</strong></font><br>
<hr>
</center>
The Flat Tax (Dick Armey), The Sales Tax (Bill Archer), The USA (Unlimited
Savings Allowance) Tax (Domenici-Nunn), and The Individual Investment
Account Act (Breaux-McCrery)
<p>

All four revolutionary tax proposals have identical prime objectives:  (1)
totally <i>eliminating</i> the double tax on saving; and (2) greatly
<i>simplifying</i> the tax system.  These objectives are entirely proper
and achievable.  What it takes is sound judgment, good leadership, and the
guts to stop the "hand-wringers" from conjuring up ghosts that drag out
and obfuscates sound analysis and action. 
<P>
Appropriate comments follow.  But first, please recognize that
the League focuses on the taxation of <i>personal saving</i>.
Corporate tax changes, while relevant, are not commented upon herein.
<P>

<b>Flat Tax</b>:<br>  

We applaud it, because it totally removes the double tax on saving.  It
has undeniable attraction via simplicity. It is challenged by some,
because they claim it is less "progressive" than they prefer.  It suffers
due to the prospective elimination of tax deductions for home mortgage
interest, charitable contributions, and certain other embedded, existing
tax provisions. 

<P>
<b>Sales Tax</b>:<br>  

Again getting rid of the double tax on saving is a major attribute.  The
champions of the sales tax stress that it removes the whole income tax
structure and effectively removes the need for any IRS-with its legions of
tax collectors.  Further, the sales tax can be adjusted to correct the
present tax imbalance on foreign imports and exports.  Some commentators
fear that the sales tax will eventually evolve into a value-added tax,
with many levels of taxation that are masked from the public.  The sales
tax concept is simple, but faces a need for public acceptance due to its
perceived regressiveness.  The states, many who rely upon sales taxes, may
fight a national sales tax. 

<P>
<b>Domenici-Nunn (N-D) USA Plan:</b><br>

The centerpiece of the USA Tax is the Unlimited Savings Allowance from
which the new tax system for America's future derives its name" (4/25/95
N-D memo).  This plan has been endorsed by the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The N-D plan, insofar as the taxation of personal saving is concerned, is
virtually identical to in concept, and is derived from, the Individual
Investment Account Act.<p>

<b>The Individual Investment Account Act (S. 159 and H.R.
328):</b><br> 

Described by knowledgeable economists as ... "one of the boldest, most
imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth tax initiatives in many
years," this plan zeros in solely on the major fault with the existing
income tax system:  the senseless double tax on saving.  <p>

The simple, effective substance of this legislation creates an IRA-type
account for every person into which unlimited, fully tax-deductible
contributions may be made.  All assets accumulate on a tax-free basis. 
There is no penalty tax, nor forced distributions at any age.  There is no
income tax nor estate tax at death, and beneficiaries have the same tax
basis as the benefactor.  All withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax
rates.  The net effect of this legislation is, like the other more complex
legislation above, a zero tax on <i>after-tax income </i> that is saved
and invested.  Additionally, this act provides a simple, most desirable
"home and account" rollover procedure that helps people not only purchase
their home, but also sell their home on a sound, tax-deferred "investment
transaction "basis.

   <H1>Imagineering a State Budget</H1>
   <H3>By Tom McClintock</H3>

</center>

In Anaheim, California, the creative technicians at Disneyland use the term, 
"Imagineering" to describe the process of letting their imaginations run wild and then 
trying to engineer fantasy into reality.  In Sacramento, California, the creative politicians 
at the Capitol use the term "budgeting" to describe a similar exercise.  The principal 
difference is that the Disney folks are good at it.

<p>
The Imagineers in Sacramento have once again produced a budget that fantasizes much 
higher revenues than the state will receive, much lower expenditures than the state has 
authorized, with virtually no budget reserve.  Thus, every miscalculation will 
immediately translate into red ink, piling on to the already staggering debt load 
shouldered by California's taxpayers. 

<p>
Since 1990, California's economy has significantly <i>under</i>-performed the rest of the 
nation--dragged down by one of the heaviest tax and regulatory burdens in the country.

<p>
Nevertheless, California's new budget is based on predictions of a miraculous economic 
explosion in 1996, including a 33 percent jump in building permits. 

<p>
Last year, Californias personal income grew only half as fast as the rest of the country, 
but next year, the budget requires an economy growing a 33 percent faster than the 
nation.  Last year, Californias employment grew at only one third the national rate.  Next 
year, it must grow 25 percent faster than the rest of the country.  Taxpayers will make up 
the difference between fantasy and reality.  Meanwhile, the budget counts on a $500 
million federal gift that Washington has not even agreed to give.

<p>
In their defense, Sacramentos Imagineers are quick to point out that the budgets 
economic forecasts are "mid-range estimates, when compared to other forecasters."  
That's an important distinction, since the "other forecasters" they use for comparison have 
been very good at over-estimating the states performance in past years.  Economists like 
Arthur Laffer, who have been consistently correct in predicting Californias economy, are 
far more pessimistic.  Laffer observes that Californias economy now drags along at the 
bottom of national numbers, on its way to becoming "perpetual West Virginia."

<p>
On the expenditure side, the budget is balanced by significant and overdue cuts in social 
welfare spending.  But theres a hitch.  The cuts cant take effect until waivers are granted 
from the federal government, or federal laws are changed.

<p>
Yet the budget assumes these authorizations will soon take effect.  California will run a 
deficit up to $1.5 million every day the authorizations are delayed.  Thats a very likely 
scenario.  The state is still waiting for waivers for cuts made last year.  The same 
imprudence last year added millions of dollars to the deficit.

<p>
In addition, a number of court cases are pending against the state for past fiscal 
gimmicks.  For example, past budget games have shorted the state's pension system of 
nearly $1 billion. Court cases challenging state raids of this nature--which are part of the 
state's structural deficit--are very likely to add $2 billion to the states obligations, yet no 
reserve has been set aside.

<p>
A press release from the budgets author boasts, "Without any gimmicks, tricks, or smoke 
and mirrors, the proposed 1995-96 budget is balanced and even has a small reserve of $41 
million."  "Small" is putting it mildly. It amounts to 95/1000ths of one percent of the 
state general fund.  The Imagineers may not have relied on "smoke and mirrors," but their 
new budget will only fly with ample quantities of faith and trust--and a little of Tinker 
Belles pixie dust.

<p>
The difference between the fantasy of this years state budget and the reality of the states 
ailing economy will be measured by a growing deficit that future taxpayers will bear.  
Meanwhile, the state continues to carry at least $2.5 billion of debt from past years, or 
about $300 per family, which California taxpayers must eventually pay. 

<p>
Kudos to those few legislators who stood in the face of intimidation and pressure to vote 
against this wasteful and irresponsible budget.  The fact that this years budget was 
passed by a bi-partisan vote should not be hailed as a breech in "gridlock".  Instead, 
support for this business-as-usual budget, which will continue to drag California to its 
knees, should be seen for what it is: a sad commentary on the quality of political 
leadership in California.

   <H1>Fatherlessness</H1>
   <h2>The Central Social Problem of Our Time</h2>
   <H3>By Tom Lowe</H3>

</center>

<p>
For most of our history, a child growing up in the United States of  America could reasonably expect to grow up with a 
father at home.  Today, he can reasonably expect not to.  Fatherlessness is fast replacing fatherhood.  Never in our nation's 
history have so many men decided to abandon their children.  And never have the effects of that abandonment been felt so 
ubiquitously.


<p>
Divorce; child poverty; youth violence; the failure of education; unsafe neighborhoods; domestic violence; the weakening of 
parental authority--all are most directly attributable to the scourge of fatherlessness.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless 
America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in 
which their fathers do not live . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social 
problems."


<p>
Our ancestral understanding of fatherhood, which in many ways was responsible for early American success and survival, is 
under siege.  Men in general, but fathers in particular, are viewed as superfluous--America is now unable to believe in 
fatherhood as an inherent domain of males that absolutely effects the well-being of children and society.  

<p>
A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty.  In married-couple 
homes as of 1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty, while in single-mother homes an 
unbearably sad 66 percent of young children lived in poverty.  And consider that in married-couple homes with pre-school 
children, median family income in 1992 was approximately $41,000, while in single mother homes, median income was 
about $9,000.  America cannot address its child poverty problem without first addressing its most powerful determinant--fatherlessness. 


<p>
After protection and provisional responsibility, the central task of fatherhood is cultural conveyance.  As described in the 
Book of Genesis, paternity does not just mean males providing food and shelter for children, it also means that they ensure 
that the child grows up to be a <i>certain type of person</i>.  Biological paternity means producing a child--fatherhood means 
producing an adult.  For boys, the most insidious manifestation of fatherlessness has been juvenile violence, and for girls it 
has been out of wedlock childbearing.  


<p>
Studies show that girls who grow up without fathers are at much greater risk for early sexual activity, adolescent 
childbearing, and divorce.  Among white families, one study finds that "daughters of single parents are 111 percent more 
likely to have children as teenagers, and 164 percent more likely to have a pre-marital birth."


<p>
These studies also confirm that boys who grow up without a father at home are three times as likely to get in trouble with the 
police.  Historian James Q. Wilson reminds us that, "Neighborhood standards may be set by mothers, but they are enforced 
by fathers, or at least by adult males.  Neighborhoods without fathers are neighborhoods without men able and willing to 
confront errant youth, chase threatening gangs. . . The absence of fathers. . . deprives the community of those little platoons 
that informally but often effectively control boys on the street."


<p>
Frighteningly, an entire generation of young people is now growing up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or 
responsible males.  As of 1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, and in certain welfare-infested inner city 
neighborhoods over 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.  <i>Over 80 Percent.</i>


<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments to out-of-work mothers usurp a man's traditional role 
as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner unnecessary, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He 
turns to the super-masculine world of the streets:  drinking, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties 
that bind men to their children explains much of the rampant pathology from the city streets to small towns across America.


<p>
What is the solution to fatherlessness?  Laws strengthening the traditional family are part of the answer.  There should be 
firm public endorsement of healthy families, especially in textbooks written for schools.  Divorce should be made more 
difficult.  So-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our childrens well-
being.  State legislatures could reaffirm the value of two-parent families by passing laws to prohibit sperm banks from 
selling sperm to unmarried women.  The tax codes, which are unfriendly, if not downright hostile to families, must be 
changed to promote two-parent families and the raising of children at home.


<p>
As Blankenhorn insists, the most urgent social challenge for America as it heads into the twenty-first century is the re-
creation of fatherhood as a vital social role for males.  Does every child deserve a father?  The current answer in American 
society is "no" or "not necessarily."  The only answer that can save our children's future is an unabashed yes, but today, few 
ideas could be more radical.

   <H1>What Welfare Should Be</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn & Thomas G. West </H3>

</center>

What should welfare be twenty-five years from now?  The current system and everything like it should be a faint memory.  In its place should be a system that is local in administration.  This new system must support family and work.  It must respect marriage, disdain illegitimacy, and distinguish the deserving poor from the pretenders.  It must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and 
organizations, in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy.  It must be fair and good.

<p>
During the 1960's, 70's, and 80's the public debate over welfare consisted mostly of money talk.  Can we afford welfare?  Who should have to pay for it?  Much, however, has changed over the past decade. Now, thanks to the accumulation of bad experience, and the clear heads of a wise few, we are reaching to the fundamentals.  We see now that a vast treasure of ill targeted relief has bought us only more misery.  We see that the poor have been hurt even more than the tax payer has been bilked.

<p>
Between 1960 and 1990 government welfare spending increased from about $30 billion (measured in 1990 dollars) to $225 billion per year; an increase of 750 percent.  The reasons for this dependency are many and complicated, but consider that in 1992, for example, a welfare mother of two living in California with a Section 8 housing voucher from the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, had a tax-free equivalent income of $1,817 per month, or $21,804 per year.  This is more than twice the after-tax amount she could have earned at a full-time minimum-wage job.  Why should she work when welfare prices work out of the market?

<p>
The percentage of poor Americans has not been reduced since modern welfare began in the mid-1960s.  On the contrary, these programs have in truth worked against economic growth and opportunity for the poor.  Before the big 1960s increases in welfare spending, the poverty level had actually been <i>declining</i> rapidly.  According to government figures, 35 percent of Americans were poor in 1950.  By 1965, that figure had declined to 14 percent, which is about where it has stubbornly remained ever since.

<p>
The stubborn immobility of the poverty numbers is bad enough, but it is not the worst.  The nature of poverty has changed insidiously.  Prior to the 1960s, most poor Americans were poor because their work brought them a paltry income.  But since the middle of the 60s there has been a sharp and ominous increase of social pathology in urban, welfare-infested communities.  Poverty has increasingly become a problem stemming from a new underclass of able-bodied people who work rarely or not at all.  Many of them, especially males, reject the qualities that most Americans admire:  self-control, sobriety, duty to family, loyalty, courage, fair play, and faith in God.

<p>
The new underclass, mired in government dependency, rejects the ethic of hard work and self-reliance.  Low-paying jobs--where many Americans have traditionally learned the basic skills of showing up on time and getting the job done--are scoffed at.  The underclass regards these jobs as "dead-end" and their pay as "chump change."  For this urban underclass, many of whom have spent care-free years not working, hanging around smoking reefer and drinking 40-ounce beers, the reality of trying to hold down a regular job is too much.  In this world, the drug dealing thug is lionized and the man who sweeps floors is scorned.  Welfare has taught our poor all the wrong lessons.

<p>
If today's welfare policies are not working, what then is the alternative?  Prior to the new, post-1965 approach, America had the most successful poverty program in history.  Two centuries ago, at least 90 percent of Americans were desperately poor by today's standards.  By the 1960s a majority of Americans had moved into the middle class.  The recipe for America's successful 189-year-long poverty program was simple: 
<ol>
<li>Establish free markets and opportunity for all who can work.
<li>Provide strong governmental support for the traditional family and for a morality of self-control, industriousness, and basic decency.
<li>Provide individual support in local communities for the deserving poor (orphans, the elderly, and the disabled), and temporarily for the wayward able who desire to pull themselves out from poverty.
</ol>


<p>
Let us assume that the federal government is acting on the new prevailing intellectual consensus about poverty programs by handing over to states and local governments the authority to set and administer their own assistance programs for the poor.  With that in mind, here are characteristics of programs and ideas that can help in the transition away from the disastrous federal welfare state.

<p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Political and community leaders should again talk candidly about virtue, vice and shame.</i></b></ul>

<p>
We know destructive and immoral conduct when we see it.  Its carnage is all around us and there is no reason to refrain from pointing out the truth.  One of the most frustrating problems in trying to resolve the current poverty question, as <i>Newsweek</i> pointed out in a cover story last fall, is the fact  that "shame" has all but disappeared from American society.  Thirty years ago, it was considered shameful to be on the government dole.  But beginning in the 60s, as Marvin Olasky points out in <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, the poor were taught by welfare organizers that welfare is "nothing to be ashamed of."  Before that, he says, poor mothers had  "a sense that welfare should be avoided."  But, "the constant repetition of <i>rights</i> got through."  The result was "a changing outlook among many poor and the near poor."  The deceptive notion that there was "dignity" in accepting government aid was widely promulgated in these years.  Accordingly, within a few years a much larger proportion of those eligible for welfare chose to take advantage of it.  

<p>
When the stigma of accepting hand-outs is lost, so then is much of the self-reliant spirit it takes for people to pull themselves out of poverty.  Society must not be afraid to cast shame upon laziness, and leaders must affirm with renewed vigilance the duties and responsibilities of citizenship:  hard work, honesty, duty to family and self-sufficiency.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Understand that fatherlessness is the central social problem of our time.</i></b></ul>

<p>
It is in fact the key to solving poverty and crime problems.  While we know children do better with a father at home, and while it is damaging for a child to grow up without one, an almost incomprehensible disaster happens when an entire generation of young people grows up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or responsible males.  As of  1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, but in certain welfare-infested inner city neighborhoods 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.

<p>
The problem, however, has spread far beyond the inner city.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in which their fathers do not live. . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social problems, from crime to adolescent pregnancy. . . . A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty."  These studies indicate that in married-couple homes as of  1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty; while in single-mother homes a deplorable 66 percent of children lived in poverty.  

<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments usurp a man's traditional role as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner superfluous, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He turns to the masculine world of the streets:  drinking, gang banging, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties that bind men to their children explains much of today's rampant pathology.

<p>
Cash payments to underage girls who decide to have children without bothering to get married put the government in the indefensible position of encouraging reckless sexual behavior and illegitimate births.  Laws supporting family integrity need strengthening.  There should be firm public endorsement of healthy families, consisting of a married father and mother raising their own offspring.  Divorce should be made more difficult; and so-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our children's well-being.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>A serious response to the crime that plagues poor neighborhoods is required forthwith.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the urban quagmire most poor now find themselves trapped in, there is a clear and present need for an efficient system of arrest, prosecution, trial (not plea bargains), rigorous adherence to stiff sentencing, a crackdown on youth violence, and imprisonment for the first violent offense.

<p>
The most pressing purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property.  That purpose is subverted daily and pervasively in every major city in America, where flagrant piracy is a way of life.  The law-abiding poor need protection more urgently than the law-abiding middle class, who always have the option of moving to a safer neighborhood.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>The failure of public schools must be acknowledged and repaired.</i></b></ul>  

<p>
In the immediate term, tax credits or vouchers for school expenses would instantly enable the poor to send their children to private schools, something that is an affordable option today only for the middle class and the wealthy.  In the longer term, public schools need radical overhaul.  Control over schools should be returned to local communities, and large numbers of administrative positions should be canceled.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Private charity must be supported and not supplanted by the government welfare system.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the current "division of labor" in welfare, private charities provide few "on-line services," which means giving direct help to the needy.  That job is done by government.  Private action is forced to the sidelines, where it spends its time conducting experiments, running model programs, and giving expert advice to the government.  Private charity must be liberated so that it can flourish in America as it once did. We should invest private groups with the responsibility to do the main work in assisting the poor.  

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Separate the deserving poor from the lazy at the local level--make welfare less generous and 
more burdensome.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, Olasky describes how local assistance programs in the nineteenth century separated the "idle" from the "truly needy" by using "work tests" to discern the character of those seeking assistance.  Charities and shelters had "wood-yards" attached to their property.  "Transients willing to chop were given two meals and a nights lodging."  Not surprisingly, a commentator in 1894 noted that, "when the managers of a Boston charity attached a wood-yard and announced that relief would be given to no able-bodied man, unless willing to do a certain amount of work, the daily number of applicants fell off at once from one hundred and sixty to forty-nine."  Today, and in the future, of course, the wood-yard would be some variance on "workfare," but the idea remains the same:  To provide basic sustenance consistent with the apostle Paul's common-sense injunction, that able-bodied men who do not work are not entitled to eat.

<p>
The first steps in replacing the welfare mess should focus on turning assistance into a temporary safety-net instead of the entrapping spider web it is today.  For instance, people in dire need whose families cannot help them should have to live in local communal arrangements, with requirements for long hours of work, and  with strict rules of behavior (no overnight guests for the unmarried).  Getting tough on dependency is the only solution.  Benjamin Franklin said of welfare, "I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means.  I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it." 

<p>
America needs to discover again, as we once knew well, that true compassion calls for treating the able-bodied poor as adults with souls rather than as mindless children who will never grow up.

</CENTER>

<p>

	Charles Heatherly is the Executive Vice President of the Claremont Institute and also serves as Director of the Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies in Sacramento.

<p>

	He was born in Tennessee, raised and educated in Arizona, and has worked in Pennsylvania, California, and our nation's capital.

<p>

	He received his B.A. in government and history from the University of Arizona and his M.A. in government from the Claremont Graduate School.  He worked for non-profit educational organizations for fourteen years before turning to government service in the Reagan Administration.  He held three executive positions between 1981 and 1987, including Deputy Under Secretary for Management at the U.S. Dept. of Education and Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration. 

<p>

	He knows small business and its problems, and was for six years director of education for the nation's largest small business association, the National Federation of Independent Business.

<p>

	Heatherly has also been active in local government and local schools.  As a resident and public school parent in San Mateo County, California, he volunteered his time as a member of the Burlingame School District Budget Task Force.  He was also on the executive committee of the Governmental Research Council of San Mateo County.  Most recently, he served as Vice Chairman of the Dunfey Group, a statewide coalition of parents and community leaders advocating education reform through radical deregulation, parent empowerment, and independent charter schools.

<p>

	Prior to joining the Claremont Institute in 1993, he was Vice President for Academic Relations at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C.  He edited the now-famous Mandate for Leadership, a blueprint for the Reagan Administration's first 100 days.  He also co-edited that book's sequel, Mandate for Leadership III, written for the Bush Administration.  In 1988 he was project manager for another pioneering Heritage Foundation book, the The Imperial Congress, which included an introduction by a little-known freshman congressman from Georgia, Newt Gingrich.

<p>

	He currently serves as Chairman of the State Policy Network, a federation of thirty state-based research institutes dedicated to free markets, limited government, and individual freedom.

Director, Congressional Relations, U.S. House of Representatives
<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Buoyed by the dramatic outcome of the 1994 elections, conservatives had high expectations for the incoming Congress. For the first time in 40 years, conservatives assumed key leadership roles in both chambers. Particularly encouraging were the members of the incoming House freshman class, many of whom had based their successful campaigns on the Contract With America and its bold commitment to reforming Congress and reducing the size and scope of government.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although President Clinton repeatedly has vetoed major legislation, conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and retreats, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The successes of the 104th Congress are particularly significant when measured against the records of previous Congresses. While this Congress adopted significant government reforms with only narrow majorities, the New Deal and Great Society Congresses had large liberal majorities. Moreover, the legislation passed by those lawmakers was championed and signed by liberal Presidents. Although the revolution remains to be completed, conservatives should appreciate the progress that has been made.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No assessment of the 104th Congress would be complete without a recognition of what could have been accomplished if the President had not vetoed critical legislation. The most important accomplishment of this Congress was a balanced budget bill which would have eliminated the deficit by the year 2002 while mandating $245 billion in critical tax reductions. American families would have benefited from a $500 per child tax credit.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This legislation not only represented the first balanced budget in 26 years, but also contained significant reforms in government programs which would have returned power to states and communities. In spite of the President's obstructionism, however, Congress succeeded in reducing discretionary spending for the first time since 1969. As submitted, the President's FY 1996 budget would have raised the deficit to $211 billion; Congress deserves the taxpayer's credit for cutting the Administration's projected deficit nearly in half.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most notable achievement of the 104th Congress was its overhaul of the nation's welfare system. While the President twice vetoed welfare reform bills, he indicated that he would sign a third which differed from the first two bills only in minor respects. This historic legislation ends the federal entitlement to welfare, contains real work requirements and time limits, and fights illegitimacy. President Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it."  But it was conservatives in Congress who made this promise a reality. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many other areas, Congress succeeded in adopting conservative, commonsense alternatives to liberal approaches advanced by the Clinton Administration and its allies on Capitol Hill. Congress restored funding for important national security programs that were slashed by the Administration and its allies in Congress. Lawmakers deregulated telecommunications, stemmed the tide of costly new mandates, and stopped unjustified new regulations. Congress delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. In addition, the 104th Congress gave the President the line-item veto.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conservatives in the last Congress stopped the Clinton health care bill that would have led to socialized medicine; this Congress passed a scaled-down version of health care reform that had as its primary goal enhancing portability of health insurance. However, Congress did not address the flawed tax treatment of employment-based health insurance that produces costly distortions in the health care market, undermines consumer choice, and restricts access to health insurance.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of its success in other areas, Congress has more work to do to complete work on other conservative objectives. Lawmakers failed to pass legislation to end racial preferences. They were unable to end government funding for left-wing political activities. They failed to close down the Energy, Education, Commerce, or Housing Departments. The National Endowment for the Arts and the Legal Services Corporation live on. But Congress did achieve cuts in all of these programs that were unthinkable before 1994.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over."  The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

Conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and  presidential vetos, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Clinton Claims Undeserved Credit for Cutting FY 1996 Deficit<br>
<a href="/heritage/issues96/bud_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Comparing of Deficit Reduction Plans
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After nearly 18 months of trying to block congressional efforts to enact a seven-year plan to balance the federal budget, President Bill Clinton is now jumping to take credit for the recent news that the FY 1996 deficit will fall to $117 billion -- some $29 billion below the Office of Management and Budget's March estimate and the lowest dollar level since 1981. But not only is the falling deficit none of Clinton's doing; the record shows that he repeatedly blocked Congress's efforts to enact an honest long-term plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's claim is especially surprising when one considers that in February 1995, he submitted an FY 1996 budget to Congress that would have raised the deficit to $211 billion, or $94 billion higher than is now expected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting Clinton's proposed $211 billion FY 1996 deficit nearly in half. This happened because Congress rejected Clinton's plan and acted to curb spending. According to Congressional Budget Office predictions, the Clinton policies would have perpetuated $200 billion-plus deficits well into the next century. Furthermore, had Clinton not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for FY 1996, this year's deficit actually would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which Clinton now claims credit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But this has been the White House's pattern throughout the budget battle with Congress: First block congressional initiatives, then claim credit for the good news. Since Clinton sent his budget-busting FY 1996 budget to Capitol Hill, he has proposed seven "balanced budget plans."  Each of these plans -- including Clinton's FY 1997 budget -- proposed higher spending and higher taxes, and as a result, each would have added more to the national debt than the balanced budget plans produced by Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are a variety of reasons the deficit is now $173 billion lower than its peak of $290 billion in 1992. Clinton policies, however, generally are not among them. Some of the factors:<ul>

<p><li><b>Domestic discretionary cutbacks pushed by Congress.</b> Although Clinton blocked the entitlement reforms embodied in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress was able to reverse the growth of discretionary -- or annually appropriated -- spending. Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969.<sup>1</sup>  More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third.

<p><li><b>The turnaround in the savings and loan program.</b> A significant contributor to the soaring deficits under George Bush was the high taxpayer cost of bailing out failed savings and loan institutions. In FY 1991, for example, $66 billion in taxpayer-financed bailout costs was added to the federal deficit. In FY 1992, these costs totaled $2.6 billion. This year, however, this program is expected to bring in over $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector. Between FY 1992 and FY 1996, this budgetary reversal (from a program adding to the deficit to one reducing the deficit by generating revenues) amounts to an $18 billion swing in the deficit -- 10 percent of the deficit change between FY 1992 and FY 1996.

<p><li><b>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum.</b> The White House currently estimates that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry will generate over $10 billion in new revenues in FY 1996. These new revenues are considered "offsetting collections."  This means they are subtracted from the expenditures column of the federal register rather than added to the tax revenue column, thus giving the appearance that federal spending is lower than it actually is. In 1992, when the deficit reached its record level, the government did not auction telecommunications spectrum; it simply gave it away at no cost, and therefore at no benefit to the Treasury. Clinton is reaping this windfall.

<p><li><b>Defense cutbacks.</b> The White House now estimates the government will spend roughly $266 billion on national defense in FY 1996 -- $37 billion less than in FY 1992. These cutbacks, initiated by the Bush Administration, reflect the fall of the Soviet Union. Under the Clinton Administration, defense spending has fallen to roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and less than 17 percent of overall federal spending. Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II. By contrast, when the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Combined, the last three items alone account for $65 billion, or 38 percent, of the overall drop in the deficit since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>A Tax Revenue Windfall.</b> OMB currently projects that tax revenues will total $1.453 trillion in FY 1996, nearly $27 billion higher than was estimated in March. It appears that these new tax collections are a one-time windfall rather than a sign of improved economic conditions. According to OMB, "the Administration believes that most of this increase comes from higher-than-anticipated collections of non-withheld individual income taxes."  In other words, it is possible that this windfall is the result of investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rise in tax collections from the doldrums of the Bush recession is a significant factor in the declining deficit. Since 1992, tax revenues have grown by $363 billion, or one-third. During the Bush recession, however, tax revenues grew an average of only 3.8 percent per year, half the average annual growth rate between 1948 and 1996. The combined effect of tax collections returning to their historic year-over-year growth rates and Congress keeping federal spending from growing faster than these new collections has made a significant dent in the deficit picture.
<p>

<b>CLINTON'S RHETORIC VERSUS REALITY<sup>2</sup></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's record throughout the budget debate with Congress stands in stark contrast with his public rhetoric. At every turn during the past 18 months, Clinton stood in the way of smaller government and real long-term deficit reduction. The record is clear:
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #1:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to the CBO, the President's February budget would have increased the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. On May 19, 1995, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional balanced budget efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than Clinton's first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, it would have produced $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never have balanced the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this budget plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #4:</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The CBO scored this plan as still $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In making this argument, the Administration wanted to have it both ways. While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 18, 1995, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #5:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, however, the fifth Clinton budget fell far short of being a credible plan. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings were to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years of the plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were sunsetted in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget was to be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal was reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes."  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This plan moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly boosting the size of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction than the last congressional offer. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would have been reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would have forced hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Indeed, compared with the FY 1997 budget resolution passed by Congress in May, Clinton's FY 1997 budget would mean nearly $1,500 in higher taxes and $3,500 in higher spending for every household in America over the next six years. Moreover, the Clinton plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these indicate that the Clinton Administration probably never has been serious about reaching a balanced budget agreement with Congress. At every turn, President Clinton has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the growth rate of spending. Incredibly, Clinton now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it would have been lower had he not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The truth is that Congress deserves credit for reversing Clinton policies which would have perpetuated a $200 billion deficit into the next century. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi116c1.gif">Chart 1:</a> Federal Regulations Continue to Grow: 10,000 Pages of New Rules So Far During the Clinton Administration

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has kept its promise to the American people that it would begin to cut regulatory red tape and return common sense to regulation. It has reduced the size and cost of government and increased the health and well-being of all Americans. But alarmists have done a good job of convincing the American people that exactly the opposite has been true, seizing the moral high ground with rhetoric designed to convince the public that a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, this Congress can point to a record of solid reforms and progress toward a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels of public health, safety, and environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is the reality?  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress and signed into law:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Repealed the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit that had been on the books since 1974.
<p>
<li> Deregulated two major industries: agriculture and telecommunications. Farmers will now be able to grow what their customers want, not what bureaucrats demand.
<p>
<li> Stemmed the tide of costly new unfunded mandates on states and localities.
<p>
<li> Moved away from "one-size-fits-all" regulations by making it easier for the needs of small businesses to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<li> Established clear goals for agencies to reduce the paperwork burden, which will save Americans as much as 70 million hours of their time (valued at more than $1 billion) this year to use for more productive activities.
<p>
<li> Made itself directly accountable to the public by giving itself the authority to review and stop burdensome, unjustified new regulations developed by federal regulators.
<p>
<li> Forced a review by the Clinton Administration of all existing and proposed federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, Congress:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Passed and sent to the President the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which would have required federal regulators to follow a set of rational principles in deciding whether and how to regulate. These include the use of cost-benefit analysis, sound science, and risk assessment, as well as market-based alternatives and performance standards. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed and sent to the President with bipartisan support the Common Sense Liability Reform Act which would have curbed abuses of the legal system by relieving the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed legislation to reduce the existing burdens of the Safe Drinking Water Act, one the largest unfunded environmental mandates. Signed by President Clinton on August 6, 1996, the legislation will give states and localities the flexibility to target their resources more effectively to achieve greater levels of protection.
<p>
<li> Started an important national debate about how to resurrect commonsense regulation. This Congress, for example, introduced proposals to restructure the Superfund program in ways that would encourage faster cleanups, eliminate most of the need for lawyers and the courts, and reduce federal spending while improving public health, safety, and the environment. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration so far has blocked reform, choosing to leave in place a program in which one-third of the money will continue to go to lawyers and transaction costs while failing to clean up many of the most hazardous waste sites.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Taken together, in just 18 months this Congress has accomplished and initiated the most significant changes in more than 20 years, and has changed the terms of the debate in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulation for decades.

<p>
<b>THE BOLDEST AGENDA IN 20 YEARS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Alarmists did a good job in this first round, convincing the American public that regulatory reform was just another term for the rollback of important public health, safety, and environmental protections. As a result, Congress has not yet seen many of its most ambitious efforts to reform the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration signed into law. Many in Congress believe they lost the battle to reduce the burden of regulation and cut away the approximately $700 billion in red tape<sup>2</sup> that strangles American businesses and consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In less than two years, the 104th Congress accomplished unprecedented and far-reaching reforms that impose discipline on the federal regulatory decisionmaking process, deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries, and fundamentally change the way the federal government and the American people think about public health, safety, and environmental regulation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Surpassing Reagan.</b> The regulatory agenda of the 104th Congress is the boldest of the past 20 years. The successful enactment of legislation to deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries is comparable to the transportation deregulation successes of the late 1970s.<sup>3</sup>  Although the Reagan Administration had bold intentions to reverse the growth of economic and social regulation, the completed action fell short. Other than modest steps to deregulate the energy and communications industries and a new administrative review process that enjoyed some success in reducing the rate and cost of new rules, for example, the Reagan Administration could not follow through with new versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Superfund, or with FDA or OSHA reform.<sup>4</sup>  Thus, the 104th Congress stands alone in the scope and scale of its reform efforts. Until now, the deregulatory accomplishments of the last 20 years focused on freeing industries to rely on market forces. But the 104th Congress also has taken on for the first time the rapid expansion of major health, safety, and environmental programs which have increased steadily since the 1970s. The costs of these "social" regulations, particularly environmental regulation, has almost tripled over the last 20 years from about $80 billion in 1977 to more than $220 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress needed to take such bold action because the problems have never been worse. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> According to <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>, the total cost of government has been estimated at $3.38 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which results from federal and state regulation. The federal government is responsible for imposing more than $700 billion in regulatory costs each year: more than $2,800 for every man, woman, and child in America. Of the 366 days in 1996, the average American will work 184.6 days for the government. More than 40 of these days will be just to pay for the cost of federal regulations.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> As the number of regulations has grown, so has the number of federal regulators enforcing these rules. The number of permanent, full-time regulatory staff has increased from 69,946 in 1970 to 128,566 in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 And more is not always better. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year because of the current command-and-control regulatory system, which squanders billions of dollars on efforts to eliminate risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has fought to bring common sense back to the way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how to regulate to improve the environment and public health and safety. Today, federal regulators are no longer giving Americans the highest levels of protection for the billions of dollars they take from taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. By making sure that regulators follow rational principles that tell them to evaluate risks sensibly and consistently, consider the costs and benefits of their actions, and use market-based solutions, policymakers can do an even better job of protecting the environment and public health and safety while spending less and with fewer rules.
<p>
<b>COMMONSENSE REGULATORY REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In just 18 months, the 104th Congress has put in place a number of important reforms that will provide significant benefits to the economy and the well-being of all Americans.
<p>
<b>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</b><br>
The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996. This is the most important industry-wide deregulatory initiative undertaken by Congress in over a decade. The Act removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing telephone, cable, and broadcasting competition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Act eventually will eliminate restrictions that prohibit competition between local and long-distance companies, as well as cable companies, so that they can offer consumers a full range of communications and entertainment services.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One 1993 study estimated that complete deregulation would help create 3.6 million more jobs by 2003 and pass along savings of roughly $63 billion a year to consumers.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Telecommunications Act does not go quite as far as the more rapid, comprehensive deregulation this study envisioned, comparable gains can still be expected over time as a result of the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Deregulation also will mean the end of the Cable Act of 1992, numerous restrictions on beneficial merger and alliance activity, and many other needless Federal Communications Commission activities.
<p>

<b>The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996</b><br>
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127) eliminates federal programs that manipulate production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction. This legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of the restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which should mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation,<sup>10</sup> the new law will mean that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li> Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<p>
<li> Taken together, the agriculture community will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion in income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, the Act establishes an Environmental Quality Improvement Program to provide funds for a cooperative effort with farmers to protect wetlands, using a flexible, incentive-oriented approach while increasing wetland acreage under the conservation program. 
<p>
<b>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</b><br>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress in March 1995 enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4). The Act requires Congress to take into consideration the cost to states, localities, and Indian tribes of new mandates. Federal agencies must assess the impact of new regulations both on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector; and the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is tasked with a review of existing mandates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One year later, states already feel the relief from new unfunded mandates.<sup>11</sup>  Thanks to this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tasked with estimating the costs of these new legislative mandates. Now many Members of Congress can find out the costs of proposed mandates and reduce the cost to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations have resulted in important policy changes that saved hundreds of millions dollars:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Immigration.</b> The benefits of CBO's input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all drivers' licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. CBO estimated that this would cost from $80 million-$200 million for states that would have to purchase new equipment and make other necessary changes to handle the volume of people who suddenly would need to have new licenses issued. <sup>12</sup> This provision was changed in the final legislation to allow for a six-year phase-in period during which states could renew licenses when they normally would come up for renewal. This dropped the costs to states to around $20 million.
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision to dairy processors and manufacturers at somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually. The final farm bill did not contain a national higher fluid milk standard, and CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for its elimination.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</b> The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill initially included a provision that would have required insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses, and the case for dropping this unjustified mandate was greatly facilitated by CBO estimates of the cost. The CBO noted that imposing this mandated benefit on private health insurance would have huge public and private sector costs. It projected that the Senate mandate would impose $423 million in additional costs on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005. If it was applied to Medicare and Medicaid, program outlays would increase by almost $80 billion for Medicare between 1997 and 2000, and by another $35 billion for Medicaid during the same period. CBO also estimated that the premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would see an increase of 4 percent.<sup>14</sup>  The costly provision was taken out of the bill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The National Highway System Designation Act (P.L. 104-59)</b> ended a burdensome, costly unfunded mandate requiring states to satisfy a minimum tonnage utilization requirement for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber on federal-aid projects. According to the CBO, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that states would save up to $1 billion annually in paving costs by not having to comply with the crumb rubber requirements.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act employee commute option (ECO) program (P.L. 104-70)</b> make the program optional for states if they can undertake alternative methods that will achieve equivalent emissions reductions. While the EPA had estimated the cost of the ECO program at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion annually,<sup>16</sup> it also called the impact of the program "minuscule" because it proved to be relatively ineffective at achieving emission reductions.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act (P.L. 104-119)</b> exempts waste determined to be non-hazardous under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, since chemical compounds safe enough to drink presumably are safe enough to bury. Municipal solid waste landfills likewise are exempt from ground water monitoring requirements if they are small (waste disposals of less than 20 tons daily).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Repeal of the federal speed limit.</b> As part of the National Highway system bill that President Clinton signed on November 28, 1995, the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit was repealed unconditionally. Beginning on December 8, 1995, states were able to begin freely adjusting speed limits within their boundaries. Several states immediately took action to raise their limits in response to the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</b> Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. For small business owners, Washington looms as "public enemy number one." Small businesses want to get government off their backs so they can do what they do best -- create jobs and generate tax revenue -- without the excessive burden of reporting and regulatory compliance.<sup>18</sup>  Regulation also does not affect all businesses equally. "One-size-fits-all" regulations impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In response to the concerns of small business, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), which was signed by the President on March 29, 1996. This legislation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Authorizes judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to provide information on the impact of their regulations on small businesses and other entities;
<p>
<li> Allows small business to recoup expenses and legal fees incurred when agencies make excessive demands for penalties that cannot be sustained in court;
<p>
<li> Provides for an independent ombudsman to receive confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with federal regulators; and
<p>
<li> Requires federal agencies to prepare "Plain English" compliance guides spelling out in easy-to-follow language how small businesses can comply with federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress deserves credit for this modest reform in the face of the Clinton Administration's overwhelming opposition to more fundamental reforms that small businesses desperately need. For example, President Clinton vetoed a number of important regulatory, tax, and legal reforms proposed by the 104th Congress that were important priorities not just for small businesses, but for all businesses so they can promote economic growth and create more jobs. These included environmental and workplace reform, secure property rights, a reform of outdated labor laws, repeal of Davis-Bacon, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, tax equity in health care reform, pension reform, and tort reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</b> More than one-third of the costs of regulation -- about $200 billion -- in 1995 was due to paperwork.<sup>19</sup>  Thus, even a modest reduction in the total paperwork burden imposed on the public can save Americans thousands of hours of time and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in lost productivity. Most Americans fill out some kind of paperwork, such as federal tax forms or forms to obtain some type of government benefit. Businesses also must maintain a myriad of records to demonstrate compliance with environment, workplace, and other rules.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Intent on easing the burden imposed by the federal government on individuals and businesses, the 104th Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13), and President Clinton signed it into law on May 22, 1995. The Act further amended and recodified the original Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The new law sets a government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 10 percent in each of the first two years after its enactment, and 5 percent from FY 1998 through FY 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released a report showing that the number of hours of paperwork imposed by the government rose by 500 million in the one-month period immediately before the effective date of the Act, from 6.39 billion hours on August 30, 1995, to 6.90 billion hours on September 30, 1995.<sup>20</sup>  The estimated burden imposed by OSHA rose the most dramatically, from 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours.<sup>21</sup>  These significant increases were due to the fact that the new law forced agencies to more accurately acknowledge the level of paperwork burden they impose on the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The GAO projects that federal agencies are expected to reduce the paperwork burden by about one percent in FY 1996.<sup>22</sup>  For the first time since 1989, Congress has managed to force a decrease of as much as 70 million hours in the government paperwork burden. This is equivalent to allowing 36,350 people now working full-time on paperwork each year to engage in other, more productive activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Congressional Review Act of 1996</b> For too long, federal agencies have blamed Congress for many of the burdensome regulations it has crafted, and often this blame is justified. The 104th Congress now has made itself accountable and responsible to the American public for all regulations. The Congressional Review Act, part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, allows Congress to review each new rule and consider a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule it. Under this Act, no rule may go into effect until it is delivered to Congress for its review. A "rule" is defined very broadly to include all general agency statements that affect the public, including "interpretive" rules, agency "policy statements," "guidelines," and "staff manuals."  Federal agencies will have to report to Congress on each rule, stating whether they have evaluated the costs of the rule relative to the benefits, whether the rule takes private property, and whether it affects the relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. Congress can reject a rule, which would then have to be changed substantially before it could be resubmitted to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
More reform would have been achieved had President Clinton not vetoed other measures passed by the 104th Congress. Among them:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>The Common Sense Liability Reform Act (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> The Act would have curbed abuses of the legal system. It had strong bipartisan backing in Congress but was vigorously opposed by the trial lawyers -- incidentally, among the largest contributors to Clinton's presidential campaign. Liability reform is desperately needed to reduce the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. Unfortunately, Congress did not have the votes necessary to override Clinton's veto of May 2, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> In September 1993, President Clinton had revised and reissued the regulatory review executive order first issued by President Reagan. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, established a set of principles to guide federal regulators in developing rules and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviewing rules. These principles include consideration of costs and benefits and the use of market-based alternatives and performance standards. The Clinton Administration, however, did not appear very committed to making sure the regulatory principles it embodied were being taken into consideration by federal agencies. A review of EPA rulemaking between April 1994 and September 1994 showed that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Of 45 significant rules reviewed by OMB, only six contained a determination that the benefits justified the costs; only three contained a determination of a compelling public need; and only nine considered alternative approaches to regulating. Of the other 177 EPA rules issued during that six-month period but not reviewed by OMB, no rule determined that the benefits justified the costs.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress recognized that for regulatory reform to be truly effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently, and a statutory change was the only way to achieve it. Federal regulators needed to be required to base their decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans, and they need Congress to give them the roadmap to do it. Congress enacted such legislation as part of a temporary increase in the debt ceiling. But President Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, 1995.

<p>

<b>THE BAND-AID APPROACH: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S "REGULATORY REINVENTION INITIATIVES" </b>
<p><blockquote>
<center>	I am going to stop handing down mandates to you and regulating you to death.</center>

<P>
--Bill Clinton, remarks before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Houston, Texas, June 22, 1992.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Despite campaign promises to cut red tape, the growth of regulation has continued during the Clinton Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At the end of 1992, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the annual accumulation of all federal regulations in effect, filled 199 volumes and 128,344 pages. By the end of 1995, the CFR had grown to 205 volumes and 138,186 pages -- almost 10,000 pages of new executive branch rules in just three years.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
To be sure, soon after the 104th Congress took office, the Clinton Administration initiated a number of steps that made it look as if it was really serious about slowing the growth of new rules. For example, on February 21, 1995, the White House directed federal agencies to conduct a review of their existing regulations to determine which should be eliminated and which should be streamlined, updated, overhauled, or otherwise improved.<sup>25</sup>  However, one year later, it is clear the Administration is making no real progress in reducing the overall burden of regulation. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In June 1995, the Administration claimed that agencies had identified over 16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations that they would be eliminating.<sup>26</sup>  But some of the pages being eliminated are for rules for which the underlying statute has long since been repealed, treaties that no longer exist, and the like. This alone easily could achieve a 10 percent reduction in the CFR without accomplishing any real changes in the way the federal government goes about regulating the public. So while it sounds impressive, it is not. At the same time, the Administration already has added 10,000 pages of new regulations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting, review, and reporting requirements for a number of programs, the Clinton Administration simultaneously is pushing forward with burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the universe of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release Inventory. Critics argue that last year's expansion will mean as much as $331 million in compliance costs.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Administration, while asserting that it is committed to sound science, is pursuing federal guidelines on cancer assessment to make it easier to regulate or ban substances despite the lack of sound scientific evidence that they pose any risk. Virtually all scientists who conduct statistical analyses to determine cancer risks -- or any other analyses, for that matter -- use confidence levels to determine the likelihood that their results are accurate. But the EPA proposed new rules this April that would eliminate the current requirement that EPA use confidence levels in doing risk assessments. Under this new rule, EPA would be able to conclude that something is dangerous on the basis of evidence that would fail under any rigorous scientific study.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is consolidating a few rules and eliminating duplicative pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it also is working on new regulations that will impose over $12 billion in compliance costs on consumers and businesses (indoor air quality and ergonomics) and increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000 (fall protection).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's "reinvention" effort does little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of regulation. The Administration claims to be reinventing regulation but goes about implementing new burdensome regulations about as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the 104th Congress began in January 1995, the federal government's ever-expanding reach into the lives of Americans -- the food they eat, how they use their private property, how they run their businesses -- was a source of great concern to the American people. The 104th Congress has made historic progress toward fundamentally changing how the federal government regulates the lives of all Americans. And it has done so by applying a set of principles: free markets, competition, consideration of costs and benefits, sound science and risk assessment, priority setting, and assigning of property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Clinton Administration will now attempt to take credit for regulatory reform through its "reinvention" efforts, but all it actually has done is try to play "catch-up" by repackaging the same old regulatory system and passing it off as something new. Making it easier for businesses to comply with regulations that were unjustified in the first place or claiming to take away rules while simultaneously adding new ones does not represent true regulatory reform. The American people are too smart for that. In the final analysis, they know that true reform gives them more freedom and incentives to take actions for their own benefit, and that the 104th Congress has delivered on its promise in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulations for decades.

<h3>WHAT THE 104TH CONGRESS DID TO COMBAT CRIME</h3></font>
</b>



By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a><br>
Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a></center>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 104th Congress has delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. Most of these anti-crime measures were initiated by conservative Members of the House of Representatives, based on promises made to the taxpayers in the Contract With America, and later incorporated into bills passed by the Senate. They include a solid program of truth in sentencing for violent criminals, effective death penalty provisions, restrictions on the power of federal judges to put criminals back on the streets, a reordering of federal funding from social programs to law enforcement efforts (including prison construction and police funding), and victim restitution.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two major vehicles for enactment of most of these measures were the comprehensive Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S. 735), sponsored by former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), and the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019). While more can be done at the federal level, more also needs to be done by state and local officials who bear the primary responsibility for fighting violent street crime.<sup>2</sup>  Nonetheless, the legislative record of the 104th Congress in combating crime is impressive and far-reaching.<p><b>KEEPING THE BAD GUYS OFF THE STREETS</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first duty of government is to protect the people. As a short-term measure, the most effective way to do this is to put more violent criminals in prison and keep them there. In fulfilling this duty, Congress enacted the following measures into law:
<p>
<b>Violent Criminal Incarceration Act of 1995 (H.R. 667).</b> A major failure of the criminal justice system has been the inability or unwillingness to identify, target, and incarcerate violent criminals for long periods of time. Violent criminals typically serve only one-third of their sentences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under this new law, states will receive Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants for the construction of prisons on condition that they keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Already, more than 20 states have adopted such truth-in-sentencing laws,<sup>3</sup> and it is likely that many more will adopt such measures to keep violent criminals behind bars and off the streets.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995; was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019); and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</b> During the past three decades, federal judges have seized control of state and even local prisons, dictating conditions of confinement, promoting more comfortable living conditions for convicts, and releasing inmates as a way to ease overcrowding. Federal judges have been releasing inmates without finding a violation of a specific federal or constitutional right. Over 500 municipalities and 1,200 state prisons have been operating under judicial orders or consent decrees. Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress attempted to stop lenient federal judges from imposing caps on the number of prisoners that can be incarcerated at a particular prison,<sup>4</sup> a judicial practice that has resulted in the release of violent criminals before their terms have been served.<sup>5</sup>  Liberal lawyers and judges quickly found ways to get around this provision.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act, originally sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), closes existing loopholes by imposing tighter restrictions on federal court-ordered prison population caps. It requires a three-judge panel to find that prison crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's legal or constitutional rights. Moreover, it requires judges to find that there is no other remedy available before they impose a prison cap. State or local officials responsible for the prosecution or custody of criminals who could be released because of judicially imposed prison caps are granted standing to sue. The Prison Litigation Reform Act also specifies that court-ordered relief from incarceration is to be based on specific violations of a prisoner's constitutional rights and that federal judges must give substantial weight in their decisions to any adverse impact of such relief on public safety or on the operation of the criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure also reduces the burden of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, which include a wide range of often strange and bizarre complaints. Inmate lawsuits are estimated to comprise 25 percent of all civil suits filed in federal courts, and state officials are burdened with responding to them. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has compiled a "top ten" list of the most frivolous of these lawsuits, including complaints against officials who do not provide salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays, officials who do not pay food allowances of $26 a day to inmates traveling from prison to the courthouse, and officials who do not permit male inmates to wear such female apparel as bras, panties, lipstick, and artificial fingernails.<sup>6</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, federal courts are authorized to dismiss frivolous or malicious suits "without hearing."  Moreover, all administrative solutions within the corrections system must be exhausted before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court. The measure also limits the lawyers' fees awarded to successful inmate plaintiffs. In the past, trial lawyers have received as much as $300 per hour for representing prisoners.<sup>7</sup>  Under this Act, fees will be based on an hourly rate no higher than that for other court-appointed counsel, and any monetary damages awarded to a prisoner in a successful suit against state prison authorities must be applied to outstanding restitution owed to the victims of his crimes.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019) and signed into law as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>To disapprove certain sentencing guideline amendments (H.R. 2259/S. 1254).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to submit new guidelines imposing higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine, and higher sentences for "high level" as opposed to "low level" drug trafficking. It rejects previous guidelines that would have lowered penalties for crack cocaine to those for powder cocaine. The law stipulates that new guidelines also should include stiffer penalties for drug traffickers who use a dangerous weapon, possess a firearm, or involve or injure children or other vulnerable individuals when committing an offense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill passed the Senate on September 29, 1995; passed the House of Representatives on October 18, 1995; and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-38.
<p>


<b>MAKING PUNISHMENT SWIFT AND SURE</b><p>
<b>The Alien Deportation Improvement Act of 1995 (H.R. 668).</b> Originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law would expedite deportation procedures for non-resident aliens convicted of serious felonies, as well as bribery, counterfeiting, trafficking in stolen vehicles, perjury or subornation of perjury. It also would permit deportation of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced to five or more years for an aggravated felony.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure, originally titled the Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act of 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995, and later incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132).
<p>
<b>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 (H.R. 779).</b> While there is considerable debate over the ethics or wisdom of imposing the death penalty, the empirical evidence indicates that the death penalty in the United States is used sparingly. In 1995, there were 2,976 criminals on death row, but the states have executed 263 criminals since 1973. The abuse of <i>habeas corpus</i>, enabling those on death row to file petition after petition seeking to overturn their sentences or convictions, has been a major weakness of the American criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure reduces delays in carrying out capital sentences while preserving the right of those convicted of capital crimes to present valid claims in federal court. It also imposes time limits for the filing and judicial consideration of petitions; ends the practice of filing multiple petitions except in the rarest instances; requires that state prisoners seeking <i>habeas corpus</I> relief must exhaust all state remedies before bringing action in federal court; and specifies that if a state gives reasonable consideration to the petitioner's claim, the federal judge must deny that claim.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 was passed by the House of Representatives on February 8, 1995; incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as part of Public Law 104-132.
<p>


<b>HELPING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The central congressional approach to law enforcement assistance is the block grant, which allows local law enforcement officials to secure more funds, hire more police personnel, and have even more flexibility in using these monies to combat crime at the local level.
<p>
<b>Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 (H.R. 728).</b> This measure authorizes federal grants for local law enforcement officers while giving them the flexibility they need to fight crime in ways they deem most appropriate for their communities. Unlike the police funding in the 1994 crime bill, these funds are targeted to communities with high crime rates. $503 million has been appropriated for FY 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 1995; incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act (H.R. 2803).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, advances the investigation of car theft by setting up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). This system, to be managed by the Department of Justice and maintained by the states, is intended to serve as a reliable and accessible body of information on motor vehicle titling for law enforcement officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This law was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 20, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public law 104-152.
<p>

<b>JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS</b><p>

<b>Victim Restitution Act of 1995 (H.R. 665).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, requires judges in federal felony cases to order restitution to victims in cases involving violent crimes, offenses against property, or tampering with consumer products, as well as crimes in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. The law also authorizes the federal courts to make restitution a condition of probation or parole.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7, 1995; passed by the Senate on December 22, 1995, and incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-132.
<p>
<b>Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 (H.R. 1240).</b> Sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law imposes strong sentencing guidelines for criminals convicted of creating or trafficking in child pornography and the interstate transportation of children with the intent to use them in such criminal activity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 1240 was passed by the House on April 4, 1995; passed by the Senate on April 6, 1995; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-71.
<p>
<b>Megan's Law (H.R. 2137).</b> Sexually violent criminals often are repeat offenders, and their presence in local communities is an obvious concern for families with children. Under this law, sponsored by Representative Richard Zimmer (R-NJ), criminals convicted of these crimes must register their addresses with state law enforcement officials, and communities will be informed when these offenders move into their neighborhoods.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996; passed by the Senate on May 9, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-145.
<p>
<b>Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 3525).</b> This new law, sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), makes it a federal crime to damage religious property or obstruct any person's free exercise of religion where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 26, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-155.

<p>
<b>PENDING ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION</b>
<p><b>Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (H.R. 3814).</b> This bill provides $680 million for prisons and $571 million for block grants to local law enforcement. It passed the House on July 24, 1996, and currently is before a conference of the House and Senate.
<p>
<b>Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 2980/S. 1729).</b> H.R. 2980 makes it a felony to cross a state line to stalk someone or to cross a state line in violation of a restraining order. The House of Representatives passed this bill on May 7, 1996. S. 1729, an identical bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), was passed by the Senate.
<p>
<b>Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666).</b> This bill, sponsored by Representative McCollum, would establish an exception to the exclusionary rule, which bars the use at trial of any evidence gathered by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The narrow qualification created by this legislation would allow the admission of evidence obtained by police officers who, while they technically violated proper procedure, acted in the "reasonably objective belief" that their actions under the circumstances complied with Fourth Amendment protections. The bill classifies any information obtained pursuant to, or within the scope of, a warrant as evidence obtained in good faith.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House of Representatives passed this bill on February 8, 1995. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<p>
<b>Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565).</b> This bill, also sponsored by Representative McCollum, would allow federal prosecutors to try violent juvenile offenders as adults. It also includes tough, mandatory sentences for juvenile criminals who use firearms in the commission of a federal violent crime or drug trafficking offense, and authorizes additional funding for juvenile justice programs and grants to states, allowing them greater flexibility in combating the growth of violent juvenile crime. The bill was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on July 16 and 17, 1996, and referred to the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, which approved sections under its jurisdiction.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the United States Senate, John Ashcroft (R-MO) introduced S. 1245, a similar bill. The Subcommittee on Youth Violence of the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the Ashcroft bill.
<p>
<b>Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (S. 1675/H.R. 3456).</b> This bill would enhance the federal effort to track convicted sex offenders. Cosponsored by Senators Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Joseph Biden (D-DE), the legislation would establish a federal tracking system, accessible to the public, to document the location of sex offenders, making it more difficult for these criminals to hide their records when applying for jobs, housing, or youth service programs. A version of the bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Zimmer. Hearings on the bill have been held before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee.

<h3>HOW CONGRESS REFORMED THE WELFARE SYSTEM</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><sup>1</sup><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress passed historic welfare reform legislation; and after vetoing two previous versions of welfare reform, President Clinton finally signed the congressional welfare reform bill into law on August 22, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals have long opposed serious welfare reform, arguing that if the federal government continues its traditional practice of offering free handouts, children in particular will be better off, and the social maladies that characterize the life of low-income Americans in many of our urban and rural areas will decline or disappear. The liberal experiment in social policy has been tried and has failed.<sup>2</sup>  No scientific study has ever demonstrated that increasing welfare benefits to low-income persons improves the long-term prospects of the children of those persons. Indeed, children on welfare, compared to children whose families are poor but are not on welfare, do poorly: They do less well in school and earn less. The liberal welfare state has not helped children; it has hurt them.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The congressional legislation reforms the current welfare system in four major ways:
<P>
<b>1. It eliminates perverse financial incentives for state government.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the major welfare program for unmarried mothers and children established in 1935, has been funded on an entitlement basis. Traditionally, this has meant that the more persons a state enrolls in AFDC, the greater will be the funds received from the federal government. Conversely, if a governor reduces the number of persons on welfare, federal funding to his state is reduced. Clearly, AFDC's entitlement funding structure creates perverse incentives for state government, penalizing states which reduce dependency and rewarding those which allow their welfare caseloads to grow.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new congressional welfare reform legislation eliminates these perverse incentives by creating a new funding system. Under this new system, each state will be given a fixed dollar grant which will be increased gradually from year to year. If a state reduces its AFDC caseload, its federal grant will not be cut. Instead, the state will be permitted to keep any surplus federal funds that are generated by caseload reduction and apply those funds to other efforts to aid the poor. On the other hand, if a state permits its AFDC caseload to grow rapidly, the state -- not the federal government -- will bear the added cost.
<p>
<b>2. It slows the growth of welfare spending.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to claims by liberals in Congress and certain reports in the press, the congressional reform bill will not cut welfare spending. It merely slows the rate of growth in spending. Seven major programs are affected by the legislation:<p><ul>

<li>Aid to Families with Dependent Children;
<li>Food Stamps;
<li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI);
<li>School lunch and other child nutrition programs;
<li>Foster Care;
<li>Social Services Block Grant; and
<li>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under prior law, aggregate spending in these programs was scheduled to grow by nearly 50 percent over the next seven years (an annual growth rate of roughly 6 percent).  The congressional reform legislation will slow the rate of growth to around 35 percent over seven years (an annual growth rate of roughly 4.5 percent). Thus, the reform will permit future aggregate state spending in these programs to expand faster than the rate of inflation.
<p>
<b>3. It establishes work requirements.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the new law, welfare no longer will be a one-way handout. The law establishes serious, correctly designed standards for the states and work requirements for welfare recipients; the goal is for states to reduce their caseloads, not to process greater numbers of persons through welfare. Specified percentages of AFDC recipients will be required to take private-sector jobs. If a state is unable to reduce its caseload through placements in the private sector, it will be required to place certain numbers of welfare recipients in community service work in exchange for welfare benefits. When working in a community service job, the welfare recipient must be in a "pay after performance" system: The beneficiary will not receive AFDC benefits until after the community service work has been completed satisfactorily. If the individual fails to work the prescribed number of hours, his welfare benefits will be reduced accordingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One weakness in the reform legislation is that because of numerous loopholes, the number of recipients who will be required to work is quite low. By 1999, the typical state will be required to have only 18 percent of its AFDC caseload working. The new law, however, is still an improvement over the current system.
<p>
<b>4. It provides incentives to reduce illegitimacy.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the present time, nearly one-third of all American children are born out of wedlock. There is a growing consensus, among liberals and conservatives alike, that the growth in illegitimacy is a social catastrophe for the nation. The collapse of marriage and the rise in out-of-wedlock births encourage welfare dependency as well as crime and many other social problems.<sup>4</sup>  The welfare reform bill contains three provisions to combat illegitimacy. First, it will focus the attention of state governments on the illegitimacy problem by requiring each state to set numerical goals for reducing illegitimacy over the next ten years. Second, it will provide bonus funding to states which reduce illegitimacy without increasing abortion rates. Third, it will create a new program to provide abstinence education, funded at $50 million per year.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While it is not perfect, the congressional welfare reform legislation is a significant step in the right direction. It represents the largest change in federal welfare policy since the initiation of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty in 1965.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much more, however, has to be done. Congress must begin the job of rebuilding and revitalizing America's inner-city neighborhoods, promoting moral as well as urban renewal in the nation's most devastated communities and giving hope to millions of Americans trapped in environments whose principal distinguishing characteristics are broken families, crime-ridden communities, and economic and physical deterioration. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) have introduced a comprehensive initiative, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Their goals are real enterprise zones in urban and rural areas to encourage business opportunities and job creation in the nation's poorest communities; scholarships for poor children to attend the schools of their choice, including religious schools that reinforce traditional moral virtues; a charitable contribution tax credit to any American who makes a contribution to any private charity engaged in providing direct services to the nation's poor; and the elimination of official discrimination against religious or faith-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers -- the very programs that most often use public funds for these purposes most effectively.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives in Congress have a full agenda in social policy. Serious welfare reform is only the beginning.

<h3> HOW THE 104TH CONGRESS REFORMED ITSELF</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David M. Mason</a><br>
Vice President of Government Relations<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Imperial Congress was dethroned in 1994, and conservatives who had railed against an insulated ruling class in Washington had reason to celebrate. The switch in majorities alone deposed decades-tenured House and Senate committee chairmen who had frustrated Ronald Reagan's policy initiatives and hounded his appointees. But the new majority was far more than an ideological mirror image of the old. Beginning with its first day in January 1995, the 104th Congress instituted sweeping reforms of its own internal operations and budget, the legislative process, and congressional relations with the states and the executive branch.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The abuses of the old order were rooted out, not only with new leaders, but with new laws and rules which amount to the most sweeping changes in decades. More important, these changes likely represent an enduring and positive change in the way Americans govern themselves. As a result of reforms enacted in the past two years, future Congresses will be unable to perpetrate many of the abuses practiced by politicians in the past. The new Congress strictly limited gifts and perks, agreed to abide by laws imposed on the private sector, cut its budget and staff, limited its own spending and taxing powers, and agreed to avoid new impositions on state and local governments. By acting voluntarily to curb its own powers and privileges in this way, the 104th Congress has been truly revolutionary.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the new Congress has received insufficient credit for these achievements. The reasons: They are not widely known to the public, many of the early reforms were forgotten during the political storms of last winter, and procedural reforms take time to bear fruit. Further, many Americans were disappointed that Congress failed, albeit narrowly, to approve the most popular and sweeping reform: term limits. But the blame does not lie with Congress, which advanced term limits farther and faster than nearly any previous constitutional amendment proposal. Votes in the House and Senate have laid the groundwork, making eventual passage of a constitutional amendment highly likely. The real culprit is the Supreme Court, which invalidated state laws imposing term limits on Members of Congress. Had the Court ruled the other way, a constitutional amendment would have been more swift and certain, and some Representatives would have been facing term limits as early as 1998.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Repairing the public's fractured trust in Congress will take a long time, but a simple listing of reforms implemented since January 1995 should cheer Americans who sometimes despair about whether politicians can ever get things right. Among its reform accomplishments, the 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Applied laws imposed on the private sector to itself;

<p><li>Froze congressional pay;

<p><li>Cut its own budget and staff;

<p><li>Granted line-item veto authority to future Presidents;

<p><li>Banned most gifts to Members of Congress;

<p><li>Required lobbyists to register and disclose their activities;

<p><li>Restricted laws imposing burdens on states and communities (unfunded mandates);

<p><li>Reduced franking (free mail) and other perks;

<p><li>Imposed term limits on committee chairmen and top House and Senate leaders;

<p><li>Abolished an entire agency (the Office of Technology Assessment);

<p><li>Privatized support services;

<p><li>Eliminated government grants to nonprofit lobbying groups;

<p><li>Repealed a law that favored congressional staff in hiring for career government jobs; and

<p><li>Established a mechanism for Congress to review major new regulations.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to these reforms applying to the entire Congress, the House of Representatives, which had been subject to more severe criticism for its management and procedures, acted on its own to:
<ul>
<p><li>Require a supermajority (three-fifths) vote to increase taxes;

<p><li>Conduct its first comprehensive audit and modernized financial management;

<p><li>Reform the committee structure, eliminating three full committees and 25 subcommittees;

<p><li>Prohibit absentee (proxy) voting in committees;

<p><li>Open committee meetings and information to the media and the public;

<p><li>Create a new corrections day process to repeal unreasonable rules and regulations;

<p><li>Guarantee that the minority party would have more opportunities to amend legislation; and

<p><li>Compare spending proposals to existing spending (rather than to inflated projections).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The result of these reforms is a Congress that is less costly, less bureaucratic, and less insulated from the concerns of average Americans. It is more open, more responsive, and more accountable to voters. It is, in brief, a Congress more befitting a democratic republic, and unless these reforms are abandoned or reversed, Americans should discover a growing sense of confidence in their ability to govern themselves through Congress.
<p>

<b>THE FIRST DAY</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress acted swiftly to change its rules and practices. The 1994 elections changed the partisan control of Congress and delivered a clear reform mandate. The Contract With America promised numerous changes in House rules, and the new leadership of the House of Representatives took this mandate and ran with it. On January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 104th Congress, the House voted to end procedures that had become increasingly arbitrary and secretive.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new House rules package largely achieved the goals of the institution's critics. The rules were designed to:<ul>

<p><li>Improve deliberation by banning proxy (absentee) voting in committees, ensuring minority rights in the amendment process, and requiring fuller reporting on spending bills;

<p><li>Streamline the legislative process by cutting the number of committees and subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of legislation, and slashing committee staff;

<p><li>Promote accountability by requiring that committee meetings be open to the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll call votes on major legislation, prohibiting alterations in debate transcripts, and conducting a comprehensive audit of House finances; and

<p><li>Increase responsiveness by imposing term limits on the Speaker and committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a measure to apply federal laws to Congress as the first legislative vote in the 104th Congress.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans' Contract With America provided for eight specific first-day reforms that the House succeeded in passing, in most cases with large bipartisan majorities:
<ol>
<p><li><b>Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms.</b> The new rules package eliminated three House committees (Post Office and Civil Service, District of Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries) and 25 subcommittees. The committee reform provision also shrank House committee staff by one-third.

<p><li><b>Truth in Budgeting.</b> Appropriations committees are now required to compare new spending recommendations to the current spending level. Under the old system, tax-and-spend liberals had the upper hand because spending increases were judged not against what actually was spent last year, but against projected spending for next year. With these rules, even a spending increase could be called a "cut."

<p><li><b>Term Limits for Committee Chairmen and the Speaker.</b> House committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more than three consecutive Congresses (six years). Limiting the tenure of committee chairmen begins to address some of the concerns of advocates of full-scale legislative term limits. A central problem of previous Congresses had been that committee chairmen, who set the agenda, had spent decades in office. In the 103rd Congress, for example, the chairmen of two of the House's three most powerful committees (Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce) had held these positions for over a decade; the chairman of the third (Appropriations) had just vacated his position after holding it since the 1970s.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, the Speaker will be prohibited from serving more than four Congresses (eight years), bringing the top constitutional officer of the legislative branch in line with the President, his executive branch counterpart.

<p><li><b>Elimination of Proxy Voting.</b> Elimination of the practice of allowing absent members of a committee to lend their votes to other members was critical to ensuring fairness and improving committee deliberation. Although House rules strictly prohibited one Member from casting votes for another on the House floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by violations of this rule), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the 103rd Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Proxy voting promoted committee absenteeism by ensuring that legislators who skipped meetings would retain their ability to cast votes in absentia, in addition to allowing legislators to abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or against legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its merits. Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee chairmen and force Members to show up and actually participate in the work of their committees if they want their votes to count.
<p>
<p><li><b>Open Meetings.</b> The 1995 rules changes also ensure public access to committee meetings. In previous Congresses, committees frequently closed their doors to the press and public, a step the panels could take for nearly any reason. In fact, the two House committees that most often operated in secret (Appropriations and Ways and Means) were the ones making controversial choices about federal taxation and spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Further, broadcast media are permitted to cover any open hearing or meeting (previously, media coverage was subject to a vote of approval). The new rules also require that committees publish recorded committee votes in their reports (most voting records previously were available only at committee offices) and that hearing transcripts not be altered other than for minor grammatical changes.

<p><li><b>Tax Hikes More Difficult.</b> The new rules require a three-fifths vote of the House to pass any income tax rate increase and prohibit retroactive taxation of income. The 60 percent rule has been particularly controversial, with some Washington commentators claiming the new rule is anti-democratic or even unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric inside the Beltway is the conviction that new tax increases are needed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The supermajority requirement is similar to restrictions voters have imposed on numerous state legislatures. Among the most beneficial aspects of the 60 percent tax rule is that any future Congress desiring to raise taxes would have to alter or waive the rule, thereby signaling a potential tax boost. The provision also balances the burden of a 1990 budget law which effectively requires a 60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes (unless the reductions are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in entitlement spending).
<p>
<li><b>House Audit.</b> Another 1995 rules change authorized a comprehensive audit of House records, assets, and facilities by an independent accounting firm. Some House accounts previously had been audited sporadically by the General Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the fact that one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most House accounts were not examined regularly, and some may never have been reviewed by an independent examiner. This audit -- the first complete accounting of the House's financial status ever made available to the public -- uncovered 14 material weaknesses (significant deficiencies) in House accounting and financial control processes and resulted in a complete overhaul of House financial management practices.

<p><li><b>Applying Federal Laws to Congress.</b> The last of the Contract reforms was the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA). This measure has both substantive and symbolic importance. It underscores the principle that no American should be immune from the law or receive special treatment in its application. The bill also should encourage legislators to review the burdens that federal laws place on American citizens and ensure that the benefits they bring exceed their attendant costs.
</ol>

<p>
<b>EARLY SUCCESSES</b>
<p>

<b>Congressional Accountability Act.</b> After being passed by the House on its first day in session, the Congressional Accountability Act was taken up by the Senate as its first item of business. The Senate added an eleventh law, the Veterans Reemployment and Training Act, to the ten the House had applied to Congress; it also strengthened congressional employees' judicial review and appeal rights. The House quickly approved the Senate changes and sent the bill to President Clinton, who signed it on January 23.
<p>
<b>Unfunded Mandates.</b> The second piece of legislation considered by the Senate bars unfunded federal mandates on state and local governments. This was also an item in the Contract With America, though not on the list of "first-day" reforms. As with the Congressional Accountability Act, the House and Senate speedily passed this legislation, which President Clinton then signed into law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As the federal government essentially had run out of money over the past decade, Congress increasingly had resorted to laws requiring state or local governments to provide new services. Aside from upsetting the balance of federal powers, this allowed one agency of government (Congress) to expand services while leaving others to raise taxes to pay the bills. This was a sure formula both for expanding government and for increasing voter discontent. The new law requires congressional committees to assess and report the costs of any requirements imposed on states or localities. It also requires the House and Senate to vote explicitly to impose new mandates. As a result of this law, Congress has stopped even considering imposing new unfunded mandates. Rather than trigger scrutiny under the new law, congressional committees have rewritten communications, environmental, and other laws to avoid imposing new costs on state and local governments.
<p>
<b>Senate Reforms.</b> The Senate did not reform its internal procedures to the degree the House did, largely because a bipartisan tradition had allowed incremental reforms to be implemented over a number of years, making a large package unnecessary. The Senate did, however, echo the House by imposing term limits on committee chairmen and on the Majority Leader (the Senate's most influential member). The Senate also cut committee staffs by a substantial 15 percent and worked with the House to devise overall congressional budget cuts.
<p>
<b>Term Limits.</b> The new Congress also held the first-ever House vote on term limits, and provided the first serious consideration in the Senate. On March 29, 1995, as a part of the Contract With America, the House voted 227-204 in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting House and Senate service to 12 years. Though a majority favored term limits, the total was 63 votes short of the two-thirds majority necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states. In a similar fashion, the Senate voted 58-42 in favor of a "cloture" motion on term limits, like the House, garnering a simple majority, but falling short of two-thirds support.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While supporters of term limits were disappointed by the failure to achieve the two-thirds majorities necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states, at least members of the House and Senate are on record as publicly supporting or opposing term limits. Supporters now have a standard against which they can measure future Congresses, and voters will know -- unequivocally -- where their representatives stand on this important issue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Supporters of terms limits should remember that a majority in Congress voted for them; the real culprits are not in the majority, but among those Members still opposed, as well as on the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision on May 22, 1995,<sup>1</sup> the Court held that states may not impose term limits on their own representatives in Congress. At the same time, the Court indicated that Congress may not act on its own to impose term limits by statute. The impact of this decision was to invalidate 23 existing term limits laws and make a constitutional amendment essential to achieving term limits for Congress.<p><b>Budget Cuts.</b> The new Congress voted to slash its own budget. The FY 1996 legislative branch appropriations bill provided systemic congressional reforms as important as any yet enacted, including spending cuts, staff cuts, privatization, and abolition of unnecessary offices and functions. The FY 1996 and 1997 congressional budgets reduced spending in real dollars -- not phony "baseline" cuts -- by $161 million, or 9 percent below the 1995 level. Had Congress and the President made similar cuts in every other agency and program, the federal budget would be balanced next year. While cutting every program (including interest payments and Social Security) is clearly unrealistic, it is evident that Congress took its share of cuts and more.
<p>
<b>Pay and Pensions.</b> Members of Congress made personal sacrifices as well, voting in both the 1996 and 1997 appropriations cycles to freeze their own pay. Congress also approved reforms in the bloated congressional pension system. Congressional pensions far exceed most private-sector plans. Congress's pension system is up to twice as generous as those of most Fortune 500 corporations. Not only do these generous pensions burden the taxpayers, but they also promote political careerism by providing incentives for lawmakers to extend their tenure. Unfortunately, the pension reforms approved by Congress were part of the reconciliation package which was vetoed by President Clinton in November 1995.
<p>
<b>Perks.</b> Cuts in congressional perks contributed to budget savings, including a $20 million cut in franking (postage) costs achieved by cutting the budget for each Representative by one-third, bringing down the average annual allowance from $163,000 to $108,000 per office. The House achieved further savings by privatizing food services, mail handling, and other support functions.
<p>
<b>Agencies and Personnel.</b> Congress succeeded in setting an example for the rest of the government by slashing its staff and eliminating unneeded agencies, including the $21 million Office of Technology Assessment, which had provided redundant services to the national legislature. The reforms pushed the General Accounting Office to privatize its administrative functions, such as printing, mail handling, and library services. The GAO also will receive funds to contract out some of its auditing work so that it can benefit from the lower costs available in the private sector. The result is a cut of more than 25 percent in the GAO's budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In line with budget savings, Congress cut total employment by over 2,600 positions, nearly 10 percent of the total for Congress and its agencies.
<p>
<b>Lobbying Reform and Gift Ban.</b> In 1995, the House and Senate both enacted rules restricting the types and amounts of gifts lawmakers may receive. The Senate passed a complex rule that allows single gifts up to $50, with a $100 annual limit. Any item less than $10 falls outside the Senate's rules. The House chose to adopt a more sweeping proposal, offered by Speaker Newt Gingrich, to prohibit all gifts. Both the Senate rule and the House ban include exceptions for commemorative items and expenses related to official activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lobbying disclosure legislation was approved by both the House and Senate in late 1995. While this legislation would institute new reporting requirements and close loopholes in the original 1946 Lobby Reform Act, it carefully avoids many potential pitfalls. It protects legitimate grassroots organizing as well as incidental or small lobbying activities.
<p>
<b>Line-Item Veto.</b> Among the most potentially far-reaching reforms approved by the 104th Congress is the line-item veto, which will be available to the President who takes office in January 1997. The removal of presidential impoundment authority (the practice of refusing to spend all the money Congress appropriated) in the 1974 budget reforms was one factor in the continuing stream of high deficits from that year on. Despite partisan differences, the 104th Congress agreed that the President should be able to excise unneeded items from appropriations bills and send them back to Congress. Unless both houses can muster a two-thirds vote to override the President's objections, the spending cuts stand. This is a power used by 43 state governors and, effectively, by Presidents prior to 1974. Ronald Reagan repeatedly asked Congress for just this authority. The 104th Congress's approval of the line-item veto was an act of political magnanimity and unmatched institutional restraint.
<p>

<b>CONTINUING REFORMS</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As impressive as this list of reform accomplishments is, even more impressive is the fact that leaders and members of the 104th Congress remain committed to further reforms. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has vowed that a term limits amendment will be the first item of business for the House in the next Congress. Balanced budget and tax limitation amendments also will be brought back for consideration. Several House and Senate committees are considering changes in the budget process, which probably will be altered in 1997.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Newly installed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is exploring ways to streamline Senate procedures, and separate Republican and Democratic task forces in the House have issued reports urging further changes in House procedures. These are likely to result in another opening-day package of House rules changes in January 1997. Among the most likely items for action is a Congressional Freedom of Information Act, which would make information about Congress more widely available on the Internet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other House rules changes which have widespread support are a truth in testimony proposal to require witnesses testifying before congressional committees to disclose the amount of federal grants and contracts they receive, and a proposal to require sponsors of legislation to cite specific authority from the Constitution to justify it. Following up on the Unfunded Mandates Act, Senator Ted Stevens and others are promoting legislation to enforce the Tenth Amendment and its reservation of powers to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Too often, revolutionaries who seize power become too much like the leaders they overthrew. Some Americans may even fear that this has happened to the 104th Congress. But a review of congressional reform accomplishments over the last two years shows that the reformers stayed true to their cause. They achieved most of their goals (and even exceed some) and remain committed to further political reform in the next Congress.

<h3>
HOW THE 104TH CONGRESS HAS PROTECTED THE NATION'S SECURITY</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/moore.html">Thomas Moore</a><br>
Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nowhere has the failure of presidential leadership been more stark and disturbing than in defense and foreign policy. Failures in economic and domestic policy are bad enough. But negligence, complacency, incompetence, and self-delusion in national security are matters of life and death, as the terrorist bombing of the U.S. barracks in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, so tragically attests. When the Commander in Chief is not up to the job, lives are lost and vital national interests are injured.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The President, as Commander in Chief, has the primary constitutional responsibility for the conduct of U.S. foreign and defense policy. But the Framers of the Constitution wisely did not place all the responsibility in the President's hands: The constitutional system of checks and balances assigns much of the responsibility for national security to Congress. Under Article I, Section 8, "The Congress shall have Power to... provide for the common Defence and general welfare of the United States... ," including the power "To declare war... To Raise and support Armies... To provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.... "

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress exercises oversight authority for the conduct of foreign and security policy through the authorization and appropriation of funds for executive branch agencies. The Senate also has specific national security responsibilities, both through its power to confirm Administration appointments and officers of the armed services and, most significantly, through its role in approving or disapproving the ratification of treaties, as spelled out in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 104th Congress has performed with great credit in carrying out these responsibilities, though in some cases the results have not been commensurate with the quality or intensity of the effort. Indeed, there are limits to what Congress can do to protect the nation's security if the Commander in Chief persists in following misguided policies, or is guilty of slipshod execution of sound policies. In any case, the 104th Congress has mitigated the worst consequences of President Clinton's record on national defense and foreign affairs, and has provided balance against Clinton excesses, negligence, and irresponsible actions. Highlights of congressional accomplishments in national security include:
<ul>
<p><li>Making national missile defense a congressional leadership issue. Though the proposed Defend America Act of 1996 has yet to be enacted, it has given supporters of national missile defense the political initiative and has exposed the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the Clinton Administration on the most vital of all defense issues.
<p>


<li>As part of the missile defense effort, focusing attention on the need to withdraw or substantially modify the 1972 ABM Treaty and providing a statutory reminder that substantive changes in the Treaty must be brought before the Senate for advice and consent to ratification.

<p><li> Restoring needed funds to the defense budget to offset the severe, chronic budget shortfall inherent in the Administration's Bottom-Up Review force levels and its five-year defense plan.

<p><li> Allocating substantial new funds to modernize the forces and rebuild combat readiness.

<p><li> Acting to renew the NATO alliance by a series of votes calling for enlargement of the alliance to include newly independent democracies in Central Europe.

<p><li> Cutting foreign aid and instituting organizational reforms in the State Department and in foreign operations accounts to eliminate waste and duplication.
</ul>
<p>
<b>THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration's misguided policies in foreign and defense policy were a prime target of the Contract With America. Alarmed over Clinton's defense budget cuts and failure to move rapidly toward a national missile defense system, Republicans and conservative Democrats committed to the Contract promised to restore America's military strength. And early in the 104th Congress, they worked to fulfill their promise.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On February 7, 1995, the House of Representatives passed the National Security Revitalization Act (H.R. 7), which sought to establish a commission to eliminate the funding shortfall in defense, set a new policy for the development and deployment of missile defenses, expand NATO membership, and limit the authority of the President to subordinate U.S. troops to United Nations command.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Senate did not take up H.R. 7, but parts of the bill did find their way into different pieces of Senate legislation, such as the defense and foreign relations authorization bills. While not all of the original Contract items were included in final legislation reconciling differences between the House and Senate -- for example, Congress dropped the House demand for a commission to examine U.S. national security strategy -- conservative supporters of the Contract delivered on the majority of their promises to the American people.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress undertook a number of other foreign and defense policy initiatives that complement and supplement the national security planks of the Contract With America. For example, the new majority in Congress has endeavored to:
<p>
<b>Restore America's military strength.</b> Congress approved a defense spending bill that added $7 billion to the defense budget request submitted by President Clinton. This money was needed not only to keep America's armed forces trained and combat ready, but also to maintain a force with modern high-technology weapons in the 21st century. Because he needed congressional support for his Bosnia mission, President Clinton bowed to demands from the Hill and signed the defense appropriations bill for FY 1996, which provided the additional $7 billion above his original defense budget request.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, the President vetoed the accompanying FY 1996 defense authorization bill, which would have 1) provided more funds to maintain the technological superiority of U.S. forces; 2) authorized a pay raise and housing allowance increase for military personnel (including those deployed to Bosnia); and 3) mandated the defense of the U.S. homeland against ballistic missiles. The veto was narrowly upheld, and Congress found it necessary to weaken the missile defense provisions of the bill in order to secure its enactment with the President's signature.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the FY 1997 defense authorization bill, Congress has added more than $11.2 billion to the defense budget and has maintained a vigorous missile defense program -- or at least as vigorous as can be expected under the threat of another veto from a White House which gives lip service to missile defense while steadily undermining any real prospects for deployment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Move the United States closer to a national missile defense system. The FY 1996 defense authorization bill -- approved by Congress but vetoed by the President -- sought to establish a clear timetable for development and deployment of both national and theater missile defenses. Further, it sought to bar the application of Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty restrictions to theater defense systems. However, the President refused to sign the defense bill, giving as his primary reason the strong missile defense provisions it contained. He prevailed, forcing Congress to weaken missile defense in the final 1996 defense authorization bill. Once again, the President succeeded in blocking this country's ability to defend its citizens from nuclear attack, and Congress was not able to muster enough votes to override his veto.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the second session of the 104th Congress, both House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) sponsored the Defend America Act of 1996, which would mandate the development and deployment by a specific date of limited missile defenses of the U.S. homeland. This Act has not yet won approval, but the strong opposition of the Clinton Administration further illustrates the lengths to which the President is prepared to go to ensure the strategic status quo, which defends the 1972 ABM Treaty instead of defending Americans and leaves the U.S. vulnerable to the increasing proliferation of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction.
<p>

<b>Cut foreign aid.</b> While the new Republican majority promised extensive cuts in foreign aid, little has transpired by way of revamping America's wasteful foreign aid programs. Federal spending on foreign aid will likely be only $2 billion less in FY 1996 than it was in FY 1995. However, under the umbrella of a balanced budget by the year 2002, further cuts are likely. While current cuts amount to nearly 30 percent for all programs except aid to Israel and Egypt, much still needs to be done. One step in the right direction is a new law requiring that the U.S. government report on the progress being made by foreign aid recipients developing free markets, the main engine of economic development. This effort was inspired by The Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i>, a global comparison of economic freedom in 142 countries.
<p>
<b>End the Castro dictatorship in Cuba.</b> Congress passed, and the President signed, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act just a few days after Cuba downed two U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international waters on February 24, 1996. This legislation, which tightens the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba and allows American citizens to seek compensation for property stolen by Castro, is another step toward hastening the end of Castro's dictatorship.
<p>
<b>Reorganize the State Department.</b> Congress proposed to cut waste in the State Department and foreign operations accounts by consolidating several independent foreign policy agencies within the State Department. This effort, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), had the support of Secretary of State Warren Christopher until bureaucratic interests within the Administration persuaded him to oppose it. Key legislation to move the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), Agency for International Development (AID), and other foreign policy agencies into the State Department was approved by a House-Senate conference committee in March 1996. The President has vowed to veto this legislation if it is approved by Congress.
<p>
<b>Express reservations on sending U.S. troops to Bosnia.</b> In December 1995, the House and Senate passed resolutions to support the U.S. troops being deployed on the peacekeeping mission to Bosnia. These resolutions, however, did not endorse the President's decision to deploy them, and also raised questions about the wisdom of American involvement in a mission lacking clear goals. The House went so far as to vote to cut off funds for the Bosnia mission.
<p>
<b>Maintain America's trade relations with China by approving most-favored-nation trade status for China.</b> In June 1996, the Congress sustained most-favored-nation trading status for China. This decision reflects the belief, held by a majority in Congress, that increasing economic interaction is the best way to promote economic reform and advance political liberalization and human rights.
<p>
<b>Protect the U.S. relationship with Taiwan.</b> In the face of Administration resistance to granting Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui a visa to visit his alma mater Cornell University, Congress voted with near unanimity in May 1995 to support his visit. As a result, the President reversed course and granted the visa. Also, both the House and Senate have included provisions in the 1996 State Department authorization bill that would give precedence to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act over U.S.-China government-to-government communiqus when considering future weapons exports to Taiwan. U.S. China policy too often is framed by communiqus that have no force of law, international or domestic. The Taiwan Relations Act, however, is the law of the land. The President has vowed to veto the bill if approved by Congress.
<p>


<b>UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the 104th Congress has done much to mitigate the Clinton Administration's negative impact on national security, much remains to be done. Working within its constitutional, budget, and oversight prerogatives, Congress needs to adopt a concerted strategy -- and initiate a legislative campaign based on that strategy -- to restore America's lost credibility abroad and dispel doubts around the world about U.S. leadership.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The first step is to continue the good work of the 104th Congress to reverse the neglect and decline of U.S. military strength that has characterized the Clinton Administration. Proper congressional action can encourage the development of a clear and coherent foreign and defense policy grounded in American principles and national interest, replacing the Clinton Administration's politicizing of defense and indifference to foreign policy, which have created only muddle and confusion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress must ensure that the U.S. preserves the capacity to act unilaterally when U.S. interests are threatened. This means rejecting the false notion that U.S. power must be "legitimized" by operating through some international or multilateral agency like the United Nations. Congress must make sure that the Clinton policy of "assertive multilateralism" does not subordinate clear national interests to the U.N. and other supranational entities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to assert its prerogatives to prevent more dubious foreign interventions like Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia which turn the U.S. military into an international social work agency. Clinton's vague global utopianism has misused the military, gotten American soldiers needlessly killed, and wasted scarce defense dollars. If Congress does not intervene properly in such cases, American military strength and credibility will continue to be frittered away in "peace operations" which provide little or no benefit to the nation's security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to provide adequate funds and resources to preserve the core mission of the armed forces: to fight and win wars in defense of U.S. strategic interests and existing military alliance commitments. Under Clinton, American fighting forces are weaker and less able to deal with larger military contingencies in areas like Korea or the Persian Gulf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In keeping with this duty, Congress must end the weakening of the armed forces caused by the imposition of a radical social agenda of "political correctness."  The President has imposed his radical vision on the military services by pushing women into combat positions before their effectiveness has been tested or their impact on combat effectiveness honestly evaluated. He has advocated the admission of acknowledged homosexuals into the ranks, contrary to the judgment of the nation's top military leaders. The result has been a corrosion of the mutual trust between leaders and those they lead that is essential to unit cohesion and combat effectiveness. Congress must intervene to protect the morale and combat effectiveness of America's fighting forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress must also continue to press for deployment of the most effective theater and national missile defenses possible. If the President and his advisors continue to use the 1972 ABM Treaty as an excuse not to defend Americans from the growing threat of ballistic missiles, Congress should remove the Treaty as the chief impediment to meeting this vital requirement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many in Congress are unnecessarily intimidated by the prospects of dealing with the ABM Treaty. The Constitution establishes treaties duly ratified as part of the "supreme Law of the Land."  But the law of the land consists of the U.S. Constitution; "laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof;" and then "all Treaties... which shall be made under the Authority of the United States" -- <i>in that order</i>. In other words, treaties are not supreme over statute law or provisions of the Constitution itself. Treaties, like the Constitution and other federal laws, are subject to change or amendment. They are not permanently unalterable like the laws of the Medes and the Persians. Congress may overturn the ABM Treaty by a simple statute declaring it null and void.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The mistakes, misjudgments, and missed opportunities that have characterized the Clinton Administration's approach to foreign and defense policy over the past four years are serious. They have weakened U.S. influence and credibility abroad and, unless rectified, could lead inevitably to America's decline as a great power capable of defending its values and interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For America, it is either lead or be led. The first road leads to freedom, security, and greatness; the second, to weakness and submission. For America's own well-being, and for that of the entire globe, U.S. leadership must be restored. If the Administration cannot or will not provide this leadership, Congress must hold it publicly and politically accountable and then, insofar as the Constitution and good public policy allow, step into the breach to safeguard America's national security.

   <h1>Tom McClintock</h1>

</center>
 
<p>

Tom McClintock serves as Director of Economic 
and Regulatory Affairs for the Claremont 
Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies 
in Sacramento.  He is the foremost spokesman 
in California on conservative fiscal policy and state 
government waste.

<p>

Mr. McClintock is the author of the most 
comprehensive survey of state government waste 
available and has published numerous articles 
on the state's finances. He is regularly quoted in 
budget and fiscal stories from Sacramento.  
Of his work, Dan Walters of the <i>Sacramento Bee</i> has 
written that Tom McClintock has "consistently 
been one of the very few legislators who's been 
right about what California is experiencing."  
In May 1993, Tim Ferguson of the <i>Wall Street 
Journal</i> observed, "Mr. McClintock remains 
about the only man in California who has 
consistently projected correctly the magnitude of 
the budget crises of the 1990s."  The <i>Orange 
County Register</i> said,  "Former Assemblyman 
Tom McClintock has consistently been among the 
most accurate forecasters of the effects of state 
tax and spending policies."

<p>

McClintock was first elected to the California Legislature 
in 1982 at age 26, and 
immediately earned a reputation as a freshman who 
was unafraid to stand up to legislative 
leaders.  Within two years, he became Assembly 
Republican Whip, a leadership position he held 
for five years.  In 1987 he jointly authored the 
Mello-Condit-McClintock Tax Rebate Act, which 
returned $1.1 billion of tax over-collections to 
the taxpayers of California.  In 1992, he authored 
California's current lethal injection death penalty law.

<p>

For a period of four years, beginning in 1978, 
McClintock wrote a newspaper column which 
he syndicated nationally in 1980.  From 1980-82, 
McClintock served as Chief of Staff to Senator 
Ed Davis.  He is a recognized expert in parliamentary 
law and is designated as one of the fewer 
than 2,000 Professional Registered Parliamentarians 
in the United States by the National 
Association of Parliamentarians.

<p>
Active in Republican politics since 1972, he served 
from 1973-1974 as president of the 
California Student Republican Organization; from 
1979 to 1981 as Republican County Chairman 
for Ventura County; and from 1985 to 1992 as Resolutions 
Chairman for the California Republican party.

<p>

In 1984, McClintock was named one of five 
outstanding young Californians by the 
California Jaycees and received the civilian 
Medal of Merit from the Ventura County Peace 
Officers Association for rescuing an elderly man 
from a condominium fire in 1985.  He has been 
honored by numerous taxpayer associations around 
the state for his leadership on state budget issues.

<p>

From 1992-1994, McClintock served as Director 
of the Center for the California Taxpayer, a 
project of the National Tax Limitation Foundation.  
In 1994, he overwhelmingly received the 
Republican nomination for California State Controller, 
narrowly losing the general election by one and a half points.

<p>

Tom McClintock and his wife, Lori, have two children, ages 3 and 5.

</center>

Just prior to the 104th Congress, Catherine A. Deeds joined the 
Family Research Council in 1994 as a lobbyist to both the U.S. 
Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. Her responsibilities 
include developing legislative strategy, meeting and working with 
key decision makers on Capitol Hill, and tracking current policy 
developments. With a broad understanding of the legislative 
process, Miss Deeds focuses on specific family issues that 
incorporate her policy skills and background.

<p>

Formerly a Legislative Assistant in 1993 for freshman U.S. 
Congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina, Miss Deeds followed 
a number of domestic policy issues such as health care, labor, 
veterans, senior citizens, religion, and family.

<p>

Miss Deeds gained key legislative experience with family policy 
issues in several different arenas especially during a political 
appointment in the Bush Administration. In 1992, Miss Deeds 
assisted the management of the Office of the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Legislation in the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. She served as a liaison and political appointee 
in the Bush Administration to over two hundred Congressional Offices 
on public health issues.

<p>

On Capitol Hill in 1991, Miss Deeds worked as Policy Analyst for 
the House Republican Study Committee where she performed extensive 
research and writing on issues including health care, civil 
rights, labor, family, and education.

<p>

In 1989, Miss Deeds established her expertise on family issues as 
she served on a House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and 
Families. This position included not only the reporting on various 
topics affecting children and families but also the screening 
of witnesses for Congressional hearings.

<p>

From 1987-1989, Miss Deeds served at Free Congress Research and 
Education Foundation as Managing Editor of the monthly Family 
Protection Report and later, Associate Editor of the twenty-four 
page, monthly Family, Law & Democracy Report.

<p>

Cathy Deeds currently serves on the board of directors at a crisis 
pregnancy center and Advisory Board for American Collegians for 
Life, has volunteered for five campaigns for pro-life candidates, 
and founded the Arlington chapter of the Virginia Society for Human 
Life.

<p>

In 1986, Cathy graduated from Marquette University with a Bachelor of 
Arts in Journalism.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Information Society was
formally introduced in June 1994, in Corfu, Greece, with the issuance of
the so-called Bangemann Report, Europe and the Global Information Society,
and its implementing successor, released in July 1994, Europe's Way to the
Information Society, An Action Plan. Since that time, the European Union
has become aggressively involved in the regulation of all aspects of the
information society. The results take Europe in a direction potentially
at odds with North America and the rest of the world, damaging the European
Union's trading partners and -- as <A HREF="ggindex.html">Discovery Senior
Fellow, George Gilder </A>alleges -- Europe itself.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">Two themes characterize the European Commission's
position on the information society: federalism and protectionism. The Commission
has taken a broad and in-depth view of its role in the development of the
European information society, and is promulgating laws on the Internet to
govern the 15 independent European Union member states. In fact, the European
Union appears to be utilizing the advent of the information society to facilitate
the exercise -- and some would argue the expansion -- of its federal powers.
It also is utilizing the information society as a means of adopting protectionist
legislation that conflicts with the inherently global nature of the Internet,
and that could threaten to diminish that very integral aspect of the Internet.
Recently-adopted and proposed EC (European Community) legislation in the
area of intellectual property serve as examples of these two characterizing
themes of the EC's approach.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Commission's launching of its Information
Society initiatives followed closely on the heels of the Clinton administration's
announcement of a U.S. federal focus on the &quot;information superhighway.&quot;
The U.S. approach to the information superhighway, going back to at least
1994, appeared to be directed toward the same stance as that of the European
government's. Vice President Gore announced the Clinton Administration's
willingness to intervene in the Internet if private interests failed to
promote an agenda which conformed to the vision of a widely-accessible,
safe new medium for U.S. citizens to deploy in both philanthropic and commercial
ways. But he also made clear the Administration's preference for private
development and little regulaiton. The U.S. Congress has been even more
inclined to preserve a an open, free-market environment. With certain notable
exceptions (the Clipper Chip, the Communications Decency Act), the U.S.
federal government has intervened in regulation of the Internet to a much
lesser extent than the EC, and when adopting or proposing laws, ihas shown
greater respect for free trade principles.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The EC's federalist and protectionist position,
when compared with the more decentralized, balanced position of the United
States, can be explained by certain economic facts. First, it is undisputed
that the U.S. is the technological leader in software, telecommunications,
and other information society technologies. Widely-reported balance-of-trade
figures support this common understanding. Second, while the U.S. has the
benefit of existing federal laws to govern certain critical aspects of the
Internet, the EC is still--in many respects--in the formative stages of
creating a European nation-state. While a unified European information society
can benefit U.S. interests by providing a single, more integrated European
market, the EC's aggressive investigation into regulation of Internet-related
laws should be carefully monitored by U.S. industry, to ensure that such
&quot;federally&quot; promulgated laws do not unfairly prejudice U.S. information
interests. Moreover, international trade negotiations need to consider whether
creation of globally-fragmented Internet-related laws threaten to devalue
one of the key assets of the Internet -- its inherently free and global
nature.<BR>

</FONT></TT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">One need only look to current laws being proposed,
investigated and adopted to support the proposition that the EC views the
information society as a key mechanism for promoting a unified Europe. Virtually
all aspects of the information society -- from education and privacy, to
technical standards and intellectual property -- are being reviewed by the
EC. The following is a summary of just a fraction of the European initiatives
which have been promulgated since mid-1994 in regards to the information
society.</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Commission derives its power from
the European Treaty and has the authority to regulate the laws of the individual
European member states, now numbering 15, to the extent such laws create
disharmony in the European market. In the intellectual property area, it
is the position of the European Court of Justice that, under the European
Treaty, the European government has the power to regulate the exercise of
intellectual property rights, but not the existence of such rights. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">However, recently-adopted European legislation
indeed appears to legislate even the existence of such rights, in an ever-increasing
expansion of federal power. For example, the recently-effective Directive
on the Term of Protection of Copyrights extended by 20 years the length
of copyright in most member states, and revived certain copyrights that
had expired. Similarly, the recently-adopted EC Directive on the Legal Protection
of Databases creates intellectual property rights in databases where, under
the laws of certain member states, none existed; and the recently-created
Community Trademark, in essence, creates a unified bundle of national trademark
rights, where heretofore recourse to each individual national trademark
authority was required to obtain such rights. These are examples of areas
in which legal rights are being created by the European government which
were historically--and under the European Treaty still are--within the sole
province of the member states' governments.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">This centralized promulgation of laws can, in fact,
be advantageous to U.S. information industries. Brussels is becoming a location
at which Euuropean interest groups can consolidate their lobbying efforts.
Also, unified laws across the 15 European Union countries can result in
lower cost-of-entry barriers to marketing goods and services in Europe.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">However, these advantages are lost when the centrally-promulgated
laws discriminate against non-EU individuals and entities. Such discriminatory
treatment, at least in the intellectual property area, is growing more common.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Pica">III. Protectionist approach <BR>
</FONT></TT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The Internet is widely regarded as potentially
the single most important technological contribution to global human communication,
education and societal relationships since the telephone, the television,
and the computer. As such, laws should be developed globally to benefit
those who wish to participate individually or commercially in such medium.
The Internet is inherently borderless. Technologies are just being developed
to enable more segmented, selective deployment of the Internet; however,
the basic presumption -- and value -- of the Internet is that it is instantaneously
global. Fragmented laws governing the Internet complicate its effectiveness,
and jeopardize its global utility. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Commission publicly recognizes the
importance of the global nature of the Internet, and even acknowledges the
need for international cooperation in its development. However, recently
promulgated laws indicate that the EC will utilize its federal power, as
well as the new ease with which foreign companies can enter the European
market to promote its own industries and interests. A comparison of recent
parallel intellectual property legislation on both sides of the Atlantic
illustrates the differences in the EU and U.S. approaches to regulating
Internet interests.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The recently-effective EC Directive on the Term
of Copyright Protection explicitly excludes from extended protection works
of authorship which are of non-EU member state origin. By contrast, the
proposed U.S. Copyright Extension Act would extend copyright protection
for all World Trade Organization member individuals and corporate authors.
Where the EC Directive discriminates, the proposed U.S. law does not. The
EC acknowledges this discrimination in its preparatory comments to adoption
of this Directive, indicating that it wishes to encourage non-EU governments
to extend their term of copyright protection. As a trading partner with
vast riches of rather aging intellectual properties -- art, literature,
music -- Europe has obvious interests in extending the term of copyright
protection for such assets, particularly as a result of the expanded use
in the multimedia revolution. Nonetheless, one can ask whether this justifies
adopting legislation which creates a fragmented market -- where copyrights
are protected in some countries (e.g., the EU), and not in others (e.g.,
the U.S.); and where copyrights of certain national origin are given extended
protection, and others are not. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">Similarly, the EC Directive on the Legal Protection
of Databases grants added protection for previously unprotected databases,
but only provided the interested party has a registered office in an EU
member state and has an ongoing operational link with an EU member state.
By contrast, the proposed U.S. Database Investment and Intellectual Property
Piracy Act of 1996 would, if adopted, accord increased protection for databases
on a non-discriminatory basis. Again, the result of the EC laws is a fragmentation
of the global market for such products, and, a consequential complication
and, therefore, suppression of the market. Insofar as the present state
of the Internet results in instantaneous and low-cost global distribution,
such fragmented laws conflict with the utilization of this uniquely global
resource. While it can be argued that the EC's discriminatory position was
based on legitimate motivation--encouraging industries to locate and operate
within the European Union--the fragmentation of the market that results
from such discrimination is against the inherent nature of the Internet.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Pica">IV. Conclusion<BR>
</FONT></TT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The adoption of protectionist laws is obviously
not new to global politics. If a country can adopt internal laws which create
competitive advantage, its global trade and negotiating strength can be
increased. When a centralized force such as the European Union can use its
federal power to effectuate protectionist laws of 15 countries, the competitive
force of such an exercise of power is multiplied. However, adopting this
protectionist approach when promulgating laws which govern the Internet
results in obstacles to the effective use and development of such a medium.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">One could advocate that the U.S. retaliate by mirroring
such a protectionist stance in its own Internet-related laws. However, this
approach may only result in a further global fragmentation of legal use
of the Internet for global communications and commerce. The solution lies
rather in encouraging global cooperation on laws which directly impact the
use of the Internet, in the interests of all users. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">Rather than directing laws -- and technology --
toward a global fragmentation of the Internet, governments should be seeking
ways to preserve this inherently international asset. Rather than view the
information society and its technologies as an opportunity to gain nationalistic
competitive advantage, governments should nurture this resource as a means
of integrating global resources into a single, unified whole.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT FACE="Courier New">Postscript:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Courier New">
My Discovery Institute colleague, Senior Fellow George Gilder, adds this
qualifying comment on the argument made here.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">&quot;By submitting the Internet to Eurosclerosis,
the European Union will only assure continued decline of its economies in
the new age of networks. The Internet is inherently global and will route
around the attempts to nationalize, commisionize or parochialize it.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">In other words, European efforts at protectionism
damage Europe more than anyone -- and ultimately must fail.</FONT> <BR>

</center>

Once a gladiator in the trenches of the National Football
League, now a pro-family advocate, Phillip V. Olsen joined the
Family Research Council in 1992 where he is Vice President for
Resource Development.  In his new capacity, the former professional
athlete directs his energies into marketing the pro-family, policy,
lobbying and educational organization.  As FRC takes its analysis
of pro-family policy to our nation's leaders and lawmakers, Mr.
Olsen and his Resource Development team broadcast the news about
FRC to its supporters nationwide.  His work involves the coordination
of resource development and grass roots networking as well as
the oversight of programs, activities and events that deliver
the message of FRC.

<p>

Mr. Olsen may be best known as a consensus first team collegiate
All-American Defensive End who was also a first-round NFL draft
choice in 1970. From there the two year All-American went on to
play nine years in the NFL, until his retirement in 1979.  A highly
decorated athlete during his athletic career, he was inducted
into the State of Utah Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.  He was also
named to Utah State University's All-Century football team in
1993 and was inducted into it's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994.

<p>

As a concerned professional athlete, Mr. Olsen, and his brothers
Merlin and Orrin, originated and operated the Olsen Brothers All
Sports Camps throughout the western U.S.  He has also initiated
a number of student/athlete enhancement programs to promote athletic
and academic achievement. Mr. Olsen has continued his career
in sports through his work as a color commentator covering college
football on radio and as a member of the NBC TV broadcast support
team covering two Super Bowls and numerous other college and NFL
football games.

<p>

In business, Mr. Olsen has more than twenty years experience
in commercial/industrial real estate.  His experience includes
expertise in real estate finance, development, brokerage and investor
equity funding.

<p>

Active in community service, Mr. Olsen has served as chairman
of the NFL Players Association Men's Committee for Childhelp USA,
a national not-for-profit organization serving abused and battered
children.  He has also been actively involved with a number of
other charities and volunteer organizations such as Life to Life,
Sigma Chi Fraternity, the California Care Coalition, the Billy
Graham Crusade, &quot;Men at the Marriott&quot;, Friends of the
Family Research Council, and South Coast Community Church.

<p>

Mr. Olsen graduated from Utah State University in 1970 with a
Bachelor's degree in business and economics. He and his wife Connie
and their two daughters live in Maryland.

</center>

In 1994, Miss Hansen joined the Family Research Council's Media
Department to facilitate the networking of information between
television, print, and radio contacts and FRC's Policy Experts.
Hansen's communication skills are a factor in FRC's rapidly growing
media presence in Washington, D.C. and nation-wide. 

<p>

Her responsibilities at FRC include handling all broadcast media
requests in the area of news and talk radio as well as planning
outgoing radio tours of FRC policy experts. In addition, Hansen
associates with television and print contacts along with the Director
of Communications in order to clearly present FRC's pro-family
message far and wide. As an effective spokesperson on politics,
policy, and the media, Hansen helps FRC in generating up to a
thousand clips a month and daily broadcast interviews.  

<p>

Hansen also works extensively on the media strategy for FRC's
special projects, such as the &quot;Save Sex&quot; campaign, 
<I>Let Freedom Ring: A Basic Outline of American History</I>, <I>The
Children of Table 34</I> video, and <I>A Family Fourth: Independence
Day and Other Celebrations</I>.

<p>

Hansen's experience includes work in a sports marketing firm
and in the development of athletic ministries. Native of Southern
California, Hansen graduated from Princeton University in 1994
receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in English.

</center>

William (Bill) R. Mattox, Jr. serves as Vice President for Policy 
at the Family Research Council in Washington, D.C.  In that capacity, 
Mattox does considerable writing and speaking, particularly on issues 
related to family economics, childrearing, father absence, work and 
family, marriage and divorce, family trends, and human sexuality.

<p>

A 1993 recipient of an Amy Foundation Writing Award, Mattox's writings 
have appeared in: 

<p><ul>

<li>national publications like <I>
<a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/matoxdoc.html">The Wall Street Journal</a>, 
USA Today, The Washington Post,  The Washington Times</I>, and 
<I>Reader's Digest</I>;

<p>

<li>regional newspapers, including <I>The Miami Herald, The Cleveland 
Plain-Dealer, The Atlanta Journal, The Tampa Tribune, The Detroit News, 
The Orange County Register, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Houston 
Post, The San Diego Union, The Sacramento Bee, The Arizona Republic,</I> 
and <I>The Richmond Times-Dispatch</I>;

<p>

<li>opinion magazines like <I>Policy Review, Family Policy, Congressional 
Quarterly Researcher, Human Events</I>, and <I>Children Today</I>; and

<p>

<li>monographs and books, including chapters in <I>Family in America: 
Opposing Viewpoints</I> and <I>Stronger Families or Bigger Government</I>.

</ul><p>

Mattox has testified before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, the U.S. 
House Ways and Means Committee, the U.S. Senate Labor and Human 
Resources Committee, the U.S. Labor Department, and the U.S. House 
Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. 

<p>

He has appeared on NBC, CNN, C-SPAN, CBN, PBS, NET, and FOX, and 
given speeches at forums sponsored by The Heritage Foundation, The 
Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the U.S. Catholic 
Conference, the Institute for American Values, and others.  

<p>

Mattox also has served as project director for three national public 
opinion surveys, a series of six Capitol Hill briefings on The Family 
Time Famine, and two public education advertising campaigns (one 
which promotes responsible fatherhood and one which touts the benefits 
of saving sex for marriage).

<p>

Prior to joining FRC in 1985, Mattox worked for U.S. Congressman 
Elliott H. Levitas and U.S. Senator Sam Nunn.

<p>

Mattox graduated <I>summa cum laude</I> from the University of 
Georgia's School of Journalism, and has done graduate work in the 
sociology of work, family, and gender roles at the University of 
Maryland.  He and his wife, Jill, live in northern Virginia with 
their three children:  Allison (8), David (5), and Richard (2).

</center>

Robert H. Knight examines cutting-edge social issues that affect and 
are affected by cultural values.  Of special interest are federal 
policies relating to arts funding, sex-related topics and education, 
censorship and freedom of expression, as well as the role of public 
interest groups and the media.  Mr. Knight wrote, produced and 
directed the 1994 FRC video documentary about Alfred Kinsey, <I>The 
Children of Table 34.</I>

<p>

Prior to joining FRC, Mr. Knight headed a similar program as Senior 
Fellow for Cultural Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation.  
That program examined federal policies that undermine the traditional 
values of family sovereignty, religious freedom, property rights, 
individual responsibility and the idea of limited government.

<p>

While at Heritage, Mr. Knight authored studies on the 
<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95a1cu.html">National Endowment for the 
Arts</A>, the U.S. Labor Department's regulatory disputes with the 
Salvation Army, the federal role in early childhood education, and 
the debate over the exemption of women from military combat roles. 
He testified before the U.S. Senate's Labor and Human Resources 
Committee in July 1994 as well as the Presidential Commission on the 
Assignment of Women in the Armed Services in 1992, and was an expert 
witness in the 1993 Colorado legal case dealing with Amendment 2, 
which barred cities from extending special civil rights protections 
based on sexual orientation.  He also testified in January 1995 before 
a House Appropriations subcommittee concerning the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting and at a CPB public hearing in Washington in 
January 1994.

<p>

Before joining Heritage in September 1990, Mr. Knight was a Media 
Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, where he 
researched and began writing a book on cultural relativism.

<p>

Mr. Knight was a news editor and writer with the <I>Los Angeles 
Times</I>, where he worked for seven years prior to his Hoover 
fellowship.  During his 15 years in journalism, Mr. Knight has 
written for <I> The Wall Street Journal, National Review, Chicago 
Tribune, Philadelphia Inquirer, Baltimore Sun, Washington Times, 
San Francisco Chronicle, Orange County Register</I> and other 
publications.  He has appeared on the <i>CBS Evening News, NBC 
Nightly News</i>, ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i>, CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, NPR's <i>All Things 
Considered</i>, CNN's <i>Sonya Live</i>, CNBC'S <i>McLaughlin</i>, 
NBC's <i>A Closer Look</i>, NPR's <i>Fresh Air,</i> a PBS special 
on the arts and other television and radio broadcasts.

<p>

Mr. Knight worked for the <I>Fort Lauderdale News/Sun Sentinel</I> 
as a weekend project coordinator and copy editor, with the 
<I>Maryland Gazette </I>as assistant editor and the <I>Annapolis 
Evening Capital</I> as a reporter, and as a reporter and later 
editor of the <I>Maryland Coast Press</I>.

<p>

Mr. Knight has a Master's degree and a Bachelor of Science degree 
in political science from American University in Washington, D.C.

<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95c2dr.html">Legalization of Drugs: 
The Myths and The Facts</a>: an article by Robert L. Maginnis

<p>

After a distinguished career in the U.S. military, Lieutenant 
Colonel Robert (Bob) L. Maginnis, USA Ret., joined the Family 
Research Council in 1994 to handle one of the most difficult 
social problems facing American society and American families 
today -- the crisis of crime.  In addition, Colonel Maginnis' 
skills as an analyst, writer, speaker and team leader will be 
applied to family issues impacted by military/foreign affairs 
policy and cultural issues. Already nationally known as an expert 
on the Pentagon and a spokesman on military issues, Colonel 
Maginnis brings to FRC a broad perspective on today's toughest 
issues.

<p>

In his many roles, Colonel Maginnis has appeared on ABC, NBC and 
CBS evening news shows, CBS "This Morning," "The MacNeil/Lehrer 
Newshour," CNBC "Cal Thomas," CNN's "Crossfire" and "Larry King 
Live" as well as other programs, such as "Donohue," and on numerous 
networks.  He has been quoted many times in newspapers across the 
country from the <I>New York Times</I> to the <I>LA Times</I>.  
His editorial pieces have been published in the <I>Washington 
Times, Orange County Register, Chicago Tribune, The Miami Herald</I> 
and elsewhere. And the colonel has been featured on most major radio 
shows nationwide.

<p>

In July 1993, Colonel Maginnis retired from an assignment in 
the Pentagon where he served as an Inspector General.  He is 
an airborne-ranger infantry officer with an assignment history 
that includes Korea, Germany, Alaska, and several posts in the 
continental United States.  He served in command and staff 
positions in four infantry divisions from platoon to division 
level.  The colonel was the chief for the U.S. Army Infantry 
School's leadership training branch.  He developed curricula, 
taught, participated in leader development research and consulted 
with leaders and soldiers throughout the Army. He is the author of 
more than fifty articles published in professional military 
journals concerning ethics, leadership, and personnel matters 
impacting the military.

<p>

In the last eight months of his military service, Colonel Maginnis 
was a member of the Army's study group examining the homosexual 
ban.  He also was advisor to the Defense Department Military 
Working Group on homosexuals in the military.  In that role, he 
debated the issue in the media as well as speaking in various forums 
-- including testifying before a House subcommittee. Because of his 
expertise, Colonel Maginnis is also, on occasion, a spokesman for 
the Defense Readiness Council, a non-profit organization that led 
the fight to keep the homosexual ban.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis' service in the armed forces was commended with 
the Legion of Merit, the highest peacetime decoration, as well as 
with five meritorious medals and four commendations. Among his over 
fifty letters of commendation is one from former President Jimmy 
Carter who honored the colonel for inventing a laser training 
device, at great savings to the armed forces.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis received his B.S. from the United States Military 
Academy, West Point, New York in 1973 and a M.S. from the Naval 
Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, in 1983.  He is also 
a graduate of many military schools, including the Command and 
General Staff College.

<p>

Long active in his community and in many organizations, the colonel 
now coordinates his church's participation in homeless shelters. 
He, his wife and two children live in Northern Virginia.

<title>Beyond Block Grants -- PFF</title>

<h2>Beyond Block Grants: Eliminating Federal Funding for Welfare Programs</h2>
</center>
<b>by <a href="people/afellow.html#Muris">Timothy J. Muris</a> [from the Feb. 95 <i>American Civilization</i>]</b>
<p>
Conservatives are at a crossroads. Committed to balancing the budget by
2002, with modest tax cuts and without reducing Social Security and
Defense, they must reform welfare, Medicare and the numerous programs that
comprise non-defense discretionary spending.
<P>
Depending upon how taxpayers react to the tax cuts, to produce balanced
budget, spending must be reduced to between 18 and 19 percent of GDP, the
lowest level since the mid-1960s. Because defense will fall relative to GDP
to its lowest level in decades even with modest dollar increases, 18
percent of GDP will still leave a large federal establishment.
<P>
Even if Congress successfully reduces the recent explosive growth in
welfare, medical care and non-defense discretionary spending, and even if
it dramatically reduces mandates to state and local governments, the
federal government will still be positioned to interfere throughout our
lives.
<P>
We can do better. Along with the spending restraint described above, the
new Congress should end any involvement in programs that can be better run
by the private sector or by state and local governments. In this way,
federal outlays and revenues could be reduced to 15 to 16 percent of GDP.
<P>
Consider welfare. In 1995, federal spending on these programs will be more
than $300 billion, over 4 percent of GDP. At least three reform options are
available. First, rather than a liberal policy emanating from Washington,
we could try a conservative one. But, as political scientist James Q.
Wilson has stated, we simply do not know how to solve the welfare problem.
In fact, there may be one correct solution.
<P>
Second, we could let the states experiment, receiving block grants from
Washington. Today's block grant, however, is tomorrow's mandated program.
The temptation to impose more and more requirements on programs the federal
government once controlled will likely be irresistible.
<P>
Some federalism strategies follow the proposal made by the Reagan
Administration to nationalize Medicaid and send other welfare programs to
the states. The logic of this "swap" has been political, however, not
programmatic. The argument was that the states would agree to take over the
other welfare programs only if they were releaved of the burden of the
fastest growing problem, Medicaid.
<P>
Moreover, Medicaid is a welfare program. The most important qualification
for Medicaid is receipt of other welfare, as more than half of Medicaid
beneficiaries qualify because they receive AFDC or SSI. Medicaid is not
federally administered. Although the federal government provides more than
half of the funds and mandates numerous program details, each state runs a
Medicaid program, with significant differences among them. Thus, in 1992,
Medicaid payments per beneficiary were around $2,000 in some states (e.g.,
California and Alabama) and over $5,000 in others (e.g., Connecticut and
New York).
<P>
Yet the world has changed since November 8, 1994. A majority of governors
are now Republican, particularly in the most populated states. They appear
willing to accept more responsibility, even if given less money from the
federal government, as long as federal mandates are eliminated. A
federalism strategy, including Medicaid, may be possible -- although some
funds will have to be returned to the states.
<P>
A third reform option is available. We could decentralize not only the
administration and rules for welfare, but also the funding. This reform
could be implemented in three stages.
<P>
First, the states would be told now that in the future (say in five years)
federal taxes would be reduced dramatically and the federal government
would no longer have responsibility for welfare, other than investigation
and reporting. Beginning immediately, the federal government would reduce
program growth. Options include capping expenditures for states with high
growth, encouraging managed care in Medicaid and curtailing current
mandates and other provisions that limit state flexibility.
<P>
Second, as an intermediate step, the states would run these programs,
subject to minimal federal requirements, by receiving grants from the
federal government. The grants to the states would be framed to avoid
"gaming." Thus, states that have done a good job of reducing poverty and
controlling costs would not be punished.
<P>
Third, knowing that a massive federal tax cut is coming soon, states would
decide how they would run welfare programs and how much they would need to
raise their taxes to offset the loss of federal dollars. Most states would
undoubtedly increase their taxes by some amount. But the American taxpayer
would receive a net tax cut.
<P>
One reason is that, because the states are unable to print money, they are
barred from running deficits. (Even under a federal balanced budget
amendment to the Constitution, this option would still be available to the
federal government.) Thus, states have more incentive to control spending.
Indeed, governors have already revealed a much greater ability to restrain
costs than have mandates and often duplicative federal bureaucracy.
<P>
The nature of the federal tax cut would be stipulated now, removing the
need for any subsequent vote. But the exact size (e.g., of an
across-the-board reduction in marginal tax rates) would await additional
data. The key variable would be how much taxes could be cut and still
achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The 1995 law would make estimates, based
on the current economic, technical and policy projections, but the exact
percentages of the tax cut would be adjusted automatically (for example, to
reflect the most recent economic assumptions) to take advantage of
intervening experience. In any event, to assure states of an adequate tax
base, a minimum tax cut would be guaranteed.
<P>
This approach could be followed for other federal programs, including
education and the highway system. It would transform American government.
Rather than the federal behemoth that now directs so much of our lives,
while solving so few problems, the states and local governments would have
complete flexibility to address their unique circumstances. Now, too much
government is distant, removed and overly bureaucratic.
<P>
Reducing the federal role will return decision making closer to the people,
who, after all, are still the ultimate sovereigns in this third century of
the American experiment with limited government.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>Taxing Flying</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Peter J. Ferrara<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
 After a year of hard work, the average working man or woman is
entitled to a little vacation with the family.  They may have
scrimped and saved all year to be able to spend two weeks at their
favorite getaway.  Of course, their savings is heavily taxed all
year.  But when they finally go to buy airline tickets, what they
probably don't realize is how much they are <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/airoped.html">paying in taxes again</a>.
<P>
 All airline tickets are subject to a Federal excise tax of 10
percent.  If you are flying overseas, you are subject to a $6.00
International Departures Tax and a $6.50 Customs User Fee when
you return.  Many airports are also subject to a $3.00 Passenger
Facilities Charge, which is another tax.  Air travelers are also
subject to a $6.00 Immigration User Fee, and a $1.45 Agricultural
Inspection Fee.  Consequently, over 10 percent of what you pay
for flying is actually going to these taxes.
<P>
 But that is just the beginning.  Out of the fare the consumer
pays to the airline, the company must pay Federal income taxes,
state income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, sales taxes, capital
gains taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's compensation
taxes, business license taxes and fees, local property taxes and
any local income taxes.  The airline must also pay a new 4.3 cents
per gallon tax on jet fuel, as well as the telephone excise tax
on all its phones.  Cargo shipments by plane are also subject
to a 6.25 percent excise tax.
<P>
 These taxes the airlines must pay account for about 30 percent
of the price of airline tickets.  Counting the taxes paid directly
by the consumer, this means over 40 percent of what you pay for
an airline ticket actually goes to the government in taxes.  Out
of average domestic round trip airfare of $318, this means at
least $127.20 goes for taxes.  Everything that goes into obtaining,
manufacturing and flying your plane on your trip is covered by
the less than 60 percent of your airfare, or $190.80, remaining
after taxes are paid.
<P>
 Federal, state and local excise and sales taxes, like the 10
percent Federal excise tax on airlines, are particularly harsh
for low income workers.  Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
indicates that about 10 times as much of the incomes of lower
income workers as higher income workers goes to paying these taxes.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.&quot;  But this
is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does today.
 It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes it again
when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again along the
way.  As a result, these average family today actually pays more
in taxes than on food, clothing and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>What You Pay for a Cocktail<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
 After you finished filing your income tax returns this year,
you may have decided that you needed a good drink.  So you may
have driven to your local liquor store to pick up a bottle of
tequila for some margaritas, or a bottle of vodka for a bloody
mary, or a pint of whiskey.
<P>
 What you didn't realize is that in doing so you were primarily
paying taxes again.  That is because <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/boozoped.html">typically 65% of what you
pay</a> for a bottle of distilled spirits goes to the government in
taxes rather than for the liquor.
<P>
 Based on the most recent available data, the typical retail price
of a 750-ml bottle of 80-proof distilled spirits was $9.37.  This
includes a special Federal excise tax on the bottle of $2.16,
accounting for 23% of the total price.
<P>
 In addition, state and local excise taxes on liquor, and sales
taxes, would average another $1.98, or 21% of the total price.
 Together, these Federal, state and local excise and sales taxes
constitute 44% of what you pay for a bottle of liquor.  Consumers
nationwide currently pay almost $7.5 billion per year in such
taxes.
<P>
 But that is not all.  Before the liquor even reaches the store,
the producer, wholesalers, retailers and their employees pay substantial
taxes as well.  These include Federal income taxes, state income
taxes, Federal payroll taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's
compensation taxes, local property taxes, and any local income
taxes.  For delivery, they must pay gas taxes, tire excise taxes,
truck highway use taxes, and heavy truck excise taxes.  On the
phones, they must pay telephone excise taxes.  About $1.93 of
what you would pay for the typical bottle of liquor described
above would go for these taxes.
<P>
 Consequently, if you pay $9.37 for a typical bottle of distilled
spirits, about $6.07, or 65%, goes to the government in taxes,
rather than for the spirits.  Everything that goes into making,
marketing and distributing spirits is covered by the 35% of the
sales price, or $3.30, remaining after the taxes are paid.
<P>
 Federal, state and local excise and sales taxes are particularly
harsh for lower income workers.  Data from the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics indicates that about 10 times as much of the
income of lower income workers as of higher income workers goes
to paying taxes.
<P>
 But all of the above taxes are unfair to all workers.  In a democracy,
taxes should not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.
 They should be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine
whether they think these taxes are worth what they are getting
from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction

future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>Thirty Taxes on Bread</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Peter J. Ferrara<BR>

<P>
 After you finally completed your income tax return last April
and mailed it off, you may have worked up quite an appetite. 
So you may have driven to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread
to make a sandwich.  What you probably didn't realize was how
much you were <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/bredoped.html">paying in taxes again</a> when you bought the bread.
<P>
 In fact, in the process of production from the farm to the store,
the government imposes about 30 taxes on a loaf of bread.
<P>
 These include Federal income taxes, state income taxes, state
and local property taxes, federal payroll taxes, sales taxes,
capital gains taxes, unemployment compensation taxes, workmen's
compensation taxes, retailers' excise taxes, business license
taxes and fees, utility taxes, and state wheat farmer checkoff
taxes.
<P>
 For delivery trucks, farmers and bakers must pay a 12% manufacturers'
excise tax on the trucks, as well as a 15%-20% excise tax on the
tires.  They must also pay Federal gasoline taxes, including a
Federal diesel fuel excise tax of 20 cents per gallon, as well
as state gas taxes, truck highway use taxes, oil disposal fees,
environmental impact taxes, highway tolls, public highway user
taxes, personal property taxes on the vehicles, and taxes on auto
batteries.
<P>
 Finally, the phone in the bakery or on the farm is subject to
a 3% federal tax on general telephone services and another 3%
tax on long distance.  Many states also add additional taxes on
telephones averaging another 2%.
<P>
 A recent study by Price Waterhouse found that these taxes accounted
for 27.2% of the price of a loaf of bread, not counting sales
taxes paid by the consumer.  That means that almost 30% of what
you pay for bread, and more in some states due to the sales tax,
goes to the government in taxes rather than for the bread.  So
out of the average price for a loaf of bread of $1.09 in 1995,
about 30 cents went for taxes, plus another 5 cents on average
for sales taxes.  Everything that goes into making, marketing
and distributing the bread is paid for by the 70% or less of the
sales price, or about 79 cents, that remains after taxes are paid.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>What You Pay for Beer</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Peter J. Ferrara<BR>

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
 Last April, after you finished doing your income taxes and sent
them off to the IRS, you may have needed a drink.  So you may
have driven to the local convenience store to pick up a bottle
of beer.  What you probably didn't realize was <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/beeroped.html">how much you were
paying in taxes</a> again when you bought the beer.
<P>
 If you bought a beer at a standard price of 77 cents a bottle,
then 15 cents, or about 20%, of what you paid, was for state and
Federal sales and excise taxes.  Both state and Federal governments
impose special excise taxes on beer, in addition to standard sales
taxes.  Consumers paid $9.1 billion to the government in 1993,
the last year in which complete data is available, for such sales
and excise taxes on beer alone.
<P>
 But that is only the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays to the beer producer, the producer must pay Federal income
taxes, state income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, unemployment
insurance taxes, workmen's compensation taxes, state franchise
taxes, local property taxes, and any local income taxes.  For
the delivery truck, the beer company must pay gas taxes, tire
excise taxes, truck highway use taxes, and heavy truck excise
taxes.  On the phones in the beer factory, the producer must pay
telephone excise taxes.  Out of the remaining 62 cents that goes
to the beer producer after the state and Federal sales and excise
taxes, the producer pays 18 cents, or about 25 percent of his
total sales price, for these taxes.
<P>
 Consequently, when you pay 77 cents for a standard bottle of
beer, about 33 cents, or 43% of the total, goes to the government
for all of the above taxes rather than for the beer.  Everything
that goes into making, marketing and distributing the beer is
covered by the 44 cents remaining after taxes are paid.  About
$21 billion of what consumers paid in beer in 1993 actually went
for taxes.
<P>
 Federal, state and local excise and sales taxes are particularly
harsh for lower income workers.  Data from the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics indicates that about 10 times as much of the
income of lower income workers as higher income workers goes to
paying these taxes.
<P>
 But the above taxes are unfair to all workers.  In a democracy,
taxes should not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.
 They should be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine
whether they think those taxes are worth what they are getting
from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually

future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the

<h2>Dr. Eisenach's Testimony before House of Representatives</h2>
 
<b>May 18, 1995</b>
<P>
<i>Before the Committee On Governmental
Affairs, United States Senate
House Of Representatives</i>
<P><br>

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, it is an honor to appear before you
today to discuss current efforts to restructure the Federal government.<p>

Before continuing, I should note that while I serve as President of The Progress
& Freedom Foundation, a non-partisan research and educational institution, the
views I express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the
Foundation, its board or other staff.<p>

My testimony today is based on nearly two decades of work in government, academia
and in the political arena on the role and structure of governmental
institutions.  I have held scholarly positions at the American Enterprise
Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the Hudson Institute; taught economics and
antitrust policy at the University of Virginia, George Mason University and
Virginia Polytechnic Institute; and, served in government at the Federal Trade
Commission and the Office of Management and Budget.  My published work has
included articles on Congressional reform, drug abuse policy, welfare, housing
policy, government regulation, education policy, antitrust law, tort reform and
the Federal budget.  As President of The Progress & Freedom Foundation, I am
currently overseeing major projects on telecommunications policy, pharmaceutical
and medical device regulation, urban policy, public assistance and energy policy.<p>

In addition, I have recently co-authored a book, <i>The People's Budget:  A Common
Sense Plan for Shrinking the Government in Washington,</i> which is being published
this month by Regnery publishing.  Pre-publication copies of <i>The People's Budget</i>
have been sent to your offices.  Many of the ideas I will offer you today arise
out of that work, and I would like to recognize the role of my co-authors, Edwin
Dale, Frank Luntz, Timothy Muris and William Schneider, Jr., in helping me
develop the ideas contained in this statement.<p>

I have four objectives in my testimony today.<p>

<ul>

  <li>To describe the fundamental changes sweeping through our society, and their implications for government.<p>

  <li>To define an overall approach to restructuring the Federal government in accordance with these changes.<p>

  <li>To explain several key principles that should be applied as restructuring goes forward.<p>

  <li>To offer a few examples of what it means to apply these principles to the current programs of the Federal government.<p>

</ul>

First, we live in a time of big change.  What does that mean?  It means that very
basic forces are in the process of restructuring the way we live -- our cultural,
economic, political and social institutions are changing very profoundly and very
rapidly.<p>

The single most elegant and insightful explanation of the changes we are living
through is captured in Alvin and Heidi Toffler's concept of The Third Wave.  As
the Toffler's explain it, there have been three waves of change in human history:<p>

The First Wave of change was the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to an
agricultural society, and brought with it, for example, the notion of villages
and towns -- stable communities and all the social structures that grew up around
them.<p>

The Second Wave of change was the Industrial Revolution.  It created the society
we have all grown up in -- a society in which big was better, standardization was
the key to success, and mass production and mass communication dominated the way
we lived.<p>

The Third Wave of change is catalyzed -- but not narrowly defined -- by the
information revolution.  To make a long story short, the collapse of the price of
information has destroyed the economic underpinnings of industrial society. 
Standardization is being replaced by customization; mass communication is being
replaced by a plethora of micromedia of all kinds; "Big is better" is being
replaced by "Small is Beautiful"; economies of scale now work in reverse!<p>

When the Tofflers wrote <i>The Third Wave</i> in 1980, it was seen as "futurism." 
Today, it is current events, and the signs of rapid change are all around us --
in the increase in service jobs, in the downsizing of major corporations, in the
fact that two-thirds of the net new jobs created in the last 25 years have been
created by small businesses, and in the stunning fact, from Dun & Bradstreet,
that fully half of the capital investment in the United States next year will be
for telecommunications, computing and other information processing technology.<p>

Last year, The Progress & Freedom Foundation published a monograph by the
Tofflers, <i>Creating a New Civilization:  The Politics of the Third Wave.</i>  Now
released by Turner Publishing, the book is currently sixth on the New York Times
paperback bestseller list. Copies of the book -- a very concise treatment of the
implications of the Third Wave -- have been provided to you and your staffs along
with this statement.<p>

I should also note that while I have found the Toffler's analysis the most
helpful to me personally, they are by no means alone.  For example, Peter
Drucker's recent work, <i>The Post-Capitalist Society,</i> tracks very closely with the
Toffler's thesis and its implications; George Gilder, in <i>Microcosm</i> and his
forthcoming <i>Telecosm,</i> comes to many of the same conclusions; and, W. Edwards
Deming's theses of "continuous improvement" and "profound knowledge" are entirely
consistent with the world of change the Tofflers describe.<p>

Let me now bring all this back home to the role of government, and especially the
Federal government.<p>

The central organizational paradigm of industrial age society was bureaucracy. 
Today, the word is taken almost as an epithet.  But at one time, bureaucratic
organization was the centerpiece of a reform movement in America -- the
progressive movement -- which proposed to replace the corrupt political machines
of the late 19th and early 20th century with a theory of "scientific management."
This approach -- developed by Max Weber in Bismarck's Germany and imported into
American business practice by Frederick Taylor -- entered American government
through a succession of "progressive" Presidents, most notably Herbert Hoover and
Franklin Roosevelt.<p>

In a time when information was dear, bureaucracy was a means of organizing it,
creating, as it were, a "priesthood" of civil servants tasked with mastering
particular fields of knowledge.  By learning all there was to know about their
subjects, they were expected to make the wisest possible decisions -- based on
scientific knowledge -- and so direct society in the "right" direction.<p>

Let me be clear about something:  This system worked.  In the private sector, it
gave us AT&T, General Motors and IBM.  In domestic government, it produced the
interstate highway system and landed a man on the moon.  It won World War II,
created NATO and ultimately defeated the Soviet Empire.<p>

Let me be equally clear, however, about something else:  That system is over.  It
died with the fall of the Soviet Empire, the downsizing of IBM and General Motors
and the breakup of AT&T.<p>

In one place in the world -- literally -- it lives on.  Right here.  It lives in
practice -- in our outmoded models of regulation and the provision of public
assistance, in large expanses of the Pentagon, and in the way the government --
including the Congress -- organizes itself.<p>

Worse, it lives on here in Washington not just in what we do but in how we think.
To take one example -- there are plenty to choose from -- consider the article
in this week's <i>Washington Post</i> by Vice President Gore on telecommunications
policy.  "What My Father Helped Build with Concrete and Asphalt, We Now Build
with Glass and Copper," it was titled, and its thesis is that the central
challenge of the information age is to build an "information superhighway"
analogous to the interstate highway system of the 1950s.

But the centralized, bureaucratic system that built the interstate highway system
is dead.  "Cyberspace" is being built by hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs
and individual hackers, working on their own, through informal associations or
tiny software firms, or as part of team-based, "virtual" companies like 
Microsoft or Sun Microsystems. Meanwhile, the Federal government -- whose
bureaucracy-based approach delayed the new PCS technology by at least six years
and delayed cellular telephony by at least a decade -- is notorious for still
relying on outdated, mainframe computers, which the private sector now tellingly
refers to as "legacy" systems.  Why would we think a system that is still using
vacuum tube computers at the Federal Aviation Administration ought to be
designing (much less building) a national information infrastructure?<p>

Do not, however, think that the lessons of the Third Wave are limited to our
approach towards information technology policy.  In every aspect of the private
sector, from the manufacturing sector (e.g. Ford Motor's recent announcement that
it is shortening its product development life-cycle from 36 months to 24 months)
to public assistance (where people increasingly understand that small,
volunteer-oriented community groups are dramatically more effective than
bureaucratic government programs), the demassifying force of the Third Wave is
affecting every aspect of our society.<p>

In short, bureaucracy is obsolete in every aspect of human activity.  This is not
a matter of ideology.  It is a matter of fact.<p>

This fact leads directly and unavoidably to two conclusions that ought to
intimidate all of us at least a little:<p>

<ul>

  <li>A very significant proportion of the Federal Government we have today is obsolete.  The challenge for this generation of policymakers is no less than remaking much, probably most, of what it does.<p>

  <li>Everything we know about how to create and run Federal programs is questionable, and most of it is wrong.<p>

</ul>

If these conclusions are correct, the next step of the analysis is straightforward.<p>

The question is, "What overall approach should be taken toward restructuring the
Federal government?"<p>

Let me answer by suggesting that there appear to be two basic approaches now on the table.<p>

The first approach is called "reform."  Its thesis is that the current set of
programs can be made to work more efficiently and more effectively through
relatively marginal changes.  By changing incentives, rewriting the criteria in
authorizing statutes, hiring new management and generally eliminating "waste,
fraud and abuse," this approach would argue, we can dramatically improve the
results from the current system.<p>

The problem with this approach is that it has been tried, and it has failed.  How
many times must we try to inject economic analysis into regulatory decisions, or
"remake" the Department of Housing and Urban Development, how many "Grace
Commissions" and "Reinventing Government" initiatives must we watch fail before
we recognize that the current system cannot be improved through improvement on
the margin?  Gorbachev's "Glasnost" was not going to save Soviet-style socialism,
and no amount of "reform" within the current U.S. government will make "work" in
the sense most people understand that word in 1995.<p>

The second approach is called "abolishment."  Its thesis is that the problem can
be solved by going through the Federal organization chart and eliminating
agencies or departments.  Abolish Commerce.  Abolish Education.  Abolish Energy. 
Etc., etc., etc.<p>

Without any question, there are many functions the Federal government is now
performing which it should simply stop, and many, many areas where duplicative
and overlapping functions can be consolidated -- simplifying the organization
chart and "abolishing" departments and agencies as a result.  But these are, if
you will, the "easy" cases -- analytically if not politically.  In most areas,
the notion of "abolishing" may apply to a box on an organization chart, but does
not apply to the underlying function that box is supposed to perform.  We may,
for example, "abolish" HUD -- but a Federal role in the national marketplace for
home mortgages will persist, even if only in common law, simply because it is a
national market.   "Abolishment" can therefore serve as a means of avoiding the
hard questions. 1<p>

This brings me to a third approach, which I hope you will consider carefully in
your deliberations and adopt as your model as you move forward.  It is called
replacement.  What it means in practice is starting with a clean sheet of paper
and asking the question, "Suppose we were trying to achieve X, what would we do?"
 This is what distinguishes it from the "reform" approach, which begins by asking
"How can we do what we are doing better?"  Reform starts from what we have. 
Replacement starts from what we need.<p>

The replacement approach differs from the abolishment approach in an equally
important way:  It recognizes that in many or even most areas of current Federal
activity, there is some legitimate Federal role. 2   The problem -- or at least
one important problem -- is determining how to replace bureaucratic systems
developed over the past six decades with entrepreneurial, incentive-based, "Third
Wave" systems that will get us where we want to go much more efficiently.<p>

My third objective here is to explain the principles that ought to guide the
replacement approach I have suggested. 3<p>

First, it should be noted that the replacement approach begins by asking the
question "What is it we are trying to accomplish?"  Or, as Deming would have put
it, "What is our aim?"  Replacement forces this question to be asked.<p>

Asking this question is important for two reasons.  In the first place, it
surfaces the most profound questions of the role of government, questions that
must be constantly asked and answered in a functioning democracy.  Secondly, it
also forces and illuminates the question of measurement.  "If we are trying to
accomplish X, how will we know whether we have succeeded?" 4<p>

This, then, is the first principle I recommend to you:  Replace current
institutions with systems that have clearly defined, quantifiable objectives and
hold those systems accountable for achieving those objectives.<p>

Secondly, I would suggest to you that you cannot define your objectives without
first defining your customers.  Is it the teachers union, or the student?  The
corporate shareholder, or the consumer?  Are you trying to minimize the burden on
the Federal bureaucrat, or maximize the value created for the citizen?  And,
where does the taxpayer fit into the mix?<p>

We all think we know the answers to these questions -- they seem obvious enough
in principle.  But the fact is that they are complex, difficult questions, and
those in the private sector who have stopped long enough to ask the question "Who
are our customers?" have often come up with answers very different from what they
unthinkingly assumed.  (I would offer as an example the following thought:  Among
the customers of the Federal Trade Commission, an agency with which I am
particularly familiar, are the companies it regulates.  Part of its job is to
provide them with a clear legal framework within which to do business.  A measure
of the FTC's success in serving this customer group would be the number of
enforcement actions filed -- which we now see to be a measure of failure, rather
than success!)<p>

The second principle of replacement, then, is that each Federal activity should
identify clearly the customers it is trying to serve.<p>

Thirdly, and related to the example just mentioned:  One of our most immediate
and obvious objectives should be to replace complex, ambiguous, often arbitrary
laws and regulations with a lean and effective framework of laws and
institutions.<p>

Allow me to illustrate this point by referring to the figure below:<p>

<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>

<tr>
  <th>The Current System</th><th>A Replacement System</th>
</tr>

</table>
</center>
<p>

The current bureaucratic system -- the picture on the left -- is complex,
ambiguous and arbitrary.  Imagine yourself a customer of this system -- a citizen
wanting to know whether it is permissible to do something new or different, i.e.
to move from point A to point B. (For example, produce and market a new product.)
What you face today is a gauntlet of legal and regulatory hurdles:  Before moving
from A to B, you must ask permission from "the system," usually from more than
one part of the system.  Each part of the system has different standards,
different deadlines, different forms -- and even if you are confident that it
will ultimately be "ok" to go from A to B, you have no way of knowing how long
the process will take, or how much it will cost.<p>

The most obvious effect of such a system is to discourage change.  In times of
stability, the damage done by discouraging change is arguably rather small. 
There's not that much change to discourage, and the benefits are relatively
limited.  But in times of change -- times like these -- the costs can be
dramatic.  They take the form, today, of millions of consumers denied the
benefits of new information technologies (The FCC's decade-long delay in
licensing cellular telephone technology, for example, has been estimated to have
cost consumers $85 billion!) or, more troubling still, of Americans dying for
lack of access to medical technologies already on the market in other nations but
still trying to get past some piece of spaghetti at the FDA.<p>

A second effect -- less obvious but perhaps ultimately more destructive in a free
society -- is that a customer starting out at Point A sees nothing but a sea of
ambiguity.  The regulatory and legal system is so nuanced and so arbitrary that
it becomes impossible to tell what is legal and what is not -- it is, from the
perspective of the citizen-customer, without meaningful borders.  The end result
of such a system is that people lose faith in a legal system they cannot
understand and whose limits they cannot predict with any reasonable certainty.<p>

The alternative is to create a lean and effective framework of laws and
institutions that tells people clearly what is allowed and what is not.  Such a
system is represented by the picture on the right:  If you want to move from
point A to point B, you move there -- no permissions, no forms, no bureaucratic
delays.  But equally important, you know that if you move from point A to point C
-- you go (figuratively if not literally) "to jail."<p>

The third principle of replacement, therefore, is to replace complex, ambiguous
and arbitrary systems of regulation with lean, effective frameworks of laws and
institutions.<p>

The fourth principle I would offer today must be credited to David Osborne -- the
idea that government ought to "steer the boat rather than row it."  What Osborne
means is that government ought to create the incentives by which national
objectives are met, rather than setting up large institutions and spending
programs to accomplish them itself.  One of the beneficial aspects of the use of
incentives, of course, is that it allows for diversity of practice (i.e. for a
shared goal to be accomplished in whatever way makes the most sense in a given
set of circumstances) and encourges innovation (i.e. for people to invent new
better ways of getting things done).<p>

To Osborne's basic point, I would only add the following:  In a world of inverse
economies of scale, where big is generally less efficient than small, a system
based on incentives places the responsibility for actually doing things on
individuals and small groups -- i.e. on those who can do it most efficiently. 
From public assistance to retirement income, transferring operational
responsibility from large bureaucracies to individuals and small groups must be a
major principle of replacement.<p>

The fourth principle of replacement is to replace government activities with
government incentives and get the government out of the "doing" business.<p>

My fifth and final suggestion is also borrowed, from the Honorable Preston
Manning, leader of Canada's Reform Party.  In a recent meeting, Mr. Manning drew
the distinction between privatizing and personalizing government programs.<p>

Privatization has been applied in many areas of the Federal government, but with
mixed results.  NASA, I would argue, is a case of massive privatization that has
failed quite miserably.  Why?  Because privatization took the form of contracting
out functions performed by large, inefficient government bureaucracies and
turning them over to large, inefficient private bureaucracies.  It is worth
remembering, in this context, that the same system of top-down centralized
decisionmaking that was adopted by the Federal government was also the model, for
at least 50 years, for private business.  And private businesses that have not
yet made the transformation are not necessarily any more efficient than their
bureaucratic government cousins.<p>

The fifth and final principle is that replacement should focus on moving from
large, bureaucratic, inefficient systems to small, decentralized, efficient ones.<p>

At this point, let me return briefly to the question of the appropriate role for
the Federal government, and to my perhaps controversial assertion above that "in
many or even most areas of current Federal activity, there is some legitimate
Federal role."  Libertarians may balk at this statement -- but only, I believe, 
because they define more narrowly than I do the words "Federal role."  A "Federal
role" does not necessarily mean hiring civil servants to hand out money, or
empowering regulators to micromanage businesses.  Indeed, the grand dame of
Libertarian thought, none less than Ayn Rand, wrote in 1964 that:<p>

<blockquote>It is the proper task of government to protect individual rights and, as part of
it, formulate the laws by which these rights are to be implemented and
adjudicated.  It is the government's responsibility to define the application of
individual rights to a given sphere of activity -- to define (i.e. to identify),
not create, invent, donate or expropriate....In most cases, the American
government has been guided by the proper principle:  It sought to protect all the
individual rights involved, not to abrogate them.<p></blockquote>

This one paragraph explains a great deal of what the Federal government does
today.  From the air to the airwaves (the topic Rand was addressing in the
article just quoted), from mortgage markets to shareholders' rights, the Federal
government has an essential role to play in defining who owns what, what
constitutes trespass or tort, and how transgressions and "thefts" are to be
adjudicated.  As I have suggested above, I believe it fulfills this role very
poorly.  But it is an appropriate role.<p>

A second area where government would appear to have an role is as an agent for
its citizens in accomplishing shared goals and imposing common obligations.  A
simple example will do:  Americans have decided that they do not wish to be
confronted with the moral dilemma of elderly people who chose not to save for
their retirement.5  Thus, we have collectively decided to impose on each working
citizen a requirement to put aside money for their retirement.  Leaving aside,
for a moment, the question of whether the current Social Security system is a
wise way of acting on that decision, the decision itself is surely a legitimate
one in a democratic system.<p>

Finally, let me offer four very quick examples of what the replacement model
means in practice.<p>

First, the truth is that Social Security is not a very effective means of saving
for retirement.  It is one thing to require people to save, and something else to
make them save through a system that -- at best -- offers rates of return vastly
lower than those in the marketplace.  Replacing the Social Security system with
an IRA-based system that retains the "forced saving" component but creates choice
in how the saving occurs is consistent with the principle of replacing "doing"
programs with "incentive" programs and of personalizing (not "privatizing" per
se) responsibility.<p>

Second, the Federal Communications Commission is a prototypical, industrial-age,
"spaghetti-style" regulatory agency.  It is not the worst, arguably, as such
agencies go -- but it is distinguished by one very important characteristic:  The
industry it is regulating is the most change-oriented industry in history --
literally.  New technologies rise and fall well within the decision cycle of the
agency, and the positive, transforming catalyst of the Third Wave, the
information revolution, is crippled as a result.  Entrepreneurs simply must have
the freedom to move "from A to B" without having to wait years for permission. 
Next week, The Progress & Freedom Foundation will release a detailed proposal for
replacing the FCC with precisely the kind of lean, effective framework of laws
and institutions I have suggested.<p>


Third, I would suggest to you that our system of institutional compassion must be
reexamined and replaced with a decentralized and ultimately person-to-person
approach.  The effort, begun in earnest in the 1960s, to take the bureaucratic
model that worked at Normandy and built the interstate highways and apply it to
saving individuals in need of help has simply not worked.  We need to
re-personalize compassion, perhaps -- as Congressmen Kolbe and Knollenberg have
suggested in legislation introduced in the House -- by replacing the current
system of mandatory government compassion with a dramatic increase in the tax
incentives for giving to private charities that help those in need.<p>

Fourth and finally, I would ask you to consider carefully the current faith being
placed in block grants -- not only for public assistance but for all sorts of
undertakings, from education to housing to worker retraining.  Why should money
be collected from citizens and sent to governors, "no strings attached"?  Who are
the customers for such a program -- the citizens, or the governors?  How will you
measure the success of such efforts when the very essence of the approach is to
eliminate accountability?  (Isn't this what "no strings attached" really means?) 
Block grants are potentially no different from the worst forms of privatization,
simply moving responsibility and authority from one inefficient bureaucracy to
another.  A better approach would be to recognize that most of the programs for
which block grants are either already in place or being contemplated are simply
not Federal responsibilities in the first place.<p>

The fundamental transformation now underway in every aspect of our lives will,
sooner or later, transform the Federal government as well.  The last great
redoubt of Second Wave bureaucratic power on the planet, despite having just
recently been the most successful institution, arguably, in human history, cannot
forever withstand the forces now at work.  Within a decade, it will be much
smaller, much less bureaucratic, much less intrusive in the lives of its
citizens.  To ignore these facts is to ignore every bit of evidence about what is
happening around us every day, everywhere.<p>

The only question is how the transformation will occur.<p> 

The Chinese have an interesting approach to change, implicit in their written
language.  The Chinese character for change, it turns out, is actually a
combination of two figures:  The figure for danger, and the figure for
opportunity.<p>

We live in a time of great change -- of great danger and of great opportunity. 
If we recognize what is happening and move quickly to capitalize upon it, we can
create a Federal government that once again contributes mightily to America's
progress and is again a source of pride for its citizens.<p>

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, that completes my testimony, and I
look forward to any questions you may have.<p>

<p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>

<li>A related and even less helpful approach is "reorganization" -- which in
practice means moving the boxes around on the organization chart.  Its largest
single effect would appear to be increasing slightly Federal outlays for building
signs, business cards and stationery.<p>

<li>We will return to the nature of this role below.  In any case, it seems fair
to assume that the great questions of "what the Federal government ought to do"
will in large measure be determined elsewhere, and hence that the Committee's
main interest is in how to accomplish those things the Federal government, for
better or worse, decides to do.<p>

<li>Many of the ideas in this section have developed out of conversations with
Dr. Barbara Lawton, an Adjunct Fellow at The Progress & Freedom Foundation and
Deming Professor of Management at the University of Colorado at Boulder School of
Business.<p>

<li>If there is any doubt that this question needs to be asked and answered more
frequently, and with more follow through, than is currently the case, I would
simply refer you to the Clinton Administration's current budget -- which
concludes, to take one example, that it is impossible to demonstrate any positive
impact of the Federal Chapter One program for disadvantaged elementary and
secondary.  Apparently the purpose of this program is something other than
increasing educational achievement, however -- because the Administration
concludes from its analysis that the appropriate thing to do is increase funding
for the program!<p>

<li>The dilemma, simply put, is that we don't want to reward them for their
profligacy or lack of foresight -- but neither are we prepared to let them live
in poverty as punishment.<p>

</ol>

Early in 1995, Miss Marshall joined the Family Research Council's 
public policy team to contribute her research skills and experience 
in the field of welfare. Her responsibilities as policy analyst 
include tracking, analyzing, and writing about proposed legislation 
on welfare reform. In addition, her analysis and research benefit 
FRC in educating key decision makers in the U.S. Congress and at the 
grass roots nation-wide.

<p>

Through her studies at Rice University, in various internships 
throughout her undergraduate experience, and most recently, at the 
American Enterprise Institute with Charles Murray, Marshall has 
developed a keen understanding of compassionate welfare reform and 
school choice as well as a familiarity with the U.S. Congress and 
the formulation of public policy. 

<p>

Miss Marshall began her career in Washington as an intern in the 
Office of Congressman Tom DeLay in the summer months of 1990 and 
1991. In 1992, she served an extended internship in the White 
House Office of Political Affairs during the critical months of 
the campaign. She moved on to work in the Office of the Deputy 
Convention Manager at the 1992 Republican National Convention, with 
particular responsibility for caucus teams. Since then, she has worked 
in the Houston office of George Bush and, in 1993, in the office of 
the Deputy Executive Director at the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee.

<p>

Through the years, she has volunteered time for local Republican 
party activities and campaigns, both local and Presidential. Her 
campaign experience includes a stint as opposition research 
coordinator for a Congressional candidate in Houston. 

<p>

Native of Texas, Marshall graduated <I>Summa Cum Laude</I> from Rice 
University in 1994 with majors in Policy Studies and English. She is 
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Rice Fellow.

<TITLE>What You Pay for Gas</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<blockquote>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>43 Taxes on Gas</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Peter J. Ferrara<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
 When you cruise on over to the gas station to fill
up your car's gas tank, you naturally assume that you are paying
for gas.  What you don't realize is that <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/gas1.html">over half of what you
pay goes to the government in taxes</a> rather than for the gas.</FONT>
<P>
The Federal government adds an excise tax of 18.3
cents on every gallon of gas.  Each state then adds an additional
excise tax now averaging 19.4 cents per gallon.  This adds up
to a total of 37.7 cents per gallon.  Based on recent price data
from the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department
of Energy, these taxes account for about 28% of what you pay for
a gallon of gas at the pump.</FONT>
<P>
 For a car with a standard 15 gallon gas tank, a
tax of 37.7 cents per gallon adds up to $5.66 per fill-up.  The
Tax Foundation estimates that the average American household will
spend $422 this year on these taxes alone.</FONT>
<P>
 But that is not all.  Before the gas even gets to
the station, the oil producer must pay considerable taxes on its
production and distribution.  These include Federal income taxes,
state income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, capital gains taxes,
unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's compensation taxes, local
property taxes, corporate franchise taxes, sales and use taxes,
and any local income taxes.  States impose severance taxes or
production taxes on each gallon of oil produced.  The companies
must also pay import duties on foreign oil, customs ad valorem
user fees, airport and airway trust fund taxes, harbor maintenance
trust fund taxes, refinery throughport taxes, and pipeline throughport
taxes.  Additional taxes include the corporate environmental tax,
the Superfund tax, the oil spill liability trust fund tax, the
leaking underground storage tank tax, the aquatic resources trust
fund tax, the inland waterways trust fund tax, and the used oil
disposal tax.</FONT>
<P>
 For delivery trucks, the producers must pay heavy
truck excise taxes, tire excise taxes, Federal gas taxes, state
gas taxes, heavy truck highway use taxes, environmental impact
taxes, public highway user taxes, and personal property taxes
on the vehicles.  Finally, the phones at the refinery or on the
pipeline are subject to 3% Federal tax on general telephone services
and another 3% tax on long distance.  Many states also add additional
taxes on telephones averaging another 2%.</FONT>
<P>
 Altogether, the government imposes 43 taxes on the
production of gas.</FONT>
<P>
 The taxes producers pay amount to about 26% of the
income received from the sale of oil and gas products like gasoline.
 As a result, counting the 28% in Federal and state excise taxes
discussed above, a grand total of 54% of what you pay for gas
at the pump goes to the government in taxes rather than for the
gas.</FONT>
<P>
 Suppose the gas you buy costs $1.33 per gallon,
which was the national average for all grades of gas in May. 
Of that total, 72.3 cents would go to the government in taxes,
and only 60.7 cents would remain with the oil producer.  For a
fill-up of a standard 15 gallon gas tank, $10.77 of what you pay
would go to the government in taxes rather than for the gas. 
And none of this counts the impact of regulation, much of which
maybe unnecessary, in increasing gas prices.</FONT>
<P>
 This incredible tax burden falls most harshly on
the poor.  According to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress,
the lowest 20% of income earners pay 7.1% of their incomes on
gas, while the top 20% only pay 1.6%.  In other words, the lowest
income families in America pay over 4 times as much of their incomes
on gas as the highest income earners.  As a result, the high taxes
embodied in the price of gas are consuming over 4 times as much
of the income of the poor as of the rich.</FONT>
<P>
 The excise taxes on gas used to be justified as
a user fee dedicated to paying for the roads.  But today 4.3 cents
of the 18.3 cent Federal excise tax is openly dedicated to general
government expenses rather than roads.  Another 2 cents is dedicated
to mass transit.</FONT>
<P>
 Much of the remainder has not been spent on roads
in recent years either.  Instead, the Federal government uses
the money for general expenses and puts an IOU in a so-called
Highway Trust Fund.  That IOU would be turned in for cash from
the government to be used for highways, if and when the Federal
government so chooses.</FONT>
<P>
 If you are concerned about the high cost of gasoline,
you should focus on the real problem -- your greedy and overreaching
government.</FONT>

<H3>PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY</h3><p> 
<table border=2 width=75% cellpadding=7 cellspacing=7><tr><td>
	President Clinton signed the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill on August 21, 1996, and the provisions of the bill will become effective on July 1, 1997.  The exception being the four-year Medical Savings Account demonstration project, arguably the most "controversial" provision of the bill, which will become effective January 1, 1997. The huge margins of support for the bill in both the House and Senate reflect the deep desire of Members of Congress from both parties to address the serious and continuing problems faced by workers and their families in getting and keeping health insurance coverage.  Despite the voting margins, many Members remain concerned that specific provisions, even though drafted with the best of intentions, could have unintended and seriously damaging consequences.
<p>
	Over the next several weeks, in the wake of the political conventions and into the election, analysts, aides, and members of the business community will analyze the legislation to determine its impact on employees and businesses, as well as its impact on the American health care system.  Legal teams from the various professional associations will pore over the new law, trying to ferret out the meaning of some of the more abstruse provisions of this highly technical document, and you can be sure that they will find a few surprises--the unexpected always happens in the legislative process.  Heritage's Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies, <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a> shares his "preliminary observations" of the legislation below.
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
	With the number of uninsured Americans rising by about a million a year, the 104th Congress was anxious to pass some type of health care reform legislation that would begin to address the serious problems facing the health insurance market.  Provisions of the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation are designed to reform the employer-based health insurance market and guarantee portability of insurance coverage for workers.  Our analysts believe that its provisions for guaranteed issue, limitations on pre-existing condition exclusions, and guaranteed renewal of policies may make health insurance coverage more <i>available</i> in the individual market, but they will not make it more <i>affordable</i>.  
<p>
	The bill increases the deductibility for the self-insured, but not by much.  And the long-fought-over MSA demonstration project most certainly will disappoint those longing for a more open market in health care.  The government will dictate MSA policies instead of letting them develop in response to consumer demands, and the four-year trial is limited to 750,000 MSAs -- hardly an incentive for the private sector to compete.  How did this happen?  And what else can we expect from the bill?
<p>
<b>1. The bill is the lowest common political denominator. </b>
<blockquote><p>
	The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was the only vehicle that Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives and moderates could agree to vote on and pass into law this year.  It passed the Senate by 98 to 0; the House 421 to 2; only liberal Democrats Pete Stark of California and Pat Williams of Montana voted against it in the House of Representatives.  (Many in the business community know Congressman Stark as a major congressional champion of a single-payer system.)
<p>
	In one respect, this is a limited bill.  It has a very narrow focus, namely, health insurance regulation.  And, regardless of the particulars of health insurance rules, they are not decisive in terms of the structure of the market.  What is decisive is the tax treatment of health insurance and medical services.  At best, and putting the very best face on it, this bill should only be seen as a down payment on real market reform--and real market reform will come only with tax reform.  In that respect, we have not even begun to reform the American health care system.  In fact, we have a very long way to go.  
<p>
	The good news is that the debate on the tax treatment of health insurance and health care services is unavoidable, precisely because the debate on tax reform, including a major overhaul of our tax code, is unavoidable.  
</blockquote><p>
<b>2.  The American people should not expect dramatic changes resulting from the President signing the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.</b>  
<blockquote><p>
	We will not see a drop in health care costs.  Unfortunately, we probably will not see a drop in the rate of uninsurance either. Also, we will not see <i>true</i> portability in health insurance, like we have in auto insurance or homeowners insurance or life insurance, the kind of portability that we take for granted in all of these areas.  The reason:  Americans will still not be able to own their own health insurance policies, like they can in other areas of insurance, and take it with them when they change jobs.  Policies will still remain the property of employers. 
<p>
	Once again, we should remember that insurance regulation, no matter how well- or ill-intentioned, does not and cannot fix the major distortions in the broken health insurance market.  Only changes in the federal tax treatment of health insurance can do that.  This bill does <i>not</i> do that. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>3.  There are certain features of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill that will help millions of Americans who already have insurance at their place of work. </b>
<blockquote> 
<p>
	The bill sets up unprecedented federal ground rules for the health insurance market, so that Americans who are working will be able to keep health insurance from job to job.  In this way the new law does address the very real worries of millions of Americans who will lose health coverage if they get sick or lose their jobs.  It does this by establishing rules to guarantee, through regulation, portability of health coverage.  With guaranteed issue, health insurance companies must sell you policies in the individual market after you have exhausted your COBRA coverage.  With a limitation on exclusion of pre-existing medical conditions, they cannot deny you or your employer a policy because of your medical status.  With guaranteed renewability, your insurance company in the individual market cannot drop you if you get sick.
<p>
	The bill, therefore, will make health insurance coverage more <i>available</i> in the individual market.  It will not, however, make it more <i>affordable</i>.
</blockquote><p>
<b>4.  In fixing <i>some</i> problems in the health insurance market, the bill could create others.</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
	The American health insurance market is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy.  This regulation is overwhelmingly done at the state level, and state regulation imposes rules on insurance ranging from rate setting for doctors and hospitals to mandating that companies include very specific benefits, everything from in vitro fertilization to psychological counseling.  These state regulations are costly for individuals, families, and small businesses.  In the state of Maryland, for example, these mandates add about 25 percent to the costs of health insurance premiums.  Furthermore, the bill creates two potentially serious problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b><i>First, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill adds a new layer of federal regulation on top of the existing morass of state rules.</i></b>  The concern among analysts at The Heritage Foundation and elsewhere is that the new federal rules will drive health care costs up.  The reasons:  nobody, no matter how sick, can be denied health insurance; nobody's health insurance can be canceled, except for cause, such as fraud; your medical conditions are henceforth not a barrier to health insurance.  Of course, many medical professionals find these changes desirable. 
<p>
These new federal rules may establish equity of sorts among patients--which is what they are designed to do--but, taken alone, without any other offsetting market changes, they will add to the cost of insurance.  We don't all automatically win.  There will be losers with this bill: those who become uninsured because they can't afford the premium increases or because individual insurers in this new and even more highly regulated environment may withdraw from the market. 
<p>
How much will costs go up?  Nobody knows for sure but there are a range of estimates.  The American Academy of Actuaries says that it will be a modest increase, between 3 and 5 percent.  Individual insurers say we will see anywhere from 10 to 30 percent increases in the individual market.  The increases and adjustments are hard to predict in a rapidly changing employer-based market.  But, in any case, we should be going into this with our eyes open. 
<p>
<li><b><i>Second, the bill sets up a vast, federal data collection apparatus at the federal level, including the storage and sharing of patient records. </i></b>    Each person will have, under the bill, a "patient identifier" code, and this is designed to simplify the administration of the system.  In the text of the conference report, the Congress restates its good intention to protect privacy.  Good intentions are not enough.  As the <i>Washington Post</i> pointed out recently, unauthorized leaks could result in confidential data being sent into electronic mailboxes all over the country.  At The Heritage Foundation we are more than a little nervous about the potential for abuse. This is only the first controversial issue to surface with the passage of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.  There will doubtless be others.
</ul><p>
	A "technical corrections" bill will likely be introduced early next year to fix the glitches created by various provisions of  Kassebaum-Kennedy.  Two items should be at the top of the agenda:  First, further modification or elimination of unnecessary fines and penalties on doctors.  My colleagues at The Heritage Foundation have opposed, on sound federalist principle, the nationalization of criminal law, usurping or overriding the authority of the states.  There are today over 3,000 criminal laws.  The Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill has added a half dozen more of them.  While Members of Congress insist that they have heard the message from physicians justifiably angry over the imposition of new fines and penalties amidst the growing underbrush of thorny and complicated rules and regulations.  Members of Congress claim to have "fixed" the problem, but we believe that more can be done to protect honest physicians from overzealous bureaucrats.  If Congress remains conservative, the deregulation of the medical profession should be a top priority, just as the deregulation of agriculture and communications has been a top priority in this Congress.  
<p>
	Second, no personal medical record should be turned over to any public or private agency without the express, written permission of the patient. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>5. The Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill could have, but didn't, advance health care reforms that would have made the American system work better for individuals and families. </b>
<blockquote><p>

	<b><i>First, the bill is not nearly generous enough in providing tax relief to individuals and families, regardless of where they work or even the status of their employment.</i></b>  It increases the deductibility for the self-insured from 30 percent to 80 percent--by the year 2006!  While this is a step in the right direction, in itself it is no big deal.  It falls far short of tax equity for individuals and families--and there is not much pizzazz in waiting ten years for the full implementation of a measure that will approach a bare modicum of tax equity.
<p>
	Real tax relief either in the form of tax credits or vouchers for low-income persons, would be a far more generous approach.  It would expand personal choice for individuals and families, and make health insurance and health care itself more affordable.  In any case, tax credits would be more equitable than deductions, especially for lower-income and lower-middle income working families.  
<p>
<b><i>Second, a related item, the MSA demonstration program looks as if it were designed to fail.</i></b>  We hope it doesn't fail, but that's how it looks.  The four-year demonstration project imposes a cap of 750,000 policies that get tax equity, including the self-employed and individuals in firms with anywhere between 2 and 50 employees.  And it is hobbled by literally dozens of statutory conditions on employers and insurers, too extensive and intricate to enumerate here; and it requires a tight policing of these policies by the IRS. 
<P>
	With all of the attendant paperwork, two problems are immediately evident:  (a) small employers are wrestling with too much government paperwork now.  And this program, with its strict reporting requirements and conditions, is hardly designed to make it an attractive option for harried small businesses; (b) such an artificially small pool of potential policyholders--over a four-year period--is not likely to be inviting to a broad spectrum of commercial insurers.  This means that only a small number of insurers currently specializing in high-deductible polices, who are also willing to put up with the government's regulatory regime, will venture to participate.  The likely result: premiums will be higher than if the option were open to a much broader competition. 
<p>
	If you are interested in a demonstration of the dynamism of the market, the powerful and fruitful collision of the forces of supply and demand, designed to unleash free market forces, this is not it.  This is a political compromise.  Others can judge who got the best of the compromise; the market reformers or the regulators?  Furthermore, the very premise of a demonstration program for medical savings accounts also should be questioned.  Over 2,500 companies already have adopted MSA's, and we know that they are very popular with employees and have been successful in controlling costs in the companies where they are used.  And, as for adverse selection, employers have managed risks with managed care, and there is no reason why they can't manage risks with Medical Savings Accounts.  Moreover, they are popular with employees, even though their savings accounts are subject to federal and state taxation and thus are hobbled by an unfair discrimination in tax treatment.
<p>
	The opposition to individual tax relief and Medical Savings Accounts seems to be grounded in fear; not a fear that they are a bad idea or will fail, but rather that they are an excellent idea and will succeed.  Once individuals and families have individual tax relief, they will pick and choose their own plans and policies, their own doctors and medical treatments and procedures.  And, liberals in Congress know that once families start exercising this level of personal choice, they will never - politically -- be able to take that freedom of choice away.  Families with Medical Savings Accounts are hard, if not impossible, for regulators to regulate; huge, consolidated managed care networks, dominated by a few large insurers in any given area of the country, are comparatively easy to regulate.  It is also easy to transition from such a consolidated corporate system into a single-payer system.
<p>
	The short-term value of Medical Savings Accounts, even in the truncated form found in Kassebaum-Kennedy, is that it will give some employers another health care option that can help them hold down costs, and it will give thousands of individuals and families the power to choose their own physicians, medical treatments, and medical services.  And ultimately this is the kind of health care system Americans want.  
<p>
	Unfortunately, we still have a lot of work to do to get there.

Back to School
<BR>
DUMB AND DUMBER
<P>
<a name="alumni">Alumni</a> to the Rescue
<BR>
T. KENNETH CRIBB JR.
<P>
<font size="-1"><i>*Selected definitions from ``A Short Educational Dictionary,''
by Kingsley Amis and Robert Conquest, published in Black Paper
3, 1970.
<P>
Mr. Cribb, president of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute,
was chief of domestic affairs in the Reagan White House.
</i></font>
<P>
THE development officer of a reputable Western university recently
took one of the school's deans to meet a wealthy alumnus. In the
alum's office, the dean spied a bumper sticker that read: ``Socialists
reject history. Fair enough: History rejects Socialism.'' Upon
leaving, the dean condescendingly remarked that the sticker was
annoying, to which the development officer replied: ``You have
to learn how to talk to these people. This is the future.''
<P>
``These
people'' are concerned university alumni, and they represent the
best hope for influencing colleges and universities back toward
sanity. At schools such as Dartmouth, Princeton, Stanford, Wellesley,
Duke, Mount Holyoke, and Yale, alumni groups are demanding the
de-politicization of higher learning and better stewardship of
donations. According to the<I> Wellesley News</I>, in 1994 fewer than
50 per cent of alumnae contributed to Wellesley, for the first
time since 1978. Wellesley's alumnae-association director attributes
the decrease in part to a demand for accountability. A group of
Dartmouth alumni sued the Board of Trustees after rule changes
severely limited alumni involvement in decision-making. At South
Carolina's Converse College, trustees and alumni forced the president's
resignation after a string of multicultural excesses.
<P>
Until very
recently, the well-documented politicization of colleges and universities
went unchecked by alumni. The somnambulance of this core group
of university benefactors has allowed college administrators to
accede to the political demands of the academic Left without cost.
This inattentiveness, however, is ending at a propitious historical
moment, a time when universities are facing great financial pressure
from reduced government subsidies, resistance to skyrocketing
tuition hikes, and the hangover from years of improvident spending.
Universities depend to a significant extent on private giving.
According to <I>The Chronicle of Higher Education</I>, university trustees,
alumni, and private donors provide 49 per cent of the total revenue
of American colleges and universities, or nearly $3.4 billion
in 1994. With the increasing importance of the marginal dollar
should come an opportunity for those seeking authentic university
reform. 
<P>
While alumni slept, radicals who entered the academic world
in the Sixties slowly achieved positions of power in faculties
and administrations. Along with younger disciples, they redesigned
traditional curricula, revamped reading lists and course requirements,
instituted speech codes, redefined acceptable behavior outside
the classroom, and generally subverted the traditional mission
of the university. The end of higher learning was no longer to
be the cultivation of the mind but rather, as Richard Weaver observed,
``the conditioning [of] the young for political purposes.''
<P>
This
revolution within the university marched on virtually unnoticed
by alumni principally because the college public-relations apparatus
held a monopoly on the flow of information. Even when the national
press picked up on political correctness (years after the fact),
alums were lulled by reassurances that at their alma mater ``nothing
had changed.''
<P>
But the university stranglehold on information began
to loosen when in the early 1980s entrepreneurial students, aided
by the introduction of desktop-publishing technology and educational
institutes willing to contribute money and expertise, established
alternative student newspapers at a number of campuses. Coordinated
nationally by the Collegiate Network, these papers gave 75 to
100 schools voices independent of university control. To serve
the 2,000 campuses that had no such publication, the Intercollegiate
Studies Institute (ISI) launched in 1990 a nationwide alternative
student newspaper, CAMPUS:<I> America's Student Newspaper</I>, and began
informational mailings to tens of thousands of targeted alumni
donors. As these efforts took hold, alumni started to realize
that their alma maters were becoming radicalized laboratories
for multicultural experimentation.
<P>
The potential for exercising
real clout was most recently evidenced by an expose in an ISI-published
student journal at Yale, <I>Light and Truth</I>, which broke the story
of Yale's refusal to administer as promised $20 million given
by alumnus Lee Bass to establish an integrated program in Western
civilization. When it became evident to Mr. Bass that he had been
kept in the dark while the Yale administration explored ways to
divert the money from the agreed-upon program, he asked that Yale
refund the $20 million, plus interest. Yale was forced to comply,
to the accompaniment of nationwide headlines and the reaction
of a donor community infuriated by the sorry treatment of Mr.
Bass.
<P>
According to reports in both the New York Times and the Boston
Globe, much of the opposition to the Bass-funded Western-civilization
program was ideological. The Globe reported that ``Some Yale faculty
have resisted the emphasis on Western Civilization, favoring a
more multicultural curriculum.'' The Times stated that ``Liberals
had criticized the restrictions placed on the donation, arguing
that the money could be better spent on courses with a multicultural
perspective.'' John Leo noted in <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>
that the Bass affair is ``a reminder of how far the modern university
. . . will go these days to avoid hurting the feelings of the
campus Left.'' Meanwhile, Yale's donor community was kept minutely
informed by successive mailings of <I>Light and Truth</I> and other updates.
<P>
Such
shoddy treatment of one of their most prominent confreres led
many Yale alumni to ask, in effect, ``If Yale values a left-leaning
political agenda over $20 million, how will it treat my $1,000,
$10,000, or $100,000 gift?''
<P>
After subscribing to <I>Light and Truth</I>,
reform-minded alumni like Yale's Robert T. Eskridge are considering
novel ways to redirect their philanthropy. Mr. Eskridge wrote:
``We have been shocked when reading the <I>Light and Truth</I> publication,
and having recently arranged in our wills to leave most of our
estates to Yale and my wife's college, Beaver College, we feel
now that we would prefer to support an effort . . . to return
the education of future generations to its traditional moorings.''
Yale is out of the will, and the Eskridges have established a
trust to promote genuine higher learning.
<P>
The cost of Yale's behavior
is now estimated to be several times the original Bass gift of
$20 million. The principled stand of Lee Bass encouraged many
others to join a nationwide alumni movement committed to using
its financial muscle to restore the traditional foundations of
higher education. Already, alumni have organized for collective
action at Stanford (Winds of Freedom), Dartmouth (The Ernest Martin
Hopkins Institute), Yale (<I>Light and Truth</I>), Wellesley (Women for
Freedom), and Princeton (Princeton Alumni Viewpoints).
<P>
In countering
the agenda of the academic Left, these and other alumni efforts
will doubtless be accused of having a conservative agenda of their
own. If the impulse toward reform is indeed conservative, it is
the noble impulse to conserve the proper ends of an authentically
humane education.
<P>
From the earliest beginnings of Western culture,
the ends of education were those of Plato's Academy: wisdom and
virtue. If these ancient ends are to be rescued from the will
to power of campus politicians, all of us -- students, faculty,
trustees, donors, and alumni -- need to act with a sense of urgency.
As William F. Buckley Jr. stated in his landmark book God and
Man at Yale, ``If the present generation does not check the university's
ideological drive, the next generation most probably will not
want to.''

<H3>How Congress Won the Budget War</H3></center>
<P>Its one thing when Democrats attack the Republican-controlled 104th Congress for failing to deliver on its promises; its quite another when Republicans themselves start believing the charge.  For the fact is, in the crucial area of making real cuts in the federal budget, the 104th Congress has rung up a remarkable record of success, according to a new Heritage Foundation analysis.

<P>	Consider: When the 1996 budget process came to a close, Congress had made real cuts -- not phantom "baseline" cuts -- in discretionary spending for the first time since 1969, says Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Economics Ron Utt.  All told, it eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices, and projects, reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices, and helped reduce the deficit to its lowest level since 1982.  

<P>"Fiscal conservatives in Congress may have lost a rhetorical battle with the president over the budget," Utt says, "but they won the budget war."

<P>	Specific programs Congress erased from the federal landscape include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Office of Technological Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines.  Spending for many programs and agencies Congress failed to eliminate -- such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Legal Services Corp. -- dropped substantially.

<P>	Utts conclusion: Congresss accomplishments were "far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint." For example, Reagan proposed cutting the NEA by 27 percent and achieved 20 percent, but this Congress slashed the arts agencys budget by 39 percent.  The same applies to the National Endowment for the Humanities, where Reagans goal of a 23 percent reduction (he got 20 percent) pales next to Congresss 35 percent cut.  Similarly, mass-transit subsidies, targeted by Reagan for a 10 percent reduction, were cut 43 percent by the current Congress.

<P>	Granted, theres much more Congress could have done, and still should.  "As impressive as this Congresss performance was," Utt says,  "it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervade the federal government." He says first on Congresss cut list should be out-of-control entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  And while Congress found many opportunities to privatize federal programs such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve, another $8 billion to $20 billion could be saved just from privatizing the countrys four "power marketing administrations."

<P>	With work well underway on the fiscal year 1997 budget, Utt says Congresss goal should be to shave another $20 billion off spending totals.  "This Congress cut discretionary spending for the first time since 1969," Utt says. "Theres no reason it cant cut spending a second time."

<table border=2 width=75% cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td>
	On Thursday, May 16, President Clinton and Vice President Gore will convene a White House conference on corporate responsibility.  CEO's have been invited to participate in a program of panel discussions that will highlight "good corporate citizens" and emphasize behavior the President wants other companies to follow.  What will President Clinton and the White House team propose, and what will America's CEO's report from the front line?  The Heritage Foundation's Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy Mark Wilson's essay below highlights several key issues business leaders should keep in mind when politicians turn to the topic of "corporate responsibility".
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
	After three years of talking about economic insecurity and pursuing government solutions, President Clinton is now trying to walk a fine line between encouraging corporate citizenship and mandating it.  Hence, we see the White House promoting principles of corporate responsibility, while members of the President's Administration and political party propose more government mandates and incentives.  Americans are concerned about their jobs and wages, but in an election year politicians would rather focus that concern on business instead of the real problem: the high cost of government.
<p>
	Do companies have obligations beyond the bottom line?  Of course they do, but <b>the primary responsibility of companies is to produce the best possible products and services for the best possible price.  This, in turn, will ensure the most secure jobs for workers at the highest possible wages, as well as the highest profits for shareholders.</b>
<p>
	Striving to be competitive in a global marketplace does not mean that companies do not care about their workers or communities.  In fact, it can be argued that it is the competitive market forces a business faces every day, not government regulations, that cause it to be responsive to its customers, shareholders, employees, and communities.  For example:
<p><ul>
<li>Between 1942 and 1970, before the creation of OSHA, companies steadily improved workplace health and safety on their own as the total number of work-related injuries in the U.S. declined by 45 percent.  
<p>
 <li>Companies also recognize the goodwill generated by community giving.  In 1994, corporate giving totaled $6 billion.  Thirty-seven percent went to education, 26 percent went to health and human services, 12 percent went to cultural and arts activities, and 10 percent went to civic and community groups.
 <p>
<li>Companies also recognize the importance of training their workers.  Virtually all large establishments, and 69 percent of small establishments, provide some formal training to their workers.<sup>i</sup>  Over half of all establishments that provided formal training made it available to all employees.
</ul><p>
	Companies that are downsizing are not undertaking these measures just to increase their profits.  Rather, they are fundamentally restructuring how they operate in response to competition and to better serve their customers.  In a competitive marketplace no company can be sure how its customer demands will change, what its products will be, or even exactly what business it will be in five years from now.  Moreover, customers are demanding more for less.  If one company can not meet their needs, customers will look for another that does.  So, companies must remain flexible and innovative.
<p>
	The recent pummeling that business has taken in the press is largely undeserved.  And the President should be applauded for highlighting the positive contributions that companies make to society.  In fact, the innovation and invention inherent in business rarely gets much press or attention, but it is crucial to social progress and improvements in American living standards.  
<p>
	The problem, of course, is that politicians are not elected for talking about good deeds.  They are elected to solve problems by passing laws, creating programs, and legislating benefits.  Hence, we see liberals pressing for another mandated increase in the minimum wage and hailing the passage of the Family Medical Leave Act as a great accomplishment.  The dichotomy between the President's recent statement that the government can't make all companies do good things, and his proposal to mandate that all businesses provide health care insurance to their workers is a troubling contradiction.
<p>
	The public, Congress, and the President need to keep in mind that there are no government programs that will make layoffs disappear.  Mandating benefits and training will not eliminate layoffs or increase real wages.  Shutting off imports and immigration will not guarantee everyone a well-paying, secure job.  And sending every American to college will not end economic growth and its accompanying dislocations.  For as long as there has been economic progress, there have been layoffs.
<p><ul>
<li>Although over the past 15 years an average of 20 million workers per year experience at least one spell of unemployment, the economy has managed to create 25 million <i>net</i> new jobs. <sup>ii</sup>
<p>
<li>Sixty percent of the companies reporting job cuts in the twelve months ending June 1995, were also creating new positions at the same time.<sup>iii</sup>  The net workforce change in companies reporting job cuts was only -1.1 percent, down from -5.2 percent the year before.  Because of concurrent job creation, job elimination is no longer synonymous with downsizing.<sup>iv</sup>
<p>
 <li>Of business layoffs that involved 50 or more workers from October to December 1995, most were due to seasonal jobs ending (41.6 percent), slack work (12.2 percent), or the completion of contract work (8.4 percent).<sup>v</sup>  Company reorganizations, business ownership change, and domestic relocation together accounted for 10.9 percent of layoffs.  Import competition and overseas relocation together accounted for less than 1 percent.
 <p>
<li>Those companies that are downsizing many have taken a variety of actions to avoid workforce reductions.  Forty-three percent implement pay cuts and transfers, 40 percent offer voluntary separations, 10 percent offer voluntary job sharing.<sup>vi</sup>  Further, most downsizing companies (75 percent) offer a variety of outplacement assistance to laid-off workers.  Forty-six percent provide extended severance pay, 40 percent provide extended health coverage, and 19 percent provide job retraining.
<p>
<li>Seventy-five percent of all displaced workers who lost their jobs between January 1991 and December 1992 found new jobs.<sup>vii</sup>  Only 11.5 percent remained unemployed.
<p>
<li>Most displaced workers (53 percent) who found new jobs were earning the same as or more than their old job paid.  Over 27 percent were earning 20 percent more.<sup>viii</sup>  And, 82 percent of workers who were previously covered by group health insurance were covered in their new jobs.  Median weekly earnings, however, were 8.2 percent less than the old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>ix</sup>
<p>
<li>Although the overall distribution of job duration has not changed over the last two decades, the distribution of long-term jobs across the population has changed in two ways.<sup>x</sup>  First, individuals, particularly men, with little education (less than twelve years) are substantially less likely to be in long-term jobs today than they were twenty years ago.  Second, women with at least a high-school education are substantially more likely to be in long-term jobs today than they were twenty years ago. 
</ul><p>
	Competition and economic change are a source of America's strength and opportunity.  Government mandates limit innovation by requiring a one-size-fits-all solution, and they will only diminish economic growth. Employment security in the 1990s and beyond will depend upon business flexibility and individuals' ability to adapt to the changing demands of jobs and the job market.  Workers who will fare the best are those with a good basic education, a strong work ethic, sound communication skills, and a willingness to relocate. 
<p>
	Corporate citizenship can not be enhanced with complex tax code changes, trade restrictions, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage.  Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes on labor and capital, and job-restricting regulations.  Correcting these problems will increase economic growth, real wages, and job opportunities.

Each month, <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/bauer.html">Gary L. 
Bauer</a>, President of the Family Research Council, writes a letter 
to the friends of FRC that highlights a current topic, analyzes a key 
family issue, or describes an ongoing or new activity of the Council. 
These personal letters both describe the FRC President's perspective 
on the most pressing family issues and chronicle the development of 
FRC projects and programs to address those issues. These letters give 
friends of FRC an inside, in-depth look at the Council's work.

<TITLE>HEARINGS NEEDED ON END TO COMBAT EXEMPTIONS FOR
WOMEN</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>HEARINGS NEEDED ON END<BR>
TO COMBAT EXEMPTIONS<BR>
FOR WOMEN</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The Clinton Administration has rescinded combat exclusions for
women without justification and contrary to the recommendations
of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women
in the Armed Forces.  These changes have stripped women of more
than one-quarter million combat-related exemptions.  Consider
the changes in the last two years:

<P>
<LI> <B>Combat aircraft.</B>  On April 28, 1993 Former
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin announced that women could be assigned to combat aircraft.
<P>
<LI> <B>Combatant vessels.</B>  On November 30, 1993
Congress rescinded, at the Administration's request, the law exempting women from permanent
assignment aboard combatant vessels.
<P>
<LI> <B>Military's risk rule.</B>  On January 13, 1994
Aspin rescinded the military's risk rule, which resulted in the end of more near-combat and
combat exemptions for women.
<P>
<LI><B>Combat and near-combat positions.</B>  On July 29, 1994 Secretary
of Defense William Perry ended 80,000 more exemptions for women. Women can now be
assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions and virtually all Air Force (99.7
percent) and Navy positions (94.0 percent).  The Army (67.2 percent) and Marine Corps (62.0
percent) are more restrictive.[1]
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>LITTLE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces
recommended that "military readiness
should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
 The Pentagon, however, has yet to cite the military readiness justification for the recent changes.
Additionally, Congress has not publicly heard from the commission.  
<P>
On October 6, 1994 former chairman of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee
on Military Forces and Personnel Rep. Ike Skelton (D-MO) hosted the sole Congressional
hearing considering the latest changes.  He limited the hearing to one three-member panel which
supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) had asked to hear dissenting
views from a panel consisting of commissioners from the 1992 Commission.  His request was
denied.

<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the responsibility to "raise and support
armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and
regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and
their assignments.

<P>
The 103rd Congress virtually ignored the Clinton Administration's radical assignment policies. 
These changes do not improve readiness and threaten to leave women vulnerable to a future
draft.  The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to
reverse the Clinton Administration's current course.

<TITLE>ILLEGITIMACY TALKING POINTS</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>ILLEGITIMACY TALKING POINTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  The essential purpose of welfare reform must be to reduce illegitimacy.
 A system that subsidizes illegitimacy perpetuates illegitimacy
-- and poverty.  
<P>
<LI>  Welfare is bondage:  women bear illegitimate children in exchange
for benefits that can never compare with the benefits of an intact
family.
<P>
<LI>  The elimination of grants to unwed teenage mothers is necessary
to restore the integrity of the family unit for future generations.
 Even Frances Perkins, the most liberal member of the Roosevelt
Administration, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried
mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would
escalate family breakdown.
<P>
<LI>  As the one policy option that promises to effect change in
the current system, restrictions on benefits by definition constitute
the compassionate alternative.
<P>
<LI>  We are combatting not material poverty, but a poverty of the
spirit.  Every individual, regardless of income level, is capable
of moral autonomy.  Welfare is demeaning because it denies that
truth.
<P>
<LI>  Even Democrats now concede Dan Quayle was right.  Families
bestow advantages that simply come no other way.
<P>
<LI>  Every individual deserves equal access to the privilege of
family, and welfare denies its recipients that privilege.  In
communities where illegitimacy has reached a critical mass, many
children don't even have the opportunity to see what a family
looks like, much less live in one.
<P>
<LI>  By eroding our nation's moral capital, illegitimacy jeopardizes
the entire experiment in democratic self-government.  If citizens
cannot govern their own lives, how can they govern the republic?
<P>
<LI>  The role of the two-parent family is essential in sustaining
a free society because it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted
from generation to generation.  Only a virtuous people can be
free.  Welfare erodes first the freedom of dependents and then
freedom at large. 
<P>
<LI>  If we succeed in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work, we will still be left with roughly the same number of fatherless
children.  If current trends continue, one of every two babies
will be born to a single mother within the next 20 years.
<P>
<LI>  Illegitimacy is not a race issue.  Out-of-wedlock births are
increasing more rapidly among whites, and the illegitimacy rate
in many white communities now exceeds 40%.

Currently, federal taxpayer
dollars are being used to fund abortions for federal employees
through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
 Congress should seek to end such funding by amending the Treasury/Postal
Service Appropriations Act.
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  The Federal Employee Health
Benefits Program covers about 9 million federal government employees
(including dependents and retirees).  It provides enrollees with
a broad selection of private health insurance plans, offering
a rich menu of between 18 and 35 individual benefit packages.
 Monies for the FEHBP are allocated through the Treasury and Postal
Service Appropriations Act, and the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) administers the program as the sole negotiator of health
benefits for federal employees.
<P>
Federal taxpayer dollars fund the
greater portion of employee health benefits.  The government contributes
about 60 percent of the funds needed to purchase each employee's
health insurance.  In some plans, the federal contribution is
much higher (e.g., the government's share of the premium for Kaiser
HMO is 75 percent).
<P>
In 1980, before the Smith-Ashbrook Amendment
was instituted, the Office of Personnel Management reported that
an estimated $9 million in taxpayers' money was spent to pay for
17,000 abortions.
<P>
<B>Bills and Sponsors:</B>  In 1983, the Smith/Ashbrook
Amendment was passed in the Treasury/Postal Service Appropriations
bill, prohibiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortions
for federal employees enrolled in the FEHBP.
<P>
The Smith/Ashbrook
Amendment reads as follows: 
<UL>Sec. A:  &quot;No funds appropriated
by this Act shall be available to pay for an abortion, or the
administrative expenses in connection with any health plan under the federal employees health
benefit program
which provides any benefits or coverage for abortions.&quot; </UL>
<UL>Sec.
B:  &quot;The provision of section A shall not apply where the
life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried
to term.&quot; </UL>
<P>
However, in 1993, through the urging of the Clinton
Administration, pro-abortion members in Congress proposed and
passed a bill which did not include the longtime restriction on
abortion coverage in federal employee health plans (207-206 in
the House, 73-27 in the Senate).  And on October 28, 1993, President
Clinton signed H.R. 2403 into law (P.L. 103-123), folding abortion
coverage into the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
<P>
<B>Prospects:</B>
 The FEHBP bill was able to pass in 1993 because it was introduced
in Congress almost simultaneously with the Clinton Administration's
proposal to repeal the Hyde Amendment.  As a result, most pro-lifers
concentrated their efforts to preserve Hyde.  The sole attempt
to counter FEHBP's expansion sought to permit abortion coverage
only through a separate rider to federal employee health benefit
plans.  This attempt, spearheaded by Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.),
was defeated by only three votes (48-51).
<P>
The makeup of Congress
today, however, is quite different from what it was in 1993. 
The current pro-life majorities in both Houses of Congress make
it possible to introduce and pass a Smith/Ashbrook-type of amendment
this summer when the Treasury/Postal Appropriations bill comes
up for a vote.

<P>
<H2>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN<BR>
ACT OF 1994</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The "Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act"
passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton on September
13, 1994 authorizes $1.6 billion to combat and study violence
against women, stiffens laws against sex offenders, and creates
prevention and treatment programs.[1]  The comprehensive statute
has seven subtitles, outlined below.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"SAFE STREETS FOR WOMEN"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> Federal Penalties for Sex Crimes.  The law doubles prison sentences
for repeat sex offenders and mandates restitution for sex crimes.
 Sex offenders will pay the full amount of the victim's loss to
include medical services, transportation, temporary housing, child
care expenses, lost income, and attorney's fees.  Court decisions
to award restitution to victims will not consider the economic
circumstances of the offender nor the fact that the victim received
compensation from other sources.  The provision also authorizes
the appropriation of $1.5 million over three years to appoint
victim/witness counselors.
<P>
<LI> Law Enforcement and Prosecution Grants.  This provision amends
the 1968 Safe Streets Act to authorize grants to combat violent
crimes against women.  It is designed to develop and strengthen
law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes
against women.  It authorizes $800 million over six years.
<P>
<LI> Safety for Women in Public Transit and Public Parks.  This appropriates
$20 million to increase the safety of public transportation and
public parks by enhancing lighting systems, camera surveillance
and emergency telephone lines to contact law enforcement personnel.
<P>
<LI> New Evidentiary Rules.  This amends the federal rules of evidence
for sex offense cases.  It prohibits the admission of evidence
offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior
or establish a victim's "sexual predisposition."  Exceptions
are permitted in cases where the evidence proves that "a
person other than the accused committed the crime" or to
prove that the victim consented to the act.
<P>
<LI> Assistance to Victims of Sexual Assault.  This section of the
law has six provisions.
<P>
<UL><LI> It amends Title XIX of the Public Health and Human Services
Act to create education and prevention grants to reduce sexual
assault against women.  It authorizes $205 million over five years
for rape prevention seminars, hotlines, training programs for
professionals, and the production of information materials.
<P>
<LI> It provides $2 million over two years to train probation and
parole officers who work with released sex offenders.
<P>
<LI> It requires that a study be conducted to develop model legislation
that provides the maximum protection for the confidentiality of
communication between sexual assault or domestic violence victims
and their counselors.
<P>
<LI> It requires the Attorney General to ensure that all incarcerated
sex offenders are apprised of available sex offender treatment
programs.
<P>
<LI> It authorizes $30 million over three years for the Runaway
and Homeless Act.  Grants may be made under this provision to
agencies that provide a street-based outreach, including treatment,
counseling, and referral for runaway, homeless, and street youth
who have been subjected to or are at risk of being subjected to
sexual abuse.
<P>
<LI> It authorizes $38 million over five years for the Victims of
Child Abuse Act of 1990.</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"SAFE HOMES FOR WOMEN ACT OF 1994"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> National Domestic Violence Hotlines.  This provision creates
a national domestic violence hotline for $3 million over six years.
 It will be run by a private agency and will be toll-free, operate
24-hours-per-day and offer information relating to services for
victims of domestic violence to which callers may be referred
throughout the U.S., to include the availability of shelters that
serve battered women.
<P>
<LI> Interstate Enforcement.  The law was changed to increase punishments
for persons who cross state lines with the intent of harming a
spouse or to violate protection orders.  This provision also authorizes
$120 million over three years to encourage states to treat domestic
violence as a serious criminal act.
<P>
<LI> Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.  This Act is amended
to authorize $324 million over five years.
<P>
<LI> Youth Education.  It creates four youth education and domestic
violence model programs for young people.  It authorizes $400,000
for one year.
<P>
<LI> Community Programs on Domestic Violence.  It grants $10 million
over two years for nonprofit organizations to establish projects
that coordinate intervention and prevention of domestic violence.
 The nonprofit organizations may include religious community personnel.
<P>
<LI> Confidentiality for Abused Persons.  The Act requires the U.S.
Postal Service to write regulations that protect the confidentiality
of domestic violence shelters and abused persons' addresses.
<P>
<LI> Data and Research.  It requires the National Academy of Sciences
to study violence against women, including rape and domestic violence.
 The one-year study will report on how states may collect centralized
data on the incidence of sexual and domestic violence offenses.
 It also tasks the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
to obtain a national projection of the incidence of injuries resulting
from domestic violence and to recommend how to reduce the incidence
and cost of associated injuries.
<P>
<LI> Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement.  It authorizes
$30 million over three years to expand and establish efforts among
rural law enforcement agencies, victim advocacy groups, and victims
of domestic violence and child abuse.  The grants will provide
treatment, counseling, and education strategies directed to domestic
violence and child abuse.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDIES FOR GENDER-MOTIVATED VIOLENCE
ACT"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> This provision creates a federal civil rights cause of action
for victims of crimes of violence motivated by gender.  Victims
of a crime of violence motivated by gender can now sue the offender
for restitution.
<P>
<LI> The Act includes a "Sense of the Senate Concerning Protection
of the Privacy of Rape Victims."  It encourages news media,
law enforcement officers and others to exercise restraint and
respect a rape victim's identity by not disclosing it to the general
public.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"EQUAL JUSTICE FOR WOMEN IN THE COURTS
ACT"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>  Educates Judges.  Authorizes $600,000 for fiscal year 1996
to develop, test, present, and disseminate model programs to be
used by states in training judges and court personnel in the laws
of rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, and other crimes of
violence motivated by the victim's gender.
<P>
<LI> Studies Gender Bias in Federal Courts.  Authorizes $600,000
for fiscal year 1996 to study the nature and extent of gender
bias in federal courts and their administrative offices.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT IMPROVEMENTS"
</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> Tests for STDs.  This provision authorizes payment of the cost
of testing victims of sex offenses for sexually transmitted diseases.
 Victims can be tested at government expense up to twice during
the 12 months following a sexual assault that poses a risk of
transmission.  The provision also provides a mechanism for the
victim to obtain an order requiring the offender to be tested
and for the results of the test to be communicated to the victim
and the offender.
<P>
<LI> HIV Crimes.  The Act requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission
to conduct a study to recommend for revision sentencing guidelines
that relate to offenses in which an HIV-infected person engages
in sexual activity that exposes another to the virus.
<P>
<LI> Studies Campus Sexual Assaults.  The Act requires the Attorney
General to examine the scope of the problem of campus sexual assaults
to include the estimated number of assaults, the existing laws
pertaining to campus sexual assault, and the adequacy of policies
and practices addressing campus sexual assaults.
<P>
<LI> Battered Women's Syndrome.  Requires the Attorney General and
the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report within one
year on the impact of "Battered Women's Syndrome" in
criminal trials.  
<P>
<LI> Abusive Spouse Information.  Requires the Attorney General to
study the means by which abusive spouses may obtain information
concerning the location of estranged or former spouses.  
<P>
<LI> Domestic Violence Records.  Requires the Attorney General to
study and report within one year problems associated with record-keeping
of criminal complaints involving domestic violence.

<title>SEX EDUCATION: WHAT WORKS?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>SEX EDUCATION: WHAT WORKS?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
The institutionalization of &quot;family life&quot; or sex education
classes in public and private schools around the country has created
a demand for curricula on the subject.  Unfortunately, the broad
reach of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and SIECUS has
left many school boards and parents thinking that there is no
alternative except to teach &quot;safe sex.&quot;  But there <I>is</I>
an alternative that has shown to be even more effective than &quot;safe
sex&quot; in reducing teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted
diseases -- abstinence.  This paper is designed to help concerned
school board members and parents choose a solid abstinence curriculum.
<p>
<center><h3>WHY ABSTINENCE EDUCATION?</h3></center>
<p>
Abstinence is the only strategy for preventing teenage pregnancy
and sexually-transmitted diseases that is 100 percent effective.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
it is &quot;the most effective solution&quot; to unwanted pregnancy
and sexual disease.[1]
<p>
Given the effectiveness of abstinence, a number of states -- including
Texas, California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana -- have
passed laws in recent years stipulating that public school sex
education programs be abstinence-based.[2] Many of these programs
have produced promising results:
<p><ul>
<li>San Marcos Junior High in San Marcos, California, adopted
an abstinence-only curriculum developed by Teen-Aid, Inc., titled
<I>Sexuality, Commitment, and Family</I>.  The year before the
curriculum was implemented, 147 girls were reported pregnant.
 But two years after the program's adoption, only 20 girls became
pregnant.[3]
<p>
<li>Historically, the eighth-grade class at Nathan Hale Middle
School in the Chicago suburb of Crestwood included a number of
already pregnant girls. When the school decided to adopt an abstinence
program for the kids, many adults were skeptical.  But after three
years of quality sessions with the abstinence program <I>Project
Taking Charge</I>, the school graduated three pregnancy-free classes
in a row.[4]
<p>
<li>In the Washington, D.C. chapter of &quot;Best Friends,&quot;
only one out of 400 girls has become pregnant since the program
began.  Elayne Bennett, director of &quot;Best Friends,&quot; says that 
between 20 and 70 pregnancies are common
for the same-sized group of fifth- to ninth-grade girls in the
District of Columbia.  One &quot;Best Friends&quot; member explains,
&quot;I want to save my virginity for the man I marry....And I
want my child to have a daddy.&quot;[5]
<p>
<li>An evaluation of the abstinence-based program <I>Sex Respect:
 The Option of True Sexual Freedom</I> found that students participating
in the program had considerably lower pregnancy rates than those
in a comparison group.  Only 5 percent of the female program participants
and 9 percent of the non-program students became pregnant in the
two years following the program.[6]
<p>
<li>Emory University's abstinence-only curriculum, <I>Postponing
Sexual Involvement</I>, teaches kids about abstinence through
skill-building exercises on &quot;how to say no.&quot;  An evaluation
of the program showed that its participants were less likely to
become sexually active than those not involved in the program.[7]
<p>
<li><I>AANCHOR</I>, an alternative national curriculum on responsibility,
stresses the importance of family involvement and individual responsibility
to prevent adolescent pregnancy.  An evaluation of the curriculum
found three statistically significant differences between students
receiving the AANCHOR curriculum and students receiving the standard
school curriculum. The students participating in AANCHOR were
significantly more likely to report (1) higher family strengths,
i.e., loyalty, emotional support, cohesion, (2) greater discussions
with parents about sexual values and beliefs, and (3) more abstinent
attitudes regarding premarital sexual involvement.[8]
<p>
<li>Students who participated in the abstinence-based <I>FACTS</I>
curriculum showed significant pre-post effects occurring on the
measures of (1) affirmation of abstinence, (2) rejection of permissiveness,
and (3) future orientation and peer support for abstinence.  These
attitudinal data are important indicators of delaying sexual activity.[9]
</ul><p>
<center><h3>HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD ABSTINENCE CURRICULUM</h3></center>
<p>
In order to choose an appropriate abstinence curriculum, parents
and school board members should study curricula for their focus,
methodologies, and content.
<p>
<b>Focus of Curricula:</b> The growing interest in abstinence
curriculum has caused many contraception programs to frame themselves
as &quot;abstinence-based,&quot; &quot;abstinence-plus&quot; or
&quot;comprehensive&quot; because they mention abstinence as one
of several options.  Such programs, however, communicate a mixed
message to students which thereby tremendously weakens the abstinence
message.  Some common characteristics of these &quot;comprehensive&quot;
or &quot;abstinence-plus&quot; programs are that they (1) assume
that teenagers are inevitably sexually active, (2) emphasize contraception
and abortion, and (3) include affective decision-making (presenting
abstinence as one of many options from which to choose).  Thus,
parents and school boards should choose a curriculum that avoids
these danger points, and instead upholds abstinence as the way
to handle teen sex issues.
<p>
<b>Methodology of Curricula:</b> The method used to deliver sex
education material heavily influences the way students will respond
to the abstinence message.  Effective abstinence programs are
directive in their approach.  Dr. Onalee McGraw provides a comparative
analysis of competing delivery models of sex education in her
book <i>Foundations for Family Life Education</i>:[10]
<p><hr><p>

</pre>
<p><hr><p>
Directive abstinence education emphasizes the importance of values
and attitudes, which is consistent with a U.S. Department of Education
study, &quot;The Role of Responsibility and Knowledge in Reducing
Teenage Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing,&quot; which found that &quot;adolescents
with strong feelings of control over their lives, with higher
educational expectations, and with parents who show concern and
have higher educational expectations for their daughters have
lower chances of experiencing teenage childbirth.&quot;[11]
<p>
Furthermore, students want help in saying &quot;no&quot; to sexual
activity.  When Emory University surveyed 1,000 sexually active
girls and asked them what they would most like to learn to reduce
teen pregnancy, 84 percent responded, &quot;How to say no without
hurting the other person's feelings.&quot;[12]  Moreover, a recent
study done by Roper Starch in association with the Sex Information
and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) found that,
of the teens who have had sex, 54 percent wish they would have
waited until they were older.[13]
<p>
<b>Content of Curricula:</b> Sex education curricula vary greatly
by content, and parents should be particularly concerned if the
curriculum contains information or pictures too explicit for the
intended audience.  Caution is recommended even in cases in which
a particular sex education curriculum is widely used or endorsed
by prominent organizations.  For example:
<ul><p>
<li>The two-million member National Education Association (NEA)
endorses sex education programs that promote birth control and
homosexuality.[14]
<p>
<li>The influential Sex Information and Education Council of the
United States (SIECUS) has published a widely used set of goals
for sex education curricula entitled, &quot;<U>Guidelines for
Comprehensive Sexuality Education:  Kindergarten - 12th Grade</U>&quot;.
 The report promotes abortion, unmarried couples living together,
and homosexual relationships as equal to heterosexual relationships.[15]

<title>FAMILY CAP TALKING POINTS</title>
<body>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<h2>FAMILY CAP TALKING POINTS</h2></center>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
*  Two wrongs don't make a right.  It is foolish to fight abortion
by embracing welfare subsidies.  There are no data to support
the contention that the current welfare system suppresses the
abortion rate -- in the short-term or the long-term.  In fact,
the welfare state peacefully coexists with the world's highest
abortion rates outside the Eastern Bloc.
<P>
*  All the data demonstrate that subsidizing illegitimacy will
actually increase the number of abortions because it increases
promiscuity and discourages marriage.  Illegitimacy and abortion
spring from the same misconception that life is cheap and motherhood
bears no sacred responsibility.                         
<P><UL>
The correlation between abortion and illegitimacy in a state-by-state
analysis is astronomically high (between .67 and .72, with 1.0
designating a perfect correlation).  Likewise, abortion and illegitimacy
trends track together over time.
<P>
 States that have more generous welfare benefits also have higher
abortion rates.  When the 50 states are organized into quintiles,
for example, the rank order correlation between abortions per
1,000 live births and average monthly AFDC benefits is perfect.
<P>
 Welfare promotes family disintegration, and girls who are born
out-of-wedlock are much more likely to engage in premarital sex.
 Premarital sex is 9 times more likely to engender abortion, and
women who have never married are more than 5 times as likely to
have abortions as their married counterparts. 
<P></UL>
*  State by state analysis demonstrates that small changes in
welfare payouts do not appear to correlate closely with short-run
changes in the abortion rate.  Texas, for example, experienced
a 27% drop in abortions in the 1980s, while welfare payouts remained
consistently low relative to the national average.
<P>
*  The termination of benefits may in fact reduce the number of
abortions in the short-term because many pregnant young women
will turn to pro-life crisis pregnancy centers.  Teenagers will
be more likely to remain at home with parents, and parental notification
laws have proven effective in reducing the number of abortions.
<P>
*  Abortions are less likely to increase in the short-term because
many low-income girls deliberately choose to have a baby.  Abortion
would deny them an important status symbol.  Surveys also demonstrate
that moral opposition to abortion is strongest among the poor.
<P>
*  The logic of pro-life opposition to welfare reform is that
we should increase entitlements tenfold in order to save even
more lives and that we should forgo any crackdown on deadbeat
dads, since more men might pressure more women into abortions.
 Pro-lifers should support marriage and adoption, instead of opposing
welfare reform.
<P>
*  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on demand requires more
than legal reform.  The question we should be asking is &quot;What
constitutes progress toward ending altogether the culture that
finds abortion acceptable?&quot;  The answer certainly includes
welfare reform that reduces illegitimacy.

<H2>QUOTABLE COMMENTS ON
<BR>WELFARE REFORM AND
<BR>ILLEGITIMACY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
&quot;Welfare programs must contribute to the attack on family
breakdown and illegitimacy.  Unless such problems are dealt with
effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping the strength of society
as a whole and extending their consequences in troubled families
from one generation to the next.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- John F. Kennedy</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Illegitimacy is the single most important social problem
of our time because it drives everything else.  The task is not
to devise a public relations campaign to discourage single teenage
girls from having babies, but to neutralize whatever is impeding
the age-old impulse of human beings to form families.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Charles Murray</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;The real source of the problem is the inordinate number
of out-of-wedlock births in this country.  There's no question
that ending welfare for unwed mothers would work.  The question
is, 'Is it morally right?'&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Bill Clinton</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;I do believe that having children out of wedlock is wrong.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Donna Shalala</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Unmarried teen childbearing is morally wrong because of
its costs for children and society.  It is wrong -- not simply
foolish or impractical -- for women and men to make babies they
cannot support emotionally and financially.  We must reject moral
relativism and reassert our common values.  It is also time to
challenge the complacent view that having babies out of wedlock
is simply a lifestyle choice, and that since all lifestyles choices
are equally valid, no behavior should be condemned.  This stance
is untenable in the face of compelling evidence that not all choices
are equal in terms of their impact on children, and that children
need fathers as well as mothers.  Massive federal spending on
remedial programs will not solve the problem.  Families are the
primary socializers of children; families teach children how to
be citizens.  To deprive children of crucial adult models of citizenship,
anthropologist David Murray suggests, is to 'undercapitalize'
society's investment in its own future.  The social welfare system
has 'normalized' fatherless families.  The dilemma is this: Everything
the welfare system does to create normal and acceptable lives
for the children of teen mothers creates the perception that their
parents' behavior is normal and acceptable.  The system makes
government rather than parents ultimately responsible for the
lives of children.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Progressive Policy Institute</I>

<P>
<BR>
&quot;The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root,
in almost every area of important public concern, we are seeking
to induce persons to act virtuously.  Not only is such conduct
desirable in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if
large improvements are to be made in those matters we consider
problems.  In Victorian England and Victorian America, countless
organizations tried to save the children and they succeeded. 
They did so on the basis of firm convictions as to what constitutes
a decent family life.  We have rejected implicitly if not explicitly
the moral convictions that underlay that effort, replacing child-saving
programs with something we now call condescendingly welfare. 
Replacing our desire to save children with the desire merely to
end poverty or dependency [sic].&quot;
<BR>
<I>- James Q. Wilson</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;After making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and 'value-free,' we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Gertrude Himmelfarb</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;We looked at a hundred different programs around the country
that were trying to deal with out-of-wedlock births, and not one
of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any results.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- anonymous Clinton aide</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;I know this must seem a strange message from a not particularly
religious writer in an utterly secular newspaper, but I am increasingly
struck by two phenomena.  The first is the growing sense that
America's major failings are not political or economic but moral.
 The second is the discovery that the most successful <I>social</I>
programs are those that are driven -- even if only tacitly --
by moral or religious values.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- William Raspberry</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Washington's continued medicalization of teen pregnancy
ignores the lessons of the past 20 years and is doomed to fail.
 Dealing with teenage pregnancy requires a one-on-one discussion
of values and morality.  What many call sexual liberation has
brought with it unhappy consequences for millions of teens.  This
is not liberation.  It is bondage for the child-mother and the
mother's child.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Joseph Califano</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;The project of self-government depends on the capacity of
citizens to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Michael Novak</I>

<title>CAN GOALS 2000 BE FIXED?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>CAN GOALS 2000 BE FIXED?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Goals 2000 proponents are conceding flaws in their prized program.
President Bill Clinton himself recently confided to writer Ben
Wattenberg that his education program wasn't what he had hoped
it would be.
<p>
Nevertheless, Goals 2000 spin doctors are now suggesting that,
with the right makeover, the program will emerge irresistible
even to those who previously spurned it.  So they're willing to
undergo an utterly painless procedure:  removal of two controversial
surface elements of Goals 2000 -- the National Education Standards
and Improvement Council (NESIC), and opportunity-to-learn standards.
<p>
<h4>Leaders in the U.S. Congress, governors' offices and state
legislatures should understand that lifts and tucks aren't enough.
The core elements of Goals 2000 are unacceptable:</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>National Education Goals written as federal law (Public Law
103-227); 
<li>a federally funded National Education Goals Panel;
<li>a federally funded National Education Standards and Improvement
Council (NESIC);
<li>a new formula for reform:  federally funded standards and
assessments; and
<li>a prescription that states use this formula for reform and
submit their standards and assessments to the federal government
for approval.
</ul><p>
Never before have states had to submit their &quot;lesson plans&quot;
to get federal money.  When the U.S. Education Department was
created back in 1979, it was prohibited from dealing with curricular
issues.  Standards and assessments are curricular matters, and
the federal government has no business formulating or reviewing
them.
<p>
<h4>New Twist:  A Dangerous Liaison</h4>
<p>
Some officials, however, have no problem with federal review of
state plans -- in fact, they extend the offer to local districts
as well.  They propose that the federal government disregard the
authority of states like Virginia, New Hampshire, Montana and
Alabama, which have chosen not to participate in Goals 2000, and
go straight to the local districts interested in making a few
bucks by hitching up with Goals 2000.  What better way to invite
federal intrusion into local schools than to have local districts
bypass state authority and submit their plans directly to the
federal government for approval?
<p>
Goals 2000 is built on the flawed thesis that a greater federal
role in the education system will improve schools.  It hasn't
and it won't.  The program and the systems it spawned should be
discontinued immediately.  The money freed up will be spent more
effectively on real education needs -- not systems management
-- if left in the hands of parents and teachers closest to the
student.

<title>CAPRICORN RECORDS GOES TO POT</title>

<h2>CAPRICORN RECORDS<br>
GOES TO POT</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>David J. Chamberlin and Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Unfazed by the hit that Time Warner has received in the last two
months for peddling sex, drugs, and violence, Capricorn Records
will soon release <I>Hempilation</I>, a benefit album with a portion
of the proceeds going to the National Organization for the Reform
of Marijuana Laws (NORML).
<P>
It is not surprising that pro-drug musicians support NORML  --
 at least 45 bands have declared their support for legalizing
marijuana.[1]  It is surprising however, that Capricorn Records'
president Phil Walden didn't learn from Time Warner's recent public
flogging over the promoting of music that glorifies drug use,
puts down women, promotes Satanism, or encourages violence.
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala recently emphasized
the dangers of marijuana, saying,  &quot;Young people must understand
that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous
drug that can have acute and hazardous effects. . .Drug use --
 including marijuana. . .is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.&quot;[2]
<P>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  Marijuana
can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively, thinking,
retaining knowledge, problem solving, and forming concepts.[3]
<P>
More than 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana
damages brain cells and the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction
in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns
of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.[4]
<P>
The effects of unabated illicit drug use go beyond those already
outlined.  For example, illicit drug use correlates with crime.
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 32 percent of inmates
have used cocaine and that half had used drugs in the month before
their offense.  Seventy-five percent reported having used marijuana
in the past.[5]
<P>
Drugs numb the conscience and lower inhibitions.  They contribute
to mood disorders, depression, and low self esteem.  A high proportion
of cocaine users admit the drug makes them feel violent at times.
<P>
Consider some recent examples of youth violence that involved
drug abuse.  
<UL>
<LI>Five Dodge City, Kansas teenagers, high on marijuana, killed
a stranger for no obvious reason.[6]
<P>
<LI>Three West Palm Beach, Florida teenagers mixed beer, rum,
marijuana and cocaine and then kidnapped and set ablaze a tourist
from Brooklyn.[7]
<P>
<LI>A New Scandia Township, Minnesota teen shot his mother and
stepfather to death.  He admitted to almost daily abuse of marijuana.[8]
<P>
<LI>Two Miami, Florida teenagers were smoking marijuana when one
accidentally shot and killed the other.[9]</UL>
<P>
Not all users become violent, but social scientists confirm the
relationship between drug use and juvenile delinquency.  A 1990
study published in the <I>Journal of Drug Issues</I> found the
strongest association between the severity of the crime and the
type of substance abused  --  the more intoxicating the substance,
the more serious the incident.[10]
<P>
A study in <I>Today's Delinquent</I> found alcohol and marijuana
users commit twice the number of delinquent acts as non-users,
and a study in <I>Adolescence</I> found that half of all polydrug
users had engaged in delinquent acts.[11]
<P>
Fortunately, Walden still has time before <I>Hempilation's</I>
Sept. 26 release to reverse his blatant pro-drug decision.  Capricorn
ought to follow Simon &amp; Schuster's example of five years ago,
when it canceled plans to publish <I>American Psycho</I>, a novel
by Bret Easton Ellis, after advance complaints about objectionable
passages detailing the sexual torture and mutilation of women.[12]
<P>
It's time that record companies meet their responsibility to distribute
music that doesn't glorify drug use.  It's time Capricorn Records
heeded the timely warning that Time Warner received from angry
parents.

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT AMERICANS WANT</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT AMERICANS WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A 1993 study conducted by the Families and Work Institute
found that 66 percent of the 3,381 adults surveyed nationwide
wanted more time with their children.[1]

<p>

<li>&quot;The Changing Workforce,&quot; a national study conducted
by the Families and Work Institute, found that 66 percent of employed
parents with children ages 18 and under indicated that they did
not have enough time with their children, and another 50 percent
indicated that they did not have enough time with their spouses.[2]

<p>

<li>A 1991 Gallup poll found that when asked what was most important
to them, Americans ranked family life and betterment of society
above &quot;having a nice home, car, and other belongings.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>On average, parents today spend only 17 hours per week with
their children, according to a University of Maryland study.[4] This
is roughly 40 percent less than in 1965.

<p>

<li>A recent <I>Newsweek</I> poll found that one half of all parents
feel that they don't spend enough time with their children.[5]

<p>

<li>Sixty percent of all employees consider their jobs effect
on their personal or family life to be a &quot;very important&quot;
factor in their decision to take the job. This is not surprising,
as 42 percent of all U.S. workers have children under 18 years
of age living at home. Furthermore, 32 percent of all U.S. workers
have children under 13 years of age at home, and in 66 percent
of these families both parents work (18 percent for kids under
6 years of age).[6]

<p>

<li>According to a survey commissioned by the Massachusetts Mutual
Life Insurance Company, half of all fathers feel that they do
not spend enough time with their children.[7]

<p>

<li>Forty-four percent of women would prefer more family time
over higher pay in their jobs, while 48 percent of men would prefer
more time than money.[8]

<p>

<li>Most workers (57 percent) would trade early retirement in
favor of family time, according to a survey commissioned by the
Family Research Council. Roughly a third (36 percent) said they
prefer to work longer hours now and retire sooner.[9]

<p>

<li>The overwhelming choice for weekend family activities seems
to be spending time with children. Parents top four choices for
weekend activities were &quot;talking with children,&quot; taking
&quot;care of children,&quot; going on &quot;trips with children,&quot;
and playing &quot;games with children.&quot; Unfortunately, by
1986 parents actually had 10 fewer hours per week to spend with
their children than they did in 1960.[10]

<p>

<li>A 1995 Wharton School study found that people who placed high
importance on finding the right spouse and creating a good family
life actually ended up earning more money than those who were
willing to sacrifice home life for their careers. Peter Capelli,
a management professor at the Wharton School, explains that building
a good family life is particularly important early in careers
as &quot;that's where the serious mistakes get made. People who
didn't take time for their families spend a lot of time putting
Band-Aids on family problems&quot; later on, which hurts work
performance and commitment.[11]

<p>

<li>Seventy-eight percent of Americans feel that a father should
choose to spend more time with his children if given the choice
between that and earning more money for his family, and 75 percent
felt that a mother should choose to spend more time with her children
if given the same choice.[12]

<h3>March, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Understanding Corporate Government Relations
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>


	After nearly 34 years in the corporate world, I welcomed the opportunity to join The Heritage 
Foundation after the 1994 elections, when the prospect of a conservative revolution presented an 
irresistible second career challenge. I had always respected the conservative movement and 
supported its mission, even when I found my business colleagues on the other side of an issue.<P>
	In my old job in the corporate community, I found that conservative analysts and activists are 
often suspicious of business. Indeed, in the interest of earning &quot;business value&quot; for 
their companies and shareholders, corporate government affairs offices often put narrow 
economic interests over the broader philosophical or political objectives that motivate 
conservatives. The business community cares less about ideology than about finding the power 
center and lining up advocates on its key issues. This may translate into support for a piece of 
compromise legislation that lifts a burden, lessens a cost, or lowers a barrier, even if it isnt the 
proposal conservatives took to the table.<p>
	The business communitys pragmatic approach to policy making is not very inspiring, but it can 
bring closure and progress on its objectives. My corporate experiences suggest that sometimes 
the beauty of an idea crowds out the importance of strategically implementing a focused plan to 
achieve your objectives. This most certainly is not to suggest compromise on principle, but 
rather the need for a system that is acutely aware of its environment, regularly takes stock of how 
its agenda items are proceeding, and makes necessary adjustments to its priorities, goals, and 
strategies. <p>
Although the commercial instinct for closure and moving on to the next priority often 
serves business interests business interests well enough, it does not always serve them best. 
When it began to appear in the fall of 1994 that conservatives could seriously increase their 
presence in the House and Senate, those positioned to take over the new leadership positions 
were proclaiming a sea change rollback of government.<p>
	The reality of governing, however, dictates that conservatives cannot expect to reform 40 years 
of liberal policies overnight: reinventing government is a slow, deliberate process. Take 
Superfund, for example. Business had pushed hard for meaningful reform of the burdensome 
program and at long last, in 1994, had a bill in committee that was acceptable, though not ideal. 
But conservative senators, sensing the probability of having a majority in Congress after the 
elections, defeated the compromise legislation, promising a &quot;better&quot; bill after the 
election. Business listened to its ideological friends and acted against its instinct for closure, 
deciding to wait for the &quot;better&quot; bill. Because business quickly adjusted to the 
changing political environment and acted against its natural instincts, it will likely see that 
&quot;better&quot; bill enacted some time this year.<p>
	Despite rhetorical victories and the perception that our ideological friends have taken over, many 
point out that the rollback theme has not substantively advanced either the conservative or 
business reform agendas. But should we realistically have expected to overhaul decades worth of 
bureaucratic growth overnight?. Insufficient strength in Congress, special interest tactics, and a 
demagogic White House have thwarted usso far.<p>
	The business and policy communities will  eventually see key components of their agendas 
enacted, however, if they make timely adjustments to strategy, focus on the most important 
goals, and a develop a keen awareness of changing legislative and poltical environments. From 
my perspective, we can have more success advancing the conservative agenda in 1996 if we 
learn to focus our energies on the most important goals by adapting more quickly and shrewdly 
to this volatile political environment, as business did with Superfund reform.<p>
	Management guru and author Tom Peters has said that even the best-run companies are only 18 
months from failure. In order to stay competitive, well-run companies gear their systems to 
anticipate changes in their environments and adjust plans accordingly. Policy making (or 
unmaking) is a complicated task worthy of the best thought and strategic planning. 
Conservatives need to sharpen their skills at anticipating changes in the debate, adjusting our 
marketing and message delivery, and building strategic coalitions. The movement may not have 
the luxury of 18 months to consolidate the revolutionfocus and closure are critical.<p>

<title>CAREERS: A MISSED OPPORTUNITY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>CAREERS:<br>
A MISSED OPPORTUNITY</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
On Sept. 19, 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in
favor of the CAREERS Act (H.R. 2332), a bill which would consolidate
about 100 job training programs into three.  They call it a victory
because they've streamlined programs and saved money.  We call
it a failure to uproot key elements of the Goals 2000 agenda.
<p>
While sponsors of the bill accepted some of the changes suggested
by pro-family groups, they were unwilling to strike references
to the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) and a requirement
that state skill standards be referenced to the national skill
standards to be developed by that board.  NSSB was a creation
of the National Skill Standards Act of 1994, a part of the same
public law as Goals 2000 (Pub. Law 103-227), and in keeping with
its philosophy.  NSSB would fund, oversee, and endorse the creation
of a national system of skill standards, certificates, and assessments;
it is to occupational skills what the National Education Goals
Panel is to academics.  Yet some conservative members of Congress
failed to see the flaws in such a system.
<p>
One small victory was the addition of language to prohibit any
requirement that a student meet federally funded or endorsed skill
standards or obtain a federally funded or endorsed skill certificate.
 Because this provision has the potential to undermine significantly
the influence of the National Skill Standards Board, this provision
could be a prime target as the bill goes to conference.
<p>
CAREERS will now go to a House-Senate Conference Committee to
work out differences between versions passed in the two houses.
 Unfortunately,  Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kan.) job training
bill (S. 143) embraces the philosophy advanced in the liberal
School-to-Work Act of 1994 even more than CAREERS does.  This
may threaten even the minor improvements gained in the House bill.
<p>
The 104th Congress has unfinished business in education.   No
adequate proposal to repeal Goals 2000 has yet been advanced.
 Rep. Duke Cunningham (R-Calif.) claims his &quot;Education Reform
Consolidation Grant&quot;  would repeal Goals 2000,  but it does
so only in name.   Its core elements remain intact:  the National
Education Goals Panel, the National Education Goals, and bullying
the states on how to reform.  Does it make sense for a &quot;reformist&quot;
Congress to pass on the meddlesome, bureaucratic, centralizing
legacy of Goals 2000 and School-to-Work, rather than put an end
to it?

<TITLE>SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE KINSEY RESEARCH</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE
<BR>KINSEY RESEARCH</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Since the publication of <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>
(1948) and <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I> (1953) there
has been much criticism of the findings and methods of Dr. Alfred
Kinsey. 
<P>
The 1990 book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> (Reisman, Eichel, Court
and Muir; Lochinvar-Huntington House) examined the work of Dr.
Kinsey.  The book revealed a number of serious flaws in his research,
including shocking evidence that Kinsey used data from the sexual
abuse of children.
<P>
According to scientific fraud specialist Dr. Walter Stewart of
the National Research Council, evidence of problems in Kinsey's
research is "compelling.... disturbing...and requires investigation."[1]
 Problems include:
<P>
<LI> <B>Sexual Experiments on Children --</B> The Kinsey male report
contains data on sexual activity of 317 children aged 2 months
to 15 years.  These data were either manufactured or these children
were sexually molested by adults in the name of science.  The
data are contained in graph tables which chronicle attempts to
bring children to "orgasm."
<P>
<LI> <B>Sampling Errors --</B> Kinsey's sample was entirely voluntary
and not representative of the U.S. population.  White people were
overrepresented while Blacks and Latinos were underrepresented.
 In addition, college students, college graduates, and white-collar
workers were overrepresented.  Prison inmates comprised 25 percent
of Kinsey's male sample, even though they made up less than one
percent of the total U.S. population at the time.  Among women,
58 percent of Kinsey's sample were unmarried, three times the
actual number at the time.  Religious people were not adequately
represented and since only 10 states were included, the survey
was regionally skewed.
<P>
<LI> <B>Volunteer Error --</B> Psychologist Abraham Maslow raised
this issue by pointing out that sex surveys are skewed toward
the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.  Many people, especially
in the late 1940s and early 1950s, were not willing to talk openly
about their most intimate lives.  Those who did often exaggerated.
 Maslow proved the volunteer error in a test he conducted at Brooklyn
College and concluded that "the whole basis for Kinsey's
statistics was proven to be shaky."[2] 
<P>
Further evidence of Maslow's contention that sex surveys are inherently
slanted is found in a book written by Wardell Pomeroy, one of
Kinsey's co-authors.  Pomeroy writes:

<P>
"As types, those who took the most romantic view of sex were,
understandably, people who were the most religious -- clergymen
and their wives especially.  Those who were bubbling over to tell
us everything they could were usually homosexuals, particularly
when they discovered by our use of homosexual argot that we knew
about the kind of lives they led.  They would almost visibly expand
with relief and eagerness to talk."[3]
<P>
<LI> <B>Intimidation/Coaching of Respondents --</B> Kinsey instructed
his interviewers to goad their subjects into revelations of their
sexual behavior, especially if the results didn't match the interviewer's
assumptions. Wardell Pomeroy admitted that such coaching was quite
common in the Kinsey team's data collection.[4]  These tactics were
particularly effective with prison inmates.  If the inmates did
not provide answers they would have to return to their cells,
thus losing access to the free candy, soft drinks and cigarettes
provided by the Kinsey interviewers.
<P>
When some interviewees said that they did not do a particular
sex act, the interviewer would say: "Yes, I know you have
never done that, but how old were you the <I>first</I> time that
you did it?"[5] 
<P>
Kinsey's team intimidated subjects when they suspected that the
subject was being dishonest.  According to Kinsey, the interviewers
"...should denounce the subject with considerable severity..."[6]
Kinsey admitted that these tactics were highly unusual: "Such
an attack on a dishonest subject is quite contrary to the usual
rules for interviewing, and a procedure which we at first hesitated
to employ in the present study.  We have, however, decided that
it is a necessary technique in dealing with some individuals."[7]
  
<P>
<LI> <B>Ideological Bias --</B> According to Kinsey biographer Paul
Robinson, Kinsey consistently favored nontraditional forms of
sexuality in the way he constructed his books.  Marital intercourse
was "rudely confined to a single chapter in the back of the
book, where it received about one-third the attention devoted
to homosexual relations... a remarkable feat of sexual leveling...the
fundamental categories of his analysis clearly worked to undermine
the traditional sexual order."[8] A 1989 National Academy of
Sciences report explained that Kinsey "attempted to counter
the traditional religious view that sexual virtue was entirely
composed of heterosexual activity...inside the bonds of marriage..."[9]
Kinsey himself summarized the Old Testament's and the Talmud's
injunctions against sexual relations with animals by saying: "The
student of human folkways is inclined to see a considerable body
of superstition in the origins of all such taboos..."[10]
<P>
In addition to Dr. Walter Stewart and Dr. Abraham Maslow, critics
of the Kinsey reports include a committee appointed by the Commission
on Statistical Standards of the American Statistical Association.
 In 1954 the committee reported several statistical flaws and
concluded that "Kinsey should have been more cautious in
boldly drawing highly precise conclusions from their limited sample."[11]
<P>
The 1989 National Academy of Sciences report warned that the sampling
flaws limited "the comparability and appropriateness of the
Kinsey data as a basis for calculating the prevalence of any form
of sexual conduct."[12]
<P>
The Kinsey data are flawed and have been contradicted by subsequent
research.  However, Kinsey's work continues to be widely used
by policy makers and the culture at large in dealing with sexuality.
 The Kinsey data must be discarded.

<title>BIRTHS TO UNMARRIED WOMEN: HOW THE STATES ARE MEASURING UP</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>BIRTHS TO<br>
UNMARRIED WOMEN:<br>
HOW THE STATES ARE<br>
MEASURING UP</h2></center>
<p>
Thirty-one percent of all births in the United States are to unmarried
women, according to a September 1995 report issued by the National
Center for Health Statistics.  Only 10 states have an illegitimacy
ratio below 25 percent.
<p>
Of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 10 states have
illegitimacy ratios at or above 35 percent.  All of these states,
with the exception of New York, are along the southern rim of
the 48 contiguous states.  Indeed, among the southern rim states,
only Alabama and Texas have illegitimacy ratios lower than 35
percent.
<p>
The state with the lowest percentage of births to unmarried women
is Utah, with 15.5 percent.  Like Utah, most other states with
low illegitimacy ratios are sparsely-populated states west of
the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, only Vermont
and New Hampshire show a rate of less than 25 percent of births
to unmarried women.
<p>
There is a strong relationship between the percentage of births
to unmarried women and race.  Nationally, 68.7 percent of all
black births are out of wedlock, while 23.6 percent of white births
are to unmarried women.  Thus, states with high percentages of
births out of wedlock also tend to have relatively high percentages
of unmarried black women.
<p>
Between the years of 1991-1993, the proportion of all births to
unmarried women rose 3 percentage points.  During this same time
period, non-marital childbearing rose for white women, declined
slightly for black women, and remained essentially unchanged for
Hispanic women. Individual state percentages declined in only two states 
from 1992 to 1993:  Michigan by 0.8 percent and Texas by 0.5 percent.
<p>
Of the nation's 20 most populous states, only Minnesota (with
a ratio of 23.4 percent) and Texas (with a ratio of 17.0 percent)
rank among the few Top Ten states with the lowest percentage of
births to unmarried women.

<TITLE>USES OF KINSEY'S FLAWED RESEARCH</TITLE>

<H2>USES OF KINSEY'S FLAWED<BR>
RESEARCH</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P><CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
Forty-two years after its release, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human
Male</I> by Alfred C. Kinsey remains a highly influential document
in government funding of sex education and health programs despite
a general understanding that its research methods were unscientific.
 The Kinsey ideology has altered the nation's legal codes for
sex crimes and has been used as a touchstone for numerous federal
policies, particularly the funding of sex education, research,
and prevention programs for AIDS, drug abuse, and youth suicide.
 
<P>
<LI>  Based on the Kinsey ideology that premarital sexuality is superior
to marriage-based sex, federally-funded sex and health education
curricula have been geared almost entirely toward sexually active
teens, implying that abstinence before marriage is abnormal. 
The federal government began funding adolescent pregnancy prevention
programs during the 1970's under Title X of the Public Health
Service Act.  Curricula funded through Title X often include ideas
and "facts" derived from the Kinsey studies.  After
$3 billion in taxpayer-funded programs, America's teenage pregnancy
rate is far higher than when the programs began.  And there is
growing evidence that such programs actually increase sexual activity
among teens.[1] Yet the programs, which emphasize how teens should
engage in sex rather than why they shouldn't, continue to receive
heavy subsidies from taxpayers.  In fiscal 1995, the federal government
will spend $190.4 million on Title X projects.  By contrast, the
Adolescent Family Life Act, or Title XX of the Public Health Service
Act, whose abstinence-based programs reduce teen pregnancies,[2]
is slated to receive only $6.7 million in federal funds in fiscal
1995.
<P>
Planned Parenthood receives about $50 million annually from Title
X grants.  This money is used to design and implement sex education
and health programs for thousands of schools across America and
to operate clinics.  Giving lip service to the idea of abstinence
before marriage, Planned Parenthood-designed programs openly support
sexual experimentation.  For instance:
<P>
1)  An adolescent curriculum prepared for the Alameda-San Francisco
branch of Planned Parenthood tells young people that it is a "myth"
that "[y]oung women who have more than one sexual partner
are easy.  Some people, both men and women, prefer to relate sexually
to more than one person at a time.  This is an individual preference."[3]
 

<P>
2)  The Planned Parenthood Center of Syracuse, New York, issued
a pamphlet for teens that says:  "Many people believe that sex relations
are right only when they are married.  Others decide to have sex outside of marriage. 
This is a personal choice."[4]
<P>
3)  In a family planning magazine published under a federal grant,
a Planned Parenthood affiliated physician gives this advice to
teens:  "If we have sex for our own reasons, then there is
nothing wrong with sexual activities."[5]
<P>
4)  In 1991, Planned Parenthood of Maryland joined several government
agencies to sponsor the Affirming Diversity Conference.  Conference
coordinator John Hannay told an interviewer:  "We use the
Kinsey studies as a starting point to determine how many youth
would fall into this [child homosexuality] category.  As the cross
section of society goes, you would probably expect to see a good
10% will have predominantly or exclusively homosexual tendencies...
There haven't been any studies done on sexual orientation among
adolescents, so we're just going on estimates on adults and the
10 percent figure.  The thing is that many students will be aware
that they are different, but they would probably not describe
their difference as being a homosexual."[6]
<P>
<LI>  AIDS prevention programs are funded through grants from the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  In fiscal 1989, the CDC
spent $266.6 million on AIDS education.[7]  In fiscal 1995, the
CDC is spending $589 million on HIV/AIDS projects, plus another
$105 million on sexually transmitted diseases.  This amounts to
about a third of CDC's total $2.1 billion budget.[8]
<P>
<LI>  The Sex Information and Education Council of the United States
(SIECUS) is supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, which gave SIECUS two grants totalling $360,397 in fiscal
1994.[9] One of the founding board members of SIECUS was Wardell
B. Pomeroy, a co-author of the 1948 Kinsey male sexuality study.
 In 1980, another SIECUS co-founder, Mary Calderone, told a group
of doctors that the primary goal of SIECUS was to educate society
"very broadly and deeply with the awareness of the vital
importance of infant and childhood sexuality."[10]
<P>
A 1985 SIECUS report says:  "...homosexuality is an essential
quality of humanness, and that its expression is the right of
every human being."  In March 1991, SIECUS published a report,
"Winning the Battle:  Developing Support for Sexuality and
HIV/AIDS Education."  The report suggests that one way to
deal with opponents of some types of sex education is to determine
their religious affiliation and publicize it in order to stigmatize
them.[11] SIECUS also advocates the teaching of "alternative
lifestyles" and the use of "values clarification"
to help youth "question, explore, and assess sexual attitudes
and feelings in order to develop their own values..."[12]
<P>
Debra Haffner, executive director of SIECUS, in a 1988 SIECUS
report says:  "Colleagues and I have fantasized about a national
'petting project' for teenagers... to help them learn courting
behaviors and to, once again, give teens time to learn slowly
about their sexuality... Today's teens also need to have that
opportunity for unpressured discovery of sexual feelings and responses...
A partial list of safe sex practices for teens could include...
massaging, caressing, undressing each other, masturbation alone,
masturbation in front of a partner, and mutual masturbation."[13]
<P>
In a 1990 SIECUS report, Haffner asked readers to "Imagine
a world where:  School sexuality education is compulsory.  Contraceptives
are readily available.  Abortion is free until the 18th week of
pregnancy.  There is a law that states that, 'Cohabitation between
people of the same sex is entirely acceptable from society's point
of view.'... I was most impressed by the sense that in Sweden
sexuality is truly accepted as a natural and healthy part of living.
 Young people have a right to their sexual feelings and to sexual
education."[14]  
<P>
<P>
<LI>  In 1950, Alfred Kinsey testified before the California Assembly's
Subcommittee on Sex Crimes on behalf of liberalizing state laws
regarding sex offenders.  Kinsey argued specifically for granting
immediate paroles to child molesters and also counseled that parents
should not warn children about strangers because it might frighten
them.  In his testimony, he included little or no information
about sex crime victims, and noted that societal disapproval of
the acts posed more harm that the acts themselves.[15]  Kinsey also
worked with other state legislatures to liberalize sex crime laws
and openly called for changes in molestation laws in his second
study, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>:  "It is
difficult to understand why a child, except for its cultural conditioning,
should be disturbed at having its genitalia touched, or disturbed
at seeing the genitalia of other persons, or disturbed at even
more specific sexual contacts."[16]  
<P>
<LI>  Following the advice of such a prominent scientist, federal
and state officials began altering the penalties for molestation
and other sex crimes, as noted in a paper by Dr. Judith Reisman.
 In 1977 and 1985, the U.S. Department of Justice's National Survey
of Crime Severity, a perennial list of more than 200 crimes that
is used by the legal community to establish sentencing guidelines,
omitted child rape, child pornography, and child prostitution
as serious crimes.[17]
<P>
Writing in <I>Scientific Monthly</I> in 1955, law enforcement
scholar Morris L. Ernst explains Kinsey's importance:  "The
Kinsey report is the single greatest contribution of science to
the rule-making part of the law in my lifetime."[18]  
<P>
<LI>  The Kinsey influence also extends into federally-funded projects
at sex research institutes, including the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, which was founded by
Kinsey at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana in 1947.
 Indiana University provides support to the Kinsey Institute,[19]
and the Institute also provides support to federally-funded researchers.

<P>
Former Kinsey Institute Director June Machover Reinisch was awarded
three grants from the National Institutes of Health totalling
more than $3 million from 1981 to 1989.[20]  In 1989, the <I>Chicago
Tribune</I> reported that the National Institutes of Health launched
an investigation into "how millions of federal research grant
dollars were spent" by Reinisch.  In the case of one grant
for $658,307 from the National Institutes of Child Health and
Human Development, an NIH investigator found "no financial
illegalities" but did find that payments made to a subcontracted
researcher had been placed in a special bank account under the
names of the Kinsey Institute, Reinisch, and another Kinsey employee.[21]
 "This procedure is unconventional and highly questionable,"
the report stated.[22]  The bank account was closed "as a result
of the initial internal review conducted by the University."[23]
<P>
Another example of a federally-funded researcher under Kinsey
auspices is Howard B. Kaplan, co-author of a chapter in the Kinsey
Institute's 1990 book, <I>Homosexuality, Heterosexuality:  Concepts
of Sexual Orientation</I>.  Kaplan received a grant for this work
from the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the Centers for Disease
Control.[24]
<P>
In 1987, two federal agencies -- the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases and the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development -- sponsored The Fourth Kinsey Symposium,
titled, "AIDS and Sex:  An Integrated Biomedical and Biobehavioral
Approach."  The conference, which was also sponsored by the
host organization, the Kinsey Institute, was co-chaired by Bruce
Voeller, the late homosexual activist who was president of the
Mariposa Education and Research Foundation of Topanga, California.
 A conference statement describes Mariposa's purpose:  "to
foster a society more honest and at ease with its own sexuality.
. ."[25]  According to <I>Who's Who in America</I>, former
Kinsey Institute President June Reinisch is also affiliated with
Mariposa.[26]
<P>
<LI>  One of the most common myths derived from Kinsey's research
is the estimate that 10 percent of the population is homosexual.
 Until recently this figure has been accepted without question.
<P>
The overblown 10 percent figure is actually an exaggeration of
Kinsey's claim.  Kinsey said that 10 percent of males are homosexual
for at least three years during a portion of their lives.  For
females, Kinsey said, the figure was less than five percent. 
Homosexual activists along with the media repeatedly cited the
10 percent figure and it was generally accepted by the culture.
<P>
The figure has been used to lobby for homosexual affirmation programs,
the extension of family benefits to homosexual employees of corporations,
and to frighten elected officials and business leaders into believing
that they have to accommodate a sizable minority.
<P>
A huge body of evidence has emerged challenging the 10 percent
figure.  Studies from the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Norway,
Denmark and other nations show a homosexuality prevalence of one
percent or less.[27]

<H2>ILLEGITIMACY'S DISASTROUS EFFECTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  Out of wedlock pregnancy is a near certain predictor of poverty.
 The one-parent family is six times more likely to be poor than
the two-parent family.
<P>
 
<LI>  Women who bear illegitimate children (especially before finishing
high school) are far more likely to rely on government to support
their children and to spend more years on welfare once enrolled.
<P>
<LI>  Children born outside of marriage are three times more likely
to depend on welfare themselves when they reach adulthood.
<P>
<LI>  Illegitimacy feeds itself.  Young white women who grow up without
a father in the home are more than twice as likely to bear children
out of wedlock.  And boys living in a single-parent family are
twice as likely to father a child out of wedlock as boys from
intact homes.
<P>
<LI>  More than 70% of all juveniles in state reform institutions
come from fatherless homes.  The relationship between crime and
one-parent families is so powerful that controlling for family
structure erases the relationship between crime and race or poverty.
<P>
<LI>  The likelihood that a young male will engage in criminal activities
doubles if he is raised without a father and triples if he lives
in a neighborhood with a high concentration of single-parent families.
<P>
<LI>  The greater the incidence of single-parent families in a neighborhood,
the higher the incidence of violent crime and burglary.
<P>
<LI>  Teenage single-parent mothering is the single greatest contributor
to low birth weight babies.  Studies show that the high rate of
out-of-wedlock births to young mothers is the primary explanation
for America's low international standing on measures of infant
mortality.
<P>
<LI>  Children born out of wedlock are much more likely to experience
abuse or neglect.
<P>
<LI>  Children born out of wedlock are more likely to experience
impaired physical development and low cognitive/verbal development.
 Among children aged 3-5 in one study, those with teen mothers
were twice as likely to have few children's books in the home.
<P>
<LI>  Children from single-parent families are two to three times
more likely to have emotional or behavioral problems than children
from intact families.  They also exhibit weaker peer adjustment
and a weaker sense of right and wrong.
<P>
<LI>  Children from fatherless homes have lower educational aspirations
and a low level of educational achievement.  Studies also show
that illegitimacy reduces job performance, professional attainment,
individual income, and the overall health of the economy.

<TITLE>A FEW FACTS ABOUT ILLEGITIMACY</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>A FEW FACTS ABOUT ILLEGITIMACY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  Today, nearly one out of three children is born out of wedlock,
as opposed to one in ten in 1970.  If current trends continue,
by the year 2015 half of all American children will be born to
a single mother.
<P>
<LI>  In 1991, 1.2 million births were illegitimate -- the highest
number ever reported in the U.S.  In 1993, 6.3 million children
were living with a single parent who had never married.  In 1960,
the number was 243,000.
<P>
<LI>  The illegitimacy rate among black Americans was 26% in 1965.
 Today the rate is 68% and climbing.  In inner cities, the figure
is typically in excess of 80%.  Only 6% of black children born
in 1980 will live with both parents through age 18, according
to some projections.
<P>
<LI>  The illegitimacy rate among white Americans has risen tenfold,
from 2.29% in 1960 to 22% today -- almost the same as the black
illegitimacy rate in the early 1960s that motivated Daniel Patrick
Moynihan to write his famous report on the breakdown of the black
family.  The figure in low-income, working-class white communities
may already be twice that.  According to the latest Census Bureau
runs, the illegitimate birth rate in many white communities now
exceeds 40%, and out-of-wedlock births are increasing more rapidly
among whites than minorities.
<P>
<LI>  Women with college degrees contribute only 4% of white illegitimate
babies, while women  with a high school education or less contribute
82%.  Women with family incomes of $75,000  or more contribute
1% of white illegitimate babies, while women with family incomes
under $20,000 contribute 69%.  For white women below the poverty
line in the year prior to giving birth, 44% of births have been
illegitimate, as opposed to only 6% for women above the poverty
line.
<P>
<LI>  In 1992, 30% of all non-marital births were to females under
the age of 20.  The federal government has a particular interest
in preventing unwed teenage childbearing because teen mothers
who enter the welfare system are far more likely than older mothers
to rely on government to support their children and to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
<LI>  By 1992, 71% of teen mothers were unmarried -- a more than
doubling of the rate in just one generation.  In 1970, the proportion
of teen mothers who were unmarried was 30%.  In 1950, 14% of births
to teenagers were to unmarried mothers.
<P>
<LI>  Almost half of unwed teen mothers go on welfare within one
year after the birth of a first child.  By the time the baby is
age 5, 72% of white teens and 84% of black teens have received
AFDC. 
<P>
<LI>  Nearly one out of five teens who have a premarital pregnancy
will become pregnant again within one year.  More than 31% experience
a second pregnancy within two years.

<TITLE>AMERICA NEEDS WEDFARE, NOT WELFARE</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>AMERICA NEEDS WEDFARE,<BR>
NOT WELFARE</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The new Congress is planning to pass a major welfare reform initiative
that will encourage states to test some creative ideas for reducing
the number of people on the welfare rolls.  To date, much of the
debate has focused on ways to help welfare recipients become self
sufficient by requiring them to work for their benefits.
<P>
While "workfare" is a worthy idea, welfare reformers
need to do more than just get people off welfare.  They need to
devote serious attention to developing "preventative"
strategies for reducing the number of people who ever need welfare
in the first place.
<P>
A "preventative" strategy should focus squarely on the
primary cause of welfare dependency:  illegitimacy.  Three out
of ten births in the U.S. today are out-of-wedlock.  And few of
these never-married mothers bear any resemblance to the affluent,
upwardly-mobile Murphy Brown.  Instead, unmarried women who bear
children are five times more likely to live below the poverty
line than are married mothers.  And their children are much more
likely to suffer from abuse and neglect, and to drop out of school,
abuse drugs, commit crimes, and get pregnant out of wedlock.
<P>
To curb illegitimacy, Congressional reformers should step up efforts
to teach abstinence in schools, streamline adoption for out-of-wedlock
births, and reverse welfare policies that penalize marriage. 
The House GOP Contract With America takes some important first
steps in these areas.  It makes adoption expenses tax deductible,
eliminates welfare payments for all future cases involving unmarried
teen mothers, and sets aside money for developing a pro-marriage
tax credit for the poor.  
<P>
Moreover, some states have already taken modest steps to address
the welfare system's bias against marriage.  For example, under
the leadership of Governor Tommy Thompson, Wisconsin adopted a
"bridefare" policy in 1991 which provides higher benefits
for low-income married couples who marry or remain married.  More
recently, California has passed a "wedfare" law which
allows poor moms who marry an opportunity to retain health coverage
rather than being cut off from continued benefits.
<P>
Congress would do well to encourage states to adopt more pro-marriage
reforms of this kind.  Doing so would acknowledge that the primary
escape route from poverty 30 years after the adoption of liberal
Great Society programs is not welfare or workfare.  It is marriage.

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT PARENTS WANT</title>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT PARENTS WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A 1993 Families and Work Institute study found that 66 percent
of the 3,381 adults surveyed nationwide wanted more time with
their children.[1]

<p>

<li>Parents today spend only 17 hours per week with their children,
40 percent less than in 1965, according to a University of Maryland
study.[2]

<p>

<li>A recent <I>Newsweek</I> poll found that one half of all parents
feel that they don't spend enough time with their children.[3]

<p>

<li>Sixty-six percent of employed parents with children ages 18
and under indicated that they did not have enough time with their
children, and another 50 percent indicated that they did not have
enough time with their spouses.[4]

<p>

<li>Thirty-five percent of all workers with children would be
willing to change jobs in order to receive flexible scheduling
around their home concerns.[5]

<p>

<li>The 44 percent of parents who do not feel that they spend
enough time with their children cite work as the most frequent
culprit.[6]

<p>

<li>Half of America's moms have said no to job advancement compared
with only 29 percent of dads. This trend is more prevalent in
younger mothers, where 62 percent have turned down promotions
in favor of spending more time with their children. However, two
out of three dads say they have not turned down a job promotion
in favor of spending more time with their kids.[7]

<p>

<li>Half of all fathers feel that they do not spend enough time
with their children.[8]

<p>

<li>A 1995 Gallup poll found that nearly half of all parents feel
that they spend too little time with their children. Fewer than
one-third of these respondents ate dinner together on a regular
basis.[9]

<p>

<li>The overwhelming choice for weekend family activities seems
to be spending time with children. Parents' top four choices for
weekend activities were &quot;talking with children,&quot; taking 
&quot;care of children,&quot; going on &quot;trips with children,&quot; 
and playing &quot;games with children.&quot; Unfortunately, by 1986 
parents actually had 10 fewer hours per week to spend with their 
children then they did in 1960.[10]

<title>FRC RAISES STRONG OBJECTIONS TO THE U.N.CONFERENCE 
IN BEIJING</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>FRC RAISES STRONG OBJECTIONS<br>
TO THE U.N.CONFERENCE IN<br>
BEIJING</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
The Family Research Council (FRC) is an organization dedicated
to preserving and strengthening the traditional family unit. 
As such, FRC is strongly opposed to major elements of the agenda
for the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women which is to be held
in Beijing, China, from September 4-15, 1995.
<P>
FRC finds this conference objectionable not only because the conference
-- which claims to uphold women's rights -- is being hosted by
a country with a long track record of abuses against women (i.e.,
female infanticide, coerced abortion policies, involuntary sterilization,
the one-child-per-couple mandate, etc.), but also because the
platform document under consideration denigrates motherhood, undermines
the traditional family unit, and erodes the foundations of marriage
and family life while upholding abortion and the dissemination
of contraceptives to minors as positive alternatives.
<P>
Among its most egregious violations, the document:
<UL>
<LI><B>Denigrates the values of motherhood and traditional family
life.</B>  For example, the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed
throughout the entire platform so that it might be changed to
the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;  Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot;
has been bracketed so that it might be changed to &quot;household.&quot;
 [Bracketed sections indicate that delegates could not agree on
the text.  These sections are to be discussed further, with each
alternative weighed equally.]  In addition, the word &quot;family&quot;
almost always appears in a negative context, i.e., in relation
to domestic violence or as a vehicle for female oppression.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<LI><B>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power
play. </B>  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform: &quot;Inequality
in the public arena can often start within the family when <I>power
relations</I> between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on<I> unequal
power relations</I> also limits women's potential...for participation
in decision-making in wider public forums&quot; (emphasis added).
 Thus, rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are nowhere to be found
in the document even though the populace of every country participating
in the conference honors the marital relationship.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Fails to uphold traditional morality by leaving the term
&quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</B>
While &quot;gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform 
document, the U.N. fails to define the term.  During a preparatory
committee meeting for the conference, one of the delegates asked
that the term &quot;gender&quot; be defined as the traditional
biological classifications of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female.&quot;
 Others, however, sought to define &quot;gender&quot; as &quot;the
socially-constructed roles which society assigns to men and women.&quot;
 This latter definition has been used in feminist literature to
mean that gender is subject to change and that there exists a
spectrum of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual,
female heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual). 
The U.N. rejected both definitions and decided that &quot;gender&quot;
was to be understood &quot;in its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;
  One can only hope the commonly accepted meaning of gender in
the United States remains that which acknowledges the biological
classifications of male and female.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</B>
 In various areas relating to sexuality, reproduction, and AIDS,
the document repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling,
recognizing their rights to privacy, confidentiality, and informed
consent.&quot;  Only rarely does the document make mention of
the &quot;rights, duties, and responsibilities of parents,&quot;
but it seems to do so as a concession because parents are still
legally responsible for their children.  The document, however,
refuses to recognize parental <I>authority</I> in regards to their
children's reproductive health.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</B>
 The efforts of the previous U.N. conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen
to promote abortion and unrestricted contraceptive availability
are well-known.  The Beijing document follows in this tradition.
 While the platform fails to recognize the role of men as husbands
and fathers, it does express the notion that women should be completely
autonomous in their reproductive decision-making.  Indeed, the
platform urges governments to &quot;take action to ensure that
women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized and
respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  Furthermore, the platform seems
to elevate reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights,
stating that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).

<h2>STATE-BY-STATE<br>
DIVORCE RATES:<br>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Massachusetts and Connecticut rank first and second, respectively,
for having the lowest divorce rates in the nation, according to
new 1994 divorce data from the National Center for Health Statistics.
Both states experienced a moderate drop in divorce rates between
1992 and 1994 to remain at the top of the list. Massachusetts
fell from 2.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 1994, while Connecticut fell from
3.1 to 2.8.
<p>
Nevada once again had the highest divorce rate in the country,
even though it experienced the most marked drop in divorce rates
during the two-year period. Nevada fell from 11.4 in 1992 to 9.0
in 1994.
<p>
The divorce rate per 1,000 population for the entire United States
was 4.6 in 1994, down from 4.8 in 1992. Generally, rates were
lower in the Northeast and Midwest and higher in the West and
Southeast.
<p>
Only four states (New York, South Dakota, Missouri, and Mississippi)
experienced a rise in divorce rates between 1992 and 1994. Eight
other states held the same rate during 1992 and 1994. Vermont,
with a drop in the divorce rate from 5.2 to 4.0, rose in rank
from 27th to a tie for 15th position.

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT CHILDREN WANT</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT CHILDREN WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>Half of all children watch more than two hours of television
a day, but three-fourths of these children say that if they could
choose between spending time with their families and watching
television they would choose family time.[1]

<p>

<li>Among children ages 8 to 12, 31 percent say that they do not
spend enough time with their fathers.[2]

<p>

<li>On any given day, nearly 400,000 children -- none of them
eligible for adoption -- can be found in government foster homes,
group homes, and shelters.[3] As one child says, &quot;I'm all 
wrapped up in programs....What I need is a mom.&quot;

<p>

<li>According to the American Public Welfare Association, the
population of children in substitute care is growing 33 times
faster than the U.S. child population in general. During each
of the past 10 years, more children have entered the system than
exited.[4]

<p>

<li>Every year, 15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot; from foster
care by turning 18 with no permanent family. Forty percent of
all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare, according
to the American Civil Liberties Union.[5]

<p>

<li>Judith S. Wallerstein conducted a study of 60 families who
experienced divorce between 1971 and 1981. Ten years after the
divorce, the children affected felt &quot;less protected, less
cared for, less comforted...these children [had] vivid, gut-wrenching
memories of their parents' separation.&quot;[6]

<p>

<li>In the same study by Wallerstein, many 5- to 8-year-old boys
showed &quot;an intense longing for their fathers&quot; after
the divorce -- a longing that seemed physically painful.<B> </B>Not
only did the children's need for their father continue, but it
also tended to recur with new intensity at adolescence, especially
when it was time for the children to leave home.[7]

<p>

<li>Almost 20 percent of sixth- through 12th-graders have not
had a good conversation lasting for at least 10 minutes with at
least one of their parents in more than a month.[8]

<p>

<li>More than one-half of all children who don't live with their
father have never been in their father's current home.[9]

<p>

<li>&quot;Father hunger&quot; often afflicts boys age one and
two whose fathers are suddenly and permanently absent. Sleep disturbances,
such as trouble falling asleep, nightmares, and night terrors
frequently begin within one to three months after the father leaves
home.[10]

<p>

<li>The National Commission on Children reported that children
from step-families were more likely to say they often felt lonely
or blue than children from either single-parent or intact families.[11]

<TITLE>RESTORE THE HYDE AMENDMENT</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>RESTORE THE HYDE AMENDMENT</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by
<P>Gracie S. Hsu, M.H.S.</I></CENTER>
<P>
Congress should restore the original intent of the Hyde Amendment, preserving
states' and voters' rights to set limitations on the use of taxpayer
funds to pay for certain abortions.  
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  Since 1976,
Congress has annually approved the Hyde Amendment, named for its
original sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), which bans the use of
federal Medicaid funds for abortion except when the life of the
mother is endangered.  In 1993, Hyde's exception clause was expanded
to include cases of rape and incest.  The expansion was reluctantly
agreed upon by  many pro-lifers so that President Clinton's attempt
to repeal the Hyde Amendment altogether could be successfully
halted.  Also, House floor debate made it clear that these &quot;rape
and incest&quot; exceptions were only intended to be options for
states because many states' laws prohibit the taxpayer funding
of abortion.
<P>
However, in December 1993, the Clinton administration
issued a series of directives which &quot;interpreted&quot; the
revised Hyde Amendment as a mandate that states <B>must</B> provide and
co-fund Medicaid abortions in the cases of rape and incest.  Under
Clinton's  directive, the abortionist may simply make the unverifiable
assertion that a woman is the victim of rape or incest but is
unable, for physical or <I>psychological</I> reasons, to comply with
a reporting or documentation requirement.  Any state which refused
to comply, the directives said, would risk losing <B>all</B> federal
Medicaid funding.  At the time the directives were issued, 32
states had laws or regulations prohibiting public funding for
abortion except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered.
 Many of these states' laws were passed by public referendum (rather
than by state legislatures).  And yet, since that time, many states
have been forced to repeal or change their laws -- either through
legislative action or court order.
<P>
In fact, Arkansas' and Colorado's
constitutional amendments prohibiting state funding of abortion
except when the life of the mother is endangered -- an amendment
supported by then-Governor Clinton -- were struck down <B><I>in their
entirety</I></B> by a federal court, opening the door to state funding
of abortion on demand. 
<P>
<B>Bills and Sponsors:</B>  Several members of
Congress have sought to restore the pre-Clinton intent of the
Hyde Amendment to respect states' (and voters') rights.  Spearheaded
by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.),
the Exon-Istook Amendment would preserve the rights of states
to opt for or against state taxpayer provision and funding of
abortion in cases of rape and incest, thereby rescinding the Clinton
administration's mandate to the states.
<P>
The first
attempt to include the Exon-Istook Amendment in the "Rescissions
Bill" earlier this year failed due to pro-abortion Republicans
threatening to vote against the important rescissions package
unless the Exon-Istook Amendment was dropped.  However, the Exon-Istook
Amendment will be re-introduced in Congress this summer as an
attachment to and clarification of the Hyde Amendment.  The Hyde
Amendment has been annually offered by Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.)
as an amendment to the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes
before Congress for a vote every summer.
<P>
<B>Prospects:</B>  The prospects
are hopeful that the Exon-Istook Amendment will be passed by both
Congressional houses if it is included with the Hyde Amendment
in the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill this summer.  But expect
the same pro-abortion Republicans as well as the heavy rhetoric
of the Clinton administration to try to thwart the passage of
the Exon-Istook Amendment.

<TITLE>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S WAR ON THE FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S
<BR>WAR ON THE FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<CENTER>
<P>
<I>by</I>

<I> Daniel S. Garcia</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Legal Service Corporation (LSC) is an independent, nonprofit
corporation funded by the federal government to the tune of $415
million a year.  LSC's purported purpose is to provide poor people
access to expensive legal services.  But, actually, LSC has become
a deep well for anti-family litigation.  By using carefully-selected
&quot;test cases&quot; in carefully selected courts, liberal activists
have used the LSC to litigate their agenda, sidestepping democracy
and the legislative process.
<P>
Since 1974, LSC has spent $5 billion working against the interests
of the family on many fronts.  Following are some examples:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PROMOTING ABORTION AND DIVORCE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Legal Services Act, as amended in 1977 and in subsequent appropriations
acts, prohibited LSC from being involved in abortion related cases.
 Nonetheless, LSC has remained firmly committed to abortion on
demand and has worked around the law in an attempt to secure unlimited,
taxpayer-funded abortions.  In several cases throughout the country,
LSC has worked against waiting periods, parental consent, parental
notification and spousal notification.
<P>
In <I>Planned Parenthood Association, Inc. v. Department of Human
Resources, </I>Oregon Legal Services represented Planned Parenthood
in a challenge to a limitation on the number of elective abortions
that the state's medical assistance program would fund.  LSC argued
that poor women should have access to an unlimited number of taxpayer-funded
abortions.[1]  LSC took a similar line in a Pennsylvania case, arguing
that such limitations were an unconstitutional infringement of
a woman's right to have an unlimited number of abortions.[2]   In
another Pennsylvania case, LSC filed a class action suit to discard
parental consent for minors and spousal consent.[3]
<P>
In testimony on the reauthorization of LSC, Linda Jones of Concerned
Women for America of California testified that LSC has been involved
in most major abortion cases.  According to Jones, &quot;The list
reads like a virtual hall of fame for abortion rights litigation.&quot; [4]
<P>
LSC seems to be more interested in facilitating divorce in troubled
families than in helping to repair them.  An example of LSC's
lack of commitment to keeping families intact is their view on
mediation. The National Center on Women and Family Law, an LSC-funded
center, argues that mediation, one important means of resolving
domestic disputes, should be avoided because the woman is always
at a disadvantage.[5]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>EXPANDING WELFARE, SUBSIDIZING DESTRUCTIVE
BEHAVIOR</H3></CENTER>
<P>
LSC has also been active in blocking attempts to reform welfare
and in increasing the number of people dependent on public assistance
programs.  In the case of <I>C.K. v. Shalala,</I>[6] LSC joined the
ACLU and the National Organization of Women's Legal Defense Fund
in a class action suit to block New Jersey's law capping welfare
payments to mothers who have additional children while on welfare.
 LSC argued that such a law was an unconstitutional violation
of a woman's right to procreate at will.  LSC has filed similar
suits against California, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, Iowa, Kansas and Maine.
<P>
Lawsuits filed by LSC have also helped to subsidize the destructive
habits of alcoholics and drug addicts.  In recent years, LSC has
helped some 250,000 substance addicts obtain monthly disability
checks.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AIDING THE HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In the case of <I>Rush v. Parham,</I>[8] the Atlanta Legal Aid Society,
an LSC grantee, tried to force the state of Georgia to pay for
a sex change operation.  The suit challenged the Georgia Department
of Health's prohibition on Medicaid reimbursement for such operations.
 
<P>
The Legal Aid Society of Kentucky, another LSC grantee, represented
a lesbian mother who contested the custody of a two-and-a-half-year-old
child to the father, who had remarried.  In the case of <I>S.
v S.,</I>[9]  LSC lawyers challenged the customary preference for
the traditional family as the best environment in which to raise
children.
<P>
In a  1986 New York Case involving a lease agreement,[10] LSC claimed
that a &quot;gay life partner&quot; should be treated as a family
member.  Arguing that equal protection required that the gay partner
be treated as a family member, attorneys from the Legal Aid Society
successfully argued the case in the New York Supreme Court, calling
into question laws that favor and protect the traditional family.
  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PUSHING THE CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AGENDA</H3></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Children's rights,&quot; is another area where LSC lawyers
have pursued an anti-family agenda.  The notion that children
have rights independent of their parents is a concept that undermines
parental authority and opens the door to state interference in
the raising of children.  In the case of <I>Nafzinger v. Blum</I>,[11]
LSC lawyers successfully argued that minors who no longer wanted
to live at home should get their own welfare benefits.  The Legal
Aid Society of Central Texas, an LSC grant recipient, filed a
suit to force public housing officials to rent apartments to minors.[12]
 In 1992, Legal Services of Greater Miami argued that children
should have standing to sue their parents.[13] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>GOING SOFT ON CRIME AND AIDING CRIMINALS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Criminals often find a friend in LSC.  In a bizarre and disturbing
case from Pennsylvania,  Lehigh Valley Legal Services represented
a convicted rapist in prison who was suing for custody of the
child he fathered by the rape of a 13 year old girl.  A psychologist
found the rapist unfit to be a parent and determined that any
child in his custody would be endangered.  After a three-day non-jury
trial the judge ruled that the rapist had no parental rights.[14]
 In cases like <I>Duran v. Elrod,</I>[15] LSC grantees have worked
hard to make sure that prisons look more like country clubs than
places to protect society from dangerous people. Such lawsuits
have had the additional consequence of increasing the costs of
incarcerating criminals, and putting many of them back on the
street, often in neighborhoods where the poor become their main
targets.[16]  LSC lawsuits have also made it difficult to evict drug
dealers from public housing units and to keep them out in the
first place.[17]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By advancing this radical, anti-family agenda, LSC has done far
more to hurt poor people than to help them.  The poor, as well
as the rest of the country, can't afford LSC.  In recent testimony
to a House Judiciary Sub-Committee Howard Phillips, former head
of the Office of Economic Opportunity,  said that the true cost
of LSC should include the impact of actual, threatened and feared
LSC-related suits as well as increased federal state and local
government spending.  According to Phillips, &quot;viewed in this
way, the LSC is properly seen as a central player in our current
national deficit and debt problem.&quot; [18] Attempts to reform LSC
have failed and the agency should be abolished.  The poor are
better served by state and local initiatives as well as private
foundations and bar associations.  These institutions have demonstrated
the ability to adequately meet the legitimate legal needs of the
poor.  Non-federal contributions to LSC-type programs amounted
to $255 million in 1994.[19]  At a time when Congress needs to carefully
assess budgetary priorities it makes no sense to continue funding
LSC.

<blockquote>
WASHINGTON (AIPE).- A medida que Amrica Latina adelanta su proceso de
reforma econmica se hace ms evidente la necesidad de contar con un sistema
judicial eficaz. La democratizacin, la concentracin de la poblacin en
reas urbanas y la apertura econmica han aumentado la complejidad de la
interaccin social y, en consecuencia, la demanda por servicios judiciales
en la resolucin de conflictos. Adems, la economa de mercado exige
definiciones claras sobre derechos y obligaciones.
<p>
El sistema judicial, que incluye todos los mecanismos necesarios para
interpretar las leyes y regulaciones, es un elemento clave en el desarrollo
econmico. Sin embargo, los tribunales latinoamericanos sufren de crecientes
demoras y de corrupcin, lo cual genera desconfianza en el sistema. En casi
todos los pases latinoamericanos se observa una falta de consistencia en la
aplicacin de la jurisprudencia, lo cual unido a retrasos en resolver casos
aumenta el costo de acceso a la justicia y tambin de realizar negocios e
inversiones.
<p>
A medida que aumenta el costo de la justicia, la gente reacciona acudiendo
menos a los tribunales. Un reciente estudio muestra que la mayora de los
usuarios no se inclinan a acudir a un tribunal para resolver disputas porque
perciben el sistema como lento, incierto, costoso y de "pobre calidad". La
desconfianza en el sistema judicial es considerablemente mayor entre
empresarios pequeos y las familias de bajos ingresos.
<p>
A menudo se argumenta que se sufre de presupuestos inadecuados, pero pases
como Dinamarca, Japn y Alemania, donde el pblico tiene gran confianza en
el sistema judicial, el gobierno asigna porciones menores de su presupuesto
que Argentina, Brasil, Colombia y Mxico, las naciones cuyos tribunales
gozan de la menor confianza por parte del pblico. No se ha comprobado
relacin alguna entre la eficiencia judicial y el tamao del presupuesto
asignado a los tribunales. Encuestas realizadas en Argentina, Venezuela,
Ecuador y Per muestran que entre 55% y 75% del pblico tiene una muy baja
opinin del sector judicial. La percepcin general es que el entrenamiento
de los jueces es pobre y que no se garantiza la igualdad ante la ley.
<p>
Una pregunta clave es por qu los jueces a menudo se oponen a las reformas.
La respuesta se basa en que funcionarios gubernamentales se aprovechan de
los tribunales para obtener rentas ilcitas, lo cual en gran parte es
posible debido a la amplia discrecionalidad monoplica de que gozan los
jueces.  Por ejemplo, la costumbre de que los jueces reciben por separado a
las partes crea fuertes incentivos a la corrupcin. Como tampoco hay normas
establecidas sobre el lapso de tiempo antes de iniciar el juicio o sobre su
duracin, esto se presta a que funcionarios del tribunal cobren por agilizar
los trmites.
<p>
Otro problema es la frecuente concentracin de poder en las manos del juez,
quien asume mltiples roles en cuanto a la programacin estratgica, el
manejo de personal, la administracin de recursos, control presupuestario y
la adjudicacin de casos, todo lo cual distrae su atencin de la resolucin
de casos pendientes y abre mltiples posibilidades de corrupcin, debido a
la ausencia de mecanismos internos y externos de control.
<p>
La inercia frente a la necesidad de las reformas judiciales en parte se
explica porque los beneficios, tales como mayor inversin y crecimiento
econmico  son generales y a largo plazo, mientras que el costo es
individual e inmediato:  la desaparicin de los ingresos por corrupcin. Por
lo tanto, parte de las reformas tendran que incluir mayores beneficios a
corto plazo dirigidos a los funcionarios del sistema judicial, a travs de
generosas pensiones, promociones para los jueces y empleados de los
tribunales, nuevas instalaciones y ms amplios presupuestos.
<p>
La corrupcin implica un rompimiento del cdigo de tica colectivo que
beneficia al individuo que paga bajo la mesa para conseguir lo que desea del
tribunal, pero la sociedad se perjudica por una cada de la productividad a
travs del tiempo causada por la generalizada percepcin de que la
asignacin de recursos se hace de manera poco equitativa, al ser determinada
por prcticas corruptas. El estudio de la historia econmica prueba que la
corrupcin sistmica observada en la administracin de justicia en Amrica
Latina seguir contribuyendo al retraso econmico de la regin.

<TITLE>THE TRUTH ABOUT AFDC</TITLE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>THE TRUTH ABOUT AFDC</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
 <I>MYTH:  Single mothers heading households
alone are being unfairly singled out in the discussion of reforming
the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  According to the Census Bureau, the vast majority (87 percent)
of AFDC recipients live in single-parent households.  Nearly half
(47 percent) of the mothers on AFDC have never married; 23 percent
are widowed or divorced; and 17 percent are married, but living
without a husband present in the home.  Only 13 percent of women
receiving AFDC are married and living with a spouse. 
<P><BR>
<I>MYTH:  Women
receiving AFDC have the same childbearing patterns as non-AFDC
women.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  Women on AFDC are significantly younger than other
first-time mothers when they bear their first child.  The average
age of new mothers in the AFDC population (age 20) is three years
younger than the average age of non-AFDC mothers at first birth.
 AFDC mothers also have a slightly higher average number of children
(2.6 children).
<P>
<BR>
<I>MYTH:  If AFDC mothers had guaranteed child care
and additional material resources, they could earn their college
degrees in a matter of years.</I>
<P>
<B> FACT:</B>  While 85 percent of non-AFDC
women are at least high school graduates, almost half (44 percent)
of AFDC mothers do not have a high school diploma.  Only 19 percent
of women receiving AFDC have completed at least one year of college.
<P>
<BR>
<I>MYTH: The majority of AFDC recipients are minorities.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  There are far more white women in their childbearing years on AFDC (27.4
million) than African-American and Hispanic mothers combined (5.7
million and 4.2 million respectively).  Minority women, however,
do receive aid in numbers disproportionate to their population
size.  Only 7 percent of white mothers collect AFDC, while 26
percent of African-American mothers and 19 percent of Hispanic
mothers receive AFDC benefits.

<title>COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY<br>
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<center><h4>WHAT TYPES OF PORNOGRAPHY ARE FREELY AVAILABLE TO ANYONE ON
THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
The entire spectrum of pornographic material is available on computer
networks including images of soft-core nudity, hard-core sex acts,
anal sex, bestiality, bondage &amp; dominion, sado-masochism (including
actual torture and mutilation, usually of women, for sexual pleasure),
scatological acts (defecating and urinating, usually on women,
for sexual pleasure), fetishes, and child pornography.  Additionally,
there is textual pornography including detailed text stories of
the rape, mutilation, and torture of women, sexual abuse of children,
graphic incest, etc.
<p>
<center><h4>WHO CAN ACCESS PORNOGRAPHY ON THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Virtually anyone with an account or access to the Internet can
access pornography.  Once &quot;on-line&quot; there are no truly
effective safety measures to prevent children from accessing all
of the pornography described above.  This unlimited access to
pornography, with no accurate, enforceable age check and no verification
procedures, has never occurred in the print, broadcast, satellite
or cable media before.  Cyberspace is currently the free speech
absolutist's dream world.
<p>
<center><h4>WHERE DO CHILDREN AND ADULTS FIND PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL ON
THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Pornography is publicly available through the Internet by accessing
sections in the hierarchies of the Usenet and at a number of sites
on the World-Wide-Web.  It is also traded daily via Internet e-mail
and sites set up for the exchange of pornography.
<p>
<center><h4>ARE THESE SITES POPULAR OR IS THIS REALLY A SMALL PROBLEM?</h4>
</center>
<p>
Although surveys done by on-line administrators indicate that
pornographic sites are among the most often used on the Internet,
the relative percentage of pornographic sites is not certain.
 Regardless of the actual number of sites, which is on the rise, the 
problem of pornography continues to be a very serious one.  Like drugs, 
pornography's destructive effects are felt far beyond the &quot;pusher&quot;
and &quot;user.&quot;
<p>
<center><h4>DON'T WE NEED FURTHER STUDY BEFORE WE TAKE ACTION ON AN ISSUE 
THAT AFFECTS THE FUTURE OF CYBERSPACE?</h4></center>
<p>
Proposals to &quot;study&quot; the issue of computer pornography
are attempts by the ACLU and other ideological groups to delay legislative 
action on this problem.  They fight virtually any legislative restriction on
materials distributed on-line,  and want to dump all responsibility
for action into the laps of parents, many of whom are far less
technologically capable than their children.
<p>
<center><h4>ISN'T THE ON-LINE COMMUNITY AGAINST PROPOSALS FOR &QUOT;DECENCY&QUOT;
ON THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Some of the on-line community and many of the media are opposed
to any proposals to regulate the Internet or children's access
to pornography.  However, out of an estimated 20 million predominately
male users of various on-line networks, fewer than 2 percent have
opposed the proposals.
<p>
<center><h4>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBSCENITY AND INDECENCY?</h4>
</center>
<p>
<I>Obscenity</I> is hard-core sexual material so graphic and unredeeming
that it meets the Supreme Court's three-part test: (1) it appeals
to an abnormal or excessive interest in sex; (2) it depicts or
describes sexually explicit conduct in a patently offensive way;
and (3) it lacks serious literary artistic, political, or scientific
value. <i>Miller v. California</i> (1973). <I>Indecency</I> is
a pattern of patently offensive depictions or descriptions of
sexual or excretory activities or organs.  <i>Pacifica v. F.C.C.</i>
(1978).  This material is legal for consenting adults, but can
be regulated so that it is kept from children.
<p>
<center><h4>WON'T THE BANNING OF &QUOT;INDECENT&QUOT; MATERIALS JEOPARDIZE
SERIOUS WORKS OF LITERATURE OR LIBRARY ART?</h4></center>
<p>
No.  This argument is no more credible now than it was when used
against indecency laws in other contexts.  No serious literary
or artistic works would be banned by an indecency law.  Society
has long embraced the principle that those who peddle harmful
material have the obligation to keep the material from children.
 Computer indecency should be no exception.
<p>
<center><h4>AREN'T THERE &QUOT;TECHNICAL FIXES&QUOT; THAT ARE LESS INTRUSIVE
THAN A REGULATORY OR CRIMINAL LAW APPROACH?</h4></center>
<p>
No.  To date, only a few software programs have been released
to regulate children's access to pornography, such as SurfWatch
and NetNanny.  Also, these programs can be bypassed by users with
a good knowledge of the Internet and some technical sophistication.
 Even if better technical solutions become available, this approach
is inadequate in and of itself because:
<ul>
<li>children can walk down the street to another computer
<li>parents' technical ability often pales in comparison to their
children's expertise
<li>pornographers aren't legally discouraged from peddling their
materials to children
</ul>
<p>
<I>The above material includes excerpts adapted from &quot;Children,
Pornography and Cyberspace: The Problem, Solutions &amp; the Current
Congressional Debate&quot; published by the National Coalition
for the Protection of Children &amp; Families.</I>

<title>WHAT IS GOALS 2000?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>WHAT IS GOALS 2000?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Remove all the frills and Goals 2000 is essentially an application
process.  These are the terms:  a state agrees to report to the
federal government on its standards and assessments in exchange
for federal grant money.  Signing on the dotted line means a state
will submit its plan for improvement -- standards, assessments
and all -- for federal critique.  There are strings attached to
the Goals 2000 money, and they cannot be avoided unless a state
refuses to participate.
<p>
The only way Goals 2000 can rightly be termed &quot;voluntary&quot;
is that states currently have the option not to participate in
the program.  However, the Goals 2000 application process can
be attached to any piece of federal legislation.  As its requirements
are added to more and more legislation, there will be no way for
states to get federal money for education without submitting to
Goals 2000.
<p>
What's wrong with the terms of the Goals 2000 application agreement?
Never before have states had to submit their &quot;lesson plans&quot;
to get federal money.  American tradition and law have held that
education is a matter of state and local concern.  As the federal
government began to usurp the control of education, curriculum
was still set apart as an issue reserved for state and local decisionmakers.
The U.S. Education Department was specifically prohibited from
dealing with curricular issues when it was created in 1980.  Yet
Goals 2000 ignores the prohibition.  It calls for federal involvement
in the funding, development and approval of standards and assessments.
These are curricular issues in which the federal government should
not be involved.  Thus, the Goals 2000 application requires a
state to submit to an inappropriate role for the federal government.

<TITLE>RESPONSES TO LIBERAL SCARE TACTICS</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>RESPONSES TO LIBERAL SCARE TACTICS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  The movement away from cash benefits affects only a small percentage
of the prospective caseload.  It is the least we can do and still
claim that we are changing the system.
<P>
<LI>  By targeting teenagers, we intend to stop the cycle of misery
before it starts.
<P>
<LI>  Liberal social groups base their projections about the number
of children who will be cut from the rolls on a flawed and biased
study by a liberal think-tank, which derived the figures by going
back in time 10 years and implementing the bill, then returning
to the present -- without assuming any change in behavior or population
size.   
<P>
<LI>  The elimination of benefits affects only potential future additions
to the welfare rolls.  Not one person currently receiving welfare
would lose any benefits the day after the bill is passed. Given the Faustian bargain we have made
with current recipients,
it would be unethical to require them to function normally at
this stage.  Instead, we must protect future generations from
becoming mired in the habits of dependency.
<P>
The under-18 provision applies only with respect to federal funding.
 States are free to use state funds as they see fit.
<P>
<LI>  Minor mothers retain Medicaid, food stamps, and housing benefits.
<P>
<LI>  The federal government spends welfare dollars very inefficiently.
 One study found that less than 35 cents out of every federal
welfare dollar was paid in cash directly to the needy.  If the
federal government gave all the money it spends on welfare directly
to the poor, each family of four would receive more than the average
American family income.
<P>
<LI>  By cashing out AFDC benefits, the federal government frees
new dollars which the states can then spend on services for young
unwed mothers -- more compassionate alternatives that will minister
personally to mothers and children, instead of sapping their spirits.
<P>
<LI>  Private charitable efforts rescue far more individuals than
government social programs. Historically, private-sector organizations have succeeded in
transforming
the poor by setting behavioral standards for the receipt of assistance.
 Because it is far easier to receive a check in the mail, no questions
asked, federal welfare has kept the needy from receiving real
help. 
<P>
<LI>  In 1991, private charities provided, in cash or in kind, over
$176 billion for health, education, and welfare.  More than $100
billion of that amount was in cash.  The same year, Americans
volunteered time and manpower the equivalent of nine million full-time
employees.  After declining steadily through the 1960s and 1970s,
charitable giving rose during the 1980s.
<P>
<LI>  It is wrong to defer welfare cuts until some direct replacement
is identified for every current recipient because bad charity
drives out good.

Though this looks like a closet, it's really the "intern punishment room" for those unruly interns who talk too much or take a long lunch.  Just kidding!  (or are we?)<p>

Lest the staff of Town Hall gets too full of itself, we need to recognize the group of people who
do the real work: Town Hall's interns.  Here are a few of them seated in the room fondly known as
"intern row."

<TITLE> NEW LAW REDEFINES THE FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<H2>NEW LAW REDEFINES THE FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<P>A new law pushed by the Clinton Administration redefines "family"
to include unmarried partners, including gays and lesbians.  This
promotes homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
<P>
<CENTER> <H3>THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act was signed into
law by President Clinton on October 22, 1994.  The Act permits
a federal employee to use sick leave to attend to the medical
needs of a family member.  The Act requires the Office of Personnel
Management to use the definition of "family member"
as found in the pre-existing leave transfer program.[1]
<P>
The leave transfer program defines "family member"; based
on the term "immediate relative" as it is used for funeral
leave purposes.  OPM clarifies the definition in the <I>Federal
Register:</I> "We recognize that there may be cases in which
the traditional concept of a family relationship is not applicable,
yet a close relationship to the leave recipient exists that is
the equivalent of a family relationship.  Examples include foster
children and step children."[2]
<P>
In December 1994, the Clinton Administration twisted the definition
of "family member" as outlined in the leave transfer
program to mean something entirely different when applied to the
new leave law.  OPM Director of Communications Janice Lachance
confirms that "family member" now includes "domestic
partners" of either sex.  "It's a recognition of how
family relationships have evolved," Lachance said.  "It's
an effort to respond to the realities that federal employees face
each and every day....The key thing to remember is the government
is getting out of the business of defining relationships."[3]
<P>
OPM's new definition for "family member" includes: "spouse,
and parents thereof; children, including adopted children and
spouses thereof; parents; brothers and sisters, and spouses thereof;
<I>and any individual related by blood or affinity whose close
association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship</I>."[4]
<P>
Representative Constance Morella (R-MD), a co-sponsor of the bill,
said the definition of family is "reasonable" because
it "covers everybody without getting into the particulars.
 It is accommodating different lifestyles without favoring one
over another."
<P>
<CENTER>
 <H3>WHAT TO DO?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
OPM has liberalized the definition of "family" in the
Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act to mean something
not allowed by the law.  The definition should be changed to mean
unambiguously only the natural family.  This could be accomplished
by striking the word "affinity" from OPM's new regulation.
 Alternatively, the Clinton Administration can grant this benefit
to other-than-family members by amending the regulation to allow
for "non-family members."  The 104th Congress has oversight
of any change.  
<P>
The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act was not designed
to expand the official definition of "family" to include
domestic partners, whether homosexual or heterosexual.  Rather,
it was intended to help federal employees in crisis and should
not be manipulated by the Clinton Administration to advance a
political agenda.

<TITLE>CONSISTENT AND CORRECT CONDOM USE?</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>CONSISTENT AND CORRECT
<BR>CONDOM USE?</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that
condoms, in order to be effective, must be put on prior to genital
contact, must remain intact and, most importantly, must be used
<I>consistently and correctly</I>.  But while millions of dollars
are spent each year on public education campaigns to promote &quot;consistent
and correct&quot; condom usage -- from pamphlets in public health
clinics to AIDS education classes in schools to the recent CDC
public service announcements on both radio and television -- many
Americans still do not use condoms consistently or correctly.
<P><UL>
  <LI> A 1990 study published in the <I>American Journal of Public
Health</I> found that most adults in the United States who have
multiple sexual partners do not use condoms consistently.  Among
currently sexually active adults studied, 13 percent had had sex
with more than one partner in the year preceding the study, but
only 8 percent of this group had used condoms consistently.  Moreover,
of the 13 percent of adults who had more than one partner, two-thirds
provided data on primary versus secondary partners, but only 23
percent of these respondents reported using a condom every time
with their nonprimary partners.  (B.C. Leigh, M.T. Temple, and
K.F. Trocki, &quot;The Sexual Behavior of U.S. Adults:  Results
from a National Survey,&quot; <I>American Journal of Public Health</I>,
83:1400-1408, 1993.)
<P>
  <LI> The 1988 National Survey of Family Growth found that only
13 percent of the 1,887 never-married, sexually active women aged
15-49 used condoms &quot;consistently.&quot;  It is significant
to note, however, that this survey's definition of &quot;consistent&quot;
use did <I>not</I> mean using a condom for each <I>act</I> of
intercourse, but rather that the woman had used condoms in every
<I>month</I> throughout the reference period.  In addition, only
41 percent of the entire sample of never-married, sexually active
women had <I>ever</I> used a condom.  (L.B. Potter and J.E. Anderson,
&quot;Patterns of Condom Use and Sexual Behavior Among Never-Married
Women,&quot; <I>Sexually Transmitted Diseases</I>, 20:201-218,
1993.)
<P>
  <LI> A 1989 study of patients at a public sexually transmitted
disease (STD) clinic found that consistent condom use is rare,
even among populations at high risk.  Of the 300 patients who
participated in the survey, 51 percent of the men and 64 percent
of the women reported having had an STD in the past, and 47 percent
of all subjects were diagnosed with an STD on the day they were
interviewed.  Forty percent also agreed that their sexual behavior put them at risk of HIV
infection.  However,
only 25 percent of respondents had used a condom at the most recent
intercourse, and only 16 percent of black respondents and 13 percent
of Hispanics reported having used a condom at their last sexual
encounter.  The participants appeared to understand the benefits
of using condoms regularly; however, only 60 percent said they
had used a condom at least once in the previous two months.  (H.S.
Weinstock, et al., &quot;Factors Associated with Condom Use in
a High-Risk Heterosexual Population,&quot; <I>Sexually Transmitted
Diseases</I>, 20:14-20, 1993.)
<P>
  <LI> A 1991 study published in <I>Family Planning Perspectives</I>
found that more than half of all unmarried male participants (60
percent of Hispanics and 54 percent of non-Hispanics) had had
two or more heterosexual partners in the year preceding the survey.
 Among married men, 18 percent of Hispanics and 9 percent of non-Hispanic
whites had had two or more sexual partners.  However, while 51
percent of Hispanic men and 49 percent of non-Hispanic men did
<I>not</I> always use condoms with their secondary partners, theoretically
putting both themselves and their primary partners at risk, only
20 percent of Hispanic men and 9 percent of non-Hispanic men used
condoms with their primary partners.  (B. Van Oss Martin, C.A.
Gomez, and N. Hearst, &quot;Multiple Heterosexual Partners and
Condom Use Among Hispanics and Non-Hispanic Whites,&quot; <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I>, 25:170-174, 1993.)</UL>

<title>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Definition:  Denial of AFDC cash benefits to women who
have additional children while on welfare.  The family cap passed
by the House includes a state option to provide vouchers for goods
and services in lieu of cash benefits.</b>
<p>
<li>The family cap represents a minimum standard of acceptability
for new welfare legislation.  Because being born out-of-wedlock
increases the likelihood that an individual will live in poverty,
depend on welfare -- and parent another child out-of-wedlock --
we cannot begin to address welfare dependency until we address
illegitimacy.
<p>
<li>The problem is NOT that too many women are on welfare.  The
problem is that too many single women are bearing children they
are neither financially nor emotionally prepared to support --
and welfare has almost certainly played a role in increasing that
trend.
<p>
<li>The family cap simply asks women on welfare to meet the same
social expectations and live by the same rules that the rest of
us do.  By insisting that women on welfare are every bit as capable
of personal responsibility and rational decision-making, the family
cap accords much more dignity to welfare mothers than the current
system.
<p>
<li>The family cap is a question of simple justice.  The working
poor certainly don't receive an increase in their salary when
they add children to their families.  And is it really fair to
children to encourage a generation of irresponsible parents by
dispensing checks willy-nilly?
<p>
<li>The family cap is a responsibility issue -- not a constriction
of reproductive freedom.  It is the current welfare system that
is manipulating fertility rates.  The fact that we are now confusing
an end to social engineering with social engineering itself is
simply evidence of how far wrong we've gone in the past 30 years.
<p>
<li>The argument is NOT that women have additional children in
order to get the additional dollars.  The existence of the welfare
system shields women from the natural economic consequences of
irresponsible decisions -- and thereby encourages a lack of parental
responsibility, which in turn harms marriage and hurts children.
<p>
<li>The preliminary results from New Jersey (the first state to
implement a family cap) are a powerful demonstration that the
family cap is an effective and necessary reform.  In an initial
experiment, the birth rate dropped for women in <I>both</I> the
treatment and control groups.  Meanwhile, there has been no real
increase in abortions -- the slight rise in the raw numbers is
well within the expected range of random fluctuation.  And in
fact, the pre-cap monthly average abortion rate is slightly <I>higher
</I>than the post-cap monthly average abortion rate.
<p>
<li>The fact that the birth rate dropped in both the treatment
and control groups suggests that the cap has sent a powerful symbolic
message about personal responsibility that has reinforced the
impact of erasing the economic incentive.  The evidence suggests,
then, that we must work to reform the culture at the same time
that we are reversing the perverse economic incentives of the
welfare system.  The goal, in other words, is to instill moral
knowledge while eliminating the tension between morality and the
incentives of the current welfare system.
<p>
<li>We hope to instill morality by rebuilding strong families
and by shifting functions from the state and federal governments
to character-forming institutions in the local community -- families,
schools, churches, and voluntary organizations.  Rebuilding strong
families will require a concerted effort to reduce illegitimacy,
and rebuilding the moral-cultural sphere will require scaling
back government benefits so that local communities are once again
free and able to care for their own.

<TITLE>END CIVILIAN JUDGES' ABUSE OF THE MILITARY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>END CIVILIAN JUDGES'<BR>
ABUSE OF THE MILITARY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Military personnel discharged for homosexuality often file complaints
in federal court seeking reinstatement.  The current groundswell
of cases is tying up the federal court system.  Congress has the
authority to direct that the military courts, which are better
equipped to resolve these cases, assume the litigation burden.
<P>
On January 28, 1993, California-based U.S. District Judge Terry
J. Hatter, Jr. held that the military's policy excluding homosexuals
was unconstitutional and enjoined the entire Department of Defense
from discharging or denying enlistment based on sexual orientation.
 He also enjoined the Pentagon from maintaining files having to
do with the sexual orientation of any member of the armed forces
in the absence of conduct affecting the military mission.
<P>
Hatter's decision came in the case of Petty Officer Keith Meinhold,
who announced on <I>ABC World News Tonight</I>: "Yes, I am,
in fact, gay."  On appeal, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals struck down Hatter's earlier decision to extend the decision
to the entire Defense Department and criticized him for accepting
the case before the military appeal process was exhausted.  
<P>
However, immediately after Hatter's decision and before the appeal,
Assistant Secretary of Defense Edwin Dorn cited the decision in
order to force the armed services to lift the ban.  This was an
unusual response to a district court order.  In the past, decisions
involving only one soldier have never been generalized to the
entire military.
<P>
The military discharges hundreds of personnel for homosexuality
each year.  Homosexual activist groups such as the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund are leading a national campaign to
defeat the military's homosexual law in the courts.  According
to Michelle Benecke, co-director for the pro-homosexual Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network, hundreds of former military members discharged
for homosexuality are seeking reinstatement through the federal
court system.[1]
<P>
Each federal case taxes the courts.  The trail for each case through
the military administrative system and the federal judicial system
is both time-consuming and costly.  For example, a service member
discharged administratively under the Pentagon's homosexual regulations
receives an administrative hearing.  The results of that hearing
are reviewed, and then, subject to the review, the member is discharged
from the service.  Other service members discharged for consensual homosexual acts are often
given administrative misconduct
discharges or courts-martial.  In either case, the former member
has a couple of years to file a complaint against the federal
government seeking reinstatement.  Most discharged members seek
relief by questioning the constitutionality of the decision: 1)
violation of due process, 2) infringement of free speech, 3) discrimination,
and 4) the unlawfulness of criminalizing sodomy.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> A CASE IN POINT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Former midshipman Joseph C. Steffan was dismissed for declaring
himself a homosexual while at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1987.
 He received an administrative hearing and chose to submit a "qualified
resignation" in May 1987.  A year and a half later, he wrote
the Secretary of the Navy seeking to withdraw his resignation
and continue his education at the Academy.  The request was denied.
 Steffan brought suit in federal court in 1989, charging that
the Academy's regulations were unconstitutional.
<P>
Steffan's initial federal court foray was decided in November
1989.  The court dismissed the case, citing Steffan's refusal
to cooperate with the court.  On January 10, 1991 Steffan filed
a request for documents which were to be used in a presumed appeal.
 The appeal that followed was decided by a three-judge panel from
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
on November 16, 1993.  The same appeals court then called for
a rehearing of the case by the entire 11-member court.  The full
court reversed the previous ruling on November 22, 1994.  Steffan
ended his six-year court battle in January 1995 when he decided
not to take his challenge of the military's policy to the Supreme
Court.
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>A COST-SAVING ALTERNATIVE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The military has an operational court system which could be required
by Congress to hear homosexual discharge complaints.  The military
courts are better equipped to consider such cases than the federal
court system, and such a move would save the federal government
millions of dollars in federal judiciary expenses and likely provide
a more thorough and faster resolution to the growing number of
homosexual complaints.
<P>
Congress must consider passing a law awarding limited civil jurisdiction
to military courts to handle homosexual complaints.  Should there
be a concern that the military courts might try to expand the
jurisdiction, another, although less attractive, alternative is
available.  Congressional designation of the District of Columbia
Circuit Court of Appeals as the sole appeals court for all military
homosexual cases would also provide a more consistent view of
the issue.  Federal district courts would still give decisions
on initial complaints, but only the D.C. Circuit would hear the
cases on appeal.  This both saves the government money and brings
consistency to a complex and specialized issue.

<TITLE>DR. KINSEY AND THE CHILDREN OF TABLE 34</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>DR. KINSEY AND THE CHILDREN<BR>OF TABLE 34</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
In 1948, zoologist Alfred C. Kinsey shocked the world with his
study <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>.  In 1953 a companion
volume, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>, was published.
 Although many scientists were critical of Kinsey's methods, the
media popularized Kinsey's findings. But serious questions have
been raised about Kinsey's research:
<P>
<LI><B> Allegations of fraudulent data and child sexual abuse.</B>
The book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> (Reisman, Eichel, Court,
Muir; Huntington House, 1990) shows that either the Kinsey data
on child sexuality were manufactured or that children were sexually
abused in the name of science.  Table 34 in Kinsey's study contains
detailed data about molestation of young boys.  According to a
review in the British medical journal, <I>The Lancet,</I> the
authors of <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> &quot;demolish&quot; Kinsey's
credibility.
<P>
<LI><B> Allegations of improper sampling. </B> Kinsey relied heavily
on data gleaned from prison inmates, including sex offenders,
and extrapolated those findings to the general population.  Although
criminals made up less than one percent of the population, inmates
made up a sizable portion of Kinsey's male sample. 
<P>

</B> Esteemed colleagues of Kinsey such as psychologist Abraham
Maslow warned Kinsey that his survey suffered greatly from &quot;volunteer
bias.&quot;  Maslow told Kinsey that such surveys tend to be skewed
toward the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.  Kinsey ignored
the advice and terminated their collegial relationship.
<P>
Kinsey's work remains an underpinning for many ongoing federally-sponsored
programs.  His conclusions have permeated America's educational
institutions and are the major behavioral model on which sex education
programs are designed.  The Kinsey ideology has affected everything
from sex offender laws to the sexual portrayal of children in
pornographic publications.
<P>
The reliance on reports of sexual abuse of children under the
auspices of federally-supported research demands investigation.
 FRC's new video, &quot;The Children of Table 34,&quot; asks such
important questions as:   
<P>
<LI><B> How were the children procured for the experiments?</B>
<BR>
<LI><B> Where are the children now?</B>
<BR>
<LI><B> Did the parents of the children give consent to the experiments?</B>
<P>
It is essential that these and other questions be answered by
the Kinsey Institute and the surviving associates of Dr. Kinsey.

<TITLE>IMMIGRATION AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>IMMIGRATION
<BR>AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
In recent years, the debate over immigration has broadened and
intensified.  A growing segment of the population would like to
reduce or stop the flow of foreigners entering the United States,
while many others want to adhere to America's historic policy
of welcoming newcomers to our shores.
<P>
Ignored in this increasingly bitter debate is the question of
whether or not our immigration policies are friendly to the preservation
and nurture of family life.
<P>
The American family is in trouble.  Over the past three decades,
the rise of divorce, an increase in nonmarital cohabitation, soaring
rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases,
widespread drug abuse, an epidemic of juvenile crime and the alarming
proportion of out-of-wedlock births provide hard statistical evidence
that this basic social institution is under siege.
<P>
Clearly, many people interested in immigrating to the United States
have an old-world sense of familial loyalty and an unshakable
belief in the sanctity of marriage.  To such people -- and to
existing U.S. citizens -- we owe a commitment to craft immigration
law in a manner that respects and undergirds the marital institution.
<P>
To that end, we have two concerns that we would like to see the
Commission address:
<P>
1)  Current law allows adult children and siblings to apply for
permanent citizenship on the basis of family relationships.  This
essentially well-meaning policy should be reexamined and modified.
<P>
On the surface, the law here seems to work on behalf of families,
allowing adult children to be reunited with parents, and brothers
and sisters to join those siblings who have already immigrated
to this country.  In fact, it imposes hardships on family members
who are in greater need of reunion.  Here's how:
<P>
Since immigration is limited by quotas, the adult children of
U.S. citizens are often admitted to this country while the spouses
and children of green card holders are kept waiting on a distant
shore.
<P>
Because existing preferences for nuclear family relatives of U.S.
citizens are not extended to green card holders, a husband and
wife in one family might be separated for years while an adult brother in another family comes
to the U.S. under a law intended to reunite families.
<P>
To address this problem, the Family Research Council recommends
that current law be modified so that all backlogs in nuclear family
categories be cleared before adult children and siblings are granted
entry under family reunification status.  (It may even be well
to consider eliminating the preference for adult children and
siblings altogether, since backlogs in those categories are already
so large.)  Giving preference to all nuclear family relationships
would allow more spouses and minor children to enter as family
members -- and American family life would be strengthened correspondingly.
<P>
2)  Current law has been implemented inappropriately as cohabiting
couples and same-sex couples have been admitted on temporary visas
under the rubric of &quot;family.&quot;
<P>
While current law does not recognize such couples as &quot;family,&quot;
the federal government reportedly has allowed this interpretation
in cases of temporary visas.  The continuation of this practice
would mean that:
<P>
<LI> The number of cohabiting couples in the United States would
increase, albeit temporarily, as the result of official immigration
action;
<P>
<LI> The number of homosexual couples would also increase with the
official sanction of the INS;
<P>
<LI> The precedent set by such a practice might well be used in the
future to justify similar action in the case of permanent immigration.
<P>
In order to eliminate this practice -- which undermines the sanctity
of marriage and the stability of family life in America -- the
U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform should call upon the appropriate
federal agencies and congressional oversight committees to take
whatever steps necessary to ensure that non-marital couples are
not granted visas as a &quot;family.&quot;
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The current larger debate over immigration might well be tempered
if immigration policy were more deliberately crafted to encourage
the immigration of families and those most likely to support traditional
family values.
<P>
Many of the problems we face as a nation can be attributed, either
directly or indirectly, to the breakdown of family life.
<P>
To be successful, immigration policy should support family values
rather than contribute to their further erosion.  An overtly pro-family
stance on the part of the INS and other government agencies would
ease the fears of those who believe that our borders should be
closed completely to avoid the further collapse of American society.
<P>
The importance of stable marriages and families to the health
of a nation cannot be underestimated.  The late Pitirim Sorokin,
chairman of Harvard's Sociology Department and President of the
International Institute of Sociology, warned Americans nearly
40 years ago that the decline in family life must be reversed
or America would go the way of other nations that suffered cultural
breakdown.  In 1956, he wrote in <I>The American Sex Revolution</I>
(Boston: Porter Sargent Publisher): 
<P>
<UL><I>...marriage has been regarded by all societies as the culminating
point of human existence, and as the most decisive factor in the
survival and well-being of the societies themselves....the candle
of the American marriage and family is being burned at both ends
-- both as a union of husband and wife, and as a union of parents
and children.  And with their disintegration, marriage and the
family progressively fail in the performance of tasks of maintaining
the well-being of the individual and ensuring the survival of
the nation itself.</I></UL>
<P>
Immigrants like Sorokin (a refugee from the Soviet Union) have
contributed immeasurably to the moral health of the United States.
 We should make certain that, regardless of how the current debate
over influx is resolved, our nation's immigration policies are
always structured to ensure the survival and continuing strength
of America's families.

<TITLE>AT&T SUPPORTS HOMOSEXUALITY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>AT&T SUPPORTS HOMOSEXUALITY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Homosexual activists often use the power of the government and
media to try to force society to accept their behavior.  But the
homosexual lobby is also active in corporate America.
<P>
Some companies are actively promoting the homosexual agenda through
direct financial support, advertising campaigns and corporate
policies such as extending domestic partner benefits to homosexuals.
<P>
One of the companies most actively pushing the homosexual agenda
is AT&T.  AT&T's pro-homosexual activities include:
<P>
<LI><B> Support of "Homosexual Marriage."</B>  According
to <I>Diversity Digest</I>, a publication of AT&T's Information
Research Center, the Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay United Employees
at AT&T (LEAGUE) held a conference in which members were encouraged
to "help devise a legal definition of marriage, so the company
can work on extending domestic partner benefits to employees in
states that do not recognize marriages between same-gender partners"
(<I>Diversity Digest</I> August 1994, p. 10).
<P>
<LI><B> Homosexual Direct Mail Advertising.</B>  Last year AT&T
sent about 70,000 direct mail packages targeted at homosexuals.
 The package included brochures featuring smiling homosexual couples
and a flier about AT&T's homosexual employee group.  The materials
were sent in envelopes decorated with a rainbow-colored telephone
cord and the phrase, "It's time for a change..." (<I>The
Washington Blade</I> June 10, 1994, p. 23).
<P>
<LI><B> Indoctrination of Employees.</B>  AT&T has held workshops
and "diversity training" sessions in an effort to force
employees to accept homosexuality.  The company has used Brian
McNaught's video, <I>On Being Gay,</I> in these workshops.  The
video is filled with misleading claims and presents homosexuality as a normal, healthy lifestyle. 
<P>
McNaught, who has done several workshops for AT&T, shows his
bias against those who hold traditional religious values in his
book, <I>Gay Issues in the Workplace</I>.  McNaught links religious
conviction with hate and bigotry.  He suggests that people who
hold strong religious convictions need "counseling"
(p. 100).  He shows contempt for those who hold traditional family
values by suggesting that these values fuel "anti-gay bias."
<P>
The following endorsement by an AT&T official appears on the
back of McNaught's book:  "Every manager and employee who
takes our course on 'Homophobia in the Workplace' will receive
a copy of this book.  Brian McNaught has an incredible skill in helping people understand
and respond to gay issues in a nonthreatening way" (Sheila
Landers, Personnel Services Manager at AT&T Network Systems).
<P>
AT&T has also urged employees to observe Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week and to place posters and pink triangles on walls to show
that the office is "gay friendly." 
<P>
<LI><B> Support of "The Gay Games."</B>  According to <I>Businessweek</I>
magazine, AT&T helped sponsor a series of sporting events
featuring 11,000 athletes and a budget of $6.5 million.  <I>Businessweek</I>
described the "Gay Games" as "less a series of
sporting events than a nine-day celebration of culture, complete
with parades, plays, music, art shows and food feasts" (<I>Businessweek</I>
July 4, 1994 p. 38).  
<P>
<LI><B> Donations to the Gay Men's Health Crisis.</B>  According
to Brenda Leake of AT&T, the company gave $25,000 to the Gay
Men's Health Crisis in 1992.  Among other things, GMHC distributes
graphic, sexually explicit material to young people in an attempt
to "educate" them about the dangers of AIDS.  The brochures
encourage young people to engage in dangerous and perverse sexual
practices.   
<P>
 <CENTER><B>CONCLUSION</B></CENTER>
<P>
Proponents of pro-homosexual policies cite the need to be "tolerant"
of other people.  But the question is not one of civil rights
or ending "bigotry."  Homosexuals have the same rights
as any other Americans, but are seeking special privileges. 
<P>
Christians and other believers in traditional morality are coming
under enormous pressure in AT&T and other corporations to
ignore their most deeply held beliefs.  "Diversity"
sessions that attack or distort scripture and church teachings
constitute religious harassment.
<P>
The real issue is whether or not people will be forced to accept
homosexual behavior, something that no successful culture has
ever done.  Homosexual behavior is not normal or healthy.  Opposition
to the homosexual agenda is not bigotry; it is common sense.
<P>
If you are concerned about AT&T's promotion of the homosexual
agenda, contact them to express your concern.  Tell AT&T that
it is irresponsible to promote an immoral and unhealthy lifestyle.
 AT&T should incorporate policies that strengthen the family,
not undermine it.

<title>FAMILY TIME: WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A poll conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for the Families
and Work Institute and the Whirlpool Foundation indicates that
56 percent of all women want more flexibility in their job structures
and work hours without losing their benefits. Similarly, about
one-third of women would work part-time if they could afford to
do so.[1]

<p>

<li>According to this same poll, more than one-fourth of all women
cited the lack of family time as their greatest concern, surpassing
even concerns about neighborhood crime and safety.[2]

<p>

<li>A 1994 University of Connecticut-Storrs study of young mothers
found widespread &quot;ambivalence about returning to work&quot;
and a widespread concern about &quot;loss of time and experience
with their infants.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>A 1995 poll entitled &quot;Women: The New Providers&quot;
found that 88 percent of women say they are pressed for time and
that their greatest concern is not having enough time together
as a family.[4]

<p>

<li>This same poll found that if money were not a consideration,
33 percent would like to work part time, 31 percent would choose
to work at home caring for the family, 20 percent would select
volunteer work while only 15 percent would choose to work full
time.[5]

<p>

<li>Forty-four percent of women would prefer more family time
over higher pay in their jobs, according to the <I>Los Angeles
Times</I>.[6]

<p>

<li>A 1992 <I>ABC News</I> poll found that while 59 percent of
adult women nationally believe that &quot;the changes in American
life caused by more women working outside the home have been worth
making,&quot; but 58 percent sometimes long for the days in which
women didn't work outside the home.[7]

<p>

<li>Women who work are &quot;spending less time being married
and having children,&quot; according to researcher John Robinson,
in order to cope with the time constraints created by employment.[8]

<p>

<li>In 1994, 41.6 percent of all women were not in the labor force.
Thirty-nine percent of all women were employed full-time.[9]

<h4>Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt H-204, U.S. Capitol</h4><p>
<blockquote><i>Remarks by House Democratic Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt "A Democratic plan For America's Economy: Toward 
A Fairer, Simpler, Tax Code." Center for National Policy, Washington, D.C.</i></blockquote><p>

I thank the Center for National Policy for having me here today, and for providing this important forum on issues that matter to America's working families.<p>
I'm here today to talk about our federal income tax. To talk about the steps we must take to fundamentally overhaul a tax system that has become so riddled with loopholes, so tailored to the lobbyists and special interests, that it works against America's hard-working families, when it should be working for them.<p>
That's why I am presenting a tax plan that closes all the loopholes and makes everybody pay their fair share; that permanently ends the influence of the lobbyists and special interests; that dramatically lowers everybody's tax rates, so that 75 percent of all Americans will pay just ten 
percent of their income in taxes; and that requires a national referendum to raise tax rates.<p>
But I'm really here to talk about much, much more than a policy proposal.<p>
I'm here to continue a debate that has been raging in the 104th Congress with every vote, and every policy proposal, and every public pronouncement by members of both parties:<p>
Do we fight to protect, preserve, and defend America's working families and the middle class -- or do we return to the trickle-down travesty that shattered our standard of living, widened the gap between working people and the wealthy, and would sacrifice our children and our elderly 
on the altar of needless tax breaks for the privileged few?<p>
In the boom years of the 80's, two-thirds of all new wealth went to the top one percent of America's households. The bottom eighty percent saw their wealth decline. That is the legacy of Republican government Does that bad turn really deserve another?<p>
Several months ago, in a speech to the Economic Policy Institute, I argued that the Republican Party is now attempting to repeal the Progressive Era and the New Deal by stealth.<p>
That the Republican Party is attempting to force us into a global economic steeplechase with no rules, no order, and no standards -- until most Americans are working longer days and earning third-world wages. <p>
I argued that their opposition to a minimum wage increase -- their insistence on a tax cut tailored to top earners -- their crusade to kill meaningful health care reform last year -- are all part of an agenda that rewards the privileged few, and leaves everybody else out in the cold.<p>
I argued that unless we change the way we do business, both at home and abroad -unless we fight for globalization with rules -- globalization that expands our standards throughout the world, rather than dragging them down --And unless we insist that America's businesses value their people as 
much as their profit then we will be stuck in a devastating downward spiral.<p>
Today, I advance the second chapter of a blueprint for the American economy of the future -- in this case, a proposal for a broad-reaching tax reform that is more than the package of perks for the privileged which the Republicans have offered.<p>
The fact is, while we work to lift wages and incomes at home and abroad -- while we defend our middle class from the ravages of third- and fourth-world competition --We must give Americans the power to run their own economic lives. We must take the decisions and disincentives out of the committee rooms of the Capitol, and put that power back into the living rooms of America. The way to do that is to close the loopholes, lower tax rates, and let families spend their money in ways that are right for them.<p>
I believe that the tax reform plan I am presenting today is right on the merits -- regardless of its context. But that context -- a broader Democratic vision of America's economy and society -- a fierce defense of working families and the middle class -- an economy that upholds family wages, and does not tax them into oblivion -- is vitally important for my party and my country.<p>
At its heart, the debate we are now in asks whether Democrats will fight for our defining values, or whether we will simply surrender to resurgent Republicans, or perhaps only seek to amend and ameliorate the worst of their ideas.<p>
In my judgement, the only way for the Democratic Party to thrive in the 1990's -- or maybe even to survive -- is to advance bold, new ideas -- but ones that are consistent with the oldest, truest Democratic value we know -- to serve and strengthen working families and the middle class.<p>
The way for the Democratic Party to thrive in the 1990's is to resist the temptation to split what are really irreconcilable differences.<p>
You see, Democrats cannot win -- and will not deserve to win -- if we all we have to offer is rusted and recycled Republicanism.<p>
We cannot prevail in a mindless competition to cut deeper, to bash government harder, to balance the budget faster.<p>
Of course, balancing the budget is important. Shrinking the size of government is important. But while we repair the damage of the last generation, we must also build a stronger nation for the next generation.<p>
The Republican vision of America's future is one of lower wages and less job security; of more time on the job and less time with your family; of tax breaks for the few and Medicare cuts for the many.<p>
In Republican America -- where lobbyists write the laws, and government handouts go to the powerful special interests -- no tax break is too brazen, no shelter too shameless, for their privileged patrons.<p>
Democrats must challenge this vision head-on. And this is about more than politics. Throughout this century, the Democratic Party has been the party of working families and the middle class -- the party of jobs and opportunity -- the party of rising wages and strong families.<p>
We speak for those who have no idle investments. We speak for those who have no lobbyists to skew the system to their service.<p>
If Democrats surrender those people and those values, we lose more than the next election. We lose our soul as a party.<p>
I am here to offer a Democratic way to radically reform America's tax system. To say that while we reclaim the global and national economies from the trickle-down terrorists, we must make the tax code work for working families, not special interests and lobbyists.<p>
And I will be continuing this dialogue with other speeches in the coming months ~ talking about ways to lift America's falling wages and incomes; talking about ways to reform our political system, and make campaigns shorter and cheaper; and talking about a new Democratic path to health 
care reform. Just because health care became a problem for the politicians last year doesn't mean it stopped being a problem for hard-working families. Democrats have fought for this issue for a generation, and there is no reason to stop now.<p>
In my view, Democrats must not fight this crucial tax debate on Republican ground. We must not embrace Bill Archer's archly regressive consumption tax. We must not surrender to Dick Armey's flat tax, which fields an army of perks for the privileged. And we must not mount a timid defense of a status quo that is riddled with loopholes, and simply doesn't work for working families.
We can have a tax system that is both simple and fair. We can abandon the maddening complexity, the mind-numbing bureaucracy of today's tax system -- without favoring the loophole -- jumpers over the factory workers.<p>
It doesn't take a tax expert to see the injustice of today's system. You only have to go door to door in my town of St. Louis -- to talk to the hard-working, middle class families who are struggling just to make ends meet, to feel their anger and resentment at a system that favors the experts and insiders over average families.<p>
They know, almost intuitively, that if a privileged few are getting huge tax breaks, and the poorest Americans are paying no taxes, then the middle class gets squeezed to make up the difference.<p>
Decades of toying and tinkering at the margins have only made the problem worse. And I've concluded that the only way to fix anything is to replace everything -- to overhaul the entire system, from top to bottom.<p>
Under my plan, three-fourths of all Americans pay ten percent of their income. The rest pay one of four progressive rates -- to be specific, 20 percent, 26 percent, 32 percent, and 34 percent. The mortgage deduction is maintained, but virtually all other exemptions are eliminated.<p>
Mine is the only tax reform plan that is designed entirely for working families and the middle class. No lobbyist -- no special interest -- no corporate contributor will reap special benefits from its passage.<p>
The gimmicks and giveaways that have cluttered our tax code will be eliminated, once and for all. That means that fringe benefits will be taxable -- but because the basic tax rates will be lowered for every single American, and because the standard deduction will be bigger, most 
American's will pay less, not more, in taxes.<p>
Tax forms will be so simple that they can be printed on a small postcard. For most Americans, thanks to an improved system of withholding, they won't have to file returns at all.<p>
So if you're one of the few who use high-powered attorneys to maneuver the maze of our tax system, then you're not going to like my plan.<p>
But if you want a tax plan that lets most Americans to pay a flat ten percent of their income, without filing a return -If you want a tax plan that insists that everyone pay their fair share -
Then the 10% Tax makes sense for you. And l urge you to call a special number -- (202) 226-3881 -- to get more information about the plan, including a computer disk to help you figure out just how much you'll save on your taxes, and how simple it will be.<p>
My plan takes us back to the first principles of the federal income tax -- principles that have been distorted and defeated with every lobbyists' loophole, with every layer of legalese that has crowded our tax code.<p>
Back in 1913, when the states ratified the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, allowing a federal income tax, the basic purpose was simple:<p>
To collect tax dollars fairly, simply, and broadly, to pay for crucial public purposes.<p>
Today, it has become a test of legal brainpower, an accountants' decathlon, a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and buried tax breaks.<p>
Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives.<p>
The Internal Revenue Service has become a symbol of what is wrong with American government. Mind you, I have no interest in bashing government. My aim is to improve it.<p>
My 10% Tax will enable us to cut the IRS, to make it smaller and less expensive. For the vast majority of Americans, who will not have to file any returns, the IRS will be reduced to little more than a mailing address. I also intend to create a citizens' panel, to make sure that tax forms are 
simple and understandable for those who do have to file them.<p>
My plan begins by ending virtually every exemption, loophole, and tax shelter. With the billions of dollars we save, we will slash tax rates across the board for all Americans. With no special gimmicks and giveaways, the lobbyists who have rigged our tax code for decades will permanently 
lose their seats at the table.<p>
As I have said, there is one single deduction that this plan protects -- the deduction of interest on home mortgages. That's because home ownership is such a basic goal for working and middle class families -- it is such an essential part of the American dream -- that we must do everything we 
can to support and encourage it.<p>
Under my plan, a family of four would pay the ten percent rate up to about 60,000 dollars in income. An individual would pay the ten percent rate up to 32,000 dollars.<p>
For the remaining twenty-five percent, there will be four additional tax rates -- all be lower than under today's tax code.<p>
I am including in my plan a provision that Congress may not raise tax rates without a national referendum -- because I want to end the temptation to start raising tax rates by doling out loopholes. That decision should belong to the American people, not to a Congressional committee. 
If this plan becomes law, the American people can stop reading politicians' lips -and start running their own lives.<p>
Unlike some Republican proposals, the 10% Tax treats so-called "unearned income" -money from stock speculation, capital gains, and idle investment -- the same as income that has been earned the old-fashioned way.<p>
I don't think it makes sense to let supply-side speculators pay no taxes at all -- which is exactly what would happen under the leading Republican plans. Do they believe that money earned through idle investment is somehow better than money earned through sweat, toil, and tears? Whether it is manual labor, or the most sophisticated high-tech services, I believe we must value and encourage productive work, not just passive profit.<p>
The 10% Tax will dramatically scale back the 300-billion-dollar industry of tax advisers and preparers, and the 4.5 billion hours Americans spend each year to prepare their taxes.<p>
The income tax shouldn't be a full employment program for accountants and economists. Under my plan, the only jobs created will come from individual investment and initiative -- from people keeping and using more of their own money -- from families freed from today's tax bureaucracy.<p>
Unlike some Republican proposals, the 10% Tax will not increase the deficit. It will raise as much revenue as today's tax system -- but it will raise it more fairly, since everyone will play by the same rules, whether they hail from Main Street or Easy Street.<p>
We will slash corporate welfare by fifty billion dollars, and use that money to cut taxes for small businesses. It's time to take those tax breaks from the corporations that don't need them, and give them to the small businesses that are the real engines of growth in this country.<p>
Some argue that, instead of my simplified 10% Tax, we should merely end the income tax altogether, and switch to a consumption tax -- a national sales tax on all money that is spent. The argument is that this will increase savings, since money that is saved would not be taxed.<p>
This kind of consumption tax is wrong for several more basic reasons. First, it is plainly and profoundly regressive. Families that earn less will pay a much higher proportion of their income in taxes, because they spend much more of what they earn just to survive.<p>
Second, it would require a massive and sudden increase in the sales tax to raise the necessary revenue. Who can even guess the devastating effects on consumers and retailers when sales taxes are doubled or tripled overnight? Whole industries -- productive industries, ones that make 
more than paperwork -- could be thrown into turmoil. We simply can't take that risk.<p>
Third, at a time when the Labor Department has reported the greatest yearly decline in wages since the 1 840's -- when the invention of the electric loom threw millions of weavers out of work -- trying to 
encourage savings through the tax code is simply beside the point. Whenyou're working two or three jobs just to keep a roof over your head and put food on the table, you can't save money no matter what the tax code says.<p>
People won't save more until they have more. That is why we must turn our attention to falling family incomes, and stop trying to control people's behavior from the committee rooms of the Capitol.<p>
Finally, my 10% Tax is unapologetically progressive.<p>
Since Abraham Lincoln adopted the very first income tax during the Civil War, our tax system has followed this simple progressive principle: those who enjoy more of society's benefits should shoulder a little more of its burdens.<p>
This principle is the cornerstone not just of our tax system, but of a decent, civil society.<p>
Those who have prospered and profited from life's lottery have a moral obligation to share their good fortune. It's a principle as old as the Bible itself.<p>
Let's be very clear what we're talking about today. I know that discussions of our tax code can easily devolve into policy trivia and government jargon.<p>
But my proposal is about something more basic -- more fundamental.<p>
It's about the line worker, the farm hand, the office clerk -- people who can't afford a blue-chip lawyer, and just want a system that isn't stacked against them.<p>
It's about a new age of global competition, when we simply can't sustain a tax code that twists and tortures every economic decision, so that people do what's right for their taxes, instead of what's right for their families and our economy.<p>
And it is about a Democratic vision of a high and rising standard of living -- of fairness and freedom, both in our tax system and in our global economy.<p>
We can't reach our full potential if we have a tax system that works for the few, and punishes the many. We can't build up the middle class by taxing it out of existence. And Democrats cannot endorse a Republican agenda that lavishes more on those who have the most, but destroys the very tax base and consumer base on which they depend.<p>
I would like to believe that both Republicans and Democrats can rally behind this plan -- just as Theodore Roosevelt and William Aft joined hands with populists and progressives to support the original income tax at the turn of this century.<p>
But if that bipartisan support does not come, Democrats must not be afraid to fight for what we believe.<p>
For I believe the 10% Tax is a model for the kind of Arnerica Democrats must champion in the 1 990's -An America that can shatter the ice of its own indifference. An America that is unafraid to rethink its most basic assumptions -But an America that does not bargain away the Democratic values that have built this country, by reducing our two-party system to a one-party budget-cutting machine.<p>
The fact is, the hard-working, middle class families of this nation deserve that kind of America.<p>
That is why Democrats must fight for higher wages, for fairer taxes, for political reform, for better health care, and for the fundamental fairness that is the foundation of our Republic.<p>
The American people need this plan. I believe it can bring us closer to an economy that truly works for working people. An economy as strong and open and optimistic as the one we had when I was growing up in the 50's and 60's.<p>
May that be the mission of the Democratic Party in the 1 990's -- and through our hopes and our hard work, may that be the legacy we leave for our children, and our children's children.<p>

10% TAX<p>
The 10% Tax would radically reform today's income tax system to enable the vast majority (75%) of all taxpayers to pay their federal income taxes at no more than a 10% rate.<p>
The proposal eliminates virtually every deduction, credit, exclusion and adjustment, to lower tax rates for everyone. The only deduction allowed is for mortgage interest.<p>
A majority of taxpayers would not have to file an income tax return with the federal government. Tax forms would be printed on a small postcard.<p>
To achieve reduction in tax rates, the current tax base would be dramatically broadened. The proposal would retain the current progressivity of the tax code and would not increase the deficit. A family of four, for example, would pay taxes at a 10% rate up to $59,550 and would have $19,350 of their income exempt from federal income taxes altogether.<p>
These changes would make the tax system fairer and simpler and would help to reduce the more than $300 billion and 4.5 billion hours per year that is spent on tax filing and preparation. Average taxpayers will know that everyone else is paying their fair share: high-priced lawyers and accountants won't help the privileged reduce their tax bill.<p>
Unlike a consumption tax, the 10% Tax treats all income the same. Whether a taxpayer earns money from hard work or from investment, the tax treatment will be the same.<p>
75% of all taxpayers pay taxes at no more than a 10% rate and tax rates are lower for all Americans<p>
The 10% Tax closes all loopholes<p>
A majority of taxpayers do not have to file a tax form<p>
A family of four pays no more than 10% up to roughly $60,000 in income<p>
A single individual pays no more than 10% up to roughly $32,000 in income<p>
The deduction for mortgage interest is retained<p>
Tax rates could only change in the future by national referendum<p>
The 10% Tax taxes all income -- earned and unearned -- the same<p>
The 10% Tax does not increase the deficit<p>
The 10% Tax is as progressive as today's tax system<p>
The 10% Tax takes away the lobbyist's seat at the table<p>
The 10% Tax drastically reduces the more than $300 billion and 4.5 billion hours spent on preparing and filing tax returns<p>
The 10% Tax cuts corporate welfare by more than $50 billion and uses that money to cut taxes for small businesses<p>
The 10% Tax ends the distorting effect of the tax code on economic decisions<p>
The 10% Tax promotes more productive investment and jobs<p>
The 10% Tax helps us compete and win in world markets<p>
The 10% Tax allows dramatic cuts in the Internal Revenue Service<p>

<h3>Congress and the Coming Budget Standoff: Let The President Blink First <br>
By Paul Beckner and James Gattuso </h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
"Jim. Jim. just settle down. Let's close the place down and see if anybody  
notices." <p>
 
-- President Ronald Reagan to Budget Director Jim Miller <p>
 
In the battle over the federal budget, the stakes are high. The 
congressional majority has made a balanced budget by 2002 the 
centerpiece of its program to rein in the size and scope of the federal  
government. The president has countered with a plan that puts a balanced  
budget further into the future, and -- according to the Congressional  
Budget Office -- will likely still produce deficits indefinitely. It looks like  
the two sides are on a collision course: that Congress will pass draconian  
bills and the president will veto them, causing what many in Washington  
are calling a "train wreck" -- the shutdown of the government. That  
makes good copy, but a collision won't cause the catastrophe that the  
term "train wreck" implies. <p>
 
The battle is now at its midpoint. Phase one ended in June when Congress  
overwhelmingly approved an historic seven-year budget resolution  
mapping the way to a balanced budget by 2002. Phase two -- 
consideration of specific appropriations and authorization legislation -- is  
being fought out in Congress right now, bill by bill. The House of  
Representatives has already passed most of its appropriations measures,  
with mixed results in terms of budget cutting. The Senate is just  
beginning to turn its attention to the subject. <p>
 
While Congress grinds its way through the process, strategists on both  
sides of the budget battle are already turning their thoughts to the  
climactic stage of the conflict -- one that has come to be known in  
Washington as the "Endgame" -- the final push toward adoption or failure  
of legislation which will lead to a balanced budget. This is the stage that  
will determine who wins and who loses, based in large part upon the  
determination, patience and ingenuity of the players. It is also a stage in  
which Congress has substantial advantages -- making the budget battle  
Congress's to lose. <p>
 
<center><h3> War on Two Fronts </center></h3><p>
 
The war over the federal budget is actually being fought on two fronts.  
Each will likely be played out separately during the Endgame. The first is  
the appropriations process. Congress now has 13 appropriations bills  
before it. They cover fiscal 1996 expenditures for everything from the  
legislative branch itself to the Interior Department. The key date here is  
October 1. If an appropriations bill for any agency is not approved by  
Congress and signed by the president by that date, that agency must shut  
down non-essential operations. (More on that later.) <p>
 
The second front involves a reconciliation bill making permanent  
changes in spending programs. The key date is less clear than it is for  
appropriations. In fact, there's nothing that automatically forces action on  
reconciliation. <p>
 
Nevertheless, Congress does have a weapon on hand that it can use to  
force action: the statutory debt ceiling. If Congress does not act to raise  
the legal limit on federal debt (from its current $4.9 trillion!), the  
government would be barred from borrowing more money. This would  
force it to spend no more than it receives in revenue. Tying reconciliation  
to a debt ceiling increase is probably the only way Congress could get a  
presidential signature on a reconciliation bill. <p>
 
Strange as it may seem, no one knows for certain when the current debt  
ceiling will be reached. It depends upon how fast the government spends  
its money and the ingenuity of the Treasury Department in coming up  
with cash from reserves, from under mattresses and the like. Most  
observers, however, expect the crucial date to be reached sometime in  
late October or November. This will be after the start of the new fiscal  
year, but well within Congress's expected legislative calendar. <p>
 
It is these two likely deadlines that will make the Endgame interesting. In  
Washington budget circles, there is increasing talk of a train wreck which  
will occur if neither side blinks. And, as in a game of chicken, the side  
that is more willing to accept a train wreck (or appears to do so) will win. <p>
 
 
<center><h3>The "Train Wreck" </h3></center><p>
 
But just how bad would the train wreck be? What would really happen if  
the government were forced to close down? Some have portrayed the  
potential effects as catastrophic: mail not being delivered, planes crashing  
due to a lack of air traffic controllers, criminals being set free, and so on.  
In reality, however, the effects of a government closedown would be far  
from catastrophic. <p>
 
Let's first look at what happens if appropriations bills are not passed. The  
basic rules here were first laid out in 1980 by President Carter's Attorney  
General, Benjamin Civiletti. Entitlements, ranging from social security  
payments to farm subsidies, could continue to be paid. By definition,  
such programs do not depend upon annual appropriations for their  
funding. In addition, the president holds certain powers that no lack of  
appropriations can take away. For example, according to Civiletti, the  
president could grant pardons regardless of the status of appropriations. <p>
 
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the law that governs how  
appropriations are spent -- the rather optimistically titled "Anti-deficiency  
Act" -- specifically allows essential expenditures in cases of imminent  
emergency, to protect lives or property. <p>
 
Because of these various exceptions and exclusions, "closure" of the  
government during past budget crises have involved less than meets the  
eye. Take, for instance, the most recent closure. In 1990, the government  
"closed" for three days over the Columbus Day weekend. There was great  
consternation and an air of emergency, with nightly newsclips of  
disappointed tourists standing in front of a closed Washington  
Monument. <p>
 
But beyond tourism, the effect was limited. According to a later GAO  
report on the incident, few employees were actually sent home, and most  
of these were with the Interior Department (2,826 of the 2,984 sent home  
by the agencies the GAO surveyed). The Defense Department continued  
to operate, the mail was delivered, air traffic control continued to  
function. Even if the "shut-down" had occurred in midweek, the effect  
would not have been cataclysmic. Out of some three million civilian  
federal employees, less than half a million would have been out of action. <p>
 
Even more telling is what agencies said when the GAO asked what the  
adverse effects of a weekday shutdown would be. "Reduced morale" was  
the number one answer, recited by almost all the agencies. The  
Department of Health and Human Services voiced concern about  
"significant anxiety among employees." The IRS was concerned about a  
"loss of public confidence in the agency"! <p>
 
What about a shutdown due to the debt ceiling? Here the rules are  
different: there is no lack of appropriated money, the government just  
can't borrow any more. Without the power to borrow money, the  
government is -- cold turkey -- put on a balanced budget. It can only  
spend what comes in, and no more. While the president's ability to  
unilaterally reduce spending is limited, he presumably could delay many  
discretionary expenditures until the crisis was resolved. The result would  
be a huge cutback on discretionary spending, but spending on  
entitlements and emergency services likely could continue for some time. <p>
 
<center><h3>Who Has the Edge in the Endgame? </h3></center><p>
 
Putting this all together, who will have the advantage in the Endgame?  
Past experience (the government has been shut down four times in the  
last 15 years) isn't of much help. On each occasion, there was a  
tremendous hue and cry from the media, but no clear verdict from the  
public. <p>
 
After the 1990 Columbus Day closure, the Washington Post and ABC  
News commissioned a poll on whom the public blamed. Fifty-seven  
percent blamed the Congress, while only 14 percent fingered President  
Bush. But remember, in 1990, it was the president who was trying to cut  
costs and Congress that was protecting expenditures. <p>
 
Who will the public support this year? At this point it is not certain.  
However, there are several reasons to believe that Congress moves  
toward the Endgame with the upper hand: <p>
 
* Congress has a clear agenda. If anything is clear in American politics 
today, it is that the congressional leadership has more or less set the 
political agenda since last November. It has clearly defined goals, and  
a plan for achieving those goals. President Clinton has rarely broken out  
of a defensive stance during that time. Here is one thing the public will  
respect during any showdown: it's Congress that's trying to do something  
about today's problems, while the president is defending the status quo. It  
will be easy for the Congress to explain what it is doing and why. The  
White House, by contrast, will have some difficulty explaining its  
defense of the old ways. <p>
 
* White House interests are more at risk. Frankly speaking, the Congress 
will have more hostages during a budget showdown. Put another way, if 
there is a train wreck, most of the passengers will be Democrats. The 
reasoning is simple: the basic commodity at risk during any federal shut 
down is federal spending. And, while the Republicans in Congress have 
pet projects of their own they want to protect, the White House has more. 
This is a basic fact that's not going to change. When the government's not 
spending money, the White House will bleed more seriously than the 
budget-cutters in Congress. <p>
 
This basic equation could only be upset if the consequences of a  
temporary shutdown were so cataclysmic as to be unacceptable to  
supporters of either side. But, as discussed above, it seems clear that  
essential services would continue -- especially if the shutdown were due  
to an appropriations stalemate. As a result, the Congress could credibly --  
and responsibly -- take Reagan's advice: let the place close down and see  
if anyone notices. <p>
 
* Congress controls the terms of debate. Under the Constitution, any  
proposed resolution of a budget standoff must originate in Congress.  
While either side may make informal proposals, only Congress can  
originate actual legislation. Thus, at crucial stages, it is Congress, not the  
president, that can better define the debate and frame the choices to be  
made. This can give Congress an important edge. <p>
 
* Congress has a one-house veto. Another advantage Congress has is  
that both the House and Senate must agree to any compromise. No  
concession can go forward as long as either house refuses to give 
consent. Thus, unlike a chain, Congress's negotiating position will be as  
strong as its strongest link. <p>
 
<center><h3>Some Do's and Don'ts </center></h3><p>
 
While important, these advantages are no guarantee of victory for the  
congressional leadership. Their hand may be strong, but winning will  
depend upon how well they play it. Here are some things they should and  
shouldn't do: <p>
 
-- Do tie the reconciliation bill firmly and irrevocably to any increase in  
the debt ceiling. Without such a linkage, Congress loses virtually all  
negotiating power. Over 150 members have already signed a joint letter  
pledging that they would not vote for any stand-alone debt ceiling  
extension. More should be urged to take the pledge. <p>
 
-- Do discuss in detail -- and often -- just what will and won't happen if 
the government shuts down. The president's major weapon will be fear of 
the unknown. A shutdown must be seen and understood by the public as 
a responsible alternative to business-as-usual. Congress must begin this  
process without delay, rather than do it defensively in response to a  
presidential campaign of fear-mongering. <p>
 
-- Do immediately allay fears of damage to trust funds -- especially the  
social security trust fund. Many trust funds rely solely upon purchase of  
federal debt for their interest income. If there is a suspension of federal  
borrowing authority, Congress must make it clear to the public that trust  
funds will be compensated for any loss of interest income. <p>
 
-- Don't assume a stalemate can -- or should -- be resolved in a few days,  
as in the past. Congress must be prepared to settle in for a long siege, 
perhaps involving a shutdown of several weeks. An added bonus for  
Congress: 1995 is not an election year, so there will be no irresistible rush  
to adjourn. <p>
 
-- Don't let pork barrel projects continue to flood the appropriations bills.  
The last thing that Congress needs is to let President Clinton posture as an  
anti-pork warrior. <p>
 
-- Don't underestimate the American public. Despite what will be said 
and written in Washington, the public will in the end support efforts to 
cut spending and reduce the deficit. And if the members of this Congress 
fail to achieve those ends, the public may not give them a second chance. <p>
 
<center><h3>Conclusion </center></h3><p>
 
The budget Endgame may be the most important test which the 104th  
Congress will face. Congress has promised the American people a  
revolution. The question now is whether it can deliver upon that promise.  
If it can, Congress will have paved the way for the most fundamental  
changes in Washington in half a century. But, if it steps up to the edge,  
and then blinks, the public will assume that Washington is still up to  
business-as-usual. The opportunity for real change will have been lost --  
perhaps for another generation. <p>

<P>
In the United States, as in Britain, the passage of some three decades is required for a body of convictions to be expressed, discussed, and at last incorporated into public policy. Ordinarily this slowness in the movement of public opinion is to the nation's advantage-by contrast with the mercurial politics of France, say. It is the devil who always hurries. However that may be, in America nowadays, it appears, such a fruition of ideas is about to take form.
<p>
I mean that we are entering upon a period of conservative policies in this American Republic. In both the great political parties, I suggest, conservative views will tend to dominate. Men and women who profess conservative convictions will be elected to office. And what matters more, the conservative political imagination will set to work to allay our present discontents and to renew our order.
<p>
For a thoughtful, renewed conservatism began to appear in print at the end of the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s, with the publishing of books and periodical writings by men of a conservative bent. Ideas do have consequences, as Richard Weaver wrote about that time; and now, a generation later, those conservative concepts, popularized, are about to enter into practical politics.
<p>
It does not signify that most "activist" conservatives may have read only scantly, if at all, in the serious conservative books of thirty years ago; that is to be expected; serious thought always is vulgarized and filtered and transmuted, through newspaper editorials and Sunday sermons and college lectures and paperback books and even television programs, until a crowd of people perhaps wholly unaware of the sources of their convictions come to embrace a particular view of religion or of morals or of politics. As Henry Adams remarks in his <i>Education,</i> during his editorship <i>The North American Review</i> had only a few hundred subscribers; but he found his journal's views plagiarized, happily, in hundreds of newspapers. Thus the average American citizen will have no notion that his vote, in 1980, has been moved in part by certain books three decades old which he has never opened; nevertheless it will be so.
<p>
Similarly, it does not signify that some of the writers who have moved minds in conservative direction do not call themselves "conservatives." (This is particularly true of Europeans residing in the United States-the historians Eric Voegelin and John Lukacs, or the economist F.A. Hayek.) We are concerned not with ideological tags, but with practical influence upon informed opinion.
<p>
I am suggesting that the present conservative movement in America commenced as an intellectual development-in this like the Fabian movement in Britain, which also required some thirty years for its fruition in public policy. But quite unlike the tightly concerted Fabian Society, the American intellectual renewal of conservative ideas about 1950 was perfectly unorganized and undirected, the work of isolated individual scholars and men of letters only slightly acquainted with one another's work, let alone enjoying personal acquaintance. Take the names of men whose books obtained some attention, perhaps as novelties, shortly before or after 1950: Richard Weaver, Daniel Boorstin, Peter Viereck, Francis Wilson, William Buckley. When I published my book <i>The Conservative Mind</i> in 1953, I never had met any of these gentlemen except Weaver; nor had they met one another, with but few exceptions, I believe; besides, no two of them agreed perfectly about everything-not even about the word "conservative." Nevertheless, the gentry whom Sidney Hook calls "ritualistic liberals" took this recrudescence of conservative opinions for a wicked conspiracy. A rumor went round among professors of history, for instance, about 1954, that Daniel Boorstin, Peter Viereck, and Russell Kirk were plotting industriously to dominate the teaching of history in this land. Actually, no one of us three ever had set eyes upon the other and, hence, could have planned no conspiracy.
<p>
Until this renewal of conservative thought at the end of the 1940s, liberal dogmas in morals and politics had been everywhere triumphant in the United States since the 1920s-as Lionel Trilling still declared, with some misgiving, at the end of 1949. Irving Babbitt and Paul Elmer More had been dead for years; Donald Davidson and Allen Tate were read as poets and literary critics only. In practical politics, the leading men of both parties then employed merely the vocabulary of latter-day liberalism. Yet as if Trilling's remark had conjured spirits from the vasty deep, no sooner was his <i>Liberal Imagination</i> published than the literary adversaries of Liberal dogmata rose up in numbers.
<p>

<b>The New Conservatives</b><p>
In the book-review media and weeklies of opinion, at the beginning of the Fifties, it was the fad to refer to these writers as "New Conservatives" or "Neo-Conservatives"-the prefix "neo" usually implying the contempt of the commentator. Recently, at the end of the Seventies, the epithet "Neo-Conservative" has been clapped to yet another set of writers and scholars. Or are these new neo-conservatives really another set? Some of them, certainly, are recruits or converts to a conservative view of American society. But a chief among them, Irving Kristol, in London as editor of Encounter at the beginning of the Fifties, actually has not changed his views in any very important respect during the intervening three decades: he was quite as prudentially conservative then as he is now, and wrote as candidly and convincingly. Or Robert Nisbet, often mentioned in conjunction with these latter-day New Conservatives, was one of the more conspicuous of us original New Conservatives, with the publication of his principal book, <i>The Quest for Community,</i> in 1953.
<p>
But I digress. This fell recrudescence of conservative thought at the end of the Forties and the beginning of the Fifties was paralleled chronologically by the decline and fall of the New Deal Democrats, and the abrupt ascent of Dwight Eisenhower to the grandest seat among the seats of the mighty. But there was next to no connection between these two political phenomena, except that they both may have been provoked in part by a general American boredom with the cliches of the New Deal and by the obvious feebleness of what remained of New Deal measures during the Truman administration.
<p>
Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. endeavored to taunt the "New Conservatives" for their failure to be appointed to office by President Eisenhower; for Mr. Schlesinger himself yearns always after "place," as eighteenth-century politicians called it. But the writing conservatives of the Fifties were not disconcerted by not having been appointed Eisenhower placemen. Some of the "New Conservatives" were Democrats; and of the Republicans among them, most had preferred Robert Taft to Dwight Eisenhower. So far as we conservative writers had anything in common, it was this: we were social critics, innocent of any design for
assuming personal power. For one thing, we set our faces against political centralization, so that a cushy appointment in Washington would have been a repudiating of our own convictions.
<p>
We were sufficiently ignored by both Republican and Democratic presidents, except that Richard Nixon did occasionally invite one or another of us to the White House for general conversation. Now and again a United States senator or a member of the House-rare birds-might send one of us a note of appreciation. We fared no better among state politicians. We had no central apparatus; few publishers approved our books; the great foundations rarely assisted us; in the Academy we were a forlorn remnant.
<p>
Still, we were not ignored by the movers and shakers of public opinion. I owe my job to the <i>New York Times:</i> that is, to Gordon Chalmers' cordial review of <i>The Conservative Mind</i> in the pages of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> (a publication then less doctrinaire and more interesting than it is today). Time followed by devoting its entire book-review section, on July 4, to <i>The Conservative Mind;</i> and the other influential journals of large circulation fell into line. Once my book had made a breach in the ramparts that liberals watched, other authors fought their way in: Robert Nisbet, Thomas Molnar, James Kilpatrick, Frederick Wilhelmsen, Robert Fitch; somewhat later, Ernest van den Haag and Jeffrey Hart; a score of others. We were allied, too, with older men, some of whom had been very different in their politics at an earlier time- writers like James Burnham, William Henry Chamberlin, John Davenport, and John Chamberlain; professors like Leo Strauss, Will Herberg, Ross Hoffman, and Eliseo Vivas. Milton Friedman and a few other American economists of a cast more or less conservative had weight early in the Fifties. We made ourselves heard. The breach in the liberals' literary ramparts has been closed since then, but the liberal reviewers have not yet succeeded altogether in stamping out the forlorn hope of conservative writers who penetrated within the citadel.
<p>
There sprang up conservative weekly and quarterly magazines, among them <i>Modern Age, National Review, </i>and <i>Orbis;</i> presently others. Some few book publishers, besides the courageous Henry Regnery, began to indulge us occasionally, among them Louisiana State University Press and a few other scholarly publishers. More wondrous still, now and again people of conservative bent actually were permitted to speak upon campuses, M. Stanton Evans among them. There was organized a national campus discussion society, distinctly conservative, now called the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, with its widely-circulated <i>Intercollegiate Review</i> and other journals, and its intellectually vigorous summer schools; there appeared also national and local "activist" conservative student groups. ISI and some others have outlasted the belligerent radical student clubs of the Sixties and Seventies. These were large gains-if one had an eye to the future.
<p>
<b>The Conservative Renewal</b>
<p>
Of course this haphazard intellectual revival of conservative thought affected American elections only a little. In this land, I repeat, it takes along while for new or revived political concepts to supplant in citizens' conscious and subconscious minds accustomed political loyalties and prejudices. Still, the immediate influence of the conservative renewal would have been larger, had not certain political accidents occurred. I refer to the extravagances of Joseph McCarthy, the absurdities of the John Birch Society, the murder of President Kennedy, the fiasco of Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign, Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam War. Despite our protestations, the liberal and radical publicists tarred us conservatives with these alien brushes. Even so, the public-opinion polls showed a steady increase in the number of Americans who set themselves down as "conservatives"-indeed, from the first poll onward conservatives formed the largest single segment of political preference. Combining circumstances and an altered climate of opinion were pushing public opinion toward conservative measures.
<p>
The circumstances which worked upon the American public were obvious enough during the past thirty years, and are still more obvious just now. Inflation of the currency, burdensome taxation, oppressive political centralization, sorry confusion in the public schools, disintegration of great cities by social change, violent crime, feebleness and failure in foreign affairs-these are only some of the afflictions concerning which American citizens became uncomfortably aware from the end of the Second World War onward (though particularly during the Johnson administration). I have listed foreign affairs last among these concerns, incidentally, because the American democracy interests itself in foreign affairs only when disaster is at hand.
<p>
Because political administrations professedly liberal were in power while these grim troubles came to pass, and because liberal dogmas dominated the serious press and the universities, quite justly the American public tended to look for some alternative to liberal slogans and policies. Never has any very large proportion of the American electorate embraced a thoroughgoing radicalism; therefore conservative measures slowly were recognized by the public as the alternative to liberal measures. This realization, it seems to me, is about to produce conservative men and measures this autumn-always barring political accidents.
<p>
Adverse circumstances alone do not bring on a reformation or a renewal: for a people to take arms against a sea of troubles, there must be provided the catalyst of ideas, for good or ill. About 1950, the emerging conservative thinkers had perceived the character of national adversity long before the general public became aware of the difficulties into which the United States was sliding. Thus a measure of conservative imagination and right reason already existed as the public rather slowly and confusedly began to turn its back upon the politically dominant liberalism. The handful of conservative writers and scholars, and those public men capable of serious reflection, offered an alternative to the exploded dogmas and measures of liberalism. Those fresh or renewed conservative ideas, which can have consequences, worked upon the public's discontent with the circumstances into which liberalism had brought the country: this union of thought and circumstance brought about the present conservative movement.
<p>
At this point we require some definition. Any intellectual and political movement, if it is to achieve more than ephemeral popularity and influence, must possess a body of common belief. I do not mean that it must, or should, possess an ideology. As H. Stuart Hughes wrote once, "conservatism is the negation of ideology." Ideology is political fanaticism and illusion; as John Adams defined it, ideology is the art of diving and sinking in politics. Instead, I mean by "a body of common belief" those general convictions and healthy prejudices derived from long consensus and social experience.
<p>
Such a body of common belief still exists in the United States-perhaps more than in any other land. Here are some of its elements: persuasion that there exists a moral order, of more than human contrivance, to which we ought to conform human laws and customs as best we can; confidence in the American constitution, both the written constitution and the underlying unwritten constitution of tested usage and custom; attachment to representative government; suspicion of central direction in most matters; preference for an economy in which work and thrift obtain their just rewards; love of country-a love which extends beyond the present moment to the past and the future of the country. And there are other elements which have not lost their vitality.
<p>
These are conservative beliefs and impulses. Their roots are not altogether withered. I have sketched the origins of this body of common beliefs in my book <i>The Roots of American Order.</i> This being still the common American patrimony (even though, of course, the average citizen could not express these beliefs very coherently), it is not surprising that in a time of tribulation and discontent, the American public begins to listen to conservative voices.
<p>
In short, this present hour is an hour of conservative opportunity. The conservatives of the United States have made large gains already; indeed, it is possible now to speak of a "movement"-even if of a movement still confused and disunited. Thirty years ago, there existed no organizations like The Heritage Foundation and its influential journal, <i>Policy Review,</i> or other present organizations and serious journals of a conservative cast. Thirty years ago, it did not seem conceivable that two economists believing in a free economy would be awarded Nobel Prizes. Thirty years ago, nothing was more improbable in politics than that both great national parties would be inclined toward nominating for the presidency those aspirants who seemed the more conservative of the lot.
<p>
<b>Order, Justice, and Freedom</b>
<p>
Yet the fact remains that this conservative movement does not march in lockstep. In one respect, this lack of unanimity is a virtue: it means that conservatives are no ideologues; they believe in diversity and individuality. Utopianism, oddity, and extreme positions, nevertheless, are not conservative virtues. Those failings are easily discerned in various aspects and factions of the growing drift rather clumsily labelled "conservative." Permit me to touch briefly upon some of these excesses.
<p>
One of them is the continuing obsession, particularly among some people well endowed with the goods of fortune, with economics. I do not mean to denigrate the Dismal Science. A good economic system has produced America's prosperity; and, still more important, it is closely connected with America's private liberty. Those "civil libertarians" who somehow fancy that we can reconcile an extreme of personal freedom with a servile and directed economy simply do not understand the great mysterious incorporation of the human race. And, as Samuel Johnson put it, a man is seldom more innocently occupied than when he is engaged in making money.
<p>
But economic activity is no more the whole of the civil social order than wealth is the sole source of happiness. Economic success is a byproduct, not the source, of America's success as a society. The sort of ignorant understanding to which I refer may be illustrated by one of the inimitable anecdotes of Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn. On one occasion, that compulsive traveller was addressing a gathering of Catholic businessmen in Detroit. At the conclusion of his remarks, a gentleman in the audience inquired, "Doc, do you know what history is?"
<p>
"Why, no," Kuehnelt-Leddihn replied. "Can you instruct me?"
<p>
"Sure. History is just economics, that's all just economics."
<p>
In the mind's eye, one may see the ironic Kuehnelt-Leddihn replying: "Indeed? Tell me, sir, are you a Catholic?"
<p>
"Sure. I just made a novena."
<p>
"What a pity, sir, what a pity."
<p>
"Why is it a pity I'm a Catholic?"-this belligerently.
<p>
"Because, sir, if you were not a Catholic, you might be made a professor at the Marx-Lenin Institute."
<p>
To embrace Marxist materialism and determinism in the name of another abstraction called "capitalism" is to deliver up one's self bound to the foe. Conservatives do defend a free economy; they defend it, however, as bound up with a complex social structure of order and justice and freedom, founded upon an understanding of man as a moral being. To reduce ourselves to economic determinists offering sacrifices to the great god Mammon is to ruin the prospects of all of us.
<p>
Sometimes allied with this economic obsession is the mode of belief which calls itself "libertarian." I willingly concede that there exist some very sensible and honorable men and women who allow themselves to be tagged with that label. Both F.A. Hayek and your servant reject the term; and we have our reasons, as men who have learnt considerable from Burke and Tocqueville. Those reasons, as applied to current controversies, have been sufficiently detailed recently in <i>National Review</i> by Ernest van den Haag.
<p>
Let me say here only a few words by way of general principle. Any good society is endowed with order and justice and freedom. Of these, as Sir Richard Livingstone wrote, order has primacy: for without tolerable order existing, neither justice nor freedom can exist. To try to exalt an abstract "liberty" to a single solitary absolute, as John Stuart Mill attempted, is to undermine order and justice-and, in a short space, to undo freedom itself, the real prescriptive freedom of our civil social order. "License they mean, when they cry liberty," in Milton's phrase.
<p>
John Adams and John Taylor of Caroline carried on a correspondence about the nature of liberty. Liberty as an abstraction, Adams said in substance, is either meaningless or baneful: there is the liberty of the wolf, and there is the very different liberty of the civilized human being. We owe our American freedoms to a well-functioning civil social order that requires duties as well as liberties for its survival.
<p>
I find it grimly amusing to behold extreme "libertarians," who proclaim that they would abolish taxes, military defense, and all constraints upon impulse, obtaining massive subsidies from people whose own great affluence has been made possible only by the good laws and superior constitutions of these United States-and by our armies and navies that keep in check the enemies of our order and justice and freedom. There is no freedom in anarchy, even if we call anarchism "libertarianism." If one demands unlimited liberty, as in the French Revolution, one ends with unlimited despotism. "Men of intemperate mind never can be free," Burke tells us. "Their passions forge their fetters."
<p>
Some momentary encounters become images that fix our future thought. When a college freshman, debating in Indianapolis, I happened to stroll into the great railroad station in that city, with my freshman colleagues; and we watched from high above the intricate shuttling of long trains in and out of the station. Because my father was a railroad engineman, I understood what care, precision, and complex scheduling necessarily were involved below. The functioning of a railway station, like the functioning of the American economic apparatus generally, like the functioning of the whole American society, was dependent upon a wondrously high degree of duty, discipline, and complex cooperation. I pointed out to my companions that ineluctable truth. The libertarians still have not grasped that point. It was well for the safety enjoyed by railway passengers that my father and other railwaymen were not libertarians: they did not permit their private interests, such as a glass of beer, to conflict with their duties. Yet those railwaymen were freemen, not ashamed of the American constitution.
<p>
Some of the people who style themselves libertarians, I repeat, in fact do subscribe to the body of common beliefs I mentioned earlier. What's in a name? Actually, they remain conservative enough. But as for those doctrinaire libertarians who stand ready to sweep away government and the very moral order why, that way lies madness. If the American public is given the impression that these fantastic dogmas represent American conservatism, then everything we have gained over the past three decades may be lost. The American people are not about to submit themselves to the utopianism of a tiny band of chirping sectaries, whose prophet (even though they may not have much direct acquaintance with his works) was ~ean Jacques Rousseau.
<p>
If they are to lead this country, conservatives must appear to be, and in fact must be, imaginative but reasonable people who do not claim that they will turn the world upside down. Genuine conservatives know that man and society are not perfectible; they are realistically aware that Utopia-including the dream-paradise of absolute, unfettered liberty to act just as the individual pleases-means literally Nowhere. It is one of the conservative's principal functions to remind mankind that politics is the art of the <i>possible.</i>
<p>
The United States is entering upon an epoch, necessarily, of sweeping but prudent reform: a conservative task. Diplomatic and military policies of the liberal era have brought us into imminent peril; the economy is virtually static, while inflation and taxation consume the seed-corn of capital; the educational structure is decayed and ineffectual; our great cities have become dangerous and dismal; political centralization reduces local and private responsibility and opportunity; the American people generally are disheartened. What the public hopes for, however dimly, is restoration: a renewal of American intelligence, vigor, confidence; a regaining of order, freedom, and justice. If conservatives can deal with these great problems ably and honestly, posterity will bless them.
<p>
<b>The Hope for Restoration</b>
<p>
It has happened from time to time in the history of civilizations that a period of decadence and discouragement has been followed by a period of renewal and hope. It can be so with our American civilization. Such a restoration requires the joining of right reason with imagination. Do the people in the present conservative movement possess such reason and imagination?
<p>
Or are the conservatives generally what John Stuart Mill called them, "the stupid party"? Certainly a good many folk who are "conservative" are dull or apathetic merely. Admittedly a good many folk who call themselves "conservative" seem interested chiefly in conserving their own advantages. "With conservative populations," Brooks Adams wrote, "slaughter is nature's remedy." He meant that mere plodding adherence to old ways will not suffice for survival in an age of fierce and rapid change.
<p>
But it is not the conservatism of dullness and short-sighted self-interest merely which has been stirring in this country. Paul Elmer More remarked that in a time of crisis, often the conservative displays powers of imagination which save the day. We need to rouse imagination of that sort-even the poetic imagination. President Nixon once asked me what one book he should read. "T.S. Eliot's <i>Notes toward the Definition of Culture,</i>" I told him, and later sent him a copy. With Eliot and other great poets, the imaginative conservative takes long views; and he knows, among a good many other things, that "culture" is more than a matter of subsidized art-festivals. It is our culture itself which totters in these concluding twenty years of the twentieth century. The word "conservative" originally signified "guardian." Today thinking conservatives have to be concerned with more than winning elections, important though that task is; we have to think seriously about our civilization's preservation. Thinking always being painful, liberals and radicals have not troubled themselves much about the shape of things to come.
<p>
During those thirty years of growth of the conservative movement, immense mischief has been done to the politics and the economics and the culture of this country. Soon it may be up to the conservatives to repair the damage, if they know how. What commenced as a rearguard action by some of the older generation of men of politics and business, and as a troubled protest against the mindless drift of affairs by a handful of scholars and writers, may find itself invested with national authority. Are conservatives well prepared for this responsibility? No, not altogether; but then, time moves on, and nobody ever is well prepared for great duties, and the longer we delay, the more formidable become the nation's difficulties..
<p>
Those of us who began a conservative intellectual renewal about 1950 have grown gray in opposition to liberal dominations and powers. We do not expect ever to be able to doze secure in Lotus-land. We are not yet the passing generation: another twenty years must elapse before my eldest child is as old as I was when I published my first book-and I was then a young writer. So it is not a case of "to you, from failing hands, we throw the torch." The Heritage Foundation, I trust, will be here, or at least somewhere in the District of Columbia, by the first year of the twenty-first century-supposing that conservative men and measures have renewed this Republic. And quite conceivably I may be with you on June 4, Anno Domini 2000, reporting on the progress of the conservative movement.
<p>
Prudent change is the means of our preservation, and the great statesman is one who combines with a disposition to preserve an ability to improve. That awareness, and that sort of person, the conservative movement has been endeavoring to develop. Our efficacy may be put to the test very soon. If we fail, where else in the modern world will powers of resistance and recuperation be discovered? As Walter Bagehot says, "Conservatism is enjoyment." Life is worth living, the conservative declares. We are not going to march to Zion; yet we may succeed in planting some trees in the Waste Land. With Burke, I attest the rising generation.

<P>
Let me commence with two aphorisms, widely separated in time and substance.
<P>
The first is the observation of Aristotle that it is unjust to treat unequal things equally.
<P>
The second is the declaration of Marx that to establish equality, first we must establish inequality.
<P>
These two assumptions have been at war one with the other during the twentieth century.
<P>
What did Aristotle mean by writing that to treat unequal things equally is unjust? He meant that not all human beings are worthy of the same deserts, that not all actions are equally honorable and commendable, that not all works are of equally enduring value; so to confer equal rewards upon excellence and mediocrity would be profoundly unjust to the more deserving of praise. "To each his own."
<p>
What did Marx mean by asserting that inequality must be established before equality might be attained? He meant that the mighty must be pulled down from their seats, the alleged exploiters expropriated, whole classes destroyed-presumably by a general blood-letting-before the earthly paradise of communism might be realized. The bourgeois and all other opponents of socialist progress must be thoroughly discriminated against by the revolutionary proletariat. The bourgeois should be indulged no equality with the son of toil.
<p>
The Marxist regime in the Soviet Union fell at last after seven decades of terror and suffering; but the notion that "social justice" means equality of condition still works among us. In the connection, I commend you to three books: F. A. Hayek's <i>The Mirage of Social Justice;</i> Helmut Schoeck's <i>Envy: A Theory of Social Behavior;</i> and Gonzalo Fernandex de la Mora's <i>Egalitarian Envy: The Political Foundations of Social Justice.</i> The second book is by a German, the third by a Spaniard; it is a sign of the surviving domination of socialist assumptions about justice in America that these latter books scarcely were reviewed at all in the United States, though editions of both were published here. They deny the notion that there can exist a perfect social justice, attainable by positive law and social engineering; and their authors are agreed that the perfectly egalitarian society would be an unjust society. Let me suggest, also, that those present today would find a keen analysis of socialist errors about justice in a book of yesteryear of which I brought out a new edition some three years ago: W. H. Mallock's <i>A Critical Examination of Socialism.</i>
<p>
"All the four authors I mentioned a moment ago touch upon the vice of envy and its ruinous personal and social consequences. To that vice the Marxists appealed successfully in much of the world. "Why shouldst thou sit, and I stand?" cries incarnate Envy, in Marlowe' s play <i>Dr. Faustus.</i> "Come away!" Social justice will be attained, the poor are told, when they have unseated the affluent and supplanted them in their possessions. Such doctrines have devastated most of Asia and Africa ever since the Second World War, causing the massacre of the old leading classes, most hideously in the Congo-now Zaire-Portugese Timor, Portuguese Guinea, Chad, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and China. Yet the earthly paradise of social justice did not result from this slaughter: instead, squalid oligarchs and men of blood succeeded to power, and general impoverishment has been experienced. Perhaps we see today the beginning of such a progress toward social justice in the Republic of South Africa. Such is the justice of "the good old rule, the good old plan, that they shall take who have the power, and they shall keep who can."
<p>
Until recent decades, nevertheless, socially ruinous envy of this sort was not really powerful in the United States, and did not provoke a powerful political movement for such a restructuring of the economy as would even the scores. During several years of the Great Depression, my parents and my little sister and I lived in an old dwelling near the railway yards at Plymouth, Michigan, my father being a railroad engineman. Our house had no bathroom; its <i>necessarium</i> was an outdoor privy, inconvenient under snow. (We had thought we were buying the house on land contract, but it turned out that the man who pretended to sell the dwelling to us had no proper title to it himself, and so my parents lost their investment and went back to renting; they never did succeed in owning any house, lifelong.) Weekly there arrived in our house the newspaper of the Railway Brotherhoods, entitled <i>Labor.</i> In almost every issue there appeared a cartoon of a literally bloated Capitalist, in evening dress, smoking a bloated cigar; and such exploiters of the working poor were denounced in editorials.
<p>
But these circumstances and publications did not wake envy in my parents. They took it for granted that some people, whether by talent or by inheritance or by mere chance, prosper materially in life, while other people do not; this, they knew, was in the nature of things. They had a subsistence, and kinfolk, and love. The caricatures of the Bloated Capitalist did not rouse my father's wrath; my father did indeed think that the railroads were ill-managed, and that increasing centralization of the economy was to be regretted, and that pride would have a fall on Wall Street, as indeed came to pass; but I never heard my parents utter a word of envy. Things will be as they will be, they took it.
<p>
Blessed are those children reared in a household innocent of the deadly sin of envy. Their lives will not be tormented by a grinding resentment that they are not beautiful, or famous, or favored with the gifts of fortune. They will not demand as a natural right or an entitlement a presumptuous personal equality with everybody under the sun; nor maintain that their opinions are as good as anybody else' s. They will not covet a neighbor's goods. And thus they may come to know peace of soul. They will perceive the wisdom in these lines of a very early poem in Scots vernacular:
<p><i><blockquote>
I saw this written on a wall: <br>In what estate, man, that thou fall <br>Accept thy lot, and thank thy God of all.
</blockquote></i><p>
But I do not mean to imply that every form of equality is the work of envy. The Christian doctrine of equality has worked much moral good. This is the teaching that all souls are equal in the ultimate judgment of God; that God is no respecter of persons. Yet God separates the goats from the sheep; in my Father's house are many mansions, but they are not all on the same floor. God's ultimate judgment is not affected by rank and station, wealth or power, here below. All that matters, in the end, is goodness of heart; so sometimes the last, at the judgment seat, shall be first.
<p>
And the jurisprudential principle of equal justice under law, too, has worked much social good. The law also is no respecter of persons: the king himself is under the law, as Bracton put it in medieval times. Neither in civil nor in criminal cases, declares the system of law which Americans have inherited from Britain, does any class of persons enjoy privileges or immunities. This doctrine keeps the peace; and to keep the peace is the object of all law.
<p>
Whether political equality has worked much good is another matter. In most of the world, attempts at enduring and peaceful democracy have failed. Constitutional democracy of the successful sort has been confined chiefly to English-speaking countries, which have inherited the British historical experience. And even in such countries, who can doubt that democracy, political equality, is in grave trouble nowadays? Is not the United States being converted into a "plebiscitary democracy," with an election of the temporary dictator every four years, actually governed by a centralized bureaucracy nominally under the supervision of a body of squabbling politicians. How much genuine democracy of the sort discerned in America by Tocqueville, what Brownson called "territorial democracy," will remain by the middle of the twenty-first century?-Even today, indeed, how much political equality remains in elections determined chiefly by what candidates have the most money to spend on television broadcasts?
<p>
But political equality is too large and complex a subject for me to discuss today. I turn, therefore to the subject of equality of condition-that is, equality of incomes and other material rewards, equality in education, equality of mores, manners, lodgings, and tastes. It is this envious passion for equality of condition against which Tocqueville warned his time and ours. The total triumph of the doctrine of equality of condition would be a triumph of injustice. Unthinking demands for an equality allegedly just notwithstanding, a society in which everybody should be precisely in the condition of everybody else would be a thoroughly unjust society.
<p>
Zealots throughout the centuries have endeavored to establish communities totally egalitarian; all those endeavors have failed after much suffering. Utopians in the Greek and Roman eras, the Levellers and Diggers of England in the seventeenth century, Babeuf and his fellow conspirators of 1791, and the communist ideologues who held power in the Russian system for seven decades-these are only some of the enthusiasts for equality who for a time established a domination of equality in misery, collapsing soon or late because contrary to human nature. Yet, as Hegel wrote, we learn from history that we learn nothing from history. What failed disastrously in the late Soviet Union, a good many Americans now seek to enact in these United States.
<p>
The instrument of the doctrinaire egalitarian in America is not violent revolution, but employment of taxation-which, as John Marshall declared in the Dartmouth College case, is the power to destroy. A leveller pulls down the more prosperous classes in society through crushing taxation, levied to pay for "entitlements" for an abstraction called The Poor-in effect, to maintain a growing proletariat that contribute nothing much to society except their offspring. Rostovtzeff and other writers on Roman times have drawn the analogy between bread and circuses and the modern dole or "welfare" measures: in the Empire, the emperor with his soldiery united with the Roman mob to extort revenue from the propertied classes-until at last the ancient economy collapsed, and the frontiers could not be defended. Clinton Caesar, eager to placate the Welfare Lobby, proposes to establish new overwhelming "entitlements," particularly medical ones, to be paid for by employers-for of course the wealth of employers is assumed to be inexhaustible. As in the age of Diocletian men fled from public offices, lest they be taxed and regulated to extinction, so by the approaching end of this century employers may be inclined to flee to some other condition of life-but to what?
<p>
The mentality of the American leveller nowadays may be sufficiently suggested by a proposal advanced by some of Clinton's inner circle but not presented to the Congress. This was a new tax: a levy upon persons dwelling in large houses. If the residence should contain rooms which might have been rented, had the owner desired, to paying lodgers (or perhaps non-paying homeless persons)-why, the owner of the dwelling would be taxed for the rooms that might have been occupied by other people. This tax would have been a federal levy, not a local real-property assessment. It is just the sort of tax to have been devised by some former hippie, now a bureaucrat, spiritually akin to President Clinton, former hippie himself. The real purpose of this strange proposal clearly was punitive, meant to punish those wicked rich who possessed spare bedrooms. Make them pay through the nose for such undemocratic private possession of domestic amenities! An Englishman's home once upon a time may have been his castle; but now an American' s home should be his own only upon the sufferance of the Washington bureaucracy. If such a one should lodge homeless persons in his dining room, say, he might be indulged in a partial remission of taxes. One is reminded of housing in Moscow about the year 1919, when the communist regime requisitioned even the lavatories of private residences as night lodging for the underprivileged. Envious egalitarianism as implemented by Clintonian zealots might not be satisfied until the whole population of this land should be lodged in immobilized "mobile homes"-a universal rookery of trailer camps. Why should anybody be indulged in domestic comforts not readily available to all citizens?
<p>
Have I carried to absurdity my argument against equality of condition? Nay, not so; for the enthusiasts for total equality are not to be satisfied with small concessions. I commend to you a dystopia, -a longish short story, by Jacquetta Hawkes, that brilliant Englishwoman of diverse talents, published in her collection <i>Fables</i>-which volume appeared in 1952, during Britain's disagreeable experience with a socialist regime.
<p>
This fable is entitled "The Unites." God, having sensed no impulses from the planet Earth for a long while, dispatches a humble angel to investigate and report to Him. This emissary, who had visited Earth once long, long before, discovers on this later expedition that humankind has suffered a startling change for the worse. No longer, indeed, do men and women call themselves humans: they style themselves "Unites," for all are united in a kind of sub-human state, everybody precisely like everybody else. These degenerate beings live in some 500,000 Life Units dispersed about the globe, and subsist by primitive agriculture. Private property has been abolished altogether. Every Life Unit consists of four standard tenements: the Pink Block for the young, the Green Block for the cultivators, the Red Block for the industrial workers, the Black Block for the administrators and the governments. Kinship and family life have been swept away, as disruptive of social unity. If equality is the whole aim of existence, why should one person outlive another? There must be equality in death as in life. So on attaining the age of sixty-six, the older Unites are herded into the Finis Chamber of the Black Block, suffocated there, and their bodies incinerated. The only amusement in these Life Unit communes is a colossal sort of motor-drome in which some of the performers bloodily perish, to the crowd's satisfaction.
<p>
In short, through the doctrine of equality of condition what once was the human race has transformed itself into a moral condition scarcely distinguishable from that of the beasts which perish. And yet a few true human beings, eager to subvert this life-in-death, have survived somehow in Life Unit 1457. The visiting angel learns that this handful of young people are contriving to bring down the dreary system of equality. Indeed their slogan "Equality must be destroyed" prevails; the stupidity of the egalitarian administrators cannot resist the innovators; and in one Life Unit, at least, inequality is happily triumphant. But even so, the angel detects some ideologue of equality plotting already to bring back equal misery; thus the struggle between the forces of individual achievement and the forces of equality runs on in human societies. There are no lost causes because there are no gained causes.
<p>
Jacquetta Hawkes's fable or parable is set in a distant future; but in the closing decade of this century we move in that egalitarian direction. Equality is demanded in politics and in monetary incomes; more, it is demanded in formal education. My wife, Annette, ten years ago was a member of the Commission on Excellence in Education appointed by President Reagan. She promptly found that many folks in the federal Department of Education, and many educationists in teachers' colleges and teachers' unions, were concerned chiefly for what they called "equity"-that is, equality, sameness, at every level of schooling. Some insisted that American education must have both excellence and equity, a manifest absurdity: for the word "excellence" means to exceed, of course, to do better than others; while "equity," or uniformity, necessarily implies mediocrity. The more equality in schooling, the lower the achievement; and the greater the injustice toward students possessed of some talents. Forty years ago, I resigned a university post in disgust at a deliberate policy of lowering standards in the interest of "equity"-that is accommodating more students who, from stupidity or indolence, ought not to have been admitted to a university at all. In general, American standards for an education allegedly "higher" have declined still more since I departed from the Ivory Tower.
<p>
Egalitarian pressures are exerted in virtually every country to push into the universities most of the rising generation, however dull, bored, or feckless a young person may be. The consequence of this movement is to make the higher learning lower. Avoiding the dullness of most graduate studies in the United States, in 1948 I went abroad for my higher learning-to St. Andrews University, still -somewhat medieval in appearance, the oldest of Scottish universities, situated in a charming medieval town. Nowadays St. Andrews is under political pressure to change its character by admitting many more students, which would destroy the tradition of learning there by the North Sea. For what reason? Why, to "give everybody his chance." Perhaps we ought to confer the doctorate upon every infant at birth, and reserve the universities for people really interested in right reason and imagination, so eliminating degree-snobbery and degree-envy. The present disorders of the intellect on most campuses result from the combination of ideologue egalitarians among the professors with ignorant -and bored students.
<p>
Permit me to suggest some probable long-run consequences of national infatuation with equality of condition.
<p>
First, great injury to the leading class that every society requires for its success. This leading class is not identical with sociological "elites"; to ascertain the distinction, read T. S. Eliot's slim book <i>Notes Towards the Definition of Culture.</i> This leading class, even in the American democracy, is made up of public-spirited men and women of property; well-educated professional folk, lawyers among them; honest politicians who take long views; publishers and writers who help to shape public opinion on a diversity of matters; the clergy; persons experienced in military affairs, foreign affairs, and the arts of political administration; local leaders in charitable and civic concerns; those people of industry and commerce who know that there is more to life than getting and spending. I am even willing to acknowledge among this leading class some of the better professors of arts and sciences-although Nietzsche reminds us that in politics the professor always plays the comic role.
<p>
The authority of this class of persons in America has been declining in recent decades, from a variety of causes; and the decay in public and private morality, the decadence of education, the shallow populist tone of our politics, and a number of other afflictions result in considerable part from that decline of authority. Now a renewed demand for levelling assails this leading class. For one thing, it was possible for members of this leading class to take part in public and charitable concerns, and to set the whole tone of life in their communities, because most of them possessed some private means; they were not daily money-grubbing. Increasingly this class is being pushed to the wall by heavy-nay, savage-taxation. Most people here will have noticed how in the past few years various deductions and exemptions have been eliminated from income-tax returns, particularly for persons with incomes exceeding $100,000; for such folk, medical deductions from income are a thing of the past. Now the Clinton Administration imposes new burdens, falling principally upon the class I have just been describing. Many will pay more than half their incomes in taxes- federal and state income taxes, real-property taxes, sales taxes, and the rest. What margin will remain for such people to exercise the functions of voluntary leadership?
<p>
The late Michael Harrington, a few years past, was addressing a crowd of poor people. He said that too many affluent people were paying less than half their incomes in income tax. He was surprised by the reaction of his audience. They were indignant at Harrington's proposal that the state should take more than half a man's income, however large that income. "That's just not fair." some of them cried. His audience was right and Harrington wrong. And perhaps some in his audience perceived, better than did Harrington, what would happen to a society-including persons of very modest incomes-in which the Leviathan state should kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
<p>
Already many of you here today, and for that matter your servant, are paying more than half their incomes in taxation. Our time occupied in trying to make ends meet, how much leadership shall we be able to offer? More and more, in such circumstances, the remnant of authority and the power of decision-making are usurped by a centralized bureaucracy-and in the name of "democracy."
<p>
Second, an obsession with equality commonly results in general impoverishment, by diminishing saving and capital accumulation, and by "humanitarian" welfare measures that diminish the incentive to work for one's own subsistence. Egalitarian "entitlements" already have so increased the national debt that, as matters are drifting, the amount of interest on the national debt, annually, will come to exceed the total federal revenues collected by the present tax structure!
<p>
Decreased economic productivity, caused by a virtual oppression of industry and commerce, will afflict the poor worst of all-even though the mistaken policies of government were undertaken in the name of equality of condition for the alleged poor.
<p>
A third consequence of deliberate levelling in society would be grave intellectual damage, already in progress. Over the centuries there was developed in all civilized countries an elaborate edifice of schooling, originally religious in character, meant to impart some measure of wisdom and virtue to the rising generation. Aristotle instructs us that the process of learning cannot be made easy. The higher learning is concerned necessarily with abstractions, in large part; but the common man tends to dislike abstractions. As T. S. Eliot said once, there ought to be many different kinds of education for many different kinds of people; but the egalitarian zealot would enforce uniformity of schooling, perhaps of the "outcomes education" sort to produce conditioned responses, now being pushed in Virginia, Michigan, and other states.
<p>
The black-militant outcry against the study of the works of "dead white males" suggests what a thoroughly egalitarian system of schooling would discard. Thought always is painful; so let us get on with the rap sessions.
<p>
Those intellectual disciplines that nurture right reason and moral imagination, requiring real thought, are unpopular with the egalitarian, who regards them as archaic and snobbish. The egalitarian much prefers utilitarian schooling and vague "social studies." But both private wisdom and public order require that a substantial number of people be well acquainted with genuine works of the mind. The natural sciences, humane studies, and the philosophical habit of mind neglected, the person and the republic sink into ignorance and apathy; but the egalitarian zealot does not perceive these ruinous consequences until the decline no longer can be arrested. The condition of most of our public schools today, and the inferior performance of most colleges and universities by contrast with their work half a century ago, ought to suggest to us how far, as a people, we already have slipped down the slope toward intellectual failure. What I say of American education is quite as true of British education nowadays, and, with few exceptions of Europe generally. But the educational egalitarian is not deterred-not quite yet: so long as "everybody has equal opportunity" to spend four or five years in an educational establishment professedly higher, social justice has been achieved, he fancies.
<p>
In short, ladies and gentlemen, I have been arguing that it is profoundly unjust to endeavor to transform society into a tableland of equality. It would be unjust to the energetic, reduced to equality with the slack and indolent; it would be unjust to the imaginative, compelled to share the schooling and the tastes of the dull; it would be unjust to the thrifty, compelled to make up for the losses of the profligate; it would be unjust to those who take long views, forced to submit to the domination of a majority interested chiefly in short-run results.
<p>
But I shall not labor this point, already made forcefully by Alexis de Tocqueville and other writers whose talents exceed my. own. The egalitarian society, far from satisfying desires for "social justice," would be unjust to the very people who made possible a tolerably orderly and prosperous society. Eric Voegelin remarks that the tolerably just society is one in which the more aspiring natures are free to exercise their talents, but the large majority of people, who desire merely a quiet life,-are secured against oppression by the aspiring natures. Mediocre necessarily, the egalitarian society would discourage or suppress enterprising talents-which would result in social stagnation. Life in a social tableland of equality would be infinitely boring.
<p>
Yet don't I believe in equality of <i>opportunity?</i> No, friends, I do not. The thing is not possible. First of all, genetic differences cannot be surmounted between individual and individual; Thomas Jefferson and the whole school of "created free and equal" knew nothing whatsoever of human genetics, a science of the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Second, opportunity depends greatly upon family background and nurturing; and unless it is proposed to sweep away the family altogether, as in Jacquetta Hawkes's fable, the rising generation of one stock will differ greatly in opportunity from the rising generation of a different family. For instance, I read every evening to my four little daughters, or told them stories; while my neighbors did not so instruct and converse with their children; accordingly, my children have enjoyed superior opportunities in life. It would be outrageously unjust to try somehow to wipe out these advantages of genetic inheritance or familial instruction.
<p>
Inequality is the natural condition of human beings; charity may assist those not favored by nature; but attempts to impose an artificial equality of condition and intellect, although in the long run they fail, meanwhile can work great mischief in any society, and-still worse-damage human nature itself.

The literature of natural law is complex, copious, and monthly growing vaster. All I aspire to accomplish in this second lecture on "The Future of Justice" is to offer some general introduction to the subject, together with reflections on the protections and dangers of natural-law doctrines, and observations concerning natural law and constitutional government.
<p>
A great deal of loose talk about natural law has occurred in very recent years. It was objected to Judge Bork' s nomination to the Supreme Court that Bork did not believe in natural law; and when Judge Thomas was interrogated for that bench, the objection was raised that he <i>did</i> believe in natural law. These protestations came mostly from the same group of senators. Clearly a good many public men and women nowadays have only vague notions of what is signified by this term <i>natural law.</i>
<p>
Objectively speaking, <i>natural law,</i> as a term of politics and jurisprudence, may be defined as a loosely knit body of rules of action prescribed by an authority superior to the state. These rules variously (according to the several differing schools of natural-law and natural-rights speculation) are derived from divine commandment; from the nature of humankind; from abstract Reason; or from long experience of mankind in community.
<p>
But natural law does not appertain to states and courts merely. For primarily it is a body of ethical perceptions or rules governing the life of the individual person, quite aside from politics and jurisprudence. When many persons ignore or flout the natural law for human beings, the consequences presently are ruinous-as with the unnatural vices that result in the disease of AIDS, or with the ideological passions, defying the norm of justice, that have ravaged most nations since the First World War.
<p>
The natural law should not be taken for graven Tables of Governance, to be followed to jot and tittle; appealed to in varying circumstances, the law of nature must be applied with high prudence. As Alessandro d'Entreves writes, "The lesson of natural law is in fact nothing but an assertion that law is a part of ethics." And, he concludes "The lesson of natural law [is] simply to remind the jurist of his own limitations.... This point where values and norms coincide, which is the ultimate origin of law and at the same time the beginning of moral life proper, is, I believe, what men for over two thousand years have indicated by the name of natural law."
<p>
On the one hand, natural law must be distinguished from positive or statutory law, decreed by the state; on the other, from the "laws of nature" in a scientific sense-that is, from propositions expressing the regular order of certain natural phenomena Also natural law sometimes is confounded with assertions of "natural rights," which may or may not be founded upon classical and medieval concepts of natural law.
<p>
The most important early treatise on natural law is Cicero's <i>De Re Publica.</i> The Ciceronian understanding of natural law, which still exercises strong influence, was well expressed in the nineteenth century by Froude: "Our human laws are but the copies, more or less imperfect, of the eternal laws so far as we can read them, and either succeed and promote our welfare, or fail and bring confusion and disaster, according as the legislator's insight has detected the true principle, or has been distorted by ignorance or selfishness."
<p>
As interpreted by the Roman jurisconsult, and later by the medieval Schoolmen and Canonists- Thomas Aquinas especially-the legacy of the classical <i>jus naturale</i> endured with little challenge until the seventeenth century. In England during the sixteenth century it was powerfully upheld by Richard Hooker in his <i>Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity.</i> In the Christian world the natural law was received as a body of unwritten rules depending upon universal conscience and common sense, ascertainable by right reason. But with the stirrings of secularism and rationalism during the seventeenth century, a new interpretation of "natural law" began to develop, conspicuous (near the end of the century) in the works of Hugo Grotius and Baron Samuel von Pufendorf. This latter secularized concept of natural law was held by many of the <i>philosophes</i> of the eighteenth century, and took on flesh during the French Revolution, when it was vulgarized by Thomas Paine.
<p>
Nevertheless, the older understanding of natural law was not extinguished. It was ringingly reasserted by Edmund Burke, in his distinction between the "real" and the "pretended" rights of men. Through the disciples of Burke, and through the influence of the Catholic Church, the classical and Christian natural law has experienced a revival in the latter half of the twentieth century.
<p>
During the nineteenth century, natural-law concepts were overshadowed by the powerful Utilitarian system of Jeremy Bentham; by the theories of John Austin and the Analytical Jurists; by legal positivism; and later-particularly in the United States-by legal pragmatism. In the United States, the older and newer schools of natural law have contended against each other since the latter half of the eighteenth century, and both have been hotly assailed by positivistic, utilitarian, and pragmatic interpretations of law. Yet appeals to the "natural law" or "a higher law" have recurred often in American politics and jurisprudence; both conservatives and radicals, from time to time, have invoked this law of nature
<p>
The Catholic Church continues to adhere to the classical and Thomistic understanding of the natural law-to an apprehension of Justice that is rooted in the wisdom of the species. Sir Ernest Barker put thus the idea of natural law: "This justice is conceived as being the higher or ultimate law, proceeding from the nature of the universe from the Being of God and the reason of man. It follows that law-in the sense of the law of the last resort-is somehow above lawmaking."
<p>
The most lucid and popular exposition of natural law it to be found in the Appendix, "Illustrations of the Tao," to C. S. Lewis's little book <i>The Abolition of Man.</i> Therein Lewis distinguishes eight major natural laws of universal recognition and application, together with several illustrations of each, drawn from a wide diversity of cultures, religions, philosophical discourses, and countries. He expounds the Law of General Beneficence; the Law of Special Beneficence; Duties to Parents, Elders, Ancestors; Duties to Children and Posterity; the Law of Justice; the Law of Good Faith and Veracity; the Law of Mercy; the Law of Magnanimity. No code of the laws of nature ever having existed, it is ineffectual to try to enforce that body of ethical principles through courts of law; no judge hands down decisions founded directly upon the admonition, "Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land"-or the Commandment's equivalents in the Babylonian List of Sins, the Egyptian Confession of the Righteous Soul, the Manual of Epictetus, Leviticus, the Analects, or Hindu books of wisdom. Nevertheless, such perpetual precepts lie behind the customs and the statutes that shelter father and mother.
<p>
So much, succinctly, by way of definition. Turn we now to the difficulty of explaining natural law to the average sensual man. Permit me to discourse with you for a little while about natural law and the moral imagination. Incidentally, I am helped here by an unpublished essay by the late Raymond English, who understood and praised the natural law, and understood and despised the claims for "natural right." Let me quote English directly:
<p><blockquote>
The natural law cannot be understood except through the elements of poetry and imagination in the soul. The poetic and the moral imagination are parts of human reason. For the man who does not feel himself in some sense a child of God, who is not possessed by the "desire and pursuit of the whole," and for whom words like honor are meaningless, the notion of natural law must be a Mumbojumbo, a bogle to make children behave tolerably well, a fantasy from the adolescence or the childhood of the race. Poets, James Elroy Flecker says, are those who swear that Beauty lives although lilies die; and the natural law is the poetry of political science, the assurance that Justice lives though states are imperfect and ephemeral. Justice is to politics what beauty is to art; indeed, beauty and justice become almost identical at the highest levels of human aspiration.
</blockquote><p>
Permit me, ladies and gentlemen, to repeat here that the natural law is more than a guide for statesmen and jurists. It is meant primarily for the governance of persons-for you and me, that we may restrain will and appetite in our ordinary walks of life. Natural law is not a harsh code that we thrust upon other people: rather, it is an ethical knowledge, innate perhaps, but made more clearly known to us through -the operation of right reason. And the more imagination with which a person is endowed, the more will he apprehend the essence of the natural law, and understand its necessity. If such a one, despite his power of imagination, offends against the natural law, the greater must be his suffering. So I have discovered in the course of a peregrine life. And over a good many decades I have found that most contemners of the natural law are dull dogs, afflicted by a paucity of imagination. As Adam Mickiewicz instructs us:
<p><blockquote>
Your soul deserves the place to which it came,<br>If having entered Hell, you feel no flame.
</blockquote><p>
Such is the case for the importance of natural law. Permit me to turn now to the case against natural law, as expressed by the legal positivists-most strongly, perhaps, by the German scholar Hans Kelsen. They regard natural law as a body of sentimental fictions; they hold that the state is the only true source of law. The views of John Austin and the Analytical Jurists are similar: all law is decreed by the political sovereign, they hold. Rather than moving abstractly among the several schools of jurisprudence in the twentieth century, I offer you now the contents of a letter I received recently from a German inventor and industrialist who had read in the Bavarian magazine <i>Epoche</i> some remarks of mine on natural law. My correspondent is a very intelligent and indeed talented man, considerable of a naturalist in that he studies flora and fauna. In politics, I suppose he may be classified as a German liberal of the old school. His communication, refreshingly innocent of the jargon of jurisprudence and ethics, suggests the mentality that lies behind the denigration of natural law by positivists and secular humanists, who recognize and deride the Christian and the classical origins of the idea of natural law.
<p>
"Whether the term 'law of nature' is more frequently used nowadays, or whether the <i>jus naturale</i> is an old invention," my German correspondent begins, "I think this term is wrong and misleading. There is no law or legislative system which can be derived from nature. Nature has rules developed during evolution, but there is only a <i>jus hominis</i> and no <i>jus naturale."</I>
<p>
"In other words," my friend goes on, 
<p><blockquote>
all ethical norms are developed and worked out by human beings, in this case mostly by the homo stultus, subspecies sapiens.... The order of nature follows in many respects the right of the stronger, which, in fact, keeps nature with all its plants and animals in excellent shape. But mankind has set up ethical rules, good ones and bad ones, very different from natural rules. Many of these man-made rules are quite bad, sinning against nature....
<P>
The very deplorable situation of the species homo stultus comes from wrong ethical rules, which are against nature. I am not pleading for the right of the stronger between human beings, but for more influence of the rare subspecies sapiens, especially of those individuals who understand nature-which means also the nature of human character. Unfortunately Jesus did not understand the real nature of men; nor do the socialists understand it when they expect that people will work for the state rather than for themselves....
<P>
I offer another example, in which American legislators have chosen the wrong solution. There is a law in the United States, if I am correct, which forbids the killing of foreign heads of state. If I am correct this is concerned with clandestine actions, e.g. by the CIA. This law is unethical. Assuming that no American president or the American government plans to eliminate a foreign dictator just for fun, but rather because he is a danger to the United States or to his own people or both, then removing a dictator as soon as possible would save the lives of many; and is, in consequence, completely justified.
<P>
We should agree that right is an exclusively human creation. What is regarded as rightful by one group of people within a community, can be regarded as wrongful by another group. I seek a terminology where there is a clean and clear distinction between what comes from nature and what comes from human efforts. Human efforts are aimed very often, with the best intentions, in the wrong direction. I mean "wrong" in this sense: against nature, for nature cannot be neglected without harming the human race....
<P>
Failing to realize that often human character is bad must lead to destroying a society through leniency. We have to determine when our ethical laws accord with nature and when they counteract nature. We must not ignore "the rule of the fittest," when we decide to kill a dictator, for instance. We acknowledge the right of every nation to use as much force as possible when fighting another nation to death. The fight between nations follows what could be called natural right, but is better called the rule of nature.
</blockquote><p>
For this German correspondent of mine, you will have noted, "nature" signifies animal nature, Darwinian nature, red in tooth and claw. Therefore he despises appeals to natural law, and believes that not only all positive or traditional law, but all ethical principles, are human creations merely. And these human contrivances, he implies, sometimes may be mistaken; we might be wiser to found our human institutions on the principle of competition, favoring the fitter.
<p>
Here, I suggest, we perceive the mentality that lies back of the jurisprudence of Hans Kelsen and certain other positivists: critics of the whole concept of natural law.
<p>
Yet in one matter my correspondent does turn to the extreme medicine of natural law: his commendation of tyrannicide. This is interesting, as it is related to Germany in this century.
<p>
German jurisprudence demands that the citizen be strictly obedient to the state, for the state is the source of all law? the omniscient keeper of the peace. No law but positive law has been recognized in Germany since the fall of the German monarchy; natural law has no place at all.
<p>
Adolph Hitler, chosen Reichschancellor by lawful means, and confirmed in power by the Reichstag in 1933, was sustained later by national plebiscites. He was the head of the German state, the source of all law, to which all Germans had been taught obedience. Yet certain Germans-army officers, scholars, professional people, chiefly-found his actions evil. By quasi-constitutional means he had subverted the constitution. His popularity had become tremendous, and his military power. Only by death might he be removed.
<p>
Therefore a little knot of brave and conscientious men determined to save Germany and Europe by killing Hitler. They had been reared in the doctrine that all citizens must obey the inerrant state. In this exigency, however, they turned to doctrines of natural law for justification. Was there no remedy against an unnatural master of the state? In the teachings of natural law they discerned a fatal remedy. Fatal to them, at least; for nearly all of the heroic men involved in the several conspiracies against Hitler died frightful deaths. I knew well Dr. Ludwig Freund, a kindly professor of political science, one of the two survivors of the first plot to kill Hitler. By nature Professor Freund was a law-abiding gentleman. And being law-abiding, in defense of true law he was prepared to slay the chief of state, perverter of Germany's laws and the laws of man's nature.
<p>
I repeat that we have recourse to natural law, as opposed to positive law, only as a last resort, ordinarily. My only service as a jurist occurred in Morton Township, Mecosta County, some decades ago, when for two consecutive terms I was elected-unanimously-justice of the peace. When determining a disputed boundary between two farms, a justice of the peace does not repair to theories of natural law and meditate upon which of two claimants is the more worthy of judicial compassion; rather, the justice of the peace turns to statute, common law, possibly to local custom- and to the files of the recorder of deeds at the county seat. And so it is with the ordinary administration of law at every level. Statute, charter, and prescription ordinarily are sufficient to maintain the rule of law-the end of which, we ought not to forget, is to keep the peace.
<p>
Yet to guide the sovereign; the chief of state; the legislator; the public prosecutor; the judge when, in effect, he sits in equity-to guide you and me, indeed-there endures the natural law, which in essence is man's endeavor to maintain a moral order through the operation of a mundane system of justice. Unlike my German correspondent, the sustainer of natural law knows that there is law for man, and law for thing; and that our moral order is not the creation of coffee-house philosophers. Human nature ; not vulpine nature, leonine nature, or serpentine nature. Natural law is bound up with the concept of the dignity of man, and with the experience of humankind ever since the beginnings of social community.
<p>
It will not do to substitute private interpretations of natural law for common law or civil law, any more than it would have been well for England, during the Reformation, to have obeyed the "Geneva Men" by sweeping away common law and the whole inherited apparatus of parliamentary statutes, to substitute the laws of the ancient Jews. Positive law and customary law, in any country, grow out of a people's experience in community; natural law should have its high part in shaping and restraining positive and customary laws, but natural law could not conceivably supplant judicial institutions. Yet were natural-law concepts to be abandoned altogether-why, then, indeed, the world would find itself governed by 
<P><blockquote>
The good old rule, the good old plan, <BR>That they shall take who have the power, <BR>And they shall keep who can.
</blockquote><P>
Turn we now to relationships between the natural law and the American judiciary. Not since Associate Justice Joseph Story adorned the Supreme Court of the United States, early in the nineteenth century, has any member of the Supreme Court had much to say about natural law. Nevertheless, in recent decades a number of Supreme Court decisions seem to have been founded upon natural-law notions of a sort. I think, for instance, of the Warren Court's decision (the opinion written by Chief Justice Warren himself) that congressional districts within the several states must be so drawn in their boundaries as to contain so nearly as possible the same number of persons within the several districts-a matter previously left to the discretion of state legislatures. In part, this intervention was founded upon Jeremy Bentham's principle of one man, one vote; but also there seems to have lurked at the back of the minds of justices the notion that exact political equality, as told by numbers, somehow is "natural," whatever state and federal constitutions might prescribe and whatever the opinions of the Framers may have been. One might cite, too, the Court's decisions in the school desegregation cases. This question having been raised, let us examine how far we should appeal to natural law against statute and Constitution. Here we turn to an historical example and to the judgment of a leading American political and religious writer who endeavored to reconcile the claims of authority and the claims of freedom.
<p>
I refer to the "higher law" controversy of 1850 and to Orestes Brownson, the Catholic scholar and polemicist. In March 1850, on the floor of the United States Senate, William Henry Seward made his famous declaration that there exists "a higher law than the Constitution." He was referring to the Fugitive Slave Law and the Supreme Court. At once a hot controversy arose. In January 1851, Brownson published his review-essay entitled "The Higher Law," in which he refuted the claim of Seward, the Abolitionists, and the Free-Soilers to transcend the Constitution by appealing to a moral "higher law" during debate on the Fugitive Slave Bill.
<p>
Brownson agreed with Seward that 
<p><blockquote>
there is a higher law than the Constitution. The law of God is supreme, and overrides all human enactments, and every human enactment incompatible with it is null and void from the beginning, and cannot be obeyed with a good conscience, for "we must obey God rather than men." This is the great truth statesmen and lawyers are extremely prone to overlook, which the temporal authority not seldom practically denies, and on which the Church never fails to insist....
<P>
But the concession of the fact of a higher law than the Constitution does not of itself justify the appeal to it against the Constitution, either by Mr. Seward or the opponents of the Fugitive Slave Law. Mr. Seward had no right, while holding his seat in the Senate under the Constitution, to appeal to the higher law against the Constitution, because that was to deny the very authority by which he held his seat.... After having taken his oath to support the Constitution, the Senator had, so far as he was concerned, settled the question, and it was no longer for him an open question. In calling God to witness his determination to support the Constitution, he had called God to witness his conviction of the compatibility. If the Constitution with the law of God, and therefore left himself no plea for appealing from it to a higher law.
</blockquote><p>
We cannot be bound, Brownson continued, to obey a law that is in contravention of the law of God.
<p><blockquote>
This is the grand principle held by the old martyrs, and therefore they chose martyrdom rather than obedience to the state commanding them to act contrary to the Divine law. But who is to decide whether a special civil enactment be or be not repugnant to the law of God? Here is a grave and perplexing question for those who have no divinely authorized interpreter of the divine law.
</blockquote><p>
The Abolitionists and Free-Soilers, Brownson remarked, had adopted the Protestant principle of private judgment.
<p><blockquote>
But this places the individual above the state, and is wholly incompatible with the simplest conception of civil government. No civil government can exist, none is conceivable even, when every individual is free to disobey its orders whenever they do not happen to square with his private convictions of what is the law of God.
</blockquote><p>
The Church, Brownson writes, is the authoritative interpreter of the divine law. He reminds his readers that the state is ordained of God; but the state is not the supreme and infallible organ of God's will on earth.
<p><blockquote>
Now it is clear that Mr. Seward and his friends, the Abolitionists and the Free Soilers, have nothing to which they can appeal from the action of government but their private interpretation of the law of God, that is to say, their own private judgment or opinion as individuals; for it is notorious that they are good Protestants, holding the pretended right of private judgment, and rejecting all authoritative interpretation of the Divine law. To appeal from government to private judgment is to place private judgment above public authority, the individual above the state, which, as we have seen, is incompatible with the very existence of government, and therefore, since government is a divine ordinance, absolutely forbidden by the law of God-that very higher law invoked to justify resistance to civil enactments.... No man can ever be justifiable in resisting the civil law under the pretense that it is repugnant to the Divine law, when he has only his private judgment, or, what is the same thing, his private interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, to tell him what the Divine law is on the point in question, because the principle on which he would act in doing so would be repugnant to the very existence of government, and therefore in contravention of the ordinance, therefore of the law, of God.
</blockquote><p>
Brownson's argument-which we have not time enough to analyze in full today-in substance is this, in his own words: "Mr. Seward and his friends asserted a great and glorious principle, but misapplied it." It was not for them to utter commands in the name of God. Their claims, if carried far enough, would lead to anarchy. The arguments of some of their adversaries would lead to Statolatry, the worship of the state.
<p><blockquote>
The cry for liberty abolishes all loyalty, and destroys the principle and the spirit of obedience, while the usurpations of the state leave to conscience no freedom, to religion no independence. The state tramples on the spiritual prerogatives of the Church, assumes to itself the functions of schoolmaster and director of consciences, and the multitude clap their hands, and call it liberty and progress!
</blockquote><p>
Brownson advocated compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law, which clearly was constitutional; indeed, obligatory under Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution It was his hope to avert the Civil War which burst out ten years later. "Now there is a right and a wrong way of defending the truth, and it is always easier to defend the truth on sound than on unsound principles," he wrote. "If men were less blind and headstrong, they would see that the higher law can be asserted without any attack upon legitimate civil authority, and legitimate civil authority and the majesty of the law can be vindicated without asserting the absolute supremacy of the civil power, and falling into statolatry- as absurd a species of idolatry as the worship of sticks and stones."
<p>
Very possibly, ladies and gentlemen, you have found in these passages from "The Higher Law" and in Brownson's general argument various considerations highly relevant to our own era.
<p>
As Brownson remarks, the natural law (or law of God) and the American civil law are not ordinarily at swords' points. Large elements of natural law entered into the common law of England- and therefore into the common law of the United States-over the centuries; and the Roman law, so eminent in the science of jurisprudence, expresses the natural law enunciated by the Roman jurisconsults. No civilization ever has attempted to maintain the bed of justice by direct application of natural-law doctrines by magistrates; necessarily, it is by edict, rescript, and statute that any state keeps the peace through a system of courts. It simply will not do to maintain that private interpretation of natural law should be the means by which conflicting claims are settled.
<p>
Rather, natural law ought to help form the judgments of the persons who are lawmakers- whether emperors, kings, ecclesiastics, aristocratic republicans, or representatives of a democracy. The civil law should be shaped in conformity to the natural law-which originated, in Cicero's words, "before any written law existed or any state had been established."
<p>
It does not follow that judges should be permitted to push aside the Constitution, or statutory laws, in order to substitute their private interpretations of what the law of nature declares. To give the judiciary such power would be to establish what might be called an archonocracy, a domination of judges, supplanting the constitutional republic; also it surely would produce some curious and unsettling decisions, sweeping away precedent, which would be found highly distressing by friends to classical and Christian natural law. Only the Catholic Church, Brownson reasoned, has authority to interpret the laws of nature; but the Supreme Court of the United States, and the inferior federal courts, and our state courts, take no cognizance of papal encyclicals. Left to their several private judgments of what is "natural," some judges indubitably would do mischief to the person and the republic. The Supreme Court's majority decision in the case of Roe v. Wade-in which a pretended "right of privacy," previously unknown, was discovered-in actuality amounted to a declaration of the "natural right" of a mother to destroy her offspring.
<p>
Now it seems to me curiously naive to fancy that American courts always would subscribe to Thomistic concepts of the laws of nature, and abjure Jacobin doctrines of natural right. Courts of law must ordinarily accord with the general legislative authority; otherwise the Book of Judges is followed by the Book of Kings.
<p>
In the seventh edition of <i>The Conservative Mind,</i> I have written that the first canon of conservative thought is "Belief in a transcendent order, or body of natural law. Political problems, at bottom, are religious and moral problems. A narrow rationality, which Coleridge called the Understanding, cannot of itself satisfy human needs.... True politics is the art of apprehending and applying the Justice which ought to prevail in a community of souls."
<p>
Now Mr. Robert Bork, whose opinion as to the application of natural-law doctrines by members of the Supreme Court I have just now endorsed with some vigor, has taken notice of this. In an essay entitled "Natural Law and the Constitution," Mr. Bork advises my friend Mr. William Bentley Ball to abjure my exhortation of this sort. "The dictum also is inaccurate," Bork adds, "for it arbitrarily disqualifies as conservatives people who accept and struggle to preserve every conservative value but who do not believe that such values derive from a transcendent order." One might as well say, I suggest, that the Church ought not to emphasize the dogma of the Resurrection because that might alienate some people who are not Christians, but are possible well-wishers.
<p>
I have thought highly of Mr. Bork-although he seems to have no clear understanding of natural law and its function-but he appears to have thought lowly of me. Perhaps we both have been mistaken.
<p>
That federal judges, Mr. Bork included, have not been learned in the natural law is one of the educational misfortunes of our age. When the time is out of joint, we can repair to the teachings of Cicero and Aquinas and Hooker about the law of nature, in the hope that we may diminish man's inhumanity unto man. The natural law lacking, we may become so many Cains, and every man' s hand may be raised against every other man's.

     The word "justice" is on everyone's lips nowadays, and may
signify almost anything.  We hear the cry "Peace and Justice!"  from
folk who would destroy existing societies with fire and sword.  Other
folk fancy that perfect justice might readily be obtained by certain
financial rearrangements -- as if anything in this world ever could be
perfected.  One thinks of the observation of William James:  "So long
as one poor cockroach suffers the pangs of unrequited love, this world
will not be a moral world."  At the end of the twentieth century, the
liberal mentality demands justice for roaches, too.
<P>
     All confusion about the meaning of the word "justice"
notwithstanding, the latest edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica
contains no article under the heading "Justice."  Yet there is a
succinct article about justices of the peace, of whose number I once
was one, before the state of Michigan swept away that high office.  My
lecture today may be regarded as the attempt of a fool, rushing in
where the angelic Britannica fears to tread.  Yet possibly the nature
of justice may be apprehended by a mere quondam justice of the peace: 
for the fundamental purpose of law is to keep the peace.  "Justice is
the ligament which holds civilized beings and civilized nations
together," said Daniel Webster at the funeral of Justice Joseph Story,
in 1845; and so say I today.
<P>
     I propose in this series of four lectures to discuss first the
signification of this word "justice"; in my second lecture, to examine
natural law; in my third, to deal with criminal justice; in my
concluding lecture, to quarrel with certain notions of justice that
have been much puffed up during recent years.  In the twenty-first
century of the Christian era, will justice signify anything more than
the state's rigorous enforcement of its edicts?  Such questions I hope
to raise in your minds. 
<P>
<P>
      Nowadays, near the close of the twentieth century, moral and
political disorders bring grave confusion about the meanings of old
words.  As T.  S.  Eliot wrote in "Burnt Norton" -- 
Words strain,
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, Under the
     tension, slip, slide, perish, Decay with imprecision, will
     not stay in place, Will not stay still.  Shrieking voices
     Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering, Always assail them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     Conspicuous among such venerable words, in our era often abused
and misrepresented, is this necessary word justice.  Today I am
attempting to purify the dialect of the tribe -- to borrow another
phrase from my old friend Eliot, who endeavored lifelong to rescue
words from the clutch of the vulgarizer or of the ideologue.
<P>
     Permit me first to offer preliminary descriptions or definitions
of this word justice.  Jeremy Taylor, in the middle of the seventeenth
century, wrote that there exist two kinds of justice.  The one is
commutative justice, or reciprocal justice, expressed in Scripture
thus:  "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, even so do to
them."  In Taylor's words, "This is the measure...  of that justice
which supposes exchange of things profitable for things profitable,
that as I supply your need, you may supply mine; as I do a benefit to
you, I may receive one by you....  "
<P>
     The other kind is distributive justice, expressed in this passage
from Romans:  "Render to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is
due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor;
owe no man anything but to love one another."  Upon this Taylor
comments, "This justice is distinguished from the first, because the
obligation depends not upon contract or express bargain, but passes
upon us by some command of God, or of our superior, by nature or by
grace, by piety or religion, by trust or by office, according to that
commandment, 'As every man hath received the gift, so let him minister
the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of
God.'"
<P>
     But perhaps, ladies and gentlemen, I proceed too fast; I shall
have more to say a little later about the Christian concept of
justice.  Just now a little about the classical idea of justice.  The
classical definition, which comes to us through Plato, Aristotle,
Saint Ambrose, and Saint Augustine of Hippo, is expressed in a single
phrase:  suum cuique, or "to each his own."  As this is put in
Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis, "Justice is a habit whereby a man
renders to each one his due with constant and perpetual will." 
Aristotle instructs us that the prevalence of injustice makes clear
the meaning of justice.  Also Aristotle remarks that it is unjust to
treat unequal things equally -- a principle to which I shall return in
my later lectures.  Of the virtue called justice, Saint Augustine
declares, "Justice is that ordering of the soul by virtue of which it
comes to pass that we are no man's servant, but servants of God
alone."
<P>
     Upon such ancient postulates, classical or Christian, rests our
whole elaborate edifice of law here in these United States -- even
though few Americans know anything about the science of jurisprudence. 
For public order is founded upon moral order, and moral order arises
from religion -- a point upon which I mean to touch later in this talk
of mine.  If these venerable postulates are flouted or denied -- as
they have been denied by the Marxists in the present century, and were
denied by sophists in Plato's time -- then arbitrary power thrusts
justice aside, and "they shall take who have the power, and they shall
keep who can."
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
     All these brief definitions require explanation.  But for the
moment I pass on to the common understanding, the common sense, of the
meaning of justice.  All of us here present, I suppose, entertain some
notion of what justice signifies.  From what source do we obtain such
a concept?  Why, very commonly, from observation of a just man or a
just woman.  We begin by admiring someone -- he may be some famous
judge, or he may be an obscure neighbor -- who accords to every person
he encounters that person's due.  Just men, in short, establish the
norm of justice.  When I began to write my book The Conservative Mind,
I discovered that the abstraction "conservatism" amounts to a general
term descriptive of the beliefs and actions of certain eminent men and
women whom we call "conservative" because they have endeavored to
protect and nurture the Permanent Things in human existence.  So it is
with justice:  in large part, we learn the meaning of justice by
acquaintance with just persons.
<P>
     In the ancient world, the most just of men was Solon, Athens'
lawgiver, poet, and hero.  As Solon wrote of his reform of the
Athenian constitution -- 
<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Such power I gave the people as might do, Abridged not what
     they had, nor lavished new; Those that were great in wealth
     and high in place My counsel likewise kept from all
     disgrace.  Before them both I kept my shield of might, And
     let not either touch the other's right.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     To each class, that is, Solon gave its due, and so preserved the
peace:  that is social justice. 
<P>
     But we need not turn to the pages of Plutarch to discover just
men:  they are not an extinct species, though perhaps an endangered
one.  I think of my grandfather, Frank Pierce, a bank-manager in
Plymouth, twenty miles north of Detroit.  He was the leading man of
Lower Town (now called Old Town), near the railroad yards -- not
because he was either rich or charismatic, but because he was just. 
Justice, of course, is one of the cardinal virtues; and like the other
virtues, justice is said to be its own reward -- which is well, the
virtue of justice seldom earning material rewards.  When a member of
the town council, my grandfather refused to supply water free of
charge to the town's principal industrial plant, on the grounds that
if the factory couldn't pay water bills, who could?  For that offense,
the firm's president swore he would have Pierce discharged by the
bank; but the bank's president happening also to be a just man, my
grandfather's livelihood was not swept away.  My grandfather's counsel
was sought by everyone in the Lower Town who needed advice; and his
kindliness even moved him, on occasion, to extend interest-free
personal loans, from his own pocket, to young married couples who
could not meet the requirements for loans from the bank.  (His salary
was two hundred dollars a month.) I do not mean that he was
indiscriminately sentimental; not at all.  On the several occasions
when robbers invaded his branch bank, he successfully repelled them,
at great risk:  for the just man defends vigorously whatever is
entrusted to his charge, and sets his face against the lawless.  He
was just to children, too:  taking me on long walks, during which we
talked of everything under the sun, but rapping sharply on the dining-
room table when I waxed impudent at meals -- I immediately abashed and
repentant.  By watching this kindly paterfamilias, and listening to
what he said, I came to apprehend justice quite early.  For Frank
Pierce gave every man his due, without fear or favor.
<P>
     In every society, from the most primitive to the most decadent,
there are found some persons, like my grandfather, whom everyone
recognizes as just.  (Even bank-robbers and kidnappers -- for he was
kidnapped once by desperados -- remarked that Frank Pierce was a just
man.) From what source do such just men and women derive their habits
or principles of justice?
<P>
     Are they familiar with jurisprudential theories?  Only rarely: 
even most judges on the bench nowadays are not well grounded in the
philosophy of law.  My grandfather, who possessed a substantial
library -- perhaps the only library in Plymouth's Lower Town -- read
history, but not philosophy or law.
<P>
     Are their concepts of justice learnt in church?  Not so,
ordinarily.  My grandfather never attended church:  he came from a
family that began as Pilgrims to Massachusetts and gradually moved
through all the American stages of the dissidence of dissent.  He
never read the Bible at home.  He inherited Christian morals, but not
Christian faith in the transcendent.
<P>
     Do they create for themselves a rough-and-ready utilitarian
scheme for the administering of justice, founded principally upon
their private experience of the human condition?  Only infrequently, I
think; for most of them would subscribe to the maxim of Benjamin
Franklin, "Experience is a hard master, but fools will have no other."
<P>
     Well, then, how do just men and women apprehend the meaning of
justice?  From tradition, I maintain:  from habits and beliefs that
have long persisted within family and within local community. 
Aristophanes, contradicting Socrates, argued that virtue cannot be
taught in schools or by tutors:  rather, virtue inheres in old
families.  I believe that to be especially true of the cardinal virtue
called justice.  Or this tradition of justice, families and
communities aside, may become known through private reading, perhaps: 
anyone who attentively reads the great Victorian novelists, say,
cannot well escape absorbing, even if unaware of his acquisition,
principles of personal and social justice.  More obvious, if more rare
nowadays, is the influence of the Greek and Roman classics toward
forming an affection for justice.  Until well into the nineteenth
century, Cicero was studied in every decent school; and this passage
from that statesman-philosopher implanted an apprehension of the
nature of justice:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Law is the highest reason, implanted in nature, which
     commands what ought to be done and forbids the opposite. 
     This reason, when firmly fixed and fully developed in the
     human mind, is law.  And so they believe that law is
     intelligence, whose natural function it is to command right
     conduct and forbid wrongdoing.  They think that this quality
     has derived its name in Greek from the idea of granting to
     every man his own, and in our language I believe it has been
     named from the idea of choosing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
     In short, there exists a literary tradition expounding the idea
of justice.  The most recent popular example of this tradition is to
be found in an appendix to C.  S.  Lewis's little book The Abolition
of Man.  Therein Lewis sets side by side, drawn from various cultures,
illustrations of the Tao, or Natural Law.  He groups these precepts or
injunctions under eight headings:  the law of general beneficence; the
law of special beneficence; duties to parents, elders, ancestors;
duties to children and posterity; the law of justice; the law of good
faith and veracity; the law of mercy; the law of magnanimity. 
Everywhere in the world, in every age, Lewis is saying, wise men and
women have perceived the nature of justice and expressed that nature
in proverb, maxim, and injunction.
<P>
     At this point one may inquire, "Are you implying that just men
and women find in religious doctrines -- Hebraic, Christian, Moslem,
Hindu, Buddhist -- the fountains of justice?"  Yes, I am so reasoning. 
The sanction for justice will be found, ultimately, in religious
insights as to the human condition, and particularly in Revelation. 
Our so-called "Western" concepts of justice are derived from the
Decalogue, Platonic religious philosophy, and the teachings of the
Christ.  Somewhere there must exist an authority for beliefs about
justice; and the authority of merely human, and therefore fallible,
courts of law is insufficient to command popular assent and obedience.
<P>
     It does not follow, however, that all just men and women
recognize the ultimate source of ideas about justice, or appeal to
that ultimate source.  My grandfather never read a line that Saint
Thomas Aquinas wrote, though his understanding of justice accorded
well enough with what Aquinas expresses so convincingly in the Summa. 
To my grandfather the justice-concepts of the Hebraic and classical
and medieval cultures were transmitted through British and American
moral, legal, and literary traditions, and through long custom and
habit within his family and within the small-town American communities
where he had lived.  If pressed as to why he held a certain
understanding of the word "justice" -- indeed, he once compulsorily
engaged in a dialogue on that subject with a rather Nietzschean
desperado intent on persuading my grandfather to open his bank's safe
-- I suppose that Frank Pierce would have replied, "Because good men
always have so believed."  Securus judicat orbis terrarum, bonos non
esse qui se dividunt ab orbe terrarum in quacunque parte terrarum,
Saint Augustine of Hippo instructs us -- "The calm judgment of the
world is that those men cannot be good who, in any part of the world,
cut themselves off from the rest of the world."  The word justice
implies obligation to others, or to an Other.
<P>
     Thus far I have been describing the concept of justice that
prevailed in the Western world down to the closing years of the
eighteenth century.  Behind the phrase "to each his own" lay the
beliefs that divine wisdom has conferred upon man a distinct nature;
that human nature is constant; that the idea of justice is implanted
in the human consciousness by a transcendent power; and that the
general rule by which we endeavor to do justice is this:  "to each
man, the things that are his own."
<P>
     What is meant by this famous phrase?  To put the matter very
succinctly, the doctrine of suum cuique affirms that every man,
minding his own business, should receive the rewards which are
appropriate to his work and duties.  It takes for granted a society of
diversity, with various classes and interests.  It implies both
responsibility toward others and personal freedom.  It has been a
strong protection for private property, on a small scale or a great;
and a reinforcement, for Jews and Christians, of the Tenth
Commandment.  Through the Roman law, this doctrine of justice passed
into the legal codes of the European continent, and even into English
and American law.
<P>
     Injustice, according to this doctrine, occurs when men try to
undertake things for which they are not fitted, and to claim rewards
to which they are not entitled, and to deny to other men what really
belongs to those other men.  As Plato puts it, in The Republic, quite
as an unjust man is a being whose reason, will, and appetite are at
war one with another, so an unjust society is a state afflicted by
"meddlesomeness, and interference, and the rising up of a part of the
soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is
made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the
natural vassal -- what is all this confusion and delusion but
injustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every
form of vice?"
<P>
     Edmund Burke re-expressed this doctrine of "to each his own"
when, in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, he wrote of true
natural rights:  "Men have a right to the fruits of their industry,
and to the means of making their industry fruitful.  They have a right
to the acquisitions of their parents, to the nourishment and
improvement of their offspring, to instruction in life, and to
consolation in death.  Whatever each man can separately do, without
trespassing upon others, he has a right to do for himself; and he has
a right to all which society, with all its combinations of skill and
force, can do in his favor."
<P>
     And yet in Burke's own time, there arose a very different idea of
justice, the Utilitarian concept, expounded by Jeremy Bentham.  From
Bentham's jurisprudence there is descended the powerful present-day
school of legal thought that we call legal positivism or legal
realism.  Positivistic jurisprudence arose in alliance with
nineteenth-century nationalism and with scientific mechanism and
materialism.  To the legal positivist or realist, laws are the
commands of human beings merely.  There exists, for the positivist, no
necessary connections between law and morals, or between law as it is
and law as it ought to be.  The positivists' legal system is a closed,
logical system without need for referring to social aims, policies, or
moral standards.  So-called "moral judgments," to the positivists, are
"value judgments" merely:  and value judgments cannot be established
or defended by rational argument.  This positivistic understanding of
justice and law looms large in American courts today.
<P>
     But in this lecture I do not have time to analyze the strengths
and weaknesses of legal positivism.  For the present, I do no more
than to point out that nineteenth- and twentieth-century positivism
stands in harsh opposition to both the classical and the Christian
understanding of justice and law.  In Catholic universities, at least,
some defense still is offered of the Augustinian virtue of justice and
the venerable theory of natural law.
<P>
     It is my purpose in today's remarks to state the classical and
the Christian concept of justice, as opposed to the positivists'
denial of any source for justice except the commands of the sovereign
state.  And I will touch glancingly upon the connections among
religion, justice, and law.  (Justice and law are not identical,
though they may be closely related:  in a good commonwealth, law is an
attempt to maintain standards of justice, so far as that may be
achieved in a bent world.)
<P>
     All law is derived from the religious understanding -- that is,
all law in the traditional societies of the West; law in totalist
states is another matter entirely.  Moses came down from Horeb and did
justice upon criminous Israelites:  the prophet as lawgiver.  Solon
reformed the laws of Draco:  the religious poet as lawgiver.  When law
is divorced from the moral sanction of religious convictions,
presently the law is corrupted by passion, prejudice, private
interest, and misguided sentimentality.
<P>
     The church is concerned with the inner order:  the order of the
soul.  The state is concerned with the outer order:  the order of the
commonwealth.  Between state and church, nevertheless, relationships
are ineluctable.  Among these relationships is an understanding of
justice.
<P>
     Such relationships took shape in the West so early as the fifth
century of the Christian era.  We perceive them in the connections
between Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, and his friend Boniface, Count of
Africa.  In theory, all Christians of the West believe in separation
of church and state -- though sometimes that principle has been more
honored in the breach than in the observance.
<P>
     The church recognizes the necessary end of the state, and so
submits to the state's laws.  Because of human sinfulness, the Fathers
of the Church taught, the state is ordained of God.  As best it can,
the state restrains the three chief forms of lust:  cupidity, the lust
for possessions; the libido dominandi, the lust for power; and sexual
lust, the abuse of the gift of procreation.  When the state is
enfeebled, these lusts work the ruin of the person and the republic.
<P>
     So it is that the church, even in Roman imperial times, has
taught obedience to civil magistrates.  Saint Augustine reasoned that
the good citizen, the believing Christian, should obey every command
of the state, save one:  an order to worship false gods and to serve
Satan.
<P>
     Yet church and state have different ends, though both uphold
justice.  There runs through the history of Christianity the doctrine
of the two swords:  the church's sword of faith, the state's sword of
secular justice.
<P>
     Knowing that this earthly existence is not the be-all and end-
all, the church holds that perfect justice is in the power of God
alone, beyond the confines of time and space.  In this world here
below, we mete out justice as best we may.  Sometimes we err in our
administering of justice; it cannot well be otherwise; we are not
perfect or perfectible creatures.
<P>
     To apprehend the church's stand on mundane justice, it is
desirable to make distinctions between crime and sin.  A crime is an
act or omission which the law punishes on behalf of the state, whether
because that act or omission is expressly forbidden by statute, or
because it is so injurious to the public as to require punishment on
the ground of public policy.
<P>
     A sin is a transgression against moral law, with that law's
divine sanctions.  It is God, not the State, who punishes or forgives
sins.
<P>
     Not all sins are crimes.  We have it on the authority of Saint
Paul that the greatest of the theological virtues is charity. 
Therefore uncharitableness is a great sin; yet lack of charity is not
an offense at law.  A man may be all his life snarling, sneering,
contemptuous, envious, abominable in his language toward his wife, his
children, and others to whom he owes obligations -- that is, perfectly
uncharitable; yet he will run no risk of being haled before the bar of
criminal justice.  The uncharitable may be dealt with at the Last
Judgment.  But mundane courts of law do not touch the sinner unless
his sins result in violence or fraud or substantial damage to others. 
The state is unconcerned with sins unless they lead to breaches of the
peace, or menace the social order.  This separation of function
accords with the doctrine of the two swords.
<P>
     Quite as the state -- that is, the constitutional state -- does
not lay down religious dogmata in recent times, so the church does not
decree the laws of mundane justice, as expressed through courts of
law.  When the church has endeavored to impose its doctrines through
the operation of the state's criminal law, the church has erred.
<P>
     I have been speaking of orthodox Christian doctrine, interwoven
with principles of law in America, Britain, and many other countries
-- interwoven, that is, until recent decades.  But great confusion has
fallen upon us in these years near the end of the century. 
Increasingly, the state -- aye, the democratic state, too -- separates
itself from the religious understanding of the human condition.  And a
good many churchmen abandon Christian realism for a sentimental
humanitarianism.
<P>
     Let me remind you of the true signification of this word
"humanitarianism."  Properly defined -- and this is the definition one
still finds in the Oxford English Dictionary -- humanitarianism is the
doctrine that Jesus of Nazareth possessed a human nature merely, not
being divine; and, by extension, the doctrine that mankind may become
perfect without divine aid.  A humanitarian is a person totally
secularized in his convictions.  Yet erroneously many people use
"humanitarian" as a term of commendation.  "He was a great
humanitarian," they say of Albert Schweitzer.  That charitable and
heroic man, a professing Christian, would have rejected indignantly
that label.
<P>
     Now what has this distinction between humanitarianism and charity
to do with justice?  The point is this:  the humanitarian denies the
existence of sin, declaring that what we call "sins" are not moral
matters at all, resulting instead from circumstance, faulty rearing,
or social oppression.  In the view of the humanitarian, sins -- and
crimes, too -- are the work of "society"; and sinners and criminals
are victims, rather than unjust offenders.  Such reasoning is the
consequence of holding that man and society may be perfected through
mere alteration of social conditions, without the intervention of
divine grace.
<P>
     The humanitarian frequently proclaims his abhorrence of severe
punishments -- perhaps of any punishments.  Why?  First, because of
his illusion that no human being possesses the ability to make moral
choices.  Second, because of his horror of inflicting pain.  He leaves
no ultimate justice to God, because he fancies that no God exists. 
The mere preservation of one's comfortable earthly life is his
obsession, he fancying that man is not made for eternity.
<P>
     On the other hand, the humanitarian fulminates against those who
disagree with his principles.  Thus there occurs the phenomenon called
"the humanitarian with the guillotine."  (The recent French film
called Danton sufficiently illustrates this ferocious love of all
humankind.) As Edmund Burke put it, speaking of the humanitarian
Jacobins, men who today snatch the worst criminals from the hands of
justice tomorrow may approve the slaughter of whole classes. 
Humanitarian apologies in our own time for butchery by communist
revolutionaries sufficiently suggest the persistence of this curious
intolerant humanitarianism.  The ideologue need merely proclaim that
his object is universal happiness here below, and he is approved
uncritically by the humanitarian.  As Solovyev wrote, the banners of
the Anti-Christ will bear the legend, "Feed men, and then ask them of
virtue."
<P>
     In this disordered age, when it seems as if the fountains of the
great deep had been broken up, our urgent need is to restore a general
understanding of the classical and Christian teaching about justice. 
Without just men and women, egoism and appetite bring down a
civilization.  Without strong administration of justice by the state,
we all become so many Cains, every man's hand against every other
man's.  The humanitarian fancies himself zealous for the life impulse;
in reality, he would surrender us to the death impulse.  The
humanitarian's visions issue from between the delusory gates of ivory;
justice issues from between the gates of horn.
<P>
     Public instruction that ignores both our classical patrimony and
our religious patrimony may fail to rear up just men and women. 
Positivist jurisprudence that denies any moral order and any religious
sanction for justice may end in a general flouting of all law.  We
prate of "peace and justice" in a dissolving culture, without
apprehending tolerably the words we employ.  "Shrieking voices/
Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,/ Always assail them."  These
are the voices of the ideologue, the neurotic, and the nihilist,
pulling down the old understanding of Justice, "to each his own."
<P>
     "Justice is a certain rectitude of mind, whereby a man does what
he ought to do in the circumstances confronting him."  So Thomas
Aquinas instructs us.  At every college and university, the doctors of
the schools ought to inquire of themselves, "Do we impart such
rectitude of mind?  And if we do not, will there be tolerable private
or public order in the twenty-first century?"

<P>

      A few days past, my wife fell into casual conversation with
three medical men.  All three of the doctors were dismayed at the
present situation and future prospects of the American people, and,
unsolicited, expressed at some length their vaticinations.  A surgeon,
after remarking that on the imminent breadlines people would be armed
and fighting, claiming rights but denying duties, then groaned.  "It's
all over!  I thought we had more time!  We lasted only two hundred
years!"
<P>
      This mood of despondency is widespread today.  "Shine, perishing
Republic!"  in the line of Robinson Jeffers.  The parallel with Roman
decay is sufficiently obvious.  As the American economy staggers under
a burden of taxation that soon, we are promised -- under Clinton
Caesar -- will be increased, the federal government sends the Marines
to Somalia to take two million Somalis under our spread-eagle wings. 
It was thus the Romans occupied Greece, for the sake of the wayward
Greeks -- and never left Greece until the Greek cities were ruined in
the collapse of the whole Empire.  Whom the gods wish to destroy, they
first make mad.
<P>
      Yesteryear's great expectations are blasted.  For the first
time, a great many Americans suspect that America's culture is
decadent.  Some of them seem well content with the sickness of our old
culture.  "What do you mean by 'culture?'  the Governor of New York
exclaimed four months ago.  "That's a word they used in Nazi Germany." 
This uncultured and unscrupulous demagogue is mentioned by President-
elect Clinton as a praiseworthy future associate justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States.  When such persons are elevated to
great power in the Republic, indeed there exists reason to raise the
question of social decadence.
<P>
      Defining Culture.  There has appeared a spate of books about the
present "Culture War."  And much obloquy is cast upon the so-called
"cultural elite" of the United States.  Succinctly, how may we define
this "culture" that has grown controversial?  In my newest book,
America's British Culture, published this week by the sociological
firm of Transaction, I examine at length such definitions; but for the
present, let us take a definition by Christopher Dawson, the great
historian of culture, whose works, in twenty-two volumes, I have begun
to edit in a uniform edition, at the request of the Homeland
Foundation.  Here, extracted from Dawson's first book, The Age of the
Gods (1928), is that definition:
<P>
 <UL> A culture is a common way of life -- a particular
      adjustment of man to his natural surroundings and his
      economic needs....  And just as every natural region tends
      to possess its characteristic forms of animal and vegetable
      life, so too will it possess its own type of human
      society....   The higher culture will express itself
      through its material circumstance, as masterfully and
      triumphantly as the artist through the medium of his
      material.</UL>
<P>
      Just so.  Our American culture, derived in large part from
centuries of British culture, has grown in this continent to a
tremendous civilization; President Bush takes pride in the fact that
America is now the only superpower.  Pride goeth before a fall.  That
is why I am conversing with you on the subject of whether this
civilization of ours may endure during the twenty-first century of the
Christian era.  What, if anything, may you and I do to renew this
shaken culture of ours?
<P>
      In my preceding three lectures, I dealt with three menaces to
the survival of our civilization:  first, the fraud called
multiculturalism, which is a device to pull down the inherited culture
of these United States; second, the endeavor of militant secular
humanists to undermine the religious heritage of the American people;
third, the ideology called democratism, the heresy of democracy, which
proclaims that one man is as good as another (or perhaps a little
better), and that the voice of the abstract People is the voice of
God.  Of course these movements or attitudes are not the only reasons
why our civilization appears to be in the sere and yellow leaf, but
they are of fairly recent origin and constitute a clear and present
danger.  How may you and I contend with a tolerable hope against these
forces, thus shoring up the footing of the edifice of the American
common way of life?
<P>
      Well, before we endeavor to prescribe remedies, we need to
ascertain the causes of our difficulties.  We must remind ourselves,
to begin, that culture arises from the cult:  out of the religious
bond and the sense of the sacred grow any civilization's agriculture,
its common defense, its orderly towns, its ingenious architecture, its
literature, its music, its visual arts, its law, its political
structure, its educational apparatus, and its mores.  Christopher
Dawson, Eric Voegelin, and other historians of this century have made
this historical truth clear.
<P>
      Decay of the Cult.  Modern society's gravest afflictions,
conversely, are caused by the decay of the cult upon which a society
has been founded, or by the sharp separation of the trappings of a
sophisticated civilization from the nurturing cult, with its glimpse
of the transcendent.  Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in his Templeton Address
at London, put this plainly enough:
<P>
 <UL> Our life consists not in the pursuit of material success
      but in the quest of worthy spiritual growth.
<P>
      Our entire earthly existence is but a transition stage in
      the movement toward something higher, and we must not
      stumble or fall, nor must we linger fruitlessly on one rung
      of the ladder....   The laws of physics and physiology will
      never reveal the indisputable manner in which The Creator
      constantly, day in and day out, participates in the life of
      each of us, unfailingly granting us the energy of
      existence; when this assistance leaves us, we die.  In the
      life of our entire planet, the Divine Spirit moves with no
      less force; this we must grasp in our dark and terrible
      hour.</UL>
<P>
      Thus it should be understood that the ideology of secular
humanism, the ideology of democratism, and the ideology of negritude
that lies behind professed "multiculturalism," all are assaults upon a
common way of life that has developed out of Christian insights -- or,
if you will, Judeo-Christian insights -- into the human condition. 
Ideology always is the enemy of religion, and endeavors to supplant
its adversary among humankind.  But ideology has been unable to
produce a counter-culture that endures long -- witness the collapse of
the Soviet Union after seven decades of power.
<P>
      The relationship between religious faith and a high culture,
described here by Solzhenitsyn, has been denied or ignored by the
intellectuals, although not forgotten by the humble.  At the beginning
of his Templeton Address, Solzhenitsyn made that point.  "Over half a
century ago, while I was still a child," Solzhenitsyn said, "I recall
hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for
the great disasters that had befallen Russia. ' Men have forgotten
God; that's why all this has happened.'"  They were right, and so are
their counterparts in the United States today.
<P>
      About eight years ago, the Brookings Institution published a
careful study by James Reichley, entitled Religion in American Public
Life.  In a chapter entitled "Religion, Politics, and Human Values,"
Mr.  Reichley examined eight value-systems, and found only one of
those sufficient to balance individual rights against social
authority, so bringing about harmony in a culture.  That one value-
system he called "theist-humanism":  most people recognize it as
Christianity, in Reichley's description.  It is only a renewed sense
of the sacred, I am suggesting -- by a return to Christian
understanding of the human condition and its limitations, I am
suggesting, that the American nation may withstand the designs of
ideology and restore those common ways of life that we call America's
culture.
<P>
                         

      The governor of Mississippi has been reproached for declaring
that America is a Christian nation.  Despite objections, he was quite
right; his opponents seem not to understand the meaning of the word
"nation," except as it is incorrectly employed by the daily
journalist.  True, the United States of America is not a Christian
state, for the country's Constitution forbids the establishment of a
national church by Congress, and stands tolerant of all religions. 
But the words state and nation signify different concepts.  "State"
means the governmental organization of a country, political society
with sovereign power; while "nation" means the people of the land,
with their culture -- and not merely the people who are living just
now, but also their ancestors and those who will descend from them: 
that is, a nation is extended in time and shares a culture:  those
participants in a common culture who are living today, and the
participants in that culture who have preceded them in time, and those
participants in the common culture who are yet to be born.  One might
call a nation a community of souls.
<P>
      In that proper understanding of what a nation amounts to, the
American nation is Christian, although more Christian formerly,
perhaps, than it is just now.  For Christianity, if sometimes in a
diluted form, is the religion of the majority of Americans nowadays;
and beyond church communicants, there are millions of Americans who do
not attend churches, but nevertheless are strongly influenced by
Christian morals; moreover nearly else who has lived long in the
United States, though he be Jew or Moslem or agnostic, conforms in
large degree to American folkways and customs and conventions that are
Christian in origin:  in short, the American culture, with its
Christian roots, is everywhere dominant in these United States, among
the larger "minorities" of the population as well as among Americans
of European descent; that is, the Christian ethos is no less strong
among blacks and persons of Latin-American descent than among
Americans who can trace their descent in this country back to the
seventeenth century.
<P>
      So the Governor of Mississippi is quite right:  America is a
Christian nation; this is a matter of fact, not of opinion.  Whether
America will remain a Christian nation is matter for argument,
perhaps:  the creation of special rights for pathics, for instance,
indicates that Christian morals are going by the board; and the
prevalence of abortion, the deliberate destruction of one's offspring,
is another suggestion that both Christian belief and Christian morals
have begun to succumb to total religious indifference, if not yet to
atheism.  But if Christian faith and morals will be generally rejected
by the coming of the twenty-first century, then probably the whole
culture will disintegrate, the material culture as well as the
intellectual and moral culture; and human existence here will become
poor, nasty, brutish, and short:  unless some quite new culture, which
as yet nobody can imagine, should rise up.  Any such unnameable
innovative culture, to endure, would require some transcendent
sanction, perhaps some theophanic event -- something more enduring
than mere Marxist ideology, which was a violent attempt at a new faith
and a new culture.
<P>
      Why have an increasing number of Americans endeavored to break
with our inherited culture and its religious roots?  The reasons are
diverse; but the fundamental impulse to reject a religious patrimony
is expressed by T.  S.  Eliot in his choruses for "The Rock,"
especially in the following lines:
<P>
 <UL> Why should men love the Church?  Why should they love her laws?<BR>
      She tells them of Life and Death, and of all that they would
         forget.<BR>
      She is tender where they would be hard, and hard where they like
         to be soft.<BR>
      She tells them of Evil and Sin, and other unpleasant facts.<BR>
      They constantly try to escape<BR>
      From the darkness outside and within<BR>
      By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be
         good.</UL>
<P>
      Religion restrains the passions and the appetites:  and sensate
natures flout restraints.  The more perverse the pleasure, the more it
is sought by some.  So it is that public funds have been employed
recently to subsidize obscene representations of Jesus of Nazareth;
this seems to some titillatingly smart.  I find it odd that, so far as
I know, nobody has compared these "works of art" to the obscene
representations of Jews in which Joseph Goebbels and his colleagues
rejoiced during the regime of Hitler. 
<P>
      Religious Renewal. I have been suggesting, ladies and gentlemen,
that for our culture -- our inherited ways of life that have nurtured
our American society in the past -- to be reinvigorated, a renewal of
religious faith is required.  So long as many of us deny the dignity
of man and indulge what T.  S.  Eliot called "the diabolic
imagination," our culture limps downward.  Our public schools, almost
totally secularized, starve the religious imagination; federal and
state courts often tend to frown upon Christian morals and churches'
claims to independence.  Will a time arrive when religion is indulged
by public authorities only on sufferance?
<P>
      What can be done to restore the religious imagination within our
common culture?  One cannot look to many seminaries for such a
vigorous work of renewal:  most of those institutions are pursuing
theological or quasi-theological novelties, and are caught up in the
humanitarian spirit of the age.  No one can sincerely embrace a
religious creed merely because it might be socially beneficial to do
so.  Conceivably some great preacher or great novelist or great poet
may move minds and hearts toward the transcendent again, opening eyes
that had been sealed; there come to mind the examples of John Wesley
in eighteenth-century England, Chateaubriand in France at the end of
the French Revolution, T.  S.  Eliot in this century.  Or possibly men
of the natural sciences may come to perceive design in the universe,
purpose in mutations.  Or, as in ages past, we may be given a Sign.
<P>
      Some people, after the fashion of T.  S.  Eliot, may turn toward
Christianity once they have discovered how unendurable a place the
twentieth-century world would become were that faith altogether
lacking.  Others, myself among them, may come from much reading and
meditation to conclude that Augustine of Hippo and Sir Thomas Browne
and Samuel Johnson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge and John Henry Newman,
professed Christians and apologists too, were no fools.  Whether
enough such persons may take up the cause of Christian teaching to
alter the spirit of the age -- why, who can tell?  C.S.  Lewis and
Malcolm Muggeridge succeeded in moving intellects and consciences, and
a half-dozen American writers continue to do so among us today.  By
the way, I particularly commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, a new
book by William Kirk Kilpatrick, Why Johnny Can't Tell Right from
Wrong:  Moral Illiteracy and the Case for Character Education.  Say
not the struggle naught availeth:  this earnest book very effectively
exposes the mischief being done by those educators who in Britain are
called "the crazies."  At one American gathering of that educationist
clan, hard haters of old moral principles, all the major religions of
the world were dismissed as "male chauvinist murder cults."

<P>

      Short of a mighty reinvigoration of the religious imagination,
what may you and I do to redeem the time?
<P>
      Confining ourselves to the three causes of cultural decadence
that I discussed in my three previous lectures, I declare that we can
do much, in a practical way.
<P>
      With respect to multiculturalism, it is entirely possible to
resist this silly, malign movement, despite its temporary successes,
and to begin to restore a decent curriculum to schools, colleges, and
universities; if we succeed, nine-tenths of the students will bless
us.  At the University of Texas, recently, the multicultural program
was opposed by a majority of the faculty in a secret ballot; and the
university's president resigned in consequence, praise be.  A little
more courage on the part of college administrators and professors
would undo this anti-cultural tyranny.  And yet the advantages still
lies with the aggressors.  At one Michigan college, this year, black
militant students engaged in wild demonstrations.  Far from
disciplining the student offenders, the woman president of the college
ordered two or three members of the faculty to undergo sensitivity
training, so that they would learn to be sufficiently servile to
militant students.  A mad world, my masters!  Let us prod some
university presidents and trustees into defense of true academic
freedom.
<P>
      With respect to the assaults upon religious belief, which has
been the source of all high culture over the ages, it is high time for
us to oppose most strenuously those governmental policies which
discriminate against religion and received morality.  In New York
City, very recently, Dr.  Russell Hittinger, a redoubtable learned
champion of the doctrines of natural law, issued from the platform a
virtual call to arms against the enemies of moral order -- some of
them entrenched behind the federal bench.  Let us remember that not
even the Supreme Court of the United States is endowed with arbitrary
and absolute power:  Congress, if it so chooses may remove from the
Court's appellate jurisdiction certain categories of cases, and in
other ways may remind the judiciary that it is not a constitutional
archonocracy.  But I leave to your ingenuity, ladies and gentlemen,
the devising of ways to resist and even to intimidate those zealots
for the abolition of all restraint upon sensual impulse.
<P>
      In connection with this possible restoration of the religious
imagination, it is of the first importance to bring about more choice
in education at every level -- so that those parents and others who
would have their children obtain religious knowledge may be enabled to
do so.  The national administration of President Bush gave at least
lip-service to this cause:  and more than ever before, there exists a
possibility of persuading state legislators to pass such measures. 
<P>
      Third, I urge you friends, to resist manfully and womanfully the
thoughtless centralization of political and economic power.  Not
content with having reduced the several American states, nominally
sovereign, to impotent provinces, America's centralizers, with their
dream of a New World Order, have commenced to acquire provinces
overseas -- Somalia the first in this decade, perhaps.  "Take up the
white man's burden," certain liberal voices exhort us.  One can
imagine the nightmare of a universal domination of egalitarian
"democratic capitalism" directed by the Washington bureaucracy --
unimaginative, arrogant, everywhere resented in the twenty-first
century -- draining America's resources and energies as Rome was
drained by her empire.  The more centralization, the less freedom and
the less energy.
<P>
      Is this the manifest destiny of the United States to become the
New Rome?  Have you and I no choice about that?  Nay, not so.  In
1795, a dread year for Britain, old Edmund Burke, in his first Letter
on a Regicide Peace, denied that great states have to obey some
irresistible law of progress or decay; Burke set his face against the
attitude now called "determinism."  Permit me to quote a key passage:
<P>
 <UL> It is often impossible, in these political inquiries, to
      find any proportion between the apparent causes we may
      assign, and their known operation.  We are therefore
      obliged to deliver up that operation to mere chance; or,
      more piously (perhaps more rationally), to the occasional
      interposition and the irresistible hand of the Great
      Disposer.  We have seen states of considerable duration,
      for which ages have remained nearly as they have begun, and
      could hardly be said to ebb or flow.  The meridian of some
      has been most splendid.  Others, and they the greatest
      number, have fluctuated, and experienced at different
      periods of their existence a great variety of fortune.  At
      the very moment when some of them seem plunged in
      unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster, they have
      begun a new course, and opened a new reckoning, and even in
      the depths of their calamity, and on the very ruins of
      their country, have laid the foundations of a towering and
      durable greatness.  All this happened without any apparent
      previous change in the general circumstances which had
      brought on their distress.  The death of a man at a
      critical juncture, his retreat, have brought innumerable
      calamities on a whole nation.  A common soldier, a child, a
      girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of
      fortune, and almost of Nature.</UL>
<P>
      In those two sentences, Burke may refer to the reverses of
Pericles, to the death of the Constable of Bourbon and other startling
historical instances of a country's fate hanging upon a single life. 
His common soldier is Arnold of Winkelreid, who flung himself upon the
Austrian lances at Sempach; his child is Hannibal, taking at the age
of twelve his oath to make undying war upon Rome; his girl at the inn
is Joan of Arc.  Providence, chance, or strong wills, Burke declares,
abruptly may alter the whole apparent direction of "that armed ghost,
the meaning of history" (Gabriel Marcel's phrase).
<P>
      Even such as you and I, my friends, if we are resolute enough
and sufficiently imaginative, may alter the present course of events. 
God, we have been told, helps those who help themselves.  In the face
of increasing tribulations, sometimes conservatives and liberals are
making common cause in the defense of America's culture.  Both Arthur
M.  Schlesinger, Jr., and your servant have written books in
repudiation of multiculturalism.  Once more, say not the struggle
naught availeth.  A great number of the American people already have
taken alarm at the drift of policy and morality in this land. 
Reactions may be salutary:  as the poet Roy Campbell used to say, a
human body that cannot react is a corpse; and so it is with society. 
Up the reactionaries against decadence!
<P>
      Permit me, in conclusion, to quote a heartening passage from a
book, Our Present Discontents, published in 1919, a year in some
respects like the year 1992.  The author was William Ralph Inge, then
Dean of St.  Paul's in London, commonly described by journalists as
"the Gloomy Dean."  The passage I offer you, however, is one of hope:
<P>
       <UL> There may be in progress a store of beneficent forces
      which we cannot see, There are ages of sowing and ages of
      reaping; the brilliant epochs may be those in which
      spiritual wealth is squandered; the epochs of apparent
      decline may be those in which the race is recuperating
      after an exhausting effort.  To all appearances, man still
      has a great part of his long lease before him, and there is
      no reason to suppose that the future will be less
      productive of moral and spiritual triumphs than the past. 
      The source of all good is like an inexhaustible river; the
      Creator pours forth new treasures of goodness, truth, and
      beauty for all who will love them and take them, "Nothing
      that truly is can ever perish," as Plotinus says; whatever
      has value in God's sight is for evermore.  Our half-real
      world is the factory of souls in which we are tried as in a
      furnace.  We are not to set our hopes upon it, but learn
      such wisdom as it can teach us while we pass through it.</UL>
<P>
       America has overcome the ideological culture of the Union of
Socialist Soviet Republics.  In the decade of this victory, are
Americans to forswear the beneficent culture that they have inherited? 
For a civilization to arise and flower, centuries are required; but
the indifference or the hostility of a single generation may suffice
to work that civilization's ruin.  We must confront the folk whom
Arnold Toynbee called "the internal proletariat" as contrasted with
the "external proletariat" from alien lands.  Otherwise we may end,
all of us, as fellow-proletarians, culturally deprived, in a nation
that will permit no one to rise above mediocrity.

<P>
This year's series of Heritage Lectures is concerned with the somewhat pressing question of whether our American culture will survive the tribulations of our age. In the two previous lectures, I have discussed the ideology called "multiculturalism" as a menace; and whether a civilization that lacks belief in a religion can endure. In my final lecture, in December, I mean to talk about means for combating cultural decay. Today I have chosen for my subject the degradation of the democratic dogma.
<p>
I take my title from the writings of Henry and Brooks Adams. They found American democracy in process of degradation more than a century ago. The decay of the American Presidency from George Washington to Ulysses S. Grant, Henry Adams remarked, refuted altogether Darwin's theory of evolution. To a similar thesis I shall return presently.
<p>
But first, indulge me in some observations concerning the present condition of what is called "democracy" near the close of the 20th century. We are informed by certain voices that soon all the world will be democratic. But whether or not, the American mode of democratic government prevails, the abstract ideology called <i>democratism</i> that any government which has obtained a majority of votes be received as "democratic." Enthusiasts for unrestricted democracy presumably forget that Adolph Hitler, too, was democratically elected and sustained by popular plebiscites. Alexis de Tocqueville warned his contemporaries against "democratic despotism," 20th century writers discuss "totalist democracy."
<p>
I am suggesting, ladies and gentlemen, that <i>democracy</i>-literally, "the rule of the crowd"-is a term so broad and vague as to signify everything or nothing. The American democracy, a unique growth although an offshoot from British culture, innocent of ideology's fury-functioned fairly well in the past because of peculiar beliefs and conditions: a patrimony of ordered freedom, and especially, as Tocqueville pointed out, Americans' <i>mores,</i> or moral habits. What is called "democracy" today in most of the world-and nearly every regime represents itself as democratic-bears much resemblance to America's political and social pattern as the oar of the boat does to the ore of the mine. All that these regimes maintain in common is a claim that they rule with the assent of the majority of the people. The tyranny of the majority can be more oppressive, and more effectual, than the tyranny of a single person.
<p>
<b>Not Readily Transplanted.</b> Neoconservatives' demands nowadays that all the world be thoroughly democratized overnight remind me strongly of a similar enthusiasm not long after the end of the Second World War. Gentlemen such as Chester Bowles then proclaimed that Africa, liberated from European domination, promptly would rejoice in an array of democracies on the American model. The United States took measures, then and later, to accelerate this happy progress economic restraints upon trade of one sort or another with Portugal, Rhodesia, and latterly the Republic of South Africa. We all know, of course, how blissfully democratic Angola, Mozambique, Guinea, and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) are today; while South Africa's peoples, thanks to the beneficence of American and European liberals, enjoy the prospect of civil war in emulation of what occurred in the Congo three decades ago. America's democracy is not readily transplanted overseas. If anybody emerges alive from the present agony in Somalia, will a peaceful democracy, told by the nose, soon come to pass there? Was the ejection, after the Second World War, of the Italian government from part of Somaliland, and the withdrawal of the British administrators from another portion of that territory, a victory for democracy in Africa? Ask the Somali dead.
<p>
My point is this: Merely to shout the word <i>democracy</i> is not to bring into being a society endowed with order, justice, and freedom. Those blessings grow but slowly, and by good nurture. The roots of the American democratic republic run back through hundreds of years of American, British, and European experience. While we prate about exporting American democracy to Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia-although, as Daniel Boorstin has written, "the American Constitution is not for export"-our own political institutions seem to be crumbling. We may sink into the Latin American brand of democracy, class against class, the economy periodically ruined by inflation, with a semblance of order restored from time to time by the military.
<p>
<b>Recalling 1929. </b>Sinclair Lewis, late in life, wrote an implausible novel <i>It Can' t Happen Here</i>-a fictional affirmation that a fascist regime might be established in the United States; the book was published in 1935. The novel was more comical than convincing; but it does not follow that the American democratic republic will endure for eternity, as Rome was supposed to last. I may be one of the very few persons present today who remembers clearly the events of the American experience between, and including, the years 1929 and 1933. I find America's social and economic and political circumstances today markedly similar to those of that tumultuous era. Changes still larger than those worked by Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal may come to pass during the next four years, say. Economically, the position of the United States is more precarious than it was in 1929: our national debt is astronomical in quantity; personal (family) debt, on the average, is more than four-fifths of a family's annual income; the apparatus of credit is vastly overexpanded; and taxes begin to be crushing. In certain of our cities, ferocious riots far exceed in magnitude the disorders of 1929- 1933, and after: those riots really are proletarian risings. This is a time in which, in Yeats's lines, "The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity."
<p>
In 1957, at Bruges, during a conference on Atlandc community, I met Amaury de Riencourt, the author of a book entitled <i>The Coming Caesars,</i> published that year, the book was very widely discussed then, but now is forgotten. Unless measures of restraint should be taken, Riencourt wrote-and taken promptly-the United States would fall under the domination of 20th century Caesars. Riencourt argued:
<p><blockquote>
Caesarism is not dictatorship, not the result of one man's overriding ambition; not a brutal seizure of power through revolution. It is not based on a specific doctrine or philosophy. It is essentially pragmatic and untheoretical. It is a slow, often century-old, unconscious development that ends in a voluntary surrender of a free people escaping from freedom to one autocratic master....
<P>
Political power in the Western world has become increasingly concentrated in the United States, and in the office of the President within America. The power and prestige of the President have grown with the growth of America and of democracy within America, with the multiplication of economic, political, and military emergencies, with the necessity of ruling what is virtually becoming an American empire-the universal state of a Western civilization at bay....
<P>
Caesarism can come to America constitutionally, without having to alter or break down any existing institution. The White House is already the seat of the most powerful tribunician authority ever known to history. All it needs is amplification and extension. Caesarism in America does not have to challenge the Constitution as in Rome or engage in civil warfare and cross any fateful Rubicon. It can slip in quite naturally, discreetly, through constitutional channels.
</blockquote><p>
Just so. Caesarism slipped into the White House constitutionally, if not naturally, with the murder of President Kennedy in 1963. The plebiscitary democracy would elect Lyndon Johnson President in 1964; but Johnson's military failure would undo him, despite his panem et circenses; and a rebellious senator would strip him of the purple. If Caesars do not win their battles, they fall. In this, although not in much else, perhaps it was as well that the war in Vietnam was lost.
<p>
On a wall of my library hangs a photograph of myself with President Johnson; both of us are smiling; it is well to be civil to Caesar. It might be thought that Russell Kirk would not have been eager to visit Caesar in the Oval office of the Imperial Mansion; indeed I was not. But, in collaboration with James McClellan, I had written not long before a biography of Robert Taft; Johnson, as a senatorial colleague, had delivered a funeral eulogy of the famous Republican; and so I was induced by the patroness of the Robert A. Taft Institute of Government to present the President with a copy of the book, at a little White House ceremony.
<p>
<b>A Visit to Caesar.</b> Present for that occasion in the Oval Office were two Democratic Senators who had been on good terms with Senator Taft-Byrd of Virginia and Tydings of Maryland. Lyndon Johnson towered tall and masterful, clearly a bad man to have for an adversary. The Taft book was presented, and the President exchanged some brief remarks with me; photographs were taken while my irrepressible wife strolled behind the presidential desk, examining photographs of Lady Bird, Lynda Bird, and other folk at the ranch.
<p>
True to his reputation if to naught else, President Johnson wheeled and dealt with Senator Byrd and Senator Tydings the while. He knew me for a syndicated columnist, but surely never had opened any of my books. "Stay in school! Stay in school!" Johnson had shouted, over television, to the rising generation. Yet this Caesar had no need of books; he had been the vainglorious disciple of Experience, that famous master of fools.
<p>
No, Johnson did not open books: with Septimius Severus, he might have said, "Pay the soldiers; the rest do not matter." Had he not Robert McNamara, creator of the Edsel, to counsel him? Power was all, and surely the power of the United States, under Johnson's hand, was infinite. All the way with LBJ! There came into my head, in the Oval Office, a passage from Amaury de Riencourt:
<p><blockquote>
With Caesarism and Civilization, the great struggles between political parties are no longer concerned with principles, programs and ideologies, but with men. Marius, Sulla, Cato, Brutus still fought for principles. But now, everything became personalized. Under Augustus, parties still existed, but there were no more Optimates or Populares. No more conservatives or democrats. Men campaigned for or against Tiberius or Drusus or Caius Caesar. No one believed any more in the efficacy of ideas, political panaceas, doctrines, or systems, just as the Greeks had given up building great philosophic systems generations before. Abstractions, ideas, and philosophies were rejected to the periphery of their lives and of the empire, to the East where Jews, agnostics, Christians, and Mithraists attempted to conquer the world of souls and minds while the Caesars ruled their material existence.
</blockquote><p>

All the way with LBJ! <i>Ave atque vale!</i>
<p>
<b>Consequences of Hubris.</b> Every inch a Caesar LBJ looked; he might have sat for Michelangelo for the carving of a statue of a barracks emperor. Experience, nevertheless, had not taught this imperator how to fight a war. To fancy that hundreds of thousands of fanatic guerrillas and North Vietnamese regulars, supplied by Russia and China, might be defeated by military operations merely defensive-plus a great deal of bombing from the air, destroying civilians chiefly, that bombing pinpointed by Johnson himself in the White House! The American troops in Vietnam fought admirably well-how well, my old friend General S. L. A. Marshall described unforgettably in his books-but their situation was untenable. "Imagination rules mankind," Bonaparte had said-Napoleon, master of the big battalions. Had Johnson possessed any imagination, he would have sealed Haiphong, as Nixon did later. Only so might the war have been won.
<p>
Afflicted by <i>hubris,</i> Johnson Caesar piled the tremendous cost of the war-a small item was the immense quantity of milk flown daily from San Francisco to Vietnam, American troops not campaigning on handfuls of rice-upon the staggering cost of his enlargement of the welfare state at home. One might have thought he could not do sums. He ruined the dollar and bequeathed to the nation an incomprehensible national debt. Both guns and butter! It had been swords and liturgies with earlier emperors.
<p>
It is with variations that history repeats itself. Ignoring history, LBJ was condemned to repeat it.
<p>
Morally, he was the worst man ever to make himself master of the White House. The corrupt antics of Bobby Baker and Billie Sol Estes did not bring him down, although he had been intimately connected with both.
<p>
In June 1961, an agent of the Department of Agriculture, Henry Marshall, had been found shot to death in Texas. Marshall had been about to expose the criminal wheeling and dealing of Billie Sol Estes, and in that wheeling and dealing Lyndon Johnson, then Vice-President, had participated. A justice of the peace declared the murder of Marshall to have been suicide.
<p>
But in March 1984, a grand jury in Robertson County would look into the mystery. A federal marshal and Billie Sol Estes would certify before that jury. Estes, under immunity, swore that the killing had been decided upon at a meeting at Vice-President Johnson's Washington residence; Johnson had given the order and directed a hanger-on of his, Malcolm Wallace, to execute it. The grand jury believed Estes, it appears, and concluded that Marshall's death had been a homicide. No one was indicted, for the grand jury presumed that the murderers already were dead.
<p>
Such frequently is the way of Caesars. Like some other Caesars, Johnson, from small beginnings, accumulated while in public office a large fortune. No one ever accused him of the vice of scrupulosity. An ill man to deal with, Lyndon Baines Johnson.
<p>
Yet Eugene the Poet, Eugene the Giant-Killer, would fetch Caesar down. I do not think that Eugene McCarthy would have converted himself into a Caesar; nay, American conservatives might have been better content with President McCarthy than they would become with President Bush or will be with President Clinton.
<p>
<b>Politics of the Absurd.</b> For the past several months, the American people endured the least edifying of presidential campaigns. No one of the three gentlemen who aspired to the presidential office commanded much respect, and their debates were more concerned with trivia and intemperate accusations than with the great and most difficult public decisions that must be made very soon. The feeblest of the three candidates proposed to refer all of those decisions to the electorate at large, by electronic means of polling-as if every American voter were able and eager to express a considered judgment on what courses should be undertaken in the conduct of foreign policy, on how the national debt should be reduced, on how civil disorders should be averted, on what to do about the American proletariat, on the improvement of public schooling, on the allocation of priorities in public expenditure, on the afflictions of centralization and bureaucracy, on the question of immigration, on the modes of averting an economic collapse on the scale of what occurred in 1929-on these and innumerable other public issues, it is proposed that we take a hasty popular poll! That way lies democratic madness. Why bother with statesmen? Surely the typical American voter is omniscient. We have entered upon the politics of the absurd.
<p>
This year's three presidential aspirants seemed absurd to a great multitude of citizens. How had they been selected for candidacy? Mr. Perot selected himself, soon withdrew (but not from modesty), and then selected himself afresh. Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton were selected chiefly by primary campaigns, the results of which were determined chiefly by the amount of money they were able to spend, respectively, on television advertising. In the case of President Bush, his being an incumbent of the office, with large benefactions to bestow, saved the day for him. I was general chairman of the Buchanan campaign in Michigan. We Buchanan backers had only ten thousand dollars to spend; while the Bush people spent half a million dollars in Michigan. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi;</i> to them that hath shall be given. Certain Roman Caesars bought the imperial purple. Increasingly, our presidential candidates win by purchasing time on the boob-tube.
<p>
<b>Not As Framers Intended.</b> The Framers of the Constitution gravely distrusted democratic appetites, as such had been demonstrated by Shays' Rebellion. Also they distrusted arbitrary power in a chief executive. So they endeavored-unsuccessfully, as matters have turned out-to devise a prudent method of selecting presidents, far removed from popular vote. This was the Electoral College. It was assumed by the Framers that within each of the several states there would be chosen (through divers modes) able and conscientious presidential electors, free agents, "men of superior discernment, virtue, and information" (in Senator Thomas Hart Benton's phrases), who would select a strong and good President "according to their own will," regardless of popular sentiment of the hour. This upright intended Electoral College never has functioned as the Framers intended, nevertheless, because with the rise of great coherent political parties came the pledging in advance of electors to the candidacy of some particular individual- Adams, or Jefferson, or Burr, say-and therefore the reduction of the Electoral College to insignificance, except so far as the College preserved the idea of a nation of sovereign states, the presidential electoral vote being cast by the several states according to their representation in the Congress-and not according to the popular vote, nationally regarded.
<p>
The Framers of the Constitution conceivably might have revised a different move for the Electoral College that could have survived the rise of great political parties. One such arrangement might have been to make the sitting governors of the several states, if chosen long before the presidential election, the independent choosers of the President, so removing the selection from the ephemeral preferences of the great mass of ill-informed voters nationally. But "the saddest words of tongue or pen are simply these: 'It might have been."' Now we expect presidential candidates to exhaust themselves, and their supporters' fund, by <i>two</i> overwhelming national campaigns-one the primaries and conventions held in every state, the other the frantic struggle on the eve of the November election, every four years. This method is supposed to ascertain the popular will; but in effect it blurs distinctions between parties, the candidates promising to be all things, to all men-and women; and commonly this method gives us demagogues or else bladders of vanity as party candidates. All too possibly it may give us more Caesar-presidents; President Bush endeavored to be one such, causing the deaths of a quarter of a million people in Iraq; but the popularity of that exploit rapidly evaporated. The more we behave as if the President were the embodiment of the American democracy, and do little about the Congress except to revile senators and representatives, the less genuinely democratic this nation must become.
<p>
Electronic technology becomes a tool of plebiscitary democracy. As Mr. James M. Perry put it in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> on November 4, hereafter, having upheld the presidential contest of 1992, "Candidates will build on what they saw this year-800-telephone number satellite hookups, soft Larry King-style interviews, televised town meetings." It's a brave new world, with words like "teledemocracy" and "interactive communications" being used by the scholars to describe it. Notions like Mr. Perot's "electronic town hall," should they come to pass, would concentrate the national public' s attention upon the presidential candidates merely, sweeping aside the mechanism of parties and in effect reducing the Congress (or, on the level of the several states, the state legislatures) to little more than ratifying bodies, pledged to whatever programs the victorious presidential candidate might advocate and decree. The peril to true representative government, and to America's old territorial democracy, is too obvious for me to labor this point. The presidential candidates, in such a novel system, necessarily would have to raise enormous quantities of money from such special interests, pressure groups, and ethnic blocs as might expect to profit from the ascendancy of some vigorous demagogue or some persuasive instrument of oligarchy.
<p>
Yet a good many Americans fancy that these developments founded upon television and telephone will bring about "government of the people, by the people, and for the people." At our county Republican convention in my state of Michigan, an amiable young candidate for the office of representative in the Michigan legislature-a person who thought himself conservative- declared himself delighted at the prospect of serving the people "in the new direct democracy." Now direct democracy did not function well in ancient Athens, when the whole electorate-a few thousand men-could assemble in the agora; it would function disastrously, if at all, in the United States of the 20th century, with a population of some two hundred and fifty million people. In any event, the People possessing no unanimous collective will on any question, this virtual abolition of representative government would come down to skillful manipulation of the moment's public opinion by a circle of electronic-media specialists in the service of the President: an extreme form of plebiscitary democracy. In effect, the Presidency would become a dictatorship achieved without violence and checked only by the necessity of an election every four years. How very democratic!
<p>
<b>Plurality President.</b> I speak thus alarmingly only of future possibilities, not of the swiftly approaching reign of Clinton Caesar. For Mr. Clinton achieved a majority of the popular vote merely in his own state of Arkansas; he is a plurality President merely, no popular hero empowered by the Demos to shape the world nearer to his heart's desire. Moreover, he has promised all things to all men-free medical care; free college education, or virtually free, for all comers; emancipation from the tiresome restraints of bourgeois morality; more lavish entitlements for such minorities as can turn out the vote; Lord knows what all benefits. These promises cannot be fulfilled; therefore the reproaches which were heaped upon President Bush these past four years will descend upon President Clinton twofold, not long after his inauguration; and he lacks the rhetorical skill and cunning with which Franklin Roosevelt, in highly similar circumstances, deflected or repelled such criticisms. So feebleness, rather than militancy, is liable to predominate during the Clinton years. And if President Clinton presumes to increase income taxes, as he has said he will do-why, the new Congress, mindful of the fate of the late Bush Administration, may turn rebellious. <i>In fine,</i> Mr. Clinton will not be crowned with laurel.
<p>
Clinton's successors, nevertheless, may have more happy opportunities for the concentration of power in their hands. Increasing military involvement in the European continent, or the collapse of the world economy in a fashion more ruinous than what occurred from 1929 to 1992, might whet presidential candidates' eagerness for power, and public willingness to entrust all to the Great White Father.
<p>
Circumstances from Siberia to San Francisco strongly resemble political and social and economic circumstances in most of the world between the two World Wars. The coming of immense inflation of currencies-now quite conceivable-might cause such immense public resentment and distress that executive forces and legislative bodies might be swept out of power, in country after country, and by plebiscites might usher in persons not at all scrupulous in their attainment -of power. Such radical changes would be accomplished in the name of Democracy, of course, but what would result would be plebiscitary democracy, ruthless enough.
<p>
In the name of Democracy, America' s representative government, under the Constitution, might be swept aside, and politics might be debased to contests between hypocritical ideologues, every one of them claiming to be more democratic than the others. What's in a name? In Haiti, "democracy" signifies the arbitrary power of deposed President Aristide to have rubber tires slung round the necks of his opponents, and they set afire. In South Africa, the apotheosis of democracy, one man one vote on Benthamite principles would end in civil war and general impoverishment. In the United States, the demand for more democracy might lead to the legalized plundering of the hardworking by those who prefer not to work at all. And a line of American Caesars might be required to preserve any sort of order.
<p>
<b>Recovering True Representative Government.</b> I am arguing, ladies and gentlemen, that these United States would be only degraded by a submission to an ideological democracy, in either domestic or foreign policy, a Rousseauistic democracy restyled "teledemocracy." What we require is a vigorous recovery of true representative government, one of the principal achievements of our culture, a legacy from centuries of British and colonial experience and from the practical wisdom of the Framers of the Constitution of the United States. Say not the struggle naught availeth, friends. In my concluding lecture of this series, I will endeavor to let some cheerfulness break in, suggesting means for cultural restoration in a diversity of aspects.

<P>
Sobering voices tell us nowadays that the civilization in which we participate is not long for this world. Many countries have fallen under the domination of squalid oligarchs; other lands are reduced to anarchy. "Cultural revolution," rejecting our patrimony of learning and manners, has done nearly as much mischief in the West as in the East, if less violently. Religious belief is attenuated at best, for many or else converted, after being secularized, into an instrument for social transformation. Books give way to television and videos; universities, intellectually democratized, are sunk to the condition of centers for job certification. An increasing proportion of the population, in America especially, is dehumanized by addiction to narcotics and insane sexuality.
<p>
These afflictions are only some of the symptoms of social and personal disintegration. One has but to look at our half-ruined American cities, with their ghastly rates of murder and rape, to perceive that we moderns lack the moral imagination and the right reason required to maintain tolerable community. Writers in learned quarterlies or in daily syndicated columns use the terms "post-Christian era" or "post-modern epoch" to imply that we are breaking altogether with our cultural past, and are entering upon some new age of a bewildering character.
<p>
Some people, the militant secular humanists in particular, seem pleased by this prospect; but yesteryear's meliorism is greatly weakened in most quarters. Even Marxist ideologues virtually have ceased to predict the approach of a Golden Age. To most observers, T. S. Eliot among them, it has seemed far more probable that we are stumbling into a new Dark Age, inhumane, merciless, a totalist political domination in which the life of spirit and the inquiring intellect will be denounced, harassed, and propagandized against: Orwell's <I>Nineteen Eight-Four,</I> rather than Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i> of cloying sensuality. Or perhaps Tolkien's blasted and servile land of Mordor may serve as symbol of the human condition in the twenty-first century (which, however, may not be called the twenty-first century, the tag Anno Domini having been abolished as joined to one of the superstitions of the childhood of the race).
<p>
<b>At the End of an Era.</b> Some years ago I was sitting in the parlor of an ancient house in the close of York Minster. My host, Basil Smith, the Minster's Treasurer then, a man of learning and of faith, said to me that we linger at the end of an era; soon the culture we have known will be swept into the dustbin of history. About us, as we talked in that medieval mansion, loomed Canon Smith's tall bookcases lined with handsome volumes; his doxological clock chimed the half-hour musically; flames flared up in his fireplace. Was all this setting of culture, and much more besides, to vanish away as if the Evil Spirit had condemned it? Basil Smith is buried now, and so is much of the society he ornamented and tried to redeem. At the time I thought him too gloomy; but already a great deal that he foresaw has come to pass.
<p>
The final paragraph of Malcolm Muggeridge's essay 'The Great Liberal Death Wish" must suffice, the limits of my time with you considered, as a summing-up of the human predicament at the end of the twentieth century.
<p>
"As the astronauts soar into the vast eternities of space," Muggeridge writes, "on earth the garbage piles higher, as the groves of academe extend their domain, their alumni's arms reach lower, as the phallic cult spreads, so does impotence. In great wealth, great poverty; in health, sickness, in numbers, deception. Gorging, left hungry; sedated, left restless; telling all, hiding all; in flesh united, forever separate. So we press on through the valley of abundance that leads to the wasteland of satiety, passing through the gardens of fantasy; seeking happiness ever more ardently, and finding despair ever more surely."
<p>
Just so. Such recent American ethical writers as Stanley Hauwerwas and Alasdair MacIntyre concur in Muggeridge's verdict on the society of our time, concluding that nothing can be done, except for a remnant to gather in little "communities of character" while society slides toward its ruin. Over the past half-century, many other voices of reflective men and women have been heard to the same effect. Yet let us explore the question of whether a reinvigoration of our culture is conceivable.
<p>
<b>Surprise Turning Points.</b> Is the course of nations inevitable? Is there some fixed destiny for great states? In 1796, a dread year for Britain, old Edmund Burke declared that we cannot foresee the future; often the historical determinists are undone by the coming of events that nobody has predicted. At the very moment when some states "seemed plunged in unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster ' Burke wrote in his <i>First Letter on a Regicide Peace,</I> "they have suddenly emerged. They have begun a new course, and opened a new reckoning; and even in the depths of their calamity, and on the very ruins of their country, have laid the foundations of a towering and durable greatness. All this has happened without any apparent previous change in the general circumstances which had brought on their distress. The death of a man at a critical juncture, his disgust, his retreat, his disgrace, have brought innumerable calamities on a whole nation. A common soldier, a child, a girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of fortune, and almost of Nature."
<p>
The "common soldier" to whom Burke refers is Arnold of Winkelreid, who flung himself upon the Austrian spears to save his country; the child is the young Hannibal, told by his father to wage ruthless war upon Rome; the girl at the door of an inn is Joan of Arc. We do not know why such abrupt reversals or advances occur, Burke remarks; perhaps they are indeed the work of Providence.
<p>
"Nothing is, but thinking makes it so," the old adage runs. If most folk come to believe that our culture must collapse-why, then collapse it will. Yet Burke, after all, was right in that dreadful year of 1796. For despite the overwhelming power of the French revolutionary movement in that year, in the long run Britain defeated her adversaries, and after the year 1812 Britain emerged from her years of adversity to the height of her power. Is it conceivable that American civilization, and in general what we call "Western Civilization," may recover from the Time of Troubles that commenced in 1914 (so Arnold Toynbee instructs us) and in the twenty-first century enter upon an Augustan age of peace and restored order?
<p>
To understand these words "civilization" and "culture," the best book to read is T. S. Eliot's slim volume <i>Notes Towards the Definition of Culture,</I> published forty-four years ago.
<p>
Once upon a time I commended that book to President Nixon, in a private discussion of modern disorders, as the one book which he ought to read for guidance in his high office. Man is the only creature possessing culture, as distinguished from instinct; and if culture is effaced, so is the distinction between man and the brutes that perish. "Art is man's nature," in Edmund Burke's phrase; and if the human arts, or culture, cease to be, then human nature ceases to be.
<p>
From what source did humankind's many cultures arise? Why, from cults. A cult is a joining together for worship-that is, the attempt of people to commune with a transcendent power. It is from association in the cult, the body of worshippers, that human community grows. This basic truth has been expounded in recent decades by such eminent historians as Christopher Dawson, Eric Voegelin, and Arnold Toynbee.
<p>
Once people are joined in a-cult, cooperation in many other things becomes possible. Common defense, irrigation, systematic agriculture, architecture, the visual arts, music, the more intricate crafts, economlc production and distribution, courts and government-all these aspects of a culture arise gradually from the cult, the religious de.
<p>
Out of little knots of worshippers, in Egypt, the Fertile Crescent, India, or China, there grew up simple cultures; for those joined by religion can dwell together and work together in relative peace. Presently such simple cultures may develop into intricate cultures, and those intricate cultures into great civilizations. American civilization of our era is rooted, strange though the fact may seem to us, in tiny knots of worshippers in Palestine, Greece, and Italy, thousands of years ago. The enormous material achievements of our civilization have resulted, if remotely, from the spiritual insights of prophets and seers.
<p>
But suppose that the cult withers, with the elapse of centuries. What then of the culture that is rooted in the cult? What then of the civilization which is the culture's grand manifestation? For an answer to such uneasy questions, we can turn to a twentieth century parable. Here I think of G. K Chesterton's observation that all life being an allegory, we can understand it only in parable.
<p>
<b>Parable of the Future.</b> The author of my parable, however, is not Chesterton, but a quite different writer, the late Robert Graves, whom I once visited in Mallorca I have in mind Graves's romance <i>Seven Days in New Crete</I>-published in America under the title <I>Watch the North Wind Rise.</i>
<p>
In that highly readable romance of a possible future, we are told that by the close of the "Late Christian epoch" the world will have fallen altogether, after a catastrophic war and devastation, under a collectivistic domination, a variant of Communism. Religion, the moral imagination, and nearly everything that makes life worth living have been virtually extirpated by ideology and nuclear war. k system of thought and government called Logicalism, "pantisocratic economics divorced from any religious or national theory," rules the world-for a brief time.
<p>
In Graves's words:
<p><blockquote>
Logicalism, hinged on international science, ushered in a gloomy and anti-poetic age. It lasted only a generation or two and ended with a grand defeatism, a sense of perfect futility, that slowly crept over the directors and managers of the regime. The common man had triumphed over his spiritual betters at last, but what was to follow? To what could he look forward with either hope or fear? By the abolition of sovereign states and the disarming of even the police forces, war had become impossible. No one who cherished any religious beliefs whatever, or was interested in sport, poetry, or the arts, was allowed to hold a position of public responsibility. "Ice-cold logic" was the most valued civic quality, and those who could not pretend to it were held of no account. Science continued laboriously to expand its over-large corpus of information, and the subjects of research grew more and more beautifully remote and abstract; yet the scientific obsession, so strong at the beginning of the third millennium A. D., was on the wane. Logicalist officials who were neither defeatist nor secretly religious and who kept their noses to the grindstone from a sense of duty, fell prey to colobromania, a mental disturbance....
</blockquote><p>
<p>
Rates of abortion and infanticide, of suicide, and other indices of social boredom rise with terrifying speed under this Logicalist regime. Gangs of young people go about robbing, beating, and murdering, for the sake of excitement. It appears that the human race will become extinct if such tendencies continue; for men and women find life not worth living under such a domination. The deeper longings of humanity have been outraged, so that the soul and the state stagger on the verge of final darkness. But in this crisis an Israeli Sophocrat writes a book called <i>A Critique of Utopias,</I> in which he examines seventy Utopian writings, from Plato to Aldous Huxley. "We must retrace our steps," he concludes, "or perish." Only by the resurrection of religious faith, the Sophocrats discover, can mankind be kept from total destruction; and that religion, as Graves describes it in his romance, springs from the primitive soil of myth and symbol.
<p>
Graves really is writing about our own age, not of some remote future: of life in today's United States and today's Soviet Union. He is saying that culture arises from the cult; and that when belief in the cult has been wretchedly enfeebled, the culture will decay swiftly. The material order rests upon the spiritual order.
<p>
So it has come to pass, here in the closing years of the twentieth century. With the weakening of the moral order, "Things fall apart; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world ... " The Hellenic and the Roman cultures went down to dusty death after this fashion. What may be done to achieve reinvigoration?
<p>
<b>No Substitute.</b> Some well-meaning folk talk of a "civil religion," a kind of cult of patriotism, founded upon a myth of national virtue and upon veneration of certain historic documents, together with a utilitarian morality. But such experiments of a secular character never have functioned satisfactorily; and it scarcely is necessary for me to point out the perils of such an artificial creed, bound up with nationalism: the example of the ideology of the National Socialist Party in Germany, half a century ago, may suffice. Worship of the state, or of the national commonwealth, is no healthy substitute for communion with transcendent love and wisdom.
<p>
Nor can attempts at persuading people that religion is "useful" meet with much genuine success. No man sincerely goes down on his knees to the divine because he has been told that such rituals lead to the beneficial consequences of tolerably honest behavior in commerce. People will conform their actions to the precepts of religion only when they earnestly believe the doctrines of that religion to be true.
<p>
Still less can it suffice to assert that the Bible is an infallible authority on everything, literally interpreted, in defiance of the natural sciences and of other learned disciplines; to claim to have received private revelations from Jehovah; or to embrace some self-proclaimed mystic from the gorgeous East, whose teachings are patently absurd.
<p>
In short, the culture can be renewed only if the cult is renewed; and faith in divine power cannot be summoned up merely when that is found expedient. Faith no longer works wonders among us: one has but to glance at the typical church built nowadays, ugly and shoddy, to discern how architecture no longer is nurtured by the religious imagination. It is so in nearly all d e works of twentieth century civilization: the modern mind has been secularized so thoroughly that "culture" is assumed by most people to have no connection with the love of God.
<p>
How are we to account for this widespread decay of the religious impulse? It appears that the principal cause of the loss of the idea of the holy is the attitude called "scientism"-that is, the popular notion that the revelations of natural science, over the past century and a half or two centuries, somehow have proved that men and women are naked apes merely, that the ends of existence are production and consumption merely; that happiness is the gratification of sensual impulses; and that concepts of the resurrection of the flesh and the life everlasting are mere exploded superstitions. Upon these scientistic assumptions, public schooling in America is founded nowadays, implicitly.
<p>
This view of the human condition has been called-by C S. Lewis, in particular-reductionism: it reduces human beings almost to mindlessness; it denies the existence of the soul. Reductionism has become almost an ideology. It is scientistic, but not scientific: for it is a far cry from the understanding of matter and energy that one finds in the addresses of Nobel prize winners in physics, say.
<p>
Popular notions of "what science says" are archaic :, reflecting the assertions of the scientists of the middle of the nineteenth century; such views are a world away from the writings of Stanley Jaki, the cosmologist and historian of science, who was awarded the Templeton Prize for progress in religion last year.
<p>
As Arthur Koestler remarks in his little book <i>The Roots of Coincidence,</I> yesterday's scientific doctrines of materialism and mechanism ought to be buried now with a requiem of electronic music. Once more, in biology as in physics, the scientific disciplines enter upon the realm of mystery.
<p>
Yet the great public always suffers from the affliction called cultural lag. If most people continue to fancy that scientific theory of a century ago is the verdict of serious scientists today, will not the religious understanding of life continue to wither, and civilization continue to crumble?
<p>
<b>Hard Truth.</b> Perhaps; but the future, I venture to remind you, is unknowable. Conceivably we may be given a Sign. Yet such an event being in I he hand of God, if it is to occur at all, meanwhile some reflective people declare that our culture must be reanimated, by a great effort of will.
<p>
More than forty years ago, that remarkable historian Christopher Dawson, in his book <i>Religion and Culture,</I> expressed this hard truth strongly. "The events of the last few years," Dawson wrote, "portend either the end of human history or a turning point in it. They have warned us in letters of fire that our civilization has been tried in the balance and found wanting-that there is an absolute limit to the progress than can be achieved by the perfectionment of scientific techniques detached from spiritual aims and moral values.... The recovery of moral control and the return to spiritual order have become the indispensable conditions of human survival. But they can be achieved only by a profound change in the spirit of modern civilization. This does not mean a new religion or a new culture but a movement of spiritual reintegration which would restore that vital relation between religion and culture which has existed at every age and on every level of human development."
<p>
Amen to that. The alternative to such a successful endeavor, a conservative endeavor, to reinvigorate our culture would be a series of catastrophic events, the sort predicted by Pitirim Sorokin and other sociologists, which eventually might efface our present sensate culture and bring about a new ideational culture, the character of which we cannot even imagine. Such an ideational culture doubtless would have its religion: but it might be the worship of what has been called the Savage God
<p>
Such ruin has occurred repeatedly in history. When the classical religion ceased to move hearts and minds, two millennia ago, thus the Graeco Roman civilization went down to Avernus. As my little daughter Cecilia put it unprompted, some years ago looking at a picture book of Roman history, "And then, at the end of a long summer's day, there came Death, Mud, Crud."
<p>
Great civilizations have ended in slime. Outside the ancient city of York, where York Minster stands upon the site of the Roman praetorium, there lies a racecourse known as the Knavesmire. Here in medieval time were buried the knaves-the felons and paupers. When, a few years ago, the racecourse was being enlarged, the diggers came upon a Roman graveyard beneath, or in part abutting upon, the medieval burial ground. This appeared to have been a cemetery of the poor of Romano-British times. Few valuable artifacts were uncovered, but the bones were of interest. Many of the people there interred, in the closing years of Roman power in Britain, had been severely deformed, apparently suffering from rickets and other afflictions-deformed spines and limbs and skulls. Presumably they had suffered lifelong, and died, from extreme malnutrition. At the end, decadence comes down to that, for nearly everybody.
<p>
It was at York that the dying Septimius Severus, after his last campaign (against the Scots), was asked by his brutal sons, Geta and Caracalla, "Father, when you are gone, how shall we govern the empire?" The hard old emperor had his laconic reply ready: "Pay the soldiers. The rest do not matter." There would come a time when the soldiers could not be paid, and then civilization would fall to pieces. The last Roman army in Italy-it is said to have been composed entirely of cavalry- fought in league with the barbarian general Odoacer against Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, in the year 491; on Odoacer's defeat, the Roman soldiers drifted home, nevermore to take arms: the end of an old song Only the earlier stages of social decadence-seem liberating to some people; the last act, as Cecilia Kirk perceived, consists of Death, Mud, Crud.
<p>
In short, it appears to me that our culture labors in an advanced state of decadence; that what many people mistake for the triumph of our civilization actually consists of powers that are disintegrating our culture; that the vaunted "democratic freedom" of liberal society in reality is servitude to appetites and illusions which attack religious belief; which destroy community through excessive centralization and urbanization; which efface life-giving tradition and custom.
<p>
<blockquote>
History has many cunning passages, contrieved corridors <BR>And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions, <BR>Guides us by vanities.
</blockquote>
<p>
So Gerontion instructs us, in T. S. Eliot's famous grim poem. By those and some succeeding lines, Eliot means that human experience lived without the Logos, the Word; lived merely by the asserted knowledge of empirical science-why, history in that sense is a treacherous gypsy witch. Civilizations that reject or abandon the religious imagination must end, as did Gerontion, in fractured atoms.
<p>
<b>Restoring Religious Insights.</b> In conclusion, it is my argument that the elaborate civilization we have known stands in peril; that it may expire of lethargy, or be destroyed by violence, or perish, from a combination of both evils. We who think that life remains worth living ought to address ourselves to means by which a restoration of our culture may be achieved. A prime necessity for us is to restore an apprehension of religious insights in our clumsy apparatus of public instruction, which -bullied by militant secular humanists and presumptuous federal courts-has been left with only ruinous answers to the ultimate questions.
<p>
What ails modern civilization? Fundamentally, our society's affliction is the decay of religious belief If a culture is to survive and flourish, it must not be severed from the religious vision out of which it arose. The high necessity of reflective men and women, then, is to labor for the restoration of religious teachings as a credible body of doctrine.
<p>
"Redeem the time; redeem the dream," T. S. Eliot wrote. It remains possible, given right reason and moral imagination, to confront boldly the age's disorders. The restoration of true learning, humane and scientific; the reform of many public policies; the renewal of our awareness of a transcendent order, and of the presence of an Other, the brightening of the comers where we find ourselves such approaches are open to those among the rising generation who look for a purpose in life. It is just conceivable that we may be given a Sign before the end of the twentieth century; yet Sign or no Sign, Remnant must strive against the follies of the time.

      This year my Heritage lectures have been concerned with American
political errors during the closing decade of the twentieth century --
errors of the Republican party, of the Democratic party, and general
blunders in foreign relations. This evening, ladies and gentlemen, I
conclude my lecture series for Anno Domini 1991 with some desultory
remarks on the possibility of redemption from error -- and, in
particular, whether our rising generation in these United States may
find it possible to "redeem the time, redeem the dream" -- to borrow
T.S. Eliot's line.
<P>
      First, a few words about this concept "generation." To generate
is to beget; to bring into existence. In popular usage we mean by a
generation a large number of persons brought into existence about the
same time; in the same year, perhaps, or possibly in the same decade.
Thomas Jefferson promulgated the somewhat vague concept of every
"generation" of people making its own choices; of the generation of
the living not binding the generation which soon would come into
existence.
<P>
      Yet, this notion cannot be sustained logically or pragmatically.
For really there exists no line of demarcation parting alleged
generations of men and women. Every minute, as I address you, babies
are being born somewhere; and during the same minutes, old people are
dying in every land. 
<P>
      Actually, society is an intricate continuity of lives, not a
mere succession of human beings resembling the flies of a summer,
generation unable to link with generation. It is possible for me to
say truthfully that six generations of my family have lived in our
house at the village of Mecosta, in Michigan; but those alleged
"generations" have much overlapped; at no time over the past twelve
decades has only a single generation lived in our family home. The
notion of distinct generations, then, each generation monopolizing the
earth during its brief span of existence, is merely a convenient
fiction.
<P>
      Nevertheless, we employ that useful fiction frequently,
particularly with reference to literary and political movements. Thus
Spaniards refer to the "Generation of '98," made up of literary movers
and shakers whose convictions were formed at the time of Spain's naval
and military defeats that caused the loss of the Philippines, Cuba,
and Puerto Rico. Thus, in Britain, Wyndham Lewis referred to the "men
of 1914" -- certain innovating writers who began to appear in print
about the beginning of the First World War: Eliot, James Joyce, Ezra
Pound, T.E. Hulme, and Lewis himself. And thus, a very few years ago,
here at The Heritage Foundation, Mr. Ben Hart introduced the concept
of three generations of American conservatives that have exercised
influence since the late 1940s, say. Tonight, I address especially the
third of those hypothetical generations.
<P>
      By the First Generation, I take it, Mr. Hart means men and women
of politics and letters who began to come to public attention about
the end of the 'Forties and the beginning of the 'Fifties; who, most
of them, had grown aware of the sunken state of the world about them,
some time between, or during, the First World War and the Great
Depression. Among such persons who grew up with a conservative
inclination were Richard Weaver, Francis Wilson, Robert Nisbet, Daniel
Boorstin, William Buckley, and your servant; one might add William
Yandell Elliott (a little older) and William McGovern, and others who
were active so early as 1933, say. There would be regarded as
belonging to an earlier "generation," both in point of years and of
thought, such persons as T.S. Eliot, Irving Babbitt, Paul Elmer More,
and George Santayana. Among public men, Senators Robert A. Taft and
Carl Curtis, say, would be classified as members of the pre-
conservative generation, I suppose, their activity having occurred
mostly during the presidencies of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman;
while Senator Barry Goldwater, a relatively late conservative champion
in arms, would be classed with the First Generation conservatives, I
suppose, in Mr. Hart's scheme. You will perceive, ladies and
gentlemen, that membership in a hypothetical generation does not
necessarily coincide with the date of one's nativity.
<P>
      The Second Generation of conservatives, in Mr. Hart's
categories, consists of persons of varying ages who were attracted to
conservative causes, or began to style themselves conservatives,
sometime after 1953, in which year The Conservative Mind was
published. Thus Mr. Irving Kristol, almost so old as is your servant,
is classified as Second Generation; so is my wife Annette Yvonne
Cecilie Courtmanche Kirk, the first secretary at the organizational
meeting of Young Americans for Freedom, twenty-one years younger than
myself. I take it that Dr. Jeffrey Hart, Mr. Ben Hart's father, is
Second Generation -- although very nearly meeting the requirements for
Generation I; that Mr. M. Stanton Evans, despite his many years of
active duty in the conservative array, is a Second Generation
legionnaire; while Mr. Ben Hart himself, and his spouse are field
marshals of the Third Generation. 
<P>
      But, more subtle distinctions and classifications I leave to Mr.
Gregory Wolfe, now engaged in preparing an Encyclopedia of the Right.
So far as public men go, permit me to suggest merely that such
conservatively-inclined gentlemen as Senator Richard Lugar, Governor
John Engler, and Mr. Patrick Buchanan seem to fall within the Second
Generation fold. In brief, nowadays First Generation conservatives --
such of them as have not passed unto a less troubled realm of being --
usually are people in their seventies or their sixties; Second
Generation conservatives, most of them, in their fifties or forties;
Third Generation conservatives, in their thirties or their twenties --
or even in their teens. Pass we then to these ladies and gentlemen of
the Third Generations.

<P>

      Few of the Third Generation folk retain personal memories of the
Disaster of 1964 -- that is, the defeat of Barry Goldwater's
presidential candidacy, the centralizing follies of President
Johnson's "Great Society," the foretaste of ruin in Vietnam, the
loathsome and destructive antics of the crazy black militants and the
crazier young white radicals. The present members of the Third
Generation were reared when the hearts of our great American cities
already were dismal and rotten; when addiction to narcotics plagued
every social class; when public schools, with few honorable
exceptions, offered next to nothing for mind and conscience; when
Demon TV offered something for every taste but good taste; when
promiscuity and sexual perversity demanded recognition as normality;
when it was unwise to walk the streets o'nights; when shrieking mobs
dominated what had been the grove and halls of Academe; when
altercations in Washington made it almost impossible to conduct the
regular business of government; when American life seemed confusion
worse confounded; when one came to appreciate the mordant aphorism of
Albert Jay Nock: "American society is like German beer; dregs at the
bottom, scum at the top."
<P>
      In short, the conservative Third Generation have not known a
tranquil and pleasant and confident America. They scarcely can imagine
a time, not many decades past, when it was the happy evening diversion
of families or couples to stroll in New York's Central Park of
Detroit's Belle Isle Park. They have little knowledge even of the
neighborhood grocery or butcher-shop, the corner drug-store with its
soda-fountain; for them is the leviathan shopping-mall, commercial
collectivism. They have experienced little of continuity; the
expectation of change has been greater far. Yet, they know that much
remains to conserve, and that much ought to be restored.
<P>
      In one respect, but in that respect only, the task of the
conservative of 1991 looms less oppressive than was the task of the
conservative of 1951, when my first book was published. I mean that
the grim menace of the Soviet Union no longer hangs over us. Seventy
years were required for the Communist ideology to work its own ruin,
so that it fell to pieces at a good-natured push, quite bloodless,
from Mr. Ronald Reagan. Always will there be wars and rumors of war;
yet from the Soviet terror we have been saved, so that the Third
Generation conservatives may address their energies to something more
fundamental than resisting the armed doctrine called Marxism.
<P>
      What, then, is the mission of Third Generation conservatives,
young men and women who seek to preserve the Permanent Things, those
elements in human existence that were not born yesterday? It is not to
promulgate a "conservative ideology": for conservatism is the negation
of ideology. Ideology is an attempt to govern all life by political
slogans; while American conservatives believe that no mere political
formulas can make a people content. Conservatives take for their guide
in politics what Edmund Burke called "the wisdom of the species": that
is, the experience of human beings in community, extending over many
centuries. Thus, American conservatism is a cast of mind and
character, not a neat body of political abstractions. Ideology is
political fanaticism, an endeavor to rule the world by rigorous
abstract dogmata. The dogmata of an abstract "democratic capitalism"
may be mischievous as the dogmata of Marx.
<P>
      It is possible to describe certain attitudes that make up
America's conservative mentality, even though not all Americans could

      This year my Heritage lectures have been concerned with American
political errors during the closing decade of the twentieth century --
errors of the Republican party, of the Democratic party, and general
blunders in foreign relations. This evening, ladies and gentlemen, I
conclude my lecture series for Anno Domini 1991 with some desultory
remarks on the possibility of redemption from error -- and, in
particular, whether our rising generation in these United States may
find it possible to "redeem the time, redeem the dream" -- to borrow
T.S. Eliot's line.
<P>
      First, a few words about this concept "generation." To generate
is to beget; to bring into existence. In popular usage we mean by a
generation a large number of persons brought into existence about the
same time; in the same year, perhaps, or possibly in the same decade.
Thomas Jefferson promulgated the somewhat vague concept of every
"generation" of people making its own choices; of the generation of
the living not binding the generation which soon would come into
existence.
<P>
      Yet, this notion cannot be sustained logically or pragmatically.
For really there exists no line of demarcation parting alleged
generations of men and women. Every minute, as I address you, babies
are being born somewhere; and during the same minutes, old people are
dying in every land. 
<P>
      Actually, society is an intricate continuity of lives, not a
mere succession of human beings resembling the flies of a summer,
generation unable to link with generation. It is possible for me to
say truthfully that six generations of my family have lived in our

young men and women who seek to preserve the Permanent Things, those
elements in human existence that were not born yesterday? It is not to
promulgate a "conservative ideology": for conservatism is the negation
of ideology. Ideology is an attempt to govern all life by political
slogans; while American conservatives believe that no mere political

character, not a neat body of political abstractions. Ideology is
political fanaticism, an endeavor to rule the world by rigorous
abstract dogmata. The dogmata of an abstract "democratic capitalism"
may be mischievous as the dogmata of Marx.
<P>
      It is possible to describe certain attitudes that make up
America's conservative mentality, even though not all Americans could
express coherently their belief in such general principles, and
although some conservatives would dissent from one or more of the
general assumptions or principles I now mention.
<P>
      First, belief in some transcendent order in the universe, some
law that is more than human: a religious understanding of the human
condition, if you will; a belief in enduring moral norms. As the
national pledge of allegiance puts it, "One nation under God.... "
<P>
      Second, opposition to totalist ideology and the totalist
political order. The American conservative rejects the notion of a
future earthly paradise -- which the ideologue promises to attain.
<P>
      Third, confidence in the American Constitution -- both the
written national Constitution and the intricate fabric of custom,
belief, and habit that makes up the underlying "unwritten"
constitution of a nation-state. Many decisions of the Supreme Court in
recent decades are bitterly resented; nevertheless, attachment to the
Constitution itself remains strong.
<P>
      Fourth, maintenance of the rights of private property and of a
free or competitive economy, as contrasted with a directed or
socialist economy. This healthy prejudice persists despite the
increasing consolidation of business and industry into large
conglomerations or oligopolies.
<P>
      Fifth, suspicion of central political direction, and preference
for state and local powers: insistence upon private rights. 
<P>
      Sixth, a deep-rooted patriotism, joined to uneasiness at
"entangling alliances"; this latter attitude, nevertheless, modified
by determination to resist totalist powers that menace the American
national interest.
<P>
      Seventh, an awareness that change is not identical with healthy
improvement; a relish for the American past; a genuine preference for
the old and tried.
<P>
      Such is the consensus of that very large body of Americans who
choose to call themselves conservative in their politics. Within this
crowd of conservative citizens exist various factions, each
emphasizing some aspect or another of the general conservative
attitude. There exists no "party line" to which conservatives of one
persuasion or another are compelled to conform.
<P>
      Retrenchment and Reform. With such assumptions as those I
outlined just now, America enters upon an age of retrenchment and
reform in economic concerns. If American prosperity is to endure,
public expenditure and taxation must be kept in check. Conservative
economic measures must be employed to prevent inflation of the
currency and to reduce the national deficit -- a hard necessity of
which the general public is becoming aware.
<P>
      In this present era when the Soviet power fades away, the
majority of the American public seem disillusioned with social
experiments and with the rapid pace of change; with excessive
governmental regulation; with cities fallen to ruin and tormented by
crime; with subsidized abortion, with judicial usurping of power, with
a permissive indulgence of license and criminality, with the blight of
pornography, with the whole liberal climate of opinion. For the next
half-century at least, I suggest, the American democracy will tend to
reject those politicians who still indulge dreams of Lotos-land.
Liberalism has undone itself.
<P>
      There have been ages when custom and inertia have lain
insufferably upon humankind; and such an age may come to pass again;
but such is not our age. Ours is an era when the moral and social
heritage of many centuries of civilization stands in imminent peril
from the forces of vertiginous indiscriminate change. Resistance to
the folly of such change is the primary duty of the Third Generation
conservative.
<P>
      The continuing American conservative movement, if it is to be
carried on tolerably well, must work within the minds and the
consciences of a good many young men and women. I do not think that
this work of conservation can be accomplished by any particular group;
certainly not by any idealizing of "business rule." I trust that
Americans will conserve a market economy and all the better features
of an economy marked by volition. But Americans will conserve such
advantages only if they conserve something higher and older: that is,
a society of tradition, diversity, and the life of spirit.

<P>

      The critic Eliseo Vivas wrote once that "It is one of the marks
of human decency to be ashamed of having been born into the twentieth
century." Spiritually and politically, the twentieth century has been
a time of decadence. Yet, as that century draws near to its close, we
may remind ourselves that ages of decadence often have been followed
by ages of renewal.
<P>
      What can you do to commence redeeming the time, to conserve the
Permanent Things, to raise up the human condition to a level less
unworthy of what Pico della Mirandola called "the dignity of man"?
Why, begin by brightening the corner where you are; by improving one
human unit, yourself, and helping your neighbor.
<P>
      You will not need to be rich or famous to take your part in
redeeming the time: what you need for that task is moral imagination
joined to right reason. It is not by wealth or fame that you will be
rewarded, probably, but by eternal moments: those moments of one's
existence in which, as T.S. Eliot put it, time and the timeless
intersect. In such moments, you may discover the answer to that
immemorial question which now and again enters the head of any
reflective man or woman, "What is all this? What is this world that
surrounds us, and why are we here?"
<P>
      Yes, what is all this? Why, this present realm of being, in
which your consciousness and my consciousness are aware of reality, is
a divine creation; and you and I are put into it as into a testing-
ground -- into an arena, if you will. As the German writer Stefan
Andres put it, "We are God's Utopia." You and I are moral beings meant
to accomplish something good, in a small way or a big, in this
temporal world.
<P>
      The Roman Stoics taught that some things in life are good, and
some are evil; but that the great majority of life's happenings are
neither good nor evil, but indifferent merely. Wealth is a thing
indifferent, and so is poverty; fame is a thing indifferent, and so is
obscurity. Shrug your shoulders at things indifferent; set your face
against the things evil; and by doing God's will, said the Stoics,
find that peace which passes all understanding.
<P>
      True Authority. How do we know such postulates, religious and
philosophical, to be true? Why, by the common sense and ancient assent
of mankind -- that is, by hearkening to the voice of true authority,
the voice of what G.K. Chesterton called "the democracy of the dead."
I think of what John Henry Newman wrote about Authority in 1846:
"Conscience is an authority; the Bible is an authority; such is the
Church; such is antiquity; such are the words of the wise; such are
hereditary lessons; such are ethical truths; such are historical
memories; such are legal saws and state maxims; such are proverbs;
such are sentiments, presages, and prepossessions." Believe what wise
men and women, over the centuries, have believed in matters of faith
and morals, and you will have a firm footing on which to stand while
the winds of doctrine howl about you.
<P>
      This counsel that I offer you, conservatives of the Third
Generation, will not guarantee your winning any of the glittering
prizes of modern society; for those too are among the things
indifferent, and some of them are among the things evil. Yet, this
advice from a conservative of the First Generation who has seen a good
deal of the world conceivably may help you on the track toward certain
eternal moments, when time and the timeless intersect. What happens at
such timeless moments, such occurrences in eternity? Why, quiet
perfect events, usually; among them the act of telling stories to
one's children, or of reading aloud to them.
<P>
      What is all this -- this confused American world of glittering
material things and of appalling personal and social decay? I have
found it to be a real world, sun-lit despite its vices; a real world
in which one may develop and exercise one's potential virtues of
courage, prudence, temperance, and justice; one's faith, hope, and
charity. You will take your tumbles in this world, which can be rough
enough in our age, Lord knows; but also you may enjoy your triumphs.
It is a world in which there is so much needing to be done that nobody
ought to be bored. For young Americans especially, this is still a
world of high opportunity.
<P>
      All this creation about us is the garden that we erring humans
were appointed to tend. Plant some flowers in it, if you can, and pull
some weeds. If need be, draw your sword to defend it. Do not fancy
that a sorry policy of Looking Out for Number One will lead you to
Heaven's gate. Do not fail to remind yourselves that consciousness is
a perpetual adventure. Do not ignore the wisdom of the ages, the
democracy of the dead. Such, ladies and gentlemen, is the counsel of
this survivor from the First Generation.
<P>
      Those of us who aspire to conserve our inherited order and
justice and freedom, our patrimony of wisdom and beauty and loving-
kindness, have a hard row to hoe nowadays -- that I confess. But, I am
heartened from time to time by a stanza from Chesterton's long poem,
The Ballad of the White Horse. Chesterton is describing the prophets
of doom, who tell us that nothing in life is permanent; that all is
lost, or is being lost, in our culture; that we totter on the brink of
an abyss. Such prophets of doom think themselves wise. Chesterton has
in mind the typical intellectuals of the twentieth century, but he
calls them the wise men of the East. Here I give you Chesterton's
lines: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The wise men know what wicked thingsAre written on the
      sky,They trim sad lamps, they touch sad stringsHearing the
      heavy purple wings,Where the forgotten seraph kingsStill
      plot how God shall die.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Such despairing souls, though possessed perhaps of much
intelligence, in truth are not wise. In our time, ladies and
gentlemen, many voices have been declaring that life is not worth
living. A multitude of writers and professors and publicists and
members of the class of persons commonly styled "intellectuals"
gloomily instruct us that we human beings are no better than naked
apes, and that consciousness is an illusion. Such persons insist that
life has no purpose but sensual gratification; that the brief span of
one's physical existence is the be-all and end-all. Such twentieth-
century sophists have created in the murky caves of the intellect an
Underworld; and they endeavor to convince us all that there exists no
sun -- that the world of wonder and of hope exists nowhere, and never
did exist. Plato knew just such sophists in his age. Those doctrines
of despair, the rising generation of conservatives must confront and
refute.

<P>
      My counsels so far may have seemed somewhat ghostly, no doubt.
But, I have learned from life in various regions of the world, and
under differing circumstances, that it is the life of spirit which
truly matters; and that the Permanent Thing most worthy of
preservation is an understanding of the human soul. The conscious
conservative defends the soul of humankind against the corrosive
materialism and sensuality of twentieth-century will and appetite.
<P>
      Let me turn, however, to the art of worldly wisdom. I can offer,
too, some practical advice. How, for instance, you may ask me, does
one contrive to forge ahead in practical political life in this
sprawling American democracy, with the intention of conducting a
conservative defense of the Permanent Things?
<P>
      Why, ordinarily it is fairly simple to make one's way in the
American political structure. American political parties could not
function without volunteers. Volunteer, and you will be gladly
accepted, such as you being urgently needed; you will find, indeed,
that a number of your fellow-volunteers are rather peculiar people,
almost Outcasts of Poker Flat, but welcome in a local political
organization (if not welcome in many other circles) because, whatever
their peculiarities, they are willing to work for the common cause.
<P> 
      If you are an intelligent and adept volunteer, you will be made
much of by the party leaders and faithful, and will be advanced in
your responsibilities. You may be asked to be a delegate, whether
elected or appointed. If chosen delegate, arrive early at caucus or
convention. When the meeting proper commences, endeavor to sit at the
chairman's right hand; then others may take you for his right-hand
man. There are many little arts by which one may gain ascendancy over
the minds of one's political colleagues. But, the great necessity is
to have acquired previously a fund of knowledge and some mastery of
rhetoric -- and honest principles. That is why I sometimes advise
undergraduates not to expend their time in street demonstrations, but
instead to study. If Karl Marx, instead of reading books within, had
spent his days parading round and round the outside of the British
museum, a placard "Down with the bourgeois!" tacked to a sandwich-
board over his shoulders -- why, had he been so foolish, the world
would be so much better off today.
<P>
      Redeem the time, redeem the dream -- in ways mundane as well as
ways spiritual. If you should resolve really to take a vigorous part
in restoring the American Republic, choose your vocation accordingly,
so that the work by which you gain your livelihood, and the work by
which you help to redeem the time, may coincide. Take to the law -- if
you can endure the boredom of our law schools nowadays. Or, take to
serious journalism -- or, for broader and more immediate influence, to
television and radio. You may accomplish some reform of the American
mind through book-publishing. Or, supposing you possess fortitude
sufficient to fight your way through our PC graduate schools, aspire
after a college professorship that might enable you to counteract the
freaks who appear to dominate the typical campus nowadays. Or take to
pedagogy, if you can surmount the dull obstacles to certification as a
teacher. If you feel a religious calling -- why, in no way might you
accomplish more to restore meaning to lives in the twenty-first
century. And, the best way to insure a Fourth Generation of
intelligent young conservatives is to beget children, and rear them
well: the wise parent is the conservator of ancient truths. As Edmund
Burke put it, "We learn to love the little platoon we belong to in
society." The institution most essential to conserve is the family.
<P>
      If we aspire to redeem this age of ours, so far gone in
decadence -- well, we have no time to lose before commencing our
endeavors. Fixed to the walls of the entrance hall of my house are
masks of the archaic god Cronos, in his role of Time the Devourer; his
half-leonine, half-human face bares his fangs, which the ancient
Greeks dreaded. Those masks serve to remind me daily that the night
cometh when no man shall work, and that I had best turn back to my
productive typewriter.
<P>
      Yet, Time is not a devourer only. With proper use of the life-
span that is allotted to us, we may accomplish our part in redeeming
our era from its vices, terrors, and catastrophic errors. With
Demosthenes, ladies and gentlemen, I beg of you to think. For only if
you think soundly at this juncture in your lives will you be enabled
to act decisively in those years when you have achieved some
influence.
<P>
      I conclude with an exhortation which Orestes Brownson, that
redoubtable conservative reformer, scholar, and journalist, delivered
at Dartmouth College in 1843. His topic was "The Scholar's Mission."
He concluded, as follows, his charge to the rising generation:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Ask not what your age wants, but what it needs, not what it
      will reward, but what, without which, it cannot be saved;
      and that go and do; and find your reward in the
      consciousness of having done your duty, and above all in
      the reflection, that you have been accounted to suffer
      somewhat for mankind.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      In the later 'Sixties, many of the rising generation thought it
amusing to pull down what earlier generations had patiently built up;
their zeal extended even to the burning of university libraries. In
the early 'Nineties, I hope and trust, many of the rising generation
will find it satisfying to restore and redeem their patrimony from
earlier times -- and so save the world from suicide. That labor will
require cleverness and courage. Some of you present here tonight may
choose it for your vocation.

      In commencing this second lecture on the sorry state of
political parties in these United States, I ask you to indulge me in
quoting a passage from Edmund Burke's Thoughts on the Present
Discontents, a political tract, published in 1770, mordantly critical
of the ways of George III with Parliament.  In this famous essay Burke
defines the phrase "political party":
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they
      will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a
      contemptible struggle.... 
<P>
      Party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint
      endeavors the national interest upon some particular
      principle in which they are all agreed.  For my part, I
      find it impossible to conceive that anyone believes in his
      own politics, or thinks them of any weight, who refuses to
      adopt the means of having them reduced into practice.  It
      is the business of the speculative philosopher to mark the
      proper ends of government.  It is the business of the
      politician, who is the philosopher in action, to find out
      proper means towards those ends, and to employ them with
      effect.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Now I confess myself to be one of those speculative
philosophers, mentioned by Burke, whose business it is to mark the
proper ends of government; I do not pretend to possess remedies for
all the political ills to which our nation is heir.  But I venture to
criticize those politicians, in either great party, who, far from
being philosophers in action, are merely what Burke and his
contemporaries called "placemen":  that is, seekers after the power
and the emoluments of public office, not scrupulous as to the means by
which advantages for themselves may be obtained.  The demagogue seeks
for himself a cozy place in the political sunshine.
<P>
      In my previous lecture of this series, I touched upon some
errors of the Republican Party, under George Bush, in affairs domestic
and in affairs abroad.  Today I turn to the errors of the Democratic
Party, under leaders of recent years.  For the past decade the
Democrats have been an opposition party -- that is, in opposition to
the national Executive Force.  In their opposition the Democrats, with
some honorable exceptions, have gained little credit for themselves.
<P>
      Difficult Attitudes.  The Democratic party claims descent from
Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans, but any remaining relationship to
Jeffersonians is difficult to discern.  In its origins, the Democratic
Party at the beginning of the nineteenth century was the champion of
the agricultural and rural interest, the defender of states' powers as
opposed to political centralization, the advocate of hard money and
the opponent of national debt.  Democratic attitudes nowadays are very
different.
<P>
      For at Democratic national conventions, the cry is all for
grander federal expenditures and piling up of more debt, in
consequence.  With few exceptions, the leading Democrats would
centralize everything, not bothering to reflect upon what the word
"federal" signifies.  For the most part ignoring the remnant of
America's rural population, the Democrats are subservient to organized
"minorities" in America's great decayed cities; upon the proletariat
they are sedulous to confer more "entitlements," on humanitarian
principles.  Senator Moynihan and a handful of other Democratic
legislators think seriously about our urban afflictions, seeking
practical remedies, a difficult task; but most Democrats in office
hold by the exploded notion that legislative bodies can sweep away
social conundrums by throwing money at them.
<P>
      Democratic Majorities. In presidential contests, the Democrats
have won only one of the past six elections, and take a dim view of
their own prospects in the election of 1992.  The ethnic coalition
from which they drew a great part of their support in the Roosevelt
and Truman years has been dissolving; the labor unions that delivered
a massive Democratic vote have been diminishing in numbers and in
zeal; white voters in the Old South have shifted, a great many of
them, to the Republican ticket; the Democratic party seems devoid of
imagination and deprived of true leadership.  How is it, then, that
Democratic majorities prevail in House and Senate?
<P>
      The answer to that question seems to be that in presidential
elections, the voting public becomes fairly well aware of the issues
in dispute and of the personalities of the candidates:  massive
television coverage, prolonged newspaper discussion, and candidates'
debates give the typical voter some notion of what the Republican
presidential candidate and the Democratic candidate respectively think
and propose.  So informed, the majority of citizens then vote for the
Republican, having found him nearer to their hearts' desire.
<P>
      For the Democrats, in their endeavor to cater to even the most
unlikely "minority," have alienated the majority in nearly every state
of the Union.  The American public is conservative in its sentiments,
for the most part; and when the contest occurs between candidates
recognizably conservative and candidates recognizably liberal or
radical, the public prefers the conservative.  The governor of New
York, Mario Cuomo, so often mentioned as a possible Democratic
presidential candidate, at present is vigorously advocating a bill in
the New York legislature to confer special privileges upon
homosexuals.  The fancied political advantage to be gained by pleasing
pathics will be overwhelmed by public opinion if ever Mr.  Cuomo
confronts President Bush or any other Republican nominee who does not
endeavor to reward sexual deviancy.  What a genius the Democrats this
past quarter-century have developed for misjudging public opinion!
<P>
      Republican Goal.  How is it, then, that nevertheless the
Democratic party holds a majority, most of the time, in both Senate
and House?  Why, in the election of Senators and Representatives, the
typical voter is ill informed about the views of the respective
candidates, and knows next to nothing of their voting records,
supposing them to be incumbents of the offices at stake.  The voter
tends to approve a candidate according to what the candidate claims to
have accomplished by way of securing benefits at federal expense for
his state or his congressional district, regardless of the chief
political issues of the hour.  Also the voter in many such elections
is powerfully influenced by name-recognition, so that Democratic
incumbents, long entrenched in office, are almost impossible to
dislodge in many districts and states.  In the long run, possession of
the executive branch of the federal government by Republicans will
work to erode the Democratic majority in both legislative houses.  But
to achieve that success, Republican presidential candidates might have
to forgo the goal of winning all fifty states for their personal
triumph, and instead spend money and time upon electing senators and
representatives.  Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and Bush, although
virtually certain to be elected by wide popular and electoral
majorities, somewhat neglected their duty of trying hard to bring in
Republican Congresses -- or at least their campaign managers failed
them in that respect.
<P>
      However that may be, time is not on the side of the Democratic
Party:  their leaders talk the language of yesteryear.  Mr.  Carter,
addressing the Democratic convention that had nominated him in 1976,
made promises and employed a rhetoric that would have gone down very
well in 1932 or 1936, but were absurdly archaic in the very different
era of the Bicentenary.  Nevertheless, Mr.  Carter won the election --
not because of what he said, but in spite of it.  His successors as
Democratic presidential candidates have behaved with equal absurdity
-- being their own worst enemies -- but did not enjoy the good fortune
to run against a Republican candidate who fancied that Poland was not
Soviet dominated.  Like the Bourbons, the Democrats since F.D.R.  have
learned nothing and forgotten nothing.

<P>

      Time has been when the Democratic leaders were great men.  One
thinks of John C.  Calhoun, or Grover Cleveland.  It has been
otherwise since World War II.  An impartial observer -- from Mars, say
-- necessarily would regard with some misgiving a party headed by
Lyndon Johnson, whose infamy has been exposed by careful biographers;
or a party whose most conspicuous United States Senator nowadays is
the amorous and bibulous gentleman from Massachusetts.  Yet have there
not been Democratic leaders of recent decades who were veritable
Galahads or Percivals, you may inquire?  Why, there were some honest
and able men among those leaders; yet not, perhaps, precisely those
eminent Democrats whom the party panegyrists delight to honor.
<P>
      Take, for instance, the Honorable Hubert Humphrey, long United
States Senator from Minnesota, who since his death has been
politically canonized.  Once upon a time I debated Mr.  Humphrey
before a huge audience in Ann Arbor.  I found him an amiable man,
courteous, forthright when assailed by a band of student fidelistas in
the crowd; but excessively fond of the sound of his own voice, for
which indeed he apologized to me at the debate's end.  Yet Senator
Humphrey did not lead a career free of all stain and reproach.  I do
not refer to peccadillos of the sort committed by Mr.  Gary Hart: 
rather, I mean a conflict of interest of the gravest kind, in which
Humphrey put his own interest above the interest of the foreign policy
of the United States -- a case involving the security of the North
Atlantic Treaty allies.
<P>
      Primary Defeat.  What I am about to tell you never has been
published before, although some reference to it will appear in my
memoirs.  Let me preface my narration by reminding you, ladies and
gentlemen, of the hard-fought Democratic primary in West Virginia
during the year 1960.  Senator Kennedy was pitted against Senator
Humphrey; a vast amount of money was expended by both presidential
aspirants.  Eugene McCarthy, a Democrat as honest as he is
interesting, said to me once that this West Virginia primary was the
most corrupt episode in the political history of the United States. 
However that may be, Humphrey lost the primary, if somewhat narrowly;
therefore he lost his party's presidential nomination.  And he was
left forlorn with a great mass of West Virginia debts upon his
shoulders.
<P>
      So much for that, just now.  Our scene shifts from West Virginia
to Turkey; the events to be described occur three to four years after
Hubert Humphrey's defeat.  I am about to quote to you, verbatim, a
report made to me by a retired Foreign Service officer who at the time
of those events was assigned to duties in the Near East and the Middle
East.  I have known this former diplomat for a good many years and
have complete confidence in his veracity.
<P>
      "One of the kindest and most helpful men in the Senate," my
informant commences, "was Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota." 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
           He seemed sensitive to the national interest, willing
      to resist special interests of the financial or ethnic
      sort, and always ready to understand State's views, to
      advise, and to help when he could.  He even "condescended"
      to me socially in the grand old meaning of that word.
<P>
           In the mid-fifties, the legendary hero Ismet Inonu,
      successor to Kemal Ataturk, surprised the world by
      permitting a free and fair national election, and by giving
      up power peacefully when he lost to Adnan Menderes. 
      Menderes, with broad peasant support, won handily and
      installed his own regime in place of that of Inonu, who
      became leader of the Opposition.  Within a short time the
      Menderes government became the stage of typical Third World
      financial corruption, much of it involving rake-offs in
      alleged "development" contracts with foreign firms.  When
      Menderes began to deprive the Opposition of its political
      rights and even threatened the personal safety of Inonu,
      the armed forces, feeling that their role in society had
      been betrayed, threw out Menderes and his friends and
      reinstalled Inonu.
<P>
           Inonu, whose administration was reasonably honest by
      Turkish standards, had the backing of the Army in bringing
      to trial and punishment Turkish politicians and officials
      believed to have been among the worst of the grafters.  In
      one of many cases, several officials were punished for
      accepting large bribes from an American ("The Promoter")
      who had contracted to provide a complete small steel mill
      to Turkey.  It was shown in the trial that the "mill" was
      actually the old, rusted, and broken-down hardware from a
      plant on the southern U.S.  coast which had been closed as
      obsolete and sold by the owners to The Promoter for one or
      two million dollars; for the plant owners it was of value
      only as scrap.  The Turkish regime was no more than amused
      when The Promoter, who would have been arrested for fraud,
      bribery, and conspiracy if he had entered Turkey, formally
      asked the Turkish government for his final payment of ten
      million dollars under the contract.  He pointed out that
      the machinery in question had been delivered, even though
      it was just rusting on the docks in Turkey.  The Turkish
      government refused, noting that expert testimony in the
      trial had proved the machinery to be inoperable, worthless,
      and not as specified in the contract.  It suggested that if
      The Promoter wished to pursue his claim further, he follow
      the contract and file suit in a Turkish court, and that if
      he felt this clause was not binding, that he join the
      Turkish government in submitting the dispute to
      international commercial arbitration through established
      private institutions.  The Promoter refused to accept that
      he had not fulfilled his contract, refused to pursue the
      matter through either of the suggested channels, and again
      demanded early payment.  The Turks paid no further
      attention to him; they were convinced he would lose an
      arbitration and be assessed the costs of arbitration.

    <P>  
           The annual foreign-aid legislation then came before
      the Senate.  To our stupefied surprise, Senator Humphrey
      offered and pushed to adoption an amendment so worded as to
      apply only to The Promoter's claim, to the effect that no
      U.S.  military assistance would be provided to any country
      under the bill as long as claims by an American contractor
      for goods or services already provided had not been met in
      full.  It was further specified that the alleged quality of
      goods/services delivered could not affect the requirement,
      nor could any provisions of a contract providing for means
      of adjudicating or arbitrating the amount claimed.  This
      was called The Humphrey Amendment, and was an object of
      amusement or outrage at State and on Capitol Hill, but was
      never the subject of press inquiry, analysis, or interest. 
      The White House and State queried Humphrey's staff about
      the possibility of a compromise, but were told that if
      Senator Humphrey were to be kept on board the entire
      foreign-aid project, the Amendment must become law.  Our
      own bureau queried the staffs of Senators Fulbright and
      Mansfield to see if they couldn't make Humphrey back off or
      at least compromise.  One of Fulbright's top staffers told
      me that Humphrey, very uncharacteristically, refused to
      discuss the Amendment, except to say that it was a matter
      of principle to avoid the robbing of one of his
      constituents (The Promoter), and that he, the Senator,
      would not change a word of it.  Humphrey's prestige was
      such that he easily beat back the half-hearted move to
      reconsider the Amendment, and the Administration did not
      want to tangle with him over a measly ten million dollars.
<P>
           The bill became law with the Amendment.  Reluctantly
      we told the Turks that deliveries of new material as
      provided in the legislation and as planned by NATO could
      not be made until The Promoter was paid.  The Turks, who
      were as loyal as any ally we had, and Inonu, who had always
      co-operated with us fully, pointed out the effect on the
      Turkish armed forces of the delay of scheduled deliveries,
      and, conversely, the effect on Turkish public opinion as to
      both the U.S.  and Inonu government if the money were paid
      to The Promoter.  There was nothing we could do.  Finally
      Inonu had to ask his Parliament for ten million dollars in
      public funds to pay The Promoter before hundreds of
      millions of dollars worth of NATO materials could be
      delivered.  The Opposition pointed out with gusto the
      overwhelming proof advanced in earlier legal proceedings
      that the project was one of bribery and fraud from the
      beginning, and that the machinery was nothing but scrap. 
      Inonu swallowed the dishonor, got the money, paid The
      Promoter, and got the arms and ammunition.
<P>
           While the legislation was still before the Senate, we
      enlisted the help of a friendly office of the FBI, which had
      helped us in the past, to check The Promoter's background on
      this and earlier deals, in the hope of finding something which
      could be used to influence other Senators.  The world-weary FBI
      man, an old friend, who had conducted most of the search and
      directed it all, came in to tell me that The Promoter was quite
      shady and could be termed a boardroom confidence man, but that
      he had never been convicted -- only a couple of unpursued
      indictments in minor scandals.  As we talked I opined that The
      Promoter just couldn't by himself wield that much influence with
      the Senator -- that there must be a more weighty partner in the
      woodpile.  I asked him if he could, strictly on his own and to
      satisfy my personal curiosity, try to dig up such a partner. 
      The FBI man came in a week or two later, warned me that this
      meeting with me was not occurring, and informed me that there
      was a partner on halves with The Promoter who bought in for a
      pittance during the past year, and that the partner's name was
      the maiden name of Muriel Humphrey.
      <P>
           During the rest of my assignment at State we continued
      to receive the best possible co-operation from Senator
      Humphrey in all other matters, and his personal affability
      was undiminished.  On reflection, and considering the
      common gossip that Humphrey was tragically in debt
      following his primary collision with the Kennedy moneybags,
      I could not work up much indignation against the Senator
      personally.  I saved my indignation for the interface
      between foreign aid and the American political system, and
      slowly began to drift toward the conclusion that any good
      done by foreign aid was outweighed by the damage it caused
      here and abroad.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      At this point, my friend's narrative ceases.  Permit me to
comment that I have no animus against Hubert Humphrey.  I recount this
episode merely to suggest that even the more genuine of democratic
idols may be found to have feet of clay.  At least Senator Humphrey
needed the money in question.  During the Kennedy and Johnson
Administrations, probably the richest man in the Senate was the most
corrupt of senators:  Kerr of Oklahoma, whose devious enriching ways
are candidly described by his lieutenant, Bobby Baker, in the latter
scoundrel's memoirs.  To perceive how deep in peculation was President
Johnson himself, assisted by his agents Bobby Baker and Billy Sol
Estes, one may turn to the recent memoirs of a Republican of
integrity, Senator Carl Curtis, entitled Forty Years Against the Tide.
<P>
      Doubtless a number of persons present today have read Henry
Adams' novel Democracy.  In that book, an elderly diplomat from
Eastern Europe grows exasperated with a pompous American senator whose
character is suspect.  Baron Jacobi is referring to political
corruption about the year 1870:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
           You Americans believe yourselves to be exempted from
      the operation of general laws.  You care not for
      experience.  I have lived seventy-five years, and all that
      time in the midst of corruption.  I am corrupt myself, only
      I do have the courage to proclaim it, and you others have
      it not.  Rome, Paris, Vienna, Petersburg, London, all are
      corrupt; only Washington is pure!  Well, I declare to you
      that in all my experiences I have found no society which
      has had elements of corruption like the United States.  The
      children in the street are corrupt, and know how to cheat
      me.  The citizens are all corrupt, and also the towns and
      the counties and the States' legislatures and the judges. 
      Everywhere men betray trusts both public and private, steal
      money, run away with public funds.  Only in the Senate men
      take no money.  And you gentlemen in the Senate very well
      declare that your great United States, which is the head of
      the civilized world, can never learn anything from the
      example of corrupt Europe.  You are right -- quite right! 
      The great United States needs not an example.  I do much
      regret that I have not yet one hundred years to live.  If I
      could then come back to this city, I should find myself
      very content -- much more than now.  I am always content
      where there is much corruption, and ma parole d'honneur!" 
      broke out the old man with fire and gesture, "The United
      States will then be more corrupt than Rome under Caligula;
      more corrupt than the Church under Leo X; more corrupt than
      France under the Regent!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Baron Jacobi's prophecy has come to pass, more than a century
later.  Everyone in this room is aware that two very eminent
Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives, last year found it
prudent to resign their seats rather than face expulsion.  Everyone
also knows of the several senators who betrayed their trust in
connection with the savings and loan disaster.  Everyone has read of,
if not experienced, the maladministration of demagogic mayors elected
on the Democratic ticket in certain great cities, Washington
especially.  Corruption is not confined to the Democratic party's
placemen, of course; but corruption seems to have become epidemic in
the Democratic Party during recent decades.
<P>
      Accepting bribes, pocketing public funds, and selling political
influence are not the worst forms of political corruption.  For more
malignant still is that professed political humanitarianism which is
merely a mask for a politician's lust for power and place.  Such
politicians, and they are legion in today's Democratic apparatus,
extemporize flimsy measures that will procure for them an evanescent
popularity.  Senator Carl Curtis tells of a conversation, some years
ago, with a senatorial colleague of this stamp.  That colleague had
been active in the passage of a fiscal bill that in the long run would
be immensely costly -- almost insupportable.  Curtis expostulated on
what would be the consequences thirty years in the future.  "But I
won't be in the Senate when that happens," said his colleague. 
Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.
<P>
      Grim Mistake. My point is this:  the greatest error of the
Democratic Party nowadays is dishonesty.  Here permit me to quote one
of my less-favorite authors, Voltaire:  "It was worse than a crime: 
it was a mistake."  When a Democratic Congress appropriates vast sums
for new federal undertakings, but reproaches the executive branch for
increasing the national debt, the Democrats are dishonest -- as they
are in other great concerns.  Such political hypocrisy is not a crime
for which public men may be indicted; but it is a grim mistake.  For
presently a party that so behaves will be recognized by the public as
a dishonest party, and then its days will be numbered.
<P>
      When Ronald Reagan was re-elected to the presidency by so
overwhelming a majority, I suggested in public addresses that
conceivably the Democratic Party might begin to split into factions
and to follow the Federalist Party and the Whig Party down to dusty
death.  That process may be at work, despite temporary Democratic
majorities in the Congress.  More than the Republicans, the Democrats
have become suspect to a great part of the American public.  They are
suspected of ignoring the national interest.
<P>
      This present decade, just begun, will be a time when the United
States of America must make irrevocable decisions, in affairs domestic
and affairs international.  We would be foolish to fancy that a pax
Americana will settle upon the world.  Rather, our situation is very
like that of Britain just two centuries ago.  As Burke wrote then:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> I despair neither of the public fortune nor of the public
      mind.  There is much to be done undoubtedly, and much to be
      retrieved.  We must walk in new ways, or we can never
      encounter our enemy in his devious march.  We are not at an
      end of our struggle, nor near it.  Let us not deceive
      ourselves; we are at the beginning of great troubles.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Party Reform. Just so.  In our time of troubles, either great
political party requires high prudence, high imagination, high
honesty.  Surely the Bush Administration, which I criticized somewhat
mordantly in the course of my preceding Heritage lecture in this
series, ought to be the object of severe but honest scrutiny by the
opposing Democrats.  There are yet active in the Democratic ranks many
honorable men and women capable of working a party reform.  May they
come forward, for the sake of the Republic!
<P>
      After all, reform is within the power of honest members of the
party.  Here I quote Burke's Thoughts on the Present Discontents once
more:
<P>
     <BLOCKQUOTE> Until a confidence in government is re-established, the
      people ought to be excited to a more strict and detailed
      attention to the conduct of their representatives. 
      Standards for judging more systematically upon their
      conduct ought to be settled in the meetings of counties and
      corporations.  Frequent and correct lists of the voters in
      all important questions ought to be procured.
<P>
      By such means something may be done.  By such means it may
      appear who those are that, by an indiscriminate support of
      all administrations, have totally banished all integrity
      and confidence out of public proceedings; have confounded
      the best men with the worst; and weakened and dissolved,
      instead of strengthening and compacting, the general frame
      of government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      From the precinct and the township upward, conceivably, the
Democratic Party may be chastened and reinvigorated.  Certain
Democratic office-holders need to be taught afresh the old lesson,
"Honesty is the best policy."  In a genuine parliamentary system, at
least two strong and principled parties are required.  A party
dominated by frauds and fantastics cannot long endure.  If the
Democrats fail at reform, some other party, the nature of which cannot
now be predicted, will supplant the Democratic Party.  That is what
happened to the Liberal party in Britain.  Democratic reform lacking,
the American public may be tempted to shout an old Republican partisan
cry:  "Rotten eggs and dead cats are good enough for Democrats!"

<P>

      Now that the United States has become, temporarily, the greatest
power in the world, some of us recall an observation, half a century
ago, by the French writer Andre Siegfried:  "The United States is the
only country to have passed from barbarism to decadence without having
known civilization."  At the end of the twentieth century, have
Americans intelligence and imagination sufficient to lead the peoples
of the world?  Indeed, do Americans possess talents sufficient to
maintain their present degree of security and prosperity?
<P>
      These are grave, if not fatal, questions.  Decisions are being
made nowadays, in public policies abroad and at home, that may be
irrevocable.  And it appears that such decisions may be based upon
erroneous assumptions.
  <P>    Therefore I offer you during this year of our Lord one thousand
nine hundred and ninety-one, ladies and gentlemen, a series of four
lectures on the general topic "Political Errors at the End of the
Twentieth Century."  My first lecture, to be delivered to you this
very day, is entitled "Republican Errors"; the second, this spring,
will be "Democratic Errors"; the third, in summer or fall, will be
"International Errors"; the concluding one, "The Politics of Reality,"
when I will suggest some paths to truth in public policy.
<P>
      I commence with an examination of the state of mind and heart in
America's two great political parties; and of the two, I venture first
to touch upon certain errors prevalent in the Republican Party.  I
have known various Republican presidents, presidential candidates,
members of Congress, governors, and other party leaders, all the way
from Herbert Hoover to my friend and neighbor, John Engler, very
recently elected governor of Michigan against heavy odds:  From time
to time I have had a hand in their campaigns, especially in those of
Senator Goldwater.  I was on cordial terms with President Nixon and
President Reagan.  My wife and I succeeded in reconciling the several
factions of the Republican Party in Michigan, on the eve of the
national convention which chose Mr.  Bush as the party's nominee for
the presidency.  So you will understand, ladies and gentlemen, that in
my lamenting of the present state of Republican leadership in
Washington, I am more moved by sorrow than by wrath.
<P>
      Stolid Party. During this twentieth century the Republican Party
has been more stolid than imaginative.  It has attracted public
support by its appearance of practicality, its defense of private
property and of a competitive economy, its reluctance -- most of the
time -- to embark upon adventures abroad.  Although praised as the
party of industry and business, also, at least in my Michigan
backwoods, Republicans were the representatives of the rural interest. 
In short, it has been a broad-based party which, in recent decades,
has made considerable gains in the region that used to be the Solid
South.  Of presidents taking office since World War II, five have been
Republican, three Democratic.  The tremendous margins of victory
enjoyed by Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush in their
presidential campaigns seemed to suggest that the Republican Party
might sweep away the Democratic Party within a few years, as long
before the Federalist Party, and the Whig, had gone to the wall.
<P>
      Yet the Republican Party, which achieved its greatest vigor in
this century during the presidential terms of Ronald Reagan, now seems
in the sere and yellow leaf.  Permit me to discuss with you, for a
quarter of an hour, the domestic errors of the Republican national
administration, and then to examine, for the second quarter of an
hour, that administration's blunders in foreign policy.
<P>
      My task with respect to the fiscal measures of the Bush
Administration is made the easier for me by Dr.  Edwin Feulner's
"State of Conservatism, 1991" message, entitled "Fashionably Out of
Fashion Again."  I concur heartily in his observation that "after more
than eight years of steady growth, a combination of new federal taxes,
out-of control spending increasing, and suffocating regulatory burdens
have conspired to send the economy into spasms."  Federal expenditure
soon will exceed a quarter of the gross national product; the deficits
for the present fiscal year and for the fiscal year 1992 will be the
largest in the history of the United States.  The reforms of income
tax and inheritance tax, worked in the Reagan years, are undone.  As
socialism dissolves in Eastern Europe, in the United States, an
unofficial and unproclaimed form of socialism gains ground. 
<P>
      Why has this come to pass?  Why does a national administration
elected on a conservative platform offer such feeble resistance to
measures advocated by doctrinaire liberals.
<P>
      "Rockefeller Republicans."  Why, one ought not to blame Mr. 
Bush unduly.  When he stood for the Republican presidential nomination
against Mr.  Reagan in 1980, of necessity he turned for support to the
liberal wing of the Republican Party.  That wing had insufficient
strength to secure him the nomination; but in the course of the
contest he acquired advisors and helpers best classified as
"Rockefeller Republicans."  Those people, some of them eminent, are at
his side still, and have his ear.
<P>
      An anecdote will illustrate my point.  While, in 1988, Mr.  Bush
was campaigning vigorously, I was invited to confer with an inner
circle of his staff, in Washington.  Mr.  Bush was busy elsewhere, but
kindly telephoned me during the course of the discussion.  One of the
pieces of advice I had offered to the Bush people there was to
emphasize Mr.  Bush's opposition to abortion-on-demand; I said he has
consistently advocated the sound policy of returning the abortion
question to the police powers of the several states.  My remark was
received with an embarrassed silence; clearly some people present very
much favored abortion.  A little later I pointed out that in national
publicity, the Bush campaign should refer repeatedly to Mr.  Bush's
conservatism.
<P>
      "What has he done that's conservative?"  inquired, perhaps
rhetorically, a Young Lion of the Bush.  I might have pointed to his
intelligently conservative years in the House of Representatives, but
contented myself at the moment by suggesting that others present might
know Mr.  Bush's principal views and utterances better than I did. 
Some of Mr.  Bush's people there present in the headquarters shivered
at that dread word "conservative."
<P>
      I am suggesting that all presidents, in some degree, are held
captive by the inner circles of the Executive Force, their own
Executive Force.  I doubt whether President Bush himself inclined
initially to the fiscal measures that presently he accepted; but those
close about him persuaded him of the need for such damaging
concessions to liberals' demands.
<P>
      Now the Republican Party long boasted of its frugality.  The
Bush Administration, on the contrary, has stolen some of the
Democrats' old clothes while the sons of Jefferson and Jackson were
out bathing.  But those purloined garments are ragged; and Republicans
look odd and unconvincing when clad in them. 
<P>
      Oppressive Taxation. With respect to a sharp increase in the
level of taxes, it seems as if the Bush Administration really does not
understand the principle of diminishing returns, or know the history
of the consequences of excessive taxation.  When computing our federal
income tax very recently, my wife and I discovered that more than half
our gross income is taken in taxation -- federal income tax; Social
Security taxes; state income taxes; village, township, and county
taxes, school property tax; sales taxes.  And we are not of the number
of Franklin Roosevelt's "malefactors of great wealth."  We are in the
process of educating four young daughters, paying off mortgages,
trying to save something for one's declining years -- I, being
seventy-two years of age already -- and contributing to charitable
causes.  Yet we are better off than many taxpayers.  What straw will
break the camel's back?
<P>
      A state that annually exacts in taxes half of a citizen's income
is more oppressive, financially, than the despotisms of old.  In the
ancient monarchies of China, a tax load of more than ten percent would
have been thought unjust.  Excessive taxation is a major cause of the
decline and fall of great states:  so writes C.  Northcote Parkinson,
the author of Parkinson's Law, in his last book.
<P>
      "Taxation, taken to the limit and beyond, has always been a sign
of decadence and a prelude to disaster," as Parkinson puts it.  "For
government expenditure is the chief cause of inflation and is also the
means of government interference in commercial, industrial, and social
life.  Where evil has been averted it has normally been from lack of
funds.  Where evil has been done it was usually because the
perpetrators had money to spend."
<P>
      Billion Dollars Daily.  The Bush Administration had one handsome
prospect for reducing governmental expenditure, reducing the federal
deficit, and possibly even making a gesture at reduction of the
federal debt:  that is, the prospective contraction of the armed
forces, what with the dwindling of the Soviet menace.  Instead, Mr. 
Bush has plunged the United States into a war which, so far, has cost
about a billion dollars a day.  (You will recall that a billion
dollars is a thousand million dollars.) Already, more taxation to pay
for this struggle in the Levant is being discussed in Washington.  So
I quote Parkinson once more:  "Taxes become heavier in time of war and
should diminish, by rights, when the war is over.  That is not,
however, what happens.  Although sometimes lowered when the war ends,
taxes seldom regain their pre-war level.  That is because the level of
expenditure rises to meet the war-time level of taxation."
<P>
      Unless the Bush Administration abruptly reverses its fiscal and
military course, I suggest, the Republican Party must lose its former
good repute for frugality, and become the party of profligate
expenditure, "butter and guns."  And public opinion would not long
abide that.  Nor would America's world influence and America's
remaining prosperity.
<P>
      But, time running on, I must turn to affairs diplomatic and
military:  Republican errors internationally.  What are we to say of
Mr.  Bush's present endeavor to bring to pass a gentler, kinder New
World Order?
<P>
      Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon
Johnson were enthusiasts for American domination of the world.  Now
George Bush appears to be emulating those eminent Democrats.  When the
Republicans, once upon a time, nominated for the presidency a "One
World" candidate, Wendell Willkie, they were sadly trounced.  In
general, Republicans throughout the twentieth century have been
advocates of prudence and restraint in the conduct of foreign affairs.
<P>
      But Mr.  Bush, out of mixed motives, has embarked upon a radical
course of intervention in the region of the Persian Gulf.  After
carpet-bombing the Cradle of Civilization as no country ever had been
bombed before, Mr.  Bush sent in hundreds of thousands of soldiers to
overrun the Iraqi bunkers -- that were garrisoned by dead men,
asphyxiated.
<P>
      And for what reason?  The Bush Administration found it difficult
to answer that question clearly.  In the beginning it was implied that
the American national interest required low petroleum prices: 
therefore, if need be, smite and spare not!
<P>
      That excuse reminds me of Burke's rebuke to the Pitt ministry in
1795, when it appeared that the British government was about to go to
war with France over the question of the navigation of the River
Scheldt, in the Netherlands.  "A war for the Scheldt?  A war for a
chamber-pot!"  Burke exclaimed.  Now one may say, "A war for Kuwait? 
A war for an oilcan!"
<P>
      "The blood of a man should never be shed but to redeem the blood
of man," Burke wrote in his first Letter on a Regicide Peace.  "It is
well shed for our family, for our friends, for our God, for our
country, for our kind.  The rest is vanity; the rest is crime."  Burke
was eager that England declare war against France because of the
menace of the French revolutionaries to the civilized order of Europe,
and because of their systematic crimes.  But he set his face against
war for mere commercial advantage.  So should Republicans.  "The rest
is vanity; the rest is crime."
<P>
      War for Righteousness. A war for an oilcan not turning out to be
popular, however, President Bush turned moralist; he professed to be
engaged in redeeming the blood of man; and his breaking of Iraq is to
be the commencement of his beneficent New World Order.  Mr.  Bush has
waged what Sir Herbert Butterfield, in his little book Christianity,
Diplomacy, and War, calls "The War for Righteousness."  As Butterfield
begins the third chapter of that book, "It has been held by
technicians of politics in recent times that democracies can only be
keyed up to modern war -- only brought to the necessary degree of
fervor -- provided they are whipped into moral indignation and heated
to fanaticism by the thought that they are engaged in a 'war for
righteousness'." 
<P>
      Now indubitably Saddam Hussein is unrighteous; but so are nearly
all the masters of the "emergent" African states (with the Ivory Coast
as a rare exception), and so are the grim ideologues who rule China,
and the hard men in the Kremlin, and a great many other public figures
in various quarters of the world.  Why, I fancy that there are some
few unrighteous men, conceivably, in the domestic politics of the
United States.  Are we to saturation-bomb most of Africa and Asia into
righteousness, freedom, and democracy?  And, having accomplished that,
however would we ensure persons yet more unrighteous might not rise up
instead of the ogres we had swept away?  Just that is what happened in
the Congo, remember, three decades ago; and nowadays in Zaire, once
called the Belgian Congo, we zealously uphold with American funds the
dictator Mobutu, more blood-stained than Saddam.  And have we
forgotten Castro in Cuba?
<P>
      Momentum of Its Own. I doubt whether much good is going to come
out of the slaughter of perhaps a hundred thousand people in Iraq. 
"For one of the troubles of war," Butterfield writes, "is that it
acquires its own momentum and plants its own ideals on our shoulders,
so that we are carried far away from the purposes with which we began
-- carried indeed sometimes to greater acts of spoilation than the
ones which had provoked our original entry into the war.  Before the
war of 1914 had lasted a year, its own workings had generated such a
mood that we had promised Russia Constantinople and had bought the
alliance of Italy with offers of booty, some of which had later to be
disavowed by President Wilson.  And it is a remarkable fact that in
wars which purport to be so ethical that the states attached to
neutrality are sometimes regarded as guilty of a dereliction of duty,
the great powers primarily concerned may have required an iniquitous
degree of bribery to bring them into the conflict, or to maintain
their fidelity.  The whole ideal of moderate peace aims, and the whole
policy of making war the servant (instead of the master) of
negotiation, is impossible -- and the whole technique of the 'war for
righteousness' has a particularly sinister application -- when even in
the ostensibly 'defending' party there is a latent and concealed
aggressiveness of colossal scope, as there certainly was in 1914."
<P>
      You may perceive some parallels between Butterfield's
description of the course of the Allies during World War I and the
course, so far, of the coalition against Iraq.  Already there is talk
of what shall be done with the "remains of Iraq."  Mr.  James Baker
talks of rebuilding Iraq; others talk of dismantling Iraq altogether,
by way of spoilation.  And what promises and bribes were provided by
the government of the United States, in recent months, to secure the
assent of such murderous governments as that of Ethiopia to strong
measures against Iraq; to secure, indeed, by holding out prospects of
massive economic aid, the cooperation of the Soviet Union, Iraq's
former patron?
<P>
      Was not Egypt's cooperation obtained by forgiving the Egyptian
government's indebtedness of several billion dollars?  Was not Syria's
assent gained by America's ignoring of the Syrian conquest of the
Lebanon, with a massacre of General Aoun's Christian army?  What began
as determination to restore a legitimate (if somewhat arbitrary)
government in Kuwait may result in the overturn of several governments
in the Levant.  As for regarding neutral states as guilty of
dereliction of duty -- why, the United States has done just that to
Jordan, by cutting off economic aid at the very time when Jordan is
crammed with destitute refugees from Iraq.
<P>
      Disagreeable Consequences.  In short, deliberate entry into war
commonly brings on consequences disagreeable even to the seeming
victors.  Prudent statesmen long have known that armed conflict, for
all involved, ought to be the last desperate resort, to be entered
upon only when all means of diplomacy, conciliation, and compromise
have been exhausted.  In Iraq, we have crushed an insect with the club
of Hercules.  Temporarily, Mr.  Bush's stroke is popular.  When a
democracy goes to war, at first there occurs a wave of enthusiasm: 
"Bop the Wop; sap the Jap; get the Hun on the run!"  But afterward,
when troubles arise.... 
<P>
      True, we did not suffer a long war in the deserts of Kuwait and
Iraq.  But we must expect to suffer during a very long period of
widespread hostility toward the United States -- even, or perhaps
especially, from the people of certain states that America bribed or
bullied into combining against Iraq.
<P>
      In Egypt, in Syria, in Pakistan, in Algeria, in Morocco, in all
of the world of Islam, the masses now regard the United States as
their arrogant adversary; while the Soviet Union, by virtue of its
endeavors to mediate the quarrel in its later stages, may pose again
as the friend of Moslem lands.  Nor is this all:  for now, in every
continent, the United States is resented increasingly as the last and
most formidable of imperial systems.
<P>
      In this century, great empires have collapsed:  the Austrian,
the German, the British, the French, the Dutch, the Portuguese, the
Spanish, the Italian, and the Japanese.  The Soviet empire now
languishes in the process of dissolution.  "Imperialism" has become a
term of bitter reproach and complaint; all this within my own
lifetime.
<P>
      American Empire.  But there remains an American Empire, still
growing -- though expanding through the acquisition of client states,
rather than through settlement of American populations abroad.  Among
the client states directly dependent upon American military power are
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Israel, and El Salvador; and until the
withdrawal of American divisions from Germany for service in Arabia,
Germany, too, was a military client.  Dependent upon American
assistance of one kind or another, and in some degree upon American
military protection, are the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, and
Panama; and also, in the Levant, Egypt and Jordan, and formerly
Lebanon.  Now Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are added to the roster of
clients.  I hardly need mention America's earlier acquisitions: 
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgins, and lesser islands.  I refrain from
mentioning America's economic ascendancy, through foreign aid or
merely trade, over a great deal more of the world.  In short, although
we never talk about our empire, a tremendous American Empire has come
into existence -- if, like the Roman Empire, in a kind of fit of
absence of mind.  No powerful counterpoise to the American hegemony
seems to remain, what with the enfeebling of the U.S.S.R.
<P>
      Such a universal ascendancy always has been resented by the
lesser breeds without the law.  Soon there sets to work a widespread
impulse to pull down the imperial power.  But that imperial power,
strong in weapons, finds it possible for a time to repress the
disobedient.  In the long run -- well, as Talleyrand put it, "You can
do everything with bayonets -- except sit on them."  In the long run,
the task of repression is too painful a burden to bear; so the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union has discovered in the past few
years.  Napoleon discovered that hard truth earlier and King George
III and the King's Friends discovered it between the years 1775 and
1781.  Doubtless George Bush means well by the world near the end of
the twentieth century.  He is a man of order, diligent, dutiful,
honest, and a good family man.  But he lacks imagination, "the vision
thing."  And power intoxicates; and, as Lord Acton put it, power tends
to corrupt.  The love of power tends to corrupt both speech and
actions.  It may corrupt a grave national undertaking into a personal
vendetta.  It may corrupt what began as a chivalric rescue into a
heavy belligerent domination.  (Talk continues to come to our ears of
a "permanent American presence" in the Persian Gulf.)
<P>
      President Bush and Americans of his views doubtless intend the
American hegemony to be gentler and kinder than the sort of hegemony
that prevailed in the ancient Persian Empire, say; more just even than
the Roman hegemony that gave peace, for some centuries, to several
lands -- relative peace, anyway, at the price of crushing taxation and
the extinction of earlier cultures.  But devastating Iraq (and the
rescued Kuwait) is an uncompromising way of opening an era of
sweetness and light.  Peoples so rescued from tyrants might cry, as
did the boy whom Don Quixote de la Mancha had saved from beating by
the muleteers but who was thrashed by them not long later,
nevertheless -- "In the name of God, Don Jorge de la Casablanca, don't
rescue me again!"
<P>
      Don Jorge de la Casablanca has toppled and imprisoned one
Central American despot -- somewhat small fry -- and is in the process
of dealing after the same fashion with one Mesopotamian despot,
somewhat larger fry.  "Well done!"  some cry.  It has all been rather
like deer hunting in my Michigan back woods.
<P>
      Yet presidents of the United States must not be encouraged to
make Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, nor to fancy that they can
establish a New World Order through eliminating dissenters.  In the
second century before Christ, the Romans generously liberated the
Greek city-states from the yoke of Macedonia.  But it was not long
before the Romans felt it necessary to impose upon those quarrelsome
Greeks a domination more stifling to Hellenic freedom and culture than
ever Macedon had been.  It is a duty of the Congress of the United
States to see that great American Caesars do not act likewise.
<P>
      Echo of 1984.  If that duty is forgotten, before many years are
out we may receive such television communications as follows.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      The voice from the telescreen paused.  A trumpet call,
      clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air.  The
      voice continued raspingly:
<P>
      "Attention!  Your attention please!  A newsflash has this
      moment arrived from the Malabar front.  Our forces in South
      India have won a glorious victory.  I am authorized to say
      that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war
      within a measurable distance of its end.  Here is the
      newsflash -- "
<P>
      Bad news coming, thought Winston.  And sure enough,
      following a gory description of the annihilation of a
      Eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and
      prisoners, came the announcement that, as of next week, the
      chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grams to
      twenty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

      Perhaps you have already recognized the preceding passage from
Orwell's 1984.  Orwell describes our world of 1991, too.  Perpetual
War for Perpetual Peace comes to pass in an era of Righteousness --
that is, national or ideological self-righteousness in which the
public is persuaded that "God is on our side," and that those who
disagree should be brought here before the bar as war criminals.
<P>
      I shall have more to say about such concerns in my Third
Heritage lecture this year.  Just now I conclude my thoughts on
Republican errors by suggesting that it would be ruinous for the
Republicans to convert themselves into a party of high deeds in
distant lands and higher taxes on the home front.  Such a New World
Order, like the Pax Romana, might create a wilderness and call it
peace; at best, it would reduce the chocolate ration from thirty grams
to twenty.  And in the fullness of time, the angry peoples of the
world would pull down the American Empire, despite its military
ingenuity and its protestations of kindness and gentleness -- even as
the Soviet Empire is being pulled down today, thanks be to God.

<P> 
From time to time, I am asked what I believe to be the greatest difficulty the American Republic confronts 
nowadays. I reply that our most puzzling and distressing social misfortune is the growth of a proletariat. 
 <p>
Let us define our terms. The words <i>proletariat</I> and <i>proletarian</i> come down to us from 
Roman times. In the Roman signification of the term, a proletarian is a man who gives nothing to the 
commonwealth but his progeny. Such a being pays no taxes, subsists at public expense, fulfills no civic 
duties, performs no work worth mentioning, and knows not the meaning of piety. As a mass, the collective 
proletarians, the proletariat, are formidable; they demand entitlements-principally, in antique times, bread 
and circuses; in our day, much larger entitlements, which are granted to them lest they turn collectively 
violent. To the state, I repeat, the proletarian contributes only his offspring-who in their turn, ordinarily, 
become proletarians. Idle, ignorant, and often criminal, the proletariat can ruin a great city-and a nation. 
What Arnold Toynbee calls "the internal proletariat" so dragged down the Roman civilization; the 
barbarian invaders, the "external proletariat," burst through the fragile shell of a culture already bled to 
death. 
<p> 
Karl Marx, that hard hater of the patrimony of modern civilization, called upon the modern proletariat to 
arise and shed blood on a grand scale. Triumphant in the Russian empire after the World War I, and in 
Eastern Europe and many other regions of the world not long after World War II, Marx's ideological 
disciples installed brutal proletarians in power, at least on the local level, where they were as merciless as 
they were stupid. The proletarian cannot build; but he is able to destroy. 
 <p>
The United States of America, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the early decades of the 
twentieth, was not afflicted by a proletariat on any large national scale -though Jefferson feared the coming 
of such a class when cities should grow. And Macaulay in 1857 foretold a "downward progress" in 
America at the end of which he said, "Either some Caesar or Napoleon will seize the reins of government 
with a strong hand, or your republic will be as fearfully plundered and laid waste by barbarians in the 
twentieth century as the Roman Empire in the fifth." 
<p> 
<b>Voting Proletariat.</b> As Macaulay pointed out with some force, in the United States the proletariat would be 
possessed not merely of the power of intimidation through violence, but of the yet more effective power of 
the ballot box. "Your Huns and Vandals," he went on, "will have been engendered within your own 
country by your own institutions." 
<p> 
Now in America today, whom do we specify when we talk of a proletariat, a rootless and discontented 
class that is a burden upon the commonwealth? It is necessary first to specify groups that we do <i>not</i> 
have in mind. 
<p>
The proletariat is not identical with "the poor." Although most proletarians are poor, a man may be rich and 
yet a proletarian if he is nothing better than a vexation to the commonwealth and has the mind of a 
proletarian. Also, there are many people of very modest income who nevertheless are people of 
commendable character and good citizens. Incidentally, I am given to quoting an aside by Robert Frost 
when he was conversing with liberal friends: "Don't talk about the poor all the time!" The poor we have 
always with us, as Jesus of Nazareth instructs us. 
<p> 
The proletarian is not identical with "the workingman"-indeed, it is characteristic of the proletarian that he 
does <i>not</i> work voluntarily. I was reared almost literally in the Pere Marquette railway yards outside 
Detroit, my father a locomotive engineman and fireman; were not proletarians, nor were my schoolmates 
and their parents. 
<p> 
The proletarian is not identical with the "welfare recipient," even though the vast majority of proletarians 
are on the welfare rolls. For of course among the recipients of local, state, and federal relief and 
entitlements are many elderly, infirm, or otherwise distressed people who are not so unfortunate as to share 
the proletarian mentality and morality. 
<p> 
The proletarian population is not an urban population only. Increasingly, the proletarian condition of life 
spreads even into remote rural districts. In my backwoods or backwater Michigan village, a dismal rookery 
of decaying trailers, immobilized "mobile homes," hems in my tall archaic house; the sale of narcotics 
proceeds in our village's public park; and the rate of crimes, especially offenses against women, rises 
annually. The village's only church has been converted into an antique shop. 
<p> 
The proletariat, in short, is a mass of people who have lost-if ever they possessed-community, hope of 
betterment, moral convictions, habits of work, sense of personal responsibility, intellectual curiosity, 
membership in a healthy family, property, active participation in public concerns, religious associations, 
and awareness of ends or objectives in human existence. Most proletarians live, as dogs do, from day to 
day, unreflective. The <I>lazzaroni</I> of Naples, I suppose, for centuries have existed in such a 
proletarian condition; but the <i>lazzaroni</i> of American cities and countryside, proliferating in recent 
years, are more aggressive than their Neapolitan counterparts. 
<p> 
<b>Demise of Cities.</b> The cores of many American cities now are dominated by the proletariat; or if not the 
core in some cities, then a-grim and dangerous urban ring encircling the core. Some thirty years ago, dining 
with the economist Colin Clark at an Oxford inn, I remarked that I did not know what would become of 
America's cities. Professor Clark replied, "I know: they will cease to exist." He went on to suggest that 
suburbs beyond a city's political boundaries would survive, surrounding a devastated and demolished and 
depopulated accumulation of ruins, the former urban area looking much as if it had been showered with gel 
bombs, after the fashion employed against Dresden at the end of World War II. With dismaying speed just 
that has been coming to pass. 
<p> 
Permit me to turn to striking instances. I have known the city of Detroit ever since I was a small boy-that 
is, for more than half a century, during which the "arsenal of democracy" has been quite thoroughly 
proletarianized. When I was a college student and wandered the streets of Detroit every weekend, the city 
had a population of two million; now it has one million The art institute, the public library, the Detroit 
historical museum, and Wayne State University survive, for the present, along with some tall stone 
churches, in the midst of an overwhelming decadence. On the campus of the University, telephone kiosks 
have been erected at short intervals. In these structures, the telephone is installed at ground level, so that 
persons wounded or violated conceivably may crawl to the kiosk and pull the phone off its hook; even if no 
words are spoken, a police patrol is supposed to investigate. Such is the intellectual life of Detroit in the 
year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ninety. 
<p> 
<b>Detroit's Decay.</b> Tempting although it might be to offer to you vignettes of existence in proletarian Detroit, 
I have not world enough and time. Some persons present already may have read the very recent book by 
Ze'ev Chafets, <i>Devil's Night and Other True Tales of Detroit;</I> or have seen my own article on 
Detroit's Devil's Night, published in Newsday two years ago; or have seen the television program some 
weeks past that infuriated the foul-mouthed demagogue who is mayor of Detroit; or have been somewhat 
startled by a piece in <i>The New Yorker</I> revealing the miserable and depraved proletarian condition 
in which that mayor deliberately keeps the rising generation virtual prisoners in a ghetto. In any event, I do 
not suppose that any person present today is quite uninformed concerning the degradation of what once 
was a booming and hopeful city with some culture of its own. 
<p> 
What worked the ruin of Detroit, proletarian zing the place? The complex causes of this decay have been at 
work in most other American cities, too; but they were especially acute in Detroit. I venture to list some of 
the principal afflictions. 
<p> 
First, the automobile, though it brought a great deal of money into the city and much increased its 
population, nevertheless did mischief to what had been a rather pleasant and peaceful big town on a 
principal inland waterway. Ford and the other automobile manufacturers recruited labor wherever they 
could find it, especially from Central and Eastern Europe and from the Southern states; the masses of semi-
skilled or unskilled men who came to the automobile factories were uprooted, cut off often from some 
traditional rural culture. With American thought, politics, and manners most of them never obtained much 
acquaintance. They became deculturalized, rather than acculturated, and demagogues found them easy 
prey. So as late as 1932, by the way, the most conservative "minority" or ethnic group in the city were the 
blacks of the Paradise Valley ward, stout Republicans who stood by Herbert Hoover. They were also very 
nearly the poorest bloc in Detroit. 
<p> 
<b>Abandoning the City.</b> Second, the triumphant automobile made it possible for the more affluent Detroiters 
to build houses in the suburbs, particularly in the Grosse Pointes, abandoning their mansions near the heart 
of the city. With the coming of the New Deal, this outflow of ability and wealth from the old city was 
much accelerated by the Home Owners Loan Corporation and later programs of low-interest loans, 
federally backed, available to people who were good credit risks; thus increasingly the old city was drained 
of merchants, manufacturers, professional people, bankers, and skilled craftsmen-leaving a vacuum to be 
filled successively by ethnic and economic groups of decreasing means and talent for leadership. The 
shifting of Henry Ford from a little house on Bagley Avenue, near the city's heart, to a great rustic estate 
near Dearborn, is sufficient illustration of this. The same flitting occurred in most other American cities, of 
course-New York and San Francisco being the chief, if partial, exceptions. 
 <p>
Third, military production in "the arsenal of democracy" during the Second World War attracted to Detroit 
great numbers of industrial workers, chiefly Appalachian whites ("hillbillies" to natives of Michigan) and 
Southern blacks. To the number of the latter were soon added more Southern blacks left technologically 
unemployed by the perfection of the mechanical cotton picker and other alterations of the economic 
patterns of Dixie. People whose ancestors had been settled for several generations in place and in customs 
south of the Mason-Dixon Line found themselves in Detroit, bewildered, often resentful, and shaken in 
their beliefs and habits. 
<p> 
Fourth, with the ending of war production these people were short of work and money- and often in social 
or moral confusion. Divorce, and desertion of wives and children, became common in Detroit and other 
cities; out of this arose the successive programs for Aid to Dependent Children, federally financed, and 
well intentioned. But out of this humanitarian scheme came the one-parent family, the welfare household 
on a huge scale, the street-corner gangs of bored and idle youths who looked up to the brothel keeper, the 
numbers racketeer and presently the drug pusher, those ingenious successful men. And presently the first 
generation of such dependent children fathered a second dependent generation; and then the second 
generation fathered a third-these true proletarians giving nothing to the commonwealth but their progeny-
which progeny in turn would emulate their fathers and mothers 
<p> 
Much of the old city grew shabby, and some of it dangerous, in consequence of the changes I suggested 
just now; yet still, in the Forties, I walked mean streets unarmed, at all hours. By the Fifties, I adopted the 
precaution of wearing a sheath knife when I walked those mean streets, Michigan Avenue included, 
nocturnally; later, I carried a pistol. By the Sixties, it was well not to walk those streets except under 
necessity. Incidentally, it became necessary for the most part either to drive a car or to walk public 
transportation dwindling: the city never had built a subway, which might have been done readily during the 
Depression years; and gradually the streetcar system withered on the vine. If one was careless, old, infirm, 
or timid-well, one could stay home, vegetating-though corner groceries were vanishing, too. 
<p>
<b>Federal Bulldozer.</b> The city's decay having become physically obvious, why not knock much of it down 
and start all over again? So argued the enthusiasts for the "urban renewal" of the administration of 
President Johnson. What resulted were urban deserts and urban jungles, not renewal; great profits, though, 
were made by eminent developers and contractors. Here was a fifth cause of Detroit's collapse: the 
deliberate destruction of the neighborhoods of people of modest incomes, together with many small 
businesses. The newcomers to Detroit had only begun to settle into tolerable community, to find a church 
to attend, to obtain fairly regular employment, to come to understand the city-when down the street came 
the federal bulldozer. Where to flee now? Why, to newish, ugly, often dangerous public housing projects-
of which there were not enough to go round; or else to double up in some surviving low-rent district, which 
in consequence would become a slum. 
<p> 
Permit me to digress, so as to offer you a graphic example. Detroit's Corktown, a century ago crowded with 
newly-arrived Irishmen, is a district little more than a mile distant from the old handsome City Hall (itself 
demolished wantonly as part and parcel of that wondrous Urban Renewal). In the late Forties and early 
Fifties, Corktown was rather a pleasant quarter of well-built old houses, near Briggs Stadium and the 
boozing-dens that lined Michigan Avenue, Detroit's Skid Row. The people who lived in Corktown were a 
rather elderly generation of Irish-old women, chiefly; and also men employed in the printing trades at the 
nearby plants of the Detroit <i>News</I> and the <i>Detroit Free Press,</i> earners of high wages; and a 
great many Maltese, family people, Catholics, one of Detroit's many "minorities." An old Catholic church, 
Most Holy Trinity, was the center of Corktown's identity. 
<p> 
At the beginning of massive federal-financed "renewal," zealous civic planners noticed on their maps that 
apparently Corktown suffered from a high rate of robbery-and of disorderly conduct, too. Had they 
scrutinized their map more closely, they might have discerned that the crime-chiefly mugging of 
intoxicated men-occurred almost entirely along Michigan Avenue, the alcoholic paradise of the lowly in 
Detroit-and distinctly not in the residential streets of Corktown itself; it merely happened that Michigan 
Avenue formed the boundary of part of Corktown. But the city planners drew no such fine distinctions; 
according to the statistics available, crimes occurred in a quarter called Corktown. What to do? Why, 
renew Corktown by pulling it down and later building factories there. How does one get rid of rats? Why, 
by burning down the barn of course. To get rid of old Corktown would be to get rid of crime. On this first 
grand project of urban renewal, the federal bulldozers went to work, clearing away many interesting 
houses, clearing out a great many families long settled there; eventually they demolished the last place of 
public resort in Corktown, a modest restaurant; they did spare a large second-hand bookshop lodged in an 
old house- but spared no other business. 
<p> 
<b>Poverty War Casualties.</b> I came to know Corktown well while this mischief was in progress. Did crime 
cease? Why, there had been little or no crime to abolish in Corktown's residential streets. But now crimes 
commenced in the rubble-strewn vacant lots, and the surviving dwellings stood always in danger of 
invasion. Left with no place to resort, gangs of boys began to fight among themselves and to snatch 
women's purses. Presently the gangs took up profitable rackets, and gang murders occurred. This was one 
means of obtaining relief from boredom, in a district made grittily hideous-even the trees had been cut 
down -by the civic improvers. I knew one of the lads indicted for murder, an amiable young man with 
some taste in architecture. He had been forced into a gang for survival; he hated what was being done to 
Corktown by the civic renewers. 
<p> 
At that time I was courting a redheaded girl who was engaged in charitable work, unpaid, in connection 
with the parish of Most Holy Trinity. She lived near the church in an apartment house that had seen better 
days, and was then inhabited by elderly Irishwomen who dared not go out of doors for dread of having 
their purses snatched and themselves beaten. I offered Mary the loan of a pistol of mine, that apartment 
house being a chancy place; but she declined the weapon, saying that if the boys should learn she possessed 
anything of the sort, they would break in to snatch the gun. 
<p> 
But I must not prolong this digression. My immediate point is that the very process of public policy, the 
misguided urban-renewal fiasco, did much to turn the remaining inhabitants of Corktown into proletarians. 
Now that most of Corktown's old population has been expelled, has died, or has fled, some gestures toward 
architectural restoration and even repopulation have been made in Corktown: gentrification may come to 
pass. That is pleasant news, but there linger in my memory the faces of certain honest ungenteel 
Corktowners who were reduced to poverty and indeed to a proletarian state by Lyndon Johnson's "war on 
poverty," more accurately described as war upon the poor. 
<p> 
When the tremendous Detroit riot of 1967 occurred, some of the rioters, as they threw bottles of gasoline to 
burn down shops, cried mockingly, "Instant urban renewal!" They were not grateful for the ministrations of 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Governor George Romney, in his last public address 
before leaving Michigan to take a cabinet post in Washington, declared that the riot-almost an insurrection-
had been caused by resentment against urban renewal and federal highway building. Too true! 
<p> 
The Kerner Report (the author of which, you may recall, presently was sent to prison) declared that the 
fierce disorder had been a race riot, provoked by "white racism." In fact, blacks and whites were nearly 
equal in numbers among the looters and arsonists; of those arrested on suspicion of sniping, all were white 
The Great Riot was a proletarian stroke that Jack London would have relished, and not an organized black 
protest against "racism." 
<p> 
A sixth cause of the reduction of Detroit to a generally proletarian state has been the construction of 
gigantic freeways that destroyed established neighborhoods-as Governor Romney pointed out. It became 
nearly impossible to get from one old quarter of the city to another district without an automobile and 
various detours. Thousands of decent homes, many family-owned, were swept away in the remorseless 
progress of the freeway system. The new freeways sometimes became impassable barriers against access to 
a church or to shops. Forgetting that cities are places for people to live, the highway builders thought of 
Detroit as a massive inconvenience to be got into and got out of as swiftly as possible. Presently violent 
crimes against people whose cars happened to stall on a freeway became almost commonplace. 
<p> 
The seventh, and most catastrophic, cause of the reduction of Detroit to a warren for unhappy proletarians 
was middle class flight on a tremendous scale after the Great Proletarian Riot of 1967. The police had lost 
effective control of the sprawling city. Virtually all families who could find money enough to buy a house 
and a lot in the outer suburbs scurried out of old Detroit. And now, most former Detroiters have retreated 
beyond Eight Mile Road, Detroit's northern political boundary. From the Detroit River to Eight Mile Road, 
Detroit's principal thoroughfare, Woodward Avenue, is almost all ghastly dereliction, except for public 
buildings and churches. A Detroiter remarked to me recently that it is no longer possible to buy a shirt in 
downtown Detroit The great elegant department stores were abandoned or demolished years ago. 
<p> 
<b>Crumbling School System.</b> Eighth among the causes of the forming of a classless society in Detroit-that is, 
a society consisting of a single class, the proletariat-has been the crumbling of the public school system. 
Compulsory integration turned out to be worse schooling for both blacks and whites, not better; the 
abandonment of neighborhood schools alienated both parents and pupils; the tax basis for the school 
system dwindled. Schools became unpleasant and dangerous places where teachers' energies were spent 
mostly in maintaining some semblance of physical order. Public opinion polls showed that both white and 
black parents strongly objected to massive busing-but their mere opinion did them no good, decisions 
being in the hands of omniscient judges, those infallible educators. 
<p> 
You will have perceived, ladies and gentlemen, that the causes of Detroit's sickness indeed are complex: it 
is almost as if some evil genius had plotted intricately the undoing of a great metropolis. Woe unto the city! 
But let me name a ninth major cause of Detroit's undoing, the latest of the terrible afflictions: the frightful 
curse of the narcotics traffic and of widespread narcotics addiction. Possibly the city of Washington is 
worse off in this malady than is Detroit-but I doubt that. (True, Washington during the past two years has 
deprived Detroit of its former proud distinction as "Murder Capital of the United States.") Presumably it is 
unnecessary for me to describe to you the fatal consequences, personal and social, of the curse of narcotics. 
It is the proletarian who seeks hallucinatory drugs, because he retains no objective in life; and narcotics 
addiction will convert people of good prospects into empty proletarians. 
<p> 
<b>Offering Hope.</b> You may be asking yourselves at this point in my long tale of woe, what it is that still keeps 
Detroit half-alive, and functioning after a fashion. What resists proletarian despair? The Christian churches 
do. It is said that within the boundaries of Detroit stand some two thousand, five hundred churches, from 
cathedrals to scruffy store-front Bethels. Some of the black temples and tabernacles may be remarkably 
eccentric varieties of religious experience; but even the wildest of them offers some sort of hope and 
consolation beyond the decayed City of This Earth; even the smallest of these churches or quasi-churches 
is a surviving anchor of community. Fervent Christian profession still breathes into wrecked Detroit some 
life of the spirit. 
<p>
The influence of the black preacher is undiminished. In 1973, at the climax of a bitter political contest over 
abortion, I gave the chief address to Michigan's principal pro-life organization, meeting in a big hall on the 
riverf ront. Behind me on the platform, as moral and physical reinforcement, sat three or four ebony 
monoliths, huge black Baptist preachers. A white Protestant clergyman was there, too, and one public man-
William Ryan, then Speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives. (No Catholic priests ventured to 
take a visible stand on the platform.) The presence of those ebony ministers signified that we prolife 
partisans had won the day in Detroit. For when the statewide initiative for abortion-on-demand appeared on 
the ballot in November, the pro-choice people were defeated nearly two to one. Every black ward in 
Detroit voted against abortion by large majorities; in one ward, the ratio of ballots was sixteen to one 
against abortion. The proletarian, Marxist model has cast off the "fetters" of religion. But clearly there 
remains in Detroit one strong influence that impedes total proletarianization. 
<p> 
I have offered you the spectacle of Detroit in the year 1990 because probably Detroit illustrates better than 
any other city the concurrent and converging causes of the reduction of a city's population to a miserable 
proletarian state. Some people tell me that Newark is worse stricken than Detroit; Washington might be 
worse off, were it not for the restraining power, and the resources of the federal government. Possibly I 
have succeeded in persuading you that while we expend our national resources in pouring hundreds of 
thousands of men into the Arabian desert, the cities of America have become what Jefferson called them 
about the end of the eighteenth century, the social equivalents of sores upon the human body. 
<p> 
<b>Redemption and Reconstruction.</b> The tendency of the American people toward a proletarian condition-
often a drift more subtle than the processes I have mentioned today -ought to be the urgent concern of all 
genuine conservatives. The devising of any remedies or palliatives will require high power of imagination. 
Something is being done already-for instance, the federal programs for encouraging "minority" businesses. 
A number of economic innovations and reforms, to such ends, have been put forward in recent years by 
The Heritage Foundation. Of course we have no opportunity today to discuss such endeavors. 
<p> 
The main work of redemption and reconstruction, however, must come from conservatively-minded people 
who at present suffer under the dreary domination of demagogues and charlatans-self-styled "leaders" 
leading their dupes only to the proletarian condition. I have known some such restorers of responsibility 
and community who have brightened the corner where they were-among them, Elmo and Mattie Coney, of 
Indianapolis. I take it that some residents of Washington, Mayor Barry having been unseated, are taking 
arms against a sea of troubles. Courageous volunteers, not "welfare professionals," may yet preserve their 
neighbors from being converted into proletarians. 
<p> 
The recovery of a schooling that has wisdom and virtue for its ends, and which is moved by the moral 
imagination, could teach the rising generation to look for something in life beyond violent sensation; and 
could incline them toward a society of the common good, rather than a defiance of all authority. A voucher 
system for choice of schools might achieve much good within a few years. I think of an occasion on which 
some New York newspaper reporters visited a Catholic school in the South Bronx. Accustomed to the 
barbarous manners and sneering attitudes of New York's public schools, these journalists were astounded 
 when a little black girl, appointed their hostess, came gently up to them, introduced herself, kissed them all 
round, and intelligently led them from classroom to classroom. The public schools with which they had 
been familiar were turning out young proletarians, with few exceptions; the Catholic grade-school in the 
South Bronx-it was the only undamaged structure left standing for a substantial distance round about-was 
turning out the heirs of cultural patrimony, obstacles notwithstanding. 
<p> 
<b>Conserving the Legacy.</b> No effort at all is required to become a proletarian: one needs merely to submit to 
the dehumanizing and de culturizing currents of the hour, and worship the idols of the crowd. Much effort 
is required to conserve the legacy of order, freedom, and justice, of learning and art and imagination, that 
ought to be ours. Some malign spirits, in the name of equality, would have us all be proletarians together: 
the doctrine of equal misery. The conservative impulse, <i>au contraire,</i> is to rescue as many men and 
women as possible from that submerged lot in life, without object and without cheer, which is the 
proletarian condition.

All present in this room today are aware that the word "federal" does not mean "central." But the Congress of the United States, in recent decades, and frequently the Executive force, too, have been behaving as if unable to discern any distinction between the two terms. That way lies the collapse of the Constitution.
<p>
A simple instance of this occurred on Capitol Hill only nine days ago. We now have a new statute that prohibits servants of the federal government-and they are legion-from lodging in hotels (lodging at public expense, anyway) that do not have sprinklers in the ceilings of bedrooms. A few exemptions are granted, chiefly to hotels that stand less than four stories high. The act's premise is that by excluding non-complying hotels from federal patronage, virtually all innkeepers will find it necessary to install sprinklers (cost about $1,500 per room).The justification for this thoughtful legislation is that over the past six years, more than 400 persons have died in hotel fires in the United States. (Even I can master short division: this statistic, in effect, tells us that the hotel-fire death rate per annum per state has been 1.34 persons. I do not have to add statistics as to age and gender; at any rate, about one and one-third people, averaging the country over, have died in the average state in the average year, 1983-1989.) It is welt of course, to save lives; but a great many more lives might be saved by prohibiting the sale of skis through an act of Congress, or by a federal statute requiring all holders of real property to sprinkle salt on their sidewalks, whether part of the public way or private, after every snowfall.
<p>
My present point, however, is not the prudence or the expense of the act now on the statute books, but rather the political consequences of decreeing that the federal government shall prescribe and regulate all sorts of concerns previously left to the police powers of the several states and local agencies of government, or left to the sensible management of individuals, households, and firms. The Sprinkler Act is a sufficient instance of the continuing conversion of this country from a federal union for specified purposes to a centralized plebiscitary democracy, in which little discretion of choice is left to states and local communities, let alone private citizens.
<p>
<b>"Democratic Despotism."</b> Behold, Behemoth! While Americans are congratulating themselves and Europeans upon the collapse of socialist states beyond the demolished Iron Curtain, there continues to expand here in North America the empire of what Alexis deTocqueville called "democratic despotism." This is a grim tendency toward total centralization of which conservatives have long complained, in somewhat vague terms, but to which they have offered, so far, little effective resistance. Permit me to quote to you a very percipient passage in de Tocqueville's <I>Democracy in America:</I>
<p><blockquote>
I think then, that the species of oppression by which democratic nations are menaced is unlike anything that ever before existed in the world; our contemporaries will find no prototype of it in their memories. I seek in vain for an expression that will accurately convey the whole of the idea I have formed of it; the old words despotism and tyranny are inappropriate; the thing itself is new, and since I cannot name it, I must attempt to define it.
<P>
I seek to trace the novel features under which despotism may appear in the world. The first thing that strikes the observation is an innumerable multitude of men, all equal and all alike incessantly endeavoring to procure the petty and paltry pleasures with which they glut their lives. Each of them, living apart, is as a stranger to the fate of all the rest; his children and his private friends constitute to him the whole of mankind. As for the rest of his fellow citizens, he is close to them, but he does not see them; he touches them, but he does not feel them; he exists only in himself and for himself alone; and if his kindred still remain to him, he may be said at any rate to have lost his country.
<P>
Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power, which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratification and watch over their fate. That power is absolute, minute, regular, provident, and mild. It would be like the authority of a parent if, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in perpetual childhood; it is well content that the people should rejoice, provided that they think of nothing but rejoicing. For their happiness such a government willingly labors, but it chooses to be the sole agent and only arbiter of their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property, and subdivides their inheritances; what remains, but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living?
<P>
Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the will within a narrower range and gradually robs the man of all the uses of himself. The principle of equality has prepared men for these things; it has predisposed them to endure them and often to look on them as benefits.
</blockquote><p>
De Tocqueville has in mind here, obviously, a central government the intentions of which are beneficent. But suppose that some intentions are not beneficent? Or that legislation might be intended to harass or to punish a class, a faction, or some minority? Where, under centralized democratic despotism, would the dissidents hide? At the moment, however, let us confine ourselves to acts and decisions of centralized power which, on their face, seem in tended-if perhaps in error-to confer benefits upon the public. Many such examples might be cited; I confine myself to two, both of which occurred during the presidential administration of Lyndon Johnson.
<p>
<b>Accusing Arizona.</b> The first of these had to do with governmental inspection of meat. Some inspectors from the federal Department of Agriculture happened to visit Arizona, and there came into conflict with Arizona's state meat inspectors. The two sets of officials parted in wrath; the gentlemen from Washington menacing the Arizonans that they would be taught their place. Back in the seats of the mighty, these bureaucrats sent word to their departmental superiors, and thence to the President of the United States, that ill-inspected and potentially poisonous meat was being approved for public sale by Arizona's negligent meat inspectors. On learning this dread secret, President Johnson saw opportunity for making the American nation aware of his solicitude for their well being: the Great White Father. On television, he revealed the iniquities of Arizona to a frightened people, crying out emphatically, "Get rid of rotten meat! Get rid of rotten meat!"
<p>
A complaisant Congress very, very promptly passed a new act regarding the inspection of all meat, much extending the jurisdiction and the activities of that branch of the Department of Agriculture, and subjecting all state meat-inspecting bureaus to federal jurisdiction. --How thoughtful for the welfare of the American people, from sea to shining sea!
<p>
But others, not federal employees, looked into this affair, and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> published in some detail an account of what had occurred. It was discovered, tardily, that in truth standards of meat inspection had been high, not low; that in fact Arizona did not approve rotten meat of any sort; and that all this fuss had arisen out of minor disputations between federal and state officials. This revelation embarrassed and angered President Johnson, who had assumed that the Washington inspectors were honest and not spiteful; but he could scarcely go back on television, this time to cry, "Bring back rotten meat! Bring back rotten meat!" Nor did Congress trouble itself to repeal the statute, so recently enacted, that made state meat inspection standards wholly subordinate to federal regulations. Since then, federal courts have ruled that if a state has higher standards than the federal ones, nevertheless the state must admit within its jurisdiction meats that meet merely the lower federal standard. A mad world, my masters!
<p>
<b>Efficient Lobbyists.</b> Indulge me, ladies and gentlemen, in one more instance of this arrogating of power not merely over state jurisdictions, but over the American bedroom- -nay, the very bed and bedding. A federal agency abruptly ruled that all mattresses manufactured must be of the inner spring type-whether or not customers might prefer a plain cotton mattress or separate springs and mattress. This ukase, promptly enforced, put out of business many small makers of mattresses; it profited, however, big standard manufacturers who charged high prices; it appeared that lobbyists for the big mattress-making corporations had been at work efficiently in Washington. As for the American citizen who might prefer a simpler mattress and a cheaper, or for persons like your servant this lecturer, who possesses several ancestral antique beds that no inner spring mattress will fit-why, says Uncle Sam to such reactionaries, "Be comfortable, damn you, and expect to pay for it!"
<p>
I have not been able to ascertain under what fantastic interpretation of existing statutes the federal agency in question was able to prescribe the sort of mattress Americans must sleep upon. How could this possibly lie within the prescriptive jurisdiction of the general government-or, for that matter, within the police powers of the several states? Yet done the thing was. A related arbitrary regulation employed the pretext of securing the health of children-though of course that protection, too, ordinarily has been exercised by state and local authorities, or by voluntary organizations.
<p>
This latter instance of federal <i>pleonexia</i> had to do with children's nightwear. From on high in Washington it was decreed that all pajamas, nightgowns, and the like must be manufactured of fire-retardant fabrics, if children were to wear them and shops were so to display them. This measure was supposed to prevent infants from being burned alive in bed; much mention was made of the number of persons annually slain or scarred as a result of smoking in bed, though L at least, had been unaware that small children were given to smoking in bed. Enforced for a time, this paternal legislation caused severe loss to makers and retailers of children's standard nightwear who had large stocks in hand; also it conferred large commercial advantages upon those progressive manufacturers who already, doubtless through foresight and humane concern, were producing large qualities of fire retardant nightwear for tots.
<p>
But alas and lackaday! Scientific studies, within a few months, coincidentally revealed that fire-retardant nightwear indubitably has caused skin cancer, respiratory troubles, and other physical afflictions. The federal regulations in question were quietly rescinded, I believe; and I fancy that it is now permitted for us to clothe our infants with mere unadulterated cotton or wool.
<p>
<b>Grave Ills.</b> I have chosen these relatively harmless and mildly amusing instances of the excessive zeal of the Washington bureaucracy to centralize practically everything, ladies and gentlemen, lest I be taken for a dreadful scaremonger. Now and again some well-intentioned elderly lady assures me, benignly, "Uncle Sam knows what's best for us." I decidedly am not of that opinion Thorough political and economical centralization works ills much graver than the quality of meats, the distribution of bedsprings, and the fabric of nighties. For my part, I am of the opinion that deTocqueville, rather than Uncle Sam, knows what's best for us. Let me add that both John Adams, Federalist, and Thomas Jefferson, Democratic Republican, would have been astounded and indignant at the degree of centralization already well established among us, two centuries after the Constitution of the United States commenced to function. I fancy that neither one would have insisted upon a sprinkler being installed in his bedchamber, at the expense of a perversion of the Constitution.
<p>
The pretexts for giving a veneer of seeming Constitutionality to the concentration of power at Washington have been various. Our recent act to install sprinklers in hotel bedrooms is one of the less extravagant apologies-that is, it amounts merely to a refusal to pay the bills of federal employees who lodge at inns that have no sprinklers in bedrooms. (Of course every hotel in this country must be thoroughly inspected to ascertain the number of sprinklers.) Another and somewhat more severe form of compulsion is the refusal to pay any monies from the federal treasury to non-complying persons and institutions, as in the case of colleges and universities coerced into Affirmative Action programs and the like. Yet another method is the withdrawal of tax exemptions from institutions otherwise entitled to such exemptions, as in the case of Bob Jones University. The oldest method is the appeal of some federal department or federal agency to the commerce clause of the Constitution as the ground for justifying some surprising enlargement of the federal government's power; and of course that is the road taken by the Congress ever since the 182Os. The most common method employed to induce states and cities, and various voluntary associations, to submit to federal regulation is the matching grant-in-aid, often on a very large scale. And in a number of instances the Congress and Executive Branch have not troubled themselves to look for excuses in the Constitution: they simply have pushed through a piece of legislation, of national scope, without bothering to enquire whether by any stretch of the imagination such an act could be regarded as authorized by some provision of the Constitution.
<p>
<b>Consolidation By Degrees.</b> In consequence of all of this, the federal character of the United States, this country's chief contribution to the art of governance, has been fading to a shadow of a shade. And where Congress hesitated, the Supreme Court rushed in to nationalize the whole political structure. More mischief of this sort was accomplished during the reign of King Lyndon than during any other period of American history-considerably more, incidentally, than was accomplished during the reign of King Franklin-but in general the leaders of either major political party have made no strong effort to resist consolidation of power; and, after all, it has come about by degrees, not as a result of any announced design. No doubt a well-publicized plan for systematic centralization would have been hotly rejected by the American electorate; and among those opponents of deliberate centralization would have been a good many liberals.
<p>
A decay of historical consciousness among Americans has had its part in reducing resistance to the concentration of decision-making powers in the general government. Here I offer you two paragraphs written by C. Northcote Parkinson, the deviser of Parkinson's Law. Professor Parkinson declares that political centralization is the initial cause of the nation's decadence. She first stage on the downward path is one of over-centralization," Parkinson wrote in 1978.
<p><blockquote>
Everything is done to eliminate or neutralize all but the main and central seat of administration The lesser centers of power are either provincial governments or organizations which can be classified as religious, financial, military, or economic: an arch-bishopric, a national bank, a military command or a major industrial or trading group. The attempt to centralize all power in the one capital city and, indeed, in its administrative quarter, means the assimilation of all possible rival institutions from monasteries to television stations, from harbour authorities to charitable foundations. All these can be eliminated in the name of democracy or efficiency, and the result is the creation of the one government machine into which all problems are fed and from which all wisdom is to emerge. All that is initially lost is the likelihood of the government's having to listen to informed criticism from outside its inner circle of officials. Thereafter the problems centre upon the growing size and complexity of the central administration. As the civil servants multiply there is an ever-increasing distance between the citizen and the nameless people who will ultimately decide upon his application, protest, or appeal. Proceedings are cumbrous and attitudes are hierarchical, all decisions being referred from the periphery to the centre and then from the bottom to the top.
<P>
"If death come from Madrid," said sixteenth-century Spaniards, "we should all live to a very great age."
<P>
Much the same comment must have been made about Babylon, Peking, Persepolis, Delhi, and London. Less frequently noticed are two other results of over-centralisation. The first is that the normal processes of retirement and promotion will bring to the centre the people who have been robbed of all initiative while posted at the circumference. The second is that the capital city is now appallingly vulnerable to internal sedition or external assault. When all roads lead to Rome, all cables to London, the usual channels to Paris, the whole administrative machinery can be knocked out by a single rocket attack there are no centres of authority outside the target area, no alternative capital city to which a government might move. With the capital city gone, there is nothing left.
</blockquote><p>
Parkinson goes on to describe the second stage in the decline and fall of great states: the growth of taxation. But that is just another vast subject on which, conceivably, I may address you another time, ladies and gentlemen. Let me proceed, just now to my peroration. The worst thing about excessive concentration of power, I believe, is that in the long run such Behemoth centralization fails; and then the whole social structure falls apart, as is occurring in the Soviet empire at this moment.
<p>
Reasons exist why a supplanting of the old constitutional order, if completed, would present most serious dangers to American order and justice and freedom. I will mention only four of these perils.
<p>
<b>Too Much Work.</b> The first is the problem of efficiency. The general government is designed to carry out certain responsibilities, fairly well defined: most notably, the conduct of foreign relations, the defense of the country, and the management of undertakings too widespread for any one state in the Union to manage. But already the government here in Washington is dismayingly oppressed by too much work and too many servants. By endeavoring to do everything, the Washington government might end in doing nothing successfully.
<p>
The second problem is of scale. Measures which the provincial governors at Graz or Innsbruck would refuse to entrust to Vienna are proposed in America as if the governing of two hundred and fifty million people were little more difficult than the conduct of a town meeting-and quite as democratic-as long as President and Congress are still elected. I have heard American advocates of social-welfare measures, for instance, seriously advance the example of social-democratic legislation in Denmark as a precedent for American policy -though some American counties, not to mention states, are larger than Denmark, and other counties have more people than there are Danes.
<p>
Appeals against imprudent or unjust administration become immensely difficult when they are only the faint voices of individuals or local groups opposed to the prestige and influence of administrators at the capital; indeed, the chief administrators themselves cannot possibly look deeply into such complaints. Detailed administration on such a scale would require from civil servants a wisdom and a goodness never experienced in human history. "Well, appeal to your Congressman," centralizers say, perhaps ingenuously. But Congressmen already do not have time enough to answer the mail from their more important constituents, let alone act as so many Don Quixotes of the mass state.
<p>
<b>Habit of Command.</b> The third difficulty I raise here is the problem of leadership. Centralized political power functions smoothly only in nations accustomed to defer to the measures and opinions of a governing class-that is, in aristocratic or autocratic lands. Soviet centralization would have failed altogether, and almost at once, had it not been for the long-established powers of the Old Regime at Moscow and St. Petersburg. And such a body of decision makers, of governors, of aristocrats, must possess a high degree of self-confidence and the habit of command. They must be accustomed to dealing with deferential populations.
<p>
But these United States, accustomed to territorial democracy, have no class of leaders and administrators competent to undertake the consolidated direction which the centralizers propose. I do not discern a class of men here competent to rule wisely this immense nation, once territorial democracy and the federal framework-both principal schools of national leadership-should be undone.
<p>
Fourth, even had we a class of Winchester old-school-tie administrators, I do not know how we could expect the most expert of statists to direct paternally and justly the concerns of this nation, once local volition and private self-reliance had been seriously weakened. A man has but twenty-four hours in his day, and can read only a limited number of papers. Such centralization defeats its own object, in persons as in departments. The man-killing job of the presidency-to which centralizers will add numerous fresh responsibilities-may be sufficient illustration of my meaning.
<p>
<b>Unmanageable People.</b> To destroy, or let atrophy, territorial democracy and the federal system in America is quite possible; but it is less easy to provide some alternative satisfactory scheme of politics. Once the principle of volition, with the sense of participation and local decision, vanishes from American life, Americans are liable to become an unmanageable people. On a grander and more catastrophic scale, we might see again the resistance to authority and resort to violence which were provoked by the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act. Both the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act were "democratically" adopted; but somehow national positive democracy is not the same thing as territorial prescriptive democracy. Indeed, already we see great American cities in anarchy from time to time-the anarchists those people, black or white, who feel they have been excluded from full participation in society. What would occur when the majority should fell excluded from decision making?
<p>
Within a few years, if not immediately, any "guided democracy" or "plebiscitary democracy" would meet with evasion and hostility everywhere, and among the results of this could come a diminishing of the really effectual and popular authority of the general government. The energies and loyalties of volition would have been supplanted by the compulsions of a latter-day Jacobism, or of the Directory. And a great big Federal Bureau of Investigation would not be able to enforce the decrees of such a regime; for though a new broom sweeps clean, and an elite federal detective force aiding the local police is one thing, a permanent national secret police would be quite another-and possibly disagreeable to some of the "liberal" advocates of centralization. For that matter, a garrison of federal troops in every city might not suffice to keep order.
<p>
Yet life still rises in the tree of American federalism, and territorial democracy's powers of resistance and reaction ought not to be disregarded. It is true, as deTocqueville remarked, that men in power generally feel impelled to augment central power, while the opponents of centralization are either stupid or powerless. Notwithstanding this, attachment to the doctrines of division of authority and of state and local powers remains so popular in the United States that an intelligent plan for preserving the old system would obtain a hearing, and stand some chance of enactment.
<p>
<b>Buttressing the Structure.</b> An enormous, unitary omnicompetent nation-state cannot abide the American political tradition of cake and custom. If the federal system is obsolete, then we ought to prepare to train the leaders of a new order, and to define the character of that domination, novel to us. If territorial democracy deserves to live, if the federal system has virtue still, then the constitutional structure ought to be buttressed and helped to function. At present, most of the Americans qualified to think about such matters decline to take either of these courses. They are willing to let the norms of politics shift for themselves -which is not according to nature.
<p>
Such is another huge prospect for conservatives. Let us hope that the rising generation of conservatives may have the courage and the imagination required to avert the triumph of the centralizers; for that triumph would be followed swiftly enough by the decay of the American Republic.

<P>
With some trepidation I commence my remarks on this large subject, the lot of educational reformers being hard. In 1953, Professor Arthur Bestor published a book entitled <i>Educational Wastelands: The Retreat from Learning in Our Public Schools.</i> There survives a Jewish tradition that all the Prophets were stoned to death or otherwise slain by the People. From 1953 onward, the Educationists belabored Dr. Bestor with epithets, until he departed from this world. And the Educationists' retreat from learning has continued with few impediments.
<p>
In my preceding lecture of this series about Prospects for Conservatives, entitled "Prospects Abroad," I ventured to suggest the possibility of an Augustan Age for the United States and for the twenty-first-century world-supposing we Americans do not endeavor to impose our ways upon all the peoples of the earth. But in discussing American education, I cannot be so sanguine.
<p>
Marxist educational notions and methods have been exposed as grim fallacies-except in these United States, perhaps. Yet what are we to say of present American educational notions and methods? Ever since the publishing of the report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education, "A Nation at Risk," seven years ago, a great deal of talk about education, and scribbling about it, have occurred. As for any evidences of general improvement, however-why, one does not discover them easily.
<p>
The United States now is the great power in the world. Nevertheless, who can praise an educational system that turns out young people marvelously ignorant-except for a very small minority-of history, geography, and foreign languages, and so, unfitted to have much of anything to do with concerns larger than those of their own neighborhood? Worse still, what future have a people whose schooling has enabled them, at best, to ascertain the price of everything-but the value of nothing? We Americans stand today politically dominant, intellectually enfeebled. Conservatives have before them a complex work of intellectual restoration.
<p>
<b>Plight and Possibilities.</b> Nowadays nearly everybody-except for the National Education Association's bosses and affiliates, and the professors at most schools of education- confesses that something is badly wrong with learning in America. While we linger in a mood of remorse and recrimination, opportunity exists for genuine reform. Permit me to address you first, and basically, on the plight and possibilities of the higher learning.
<p>
For half a century, our higher education has been sinking lower. Nobody is more painfully aware of this decay than is the conscientious professor of some experience, and nobody suffers more from it than does the perceptive undergraduate. America's higher learning lies in a state of decadence. But eras of decadence sometimes are succeeded by eras of renewal. It is all a matter of will, reason, and imagination. As Samuel Johnson put it, "Why, sir, we <i>know</i> the will is free; and there's an end to it."
<p>
<b>Higher Education's Mission.</b> Conceivably we Americans, after decades of blundering and incertitude, may be entering upon an American Augustan Age. For successful healing, candid diagnosis is required. The people of the United States now spend annually upon higher education more money, probably, than did all the nations of the world combined, probably, from the foundation of the ancient universities down to the beginning of World War II. Yet there prevails a widespread discontent at the results produced by this costly endeavor. Surely it is time for us conservatives to examine afresh the mission of the higher education.
<p>
The primary end of the higher learning, in all lands and all times, has been what John Henry Newman called the training of the intellect to form a philosophical habit of mind. College and university were founded to develop right reason and imagination, for the sake of the person and of the republic. By its nature, the higher education is concerned with abstractions-rather difficult abstractions, both in the sciences and in humane studies. In any age, most people are not fond of abstractions. In this democratic milieu, therefore, higher education stands in danger everywhere from leveling pressures.
<p>
In Britain, a very few years ago, the member of the opposition party who had been designated minister of education in a prospective Labour government denounced Oxford and Cambridge universities as "cancers." Presumably he would have converted those ancient institutions, if given his way, into something like the Swedish "people's universities" -that is, lax institutions at which every lad and lass can succeed, because all standards for entrance or graduation have been swept away. Every man and woman an intellectual king or queen, with an Oxbridge degree. The trouble with this aspiration is that those kings and queens would be intellectually impoverished-and presumably Britain generally would be impoverished in more ways than one.
<p>
Recently we have heard similar voices in the graduate schools of Harvard. Why discriminate against indolence and stupidity? Why not let everybody graduate, regardless of performance in studies? Would not that be the democratic way? If young people do not care for abstractions, and manifest a positive aversion to developing a philosophical habit of mind, why not give them what they think they would like: that is, the superficial counter-culture?
<p>
<b>Lowering of Standards.</b> The educational degradation of the democratic dogma already has prevailed, with few exceptions, throughout the western world: it has gone far in France and Italy. In the United States, ever since World War II, the lowering of standards for admission and for graduation, the notorious disgrace of "grade inflation," and the loss of order and integration in curricula, are too widely known and regretted for me to need to labor these afflictions here. Some cold comfort may be found in the fact that we have not sinned more greatly than have other nations of the West-somewhat less, indeed.
<p>
Here and there, some signs of renewal in higher education may be discerned; certainly we hear much pother about it. But it remains to be determined whether it is possible to restore or improve the true higher learning, what with powerful political and economic pressures against improvement. Being somewhat gloomy by conviction, yet sanguine by temperament, I may mutter to myself, "Say not the struggle naught availeth!"
<p>
Why are this lowering of standards and this loss of intellectual coherence ruinous to higher education? Because the higher learning is intended to develop, primarily, a philosophical habit of mind. The genuine higher education is not meant, really, to "create jobs" or to train technicians. Incidentally, the higher education does tend to have such results, too; but only as by-products. We stand in danger of forgetting, during our pursuit of the incidentals, the fundamental aims of learning.
<p>
Why were colleges and universities established, and what remains their most valuable function? To discipline the mind; to give men and women long views and to instill in them the virtue of prudence; to present a coherent body of ordered knowledge, in several great fields; to pursue that knowledge for its own sake; to help the rising generation to make its way toward wisdom and virtue. The college is an instrument to teach that truth is better than falsehood, and wisdom better than ignorance. Of course the college has done other things as well, some of them mildly baneful-such as serving as an instrument of social snobbery. But I am speaking still of the college's fundamental mission.
<p>
The college is intended to confer two sorts of  benefits. The first sort of benefit is the improvement of the human person, for the individual's own sake: opening the way to some wisdom to young men and women, that there may be something in their lives besides getting and spending.
<p>
<b>Essential to Society.</b> The second kind of benefit is the preservation and advancement of society, by developing a body or class of young people who will be leaders in many walks of life: scientists, clergymen, political officials or representative officers, physicians, lawyers, teachers, industrialists, managers, and all the re! t. The college is a means to help to form intellects, assure their competence, and (a point often forgotten today) to help to form their characters. Here I am not speaking of an elite, for I share T.S. Eliot's conviction that a deliberately-cultivated series of elites would tend toward narrowness and arrogance. Rather, I refer to a fairly broad and numerous class of tolerably educated men and women who would leaven the lump of society in a wide variety of ways. Most of them never would be famous, or powerful on a large scale; but they form that body of well-schooled people essential to any modern society, and especially important to a democratic society.
<p>
Now a higher schooling merely technological and skill-oriented-what once would have been called a mechanical education, as opposed to a liberal education-can neither impart wisdom to the person nor supply intellectual and moral leadership to the republic. I do not object to learning a trade-far from it. But a trade is best learnt through apprenticeship, internship, on-the-job training, or technical schools. Except for the learned professions, learning a trade is ill suited to a college campus. If we convert higher education into technical training merely, we may find ourselves living in what Irving Babbitt called "a devil's sabbath of whirling machinery." For if the philosophical habit of mind is developed nowhere, "the center cannot hold; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."

Let me descend to particulars. The biggest fad in education today is the movement styled the Information Revolution. An extensive jargon is developing to serve this revolution's uses. The revolution is supposed to usher in an Informational Society; we even are told that this Informational Society will supplant the Knowledge Society. One of the grave faults of American schooling at every level is the eagerness to embrace the newest gadget- mechanical or intellectual-at the expense of the tested tools of learning. The apologists for television used to tell us that their darling has molded the minds of "the best informed generation in the history of America." Also, if we are to believe the report "A Nation at Risk," it has molded the minds of the most ignorant generation in America. For information is not knowledge; and knowledge is not wisdom. This is movingly expressed by T.S. Eliot in some lines of his choruses for <i>The Rock:</i>
<p><blockquote>
The endless cycle of idea and action,<br> Endless invention, endless experiment,<br> Brings knowledge of motion, but not of stillness; <br>Knowledge of speech, but not of silence; <br>Knowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word. <br>All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance, <br>All our ignorance brings us nearer to death, <br>But nearness to death no nearer to God. <br>Where is the Life we have lost in living? <br>Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? <br>Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? <br>The cycles of Heaven in twenty centuries <br>Bring us farther from God and nearer to the Dust.<br>
</blockquote><p>
Aye, where is the knowledge we have lost in information, not to mention the wisdom? What college and university used to endeavor to impart was not miscellaneous information, a random accumulation of facts, but instead an integrated and ordered body of knowledge that would develop the philosophical habit of mind-from which cast of mind one might find the way to wisdom of many sorts.
<p>
Doubtless the prevalence of computers may confer upon us various material benefits. But so far as genuine education goes, the computer and its Informational Society may amount to a blight. They seem calculated to enfeeble the individual reason and to make most of us dependent upon an elite of computer programmers-at the higher lever of the Informational Society, I mean; they may develop into vigorous enemies of the philosophical habit of mind.
<p>
<b>Technological Flotsam.</b> One thing to remember, then, in discussing what higher education should do for people in the dawning years, is that waves of technological! innovation commonly carry on their crests a mass of flotsam. Such a disagreeable mass was flung upon the beaches of academe by the ideological tempests of the 1960s and 1970s. At university and college we are only beginning to recover from the damage done to the philosophical habit of mind by that storm. The gentlefolk and scholars of the Academy would be highly imprudent if they should assist in fresh devastation by setting gadgetry above intellectual discipline.
<p>
I am arguing that educational neoterism does mischief often. Nor do I believe it to be the primary function of university and college to create a kind of tapioca-pudding society in which everybody would be just like everybody else-every young man and woman, ideally, possessed of a doctoral degree, if innocent of philosophy.
<p>
Instead, the primary mission of university and college is to point the way toward some measure of wisdom and virtue, through developing the philosophical habit of mind. I am saying that universities and colleges were founded in the hope that those institutions might help the rising generation toward two forms of order: one, order in the soul of the person, the direction of will and appetite by reason; the other, order in the commonwealth, through the understanding of justice and freedom and the public good. I am arguing that our basic reform of the higher learning must be the restoration of these venerable aims-a task for conservatives.
<p>
Is it absurd to imagine that our vast factory-like campuses might be humanized? Is it ridiculous to argue that the American obsession with getting and spending could be chastened sufficiently to permit American higher learning to be sought for its own sake? Perhaps; but perhaps not, too.
<p>
I lack time to offer you a detailed program of educational reformation. But I venture now to suggest the essential measure that must be undertaken if we are to move from intellectual decadence toward intellectual renewal.
<p>
First, the quality of American primary and secondary schooling must be mightily improved before there can be any very marked increase of intelligence and imagination among college and university students. This improvement must have two aspects: the teaching of true intellectual disciplines, and the rousing of the moral imagination. Despite endeavors of the federal Department of Education to entice schools into improving themselves, little has occurred as yet in the way of practical reform.
<p>
I find it highly doubtful that any marked reformation of the public schools can occur until the several states, and perhaps the federal government too, adopt some form of the "voucher plan," which would provide for much greater diversity and choice in schooling. Here I commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, the new book by John E. Chubb and Terry M. Moe, <i>Politics, Markets, and America's Schools</I> (Brookings Institution). As Mr. Chubb puts it, "The public education system functions naturally and routinely, despite everybody's best intentions, to burden schools with excessive bureaucracy, to discourage effective school organization, and to stifle student achievement."
<p>
Second, the American appetite for requiring vocational certification must be curbed. A very great part of the student body on nearly all campuses is enrolled mostly because "you have to get a degree to get a job." Thus universities and colleges are crowded with young people who would prefer to be somewhere else, earning money or at least active and emancipated from abstractions. It needs to be remembered that universities and colleges are centers for the study of abstractions; and most people's interest in abstractions is distinctly limited. Many of the skills in business, industry, technology, and governmental service are best acquired by internship or apprenticeship; being compelled to linger in college is little better than marking time for many undergraduates. Were universities and colleges relieved of the responsibility for turning out half-finished candidates for routine employment, they could undertake their primary duties so much the better; and the whole atmosphere of the typical campus would grow far more cheerful.
<p>
Third, the humane scale in learning should be regained by creating no more mass campuses with many thousands of undergraduates in a lonely crowd, and decentralizing so far as possible the existing Behemoth campuses. The old collegiate structure of the academic community should become the model once more. Institutes for technical training, as distinct from the abstractions with which higher education is supposed to be concerned, should be situated elsewhere than on the same campus with college or university.
<p>
Fourth, curricula at nearly all universities and colleges should be greatly revised, rigorously, so as to provide students with a genuine intellectual discipline, purged of the intellectual boondoggles that have disgraced college programs to some extent ever since the beginning of this century, but especially since the late Sixties. At the majority of American establishments of a learning allegedly higher, theoretical sciences and imaginative humane studies have been pushed into a dusty corner of the curriculum; that folly must be undone. Reading through directories of colleges recently, with a view to finding a good college for our third daughter, I discovered that at the typical college nowadays only some five percent of the undergraduates are enrolled in "letters," which once upon a time was the American college's principal discipline. If the rising generation's more intelligent members have acquired little knowledge of great literature, history, languages, and the natural sciences- why, the person and the republic will fall into disorder, soon or late.
<p>
Fifth, we must emphasize through the whole of higher education the ancient principle that the ends of all education are wisdom and virtue. I do <i>not</i> mean that the purpose of the higher learning is to "impart values." The whole notion of teaching "values" is mistaken, although held often by sincere people who mean well.
<p>
For what true education attempts to impart is <i>meaning,</i> not value. This sly employment of the word <i>value</i> as a substitute for such words as "norm," "standard," "principle," and "truth" is the deliberate work of the doctrinaire positivists, who deny that there exists any moral significance of a transcendent or an abiding character. In America, the notion of educational "values" has been advanced by sociologists and educationists of the Instrumentalist school: it is intended as a substitute for the religious assumptions about human existence that formerly were taken for granted in schools. A "value," as educationists employ the word, is a personal preference, gratifying perhaps to the person who holds it, but of no binding moral effect upon others. "Other things being equal, pushpin is as good as poetry," in Bentham's famous phrase. Choose what values you will, or ignore them all: it's a matter of what gives you, the individual, the most pleasure and the least pain.
<p>
Etienne Gilson points out that positivists deliberately advance the concept of "values" because they deny that words, or the concepts represented by words, have real meaning. Thus the word "honor" may hold value for some, but may be repellent to other people: in the view of the positivist, the word "honor" is meaningless, for there is no honor, nor yet dishonor: all really is physical sensation, pleasurable or painful. But if "honor" has an illusory value for you, employ it; if you dislike "honor," discard it.
<p>
<b>Imparting A Moral Heritage. </b>Time was when every school child used to be familiar with the catalogue of the seven cardinal virtues and the seven deadly sins. The positivists and a good many other folk today deny the existence of those seven deadly sins, or of any other sin. As for the virtues-why, they would like to convert those back into "value preferences," with no moral imperative to back them. But justice, fortitude, prudence, and temperance are not "values" merely; nor are faith, hope, and charity. It is not for the individual, bound up in self-conceit, to determine whether he prefers justice or injustice; it is not for him to decide whether prudence or imprudence suits him better. True, the individual may so decide and act, to others' harm or his own. But it is the function of education to impart a moral heritage: to teach that the virtues and the vices are real, and that the individual is not free to toy with the sins as he may choose.
<p>
What true education transmits is not values, but instead a body of truth: that is, a pattern of meanings, perceived through certain disciplines of the intellect. The sort of education that prevailed in Europe and America until about 1930, say, was an endeavor to instruct the rising generation in the nature of reality. It traced a pattern of order: order in the soul, order in the commonwealth. That old system of education began with information; it passed from information to knowledge; it moved from knowledge to wisdom. Its aim, I repeat, was not value, but truth.
<p>
The Benthamite and Deweyite educational structure of our day, little concerned with meaning, aims confusedly at personal advancement, technical training, sociability, socialization, custodial functions, and certification-not to mention fun and games. The very possibility of ascertaining the meaning of anything is denied by many a department of philosophy. What does this twentieth-century educational system transmit to the rising generation? Chiefly certain technical and commercial skills, together with that training in the learned professions that is indispensable to our civilization. Modern schooling, at any level, offers little toward the ordering of the soul and the ordering of the commonwealth.
<p>
We Americans possess the riches and the power that could give us an American Augustan Age. Do we possess mind and heart requisite for an Augustan era? It has been said that the Americans of our time know the price of everything and the value of nothing; it might better be said that they know the price of everything, the value of some things-and the meaning of next to nothing. We have not schooled ourselves, this past half-century and more, for Augustan responsibilities.
<p>
<b>Fading Heritage.</b> So far as we remembered our heritage of culture at all, most of us Americans assumed that somehow it would endure automatically, unregarded and unrenewed-a form of perpetual motion. But that heritage has been fading among us for several decades. In educational fad and foible, in arid specialization, in mere processes of certification for potential employment, we have laid waste our inheritance of reason and imagination.
<p>
Having failed to apprehend meanings, we are forced back upon a rude pragmatism in private life and in public a groping for "what works"-or seems to work. In private existence, such servility to the evanescent moment leads to the alienist's couch and the divorce court; in the affairs of nations, such naive improvisations may end in ruinous blunders, not to be undone.
<p>
The education of yesteryear was founded upon certain postulates. One of these was that much truth is ascertainable; another, that religious truth is the source of all good; a third, that we may profit by the wisdom of our ancestors; a fourth, that the individual is foolish, but the species is wise; a fifth, that wisdom is sought for its own sake; a sixth, that for the sake of the commonwealth, schooling should quicken the moral imagination.
<p>
These postulates have not ceased to be true; it is only that they have been forgotten in our century's obsession with power and money, and our century's illusion that ideology is a ready and satisfactory substitute for thought. Some eyes have been opened to the mischief done by that obsession and that illusion. Here and there, some attempts at recovery of the true ends of education are being made.
<p>
<b>Winning Back the Inheritance. </b>Many in America and throughout the world have been disinherited of their cultural patrimony. Yet they may win back that inheritance, if they have fortitude and tenacity sufficient. "The dead alone give us energy," we are told by Gustave Le Bon. In the long run, the man and the state that have rejected the legacy from many centuries will be found nerveless. And the man or woman who has sought out that intellectual legacy will be emboldened to defend the Permanent Things Against Chaos and Old Night. 
<p>
My old comrade in arms Arthur Bestor found the schools of America in 1953 educational wastelands; they are no less arid today. Yet say not, ladies and gentlemen, that the struggle naught availeth. Some conservative irrigation conceivably may cause the desert to bloom. If nothing is done-why, hand in hand with the Hollow Men, we go round and round the prickly pear at five o'clock in the morning.
<p><blockquote>
This is the dead land <BR>This is cactus land <BR>Here the stone images <BR>Are raised, here they receive <BR>The supplication of a dead man's hand <BR>Under the twinkle of a fading star.
</blockquote><p>
Unless conservatives act intellectually and vigorously to renew right reason and imagination among us, by the conclusion of the twentieth century America may be an egalitarian wasteland of mind and spirit, with everybody compulsorily schooled, and everybody equal in ignorance.

<P>
Modern civilization's Time of Troubles, according to Arnold Toynbee, commenced in 1914. Four years later, the worst blow to the received political and social order was struck by the triumph of the Bolsheviki in Russia. But in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ninety, it begins to appear that once more it may become possible to speak with some confidence of the Permanent Things. Old concepts of order, justice, and freedom may prevail, after all. God willing, much that is worth keeping may be conserved, here near the end of the twentieth century. It is one of the marks of human decency, Eliseo Vivas instructs us, to be ashamed of having been born into the twentieth century. Perhaps we may atone for the century's sins by overthrowing at the end of the century the fourth Horseman of the Apocalypse, Revolution.
<p>
Already America's conservatives have won a great victory, after seven decades of struggle. From President Wilson's dispatch of troops to the Russian arctic to President Reagan's expedition to Moscow for conferring with Gorbachev, the great American Republic wrestled with the Russian bear; and the Western concept of ordered freedom contended against the ideology of Marxism. Alexis deTocqueville foresaw that tremendous contest, which now has been decided in favor of the United States of America and in favor of the politics of prudence and prescription.
<p>
<b>Calling Communist Bluffs.</b> The final encounter was run by an elderly and eminent conservative, Mr. Ronald Reagan. When he took the presidential oath of office, Mr. Reagan was thoroughly unacquainted with foreign affairs. And yet, with the exception of his failure in Lebanon, President Reagan was wondrously successful in foreign policy. He restored the vigor of the American economy, so that the oligarchs in the Kremlin perceived the Soviet Union's weakness in the face of American productivity. He commenced work upon the Strategic Defense Initiative; and the masters of the Soviet empire, even the imperialists of the Red Army, knew to their sorrow that they could not find the resources to match that shield against nuclear rockets. He sent a rocket into the very parlor, literally, of the malign dictator of Libya; and the masters of the Soviet system opened their eyes wide at his audacity. The Communists of Russia and the Communists of Cuba seized upon the island of Grenada to make another base of it; but President Reagan promptly dispatched a military expedition to Grenada, shot some of the Russians and the Cubans in the course of taking it, and shipped back to Moscow and Havana, as released prisoners, the rest of their men. This told the rulers of the Evil Empire that President Reagan, given to calling bluffs, was not afraid of those ten-foot-tall Russians. Besides, already the Soviet Union sporadically was dependent, for very subsistence, upon shipments of American wheat. It was borne in upon Gorbachev and his comrades that they must rethink retrench, and resign numerous ambitions, lest they perish altogether: for the old actor from the Californian ranch, quick on the draw in his films, had outgunned them.
<p>
I spent some time with Mr. Reagan in the White House very shortly after his return from Moscow. He told me two jokes-his humorous fictions, by the way, appear to originate with him-one of which I venture to repeat today, by way of making a point.
<p>
President Reagan, addressing me, represented himself as having engaged in colloquy with "a high Soviet official." The dialogue went as follows. Mr. Reagan said innocently:
<p><blockquote>

"Can you tell me, just how high does Communism stand with the Russian people?"
<p>
"One point six meters."
<p>
"Really? How can you be so precise? And what does that signify, 'one point six meters'?"
<p>
The high Soviet official drew his hand across his throat. "It signifies I've had it up to here!"
<p></blockquote>

<b>American Win.</b> After seventy years, indeed, the Russian people had had Communism up to there; they were drowning in Communism; and so Gorbachev knew that he must come to terms with the lively old gentleman from the country back of Santa Barbara-and with the republic of the United States of America. Without striking any greater blow than American landing forces had inflicted upon the Russian "technicians" in Grenada, the American conservatives had won at last in world affairs.
<p>
I have subjected you, ladies and gentleman, to so lengthy a prolegomenon because we are gathered together here in a year of triumph. In general, prospects for conservatives are more cheerful than they seemed in the heyday of Chairman Johnson, say; and in particular, conservative prospects in the field of foreign affairs look bright just now. Permit me, then, to sum up America's gains in international affairs; and then to utter, Cassandra in trousers though you may think me, certain vaticinations Ins of a cautionary character.
<p>
First, ladies and gentlemen, you and I are in at the death of the Marxist ideology. As H. Stuart Hughes wrote more than thirty years ago, "Conservatism is the negation of ideology." Because any ideology-that is, a theory of fanatic politics promising the terrestrial paradise-is illusory, eventually the consequences of the ideology are perceived by most people to be ruinous; and then, God willing, a healthy reaction occurs. That has happened after seven decades in Russia; it is happening today in China; it will occur quite soon in the African, Asiatic, and Latin-American states that succumbed to Communist ideologues during the past forty years.
<p>
The practical consequences of Marxist doctrine are so thoroughly exposed that before long Marxism will find defenders only in the American academy. Marxism pretended to be a moral system as well as an economic and political panacea. Now some first principles of morals, at least, and some workable assumptions about politics and economics, any people must have. What beliefs will fill the vacuum left by the evaporation of Marxist dogmata?
<p>
Conceivably some alternative ideology might take hold upon the minds and emotions of peoples who recently have freed themselves from Marxism-some other dogmatic and treacherous system that immanentizes the symbols of transcendence. Yet what such an ideology might amount to, no man can say-presumably not some equivalent of Nazism, which Hannah Arendt called "an ideology in embryo," nor yet the theories of Italian Fascism. Some naive Americans speak windily of an "ideology of democracy"-but about democratism I shall have something to say presently.
<p>
<b>Stimulating Faith.</b> It seems more likely that there will succeed to Marx's dialectical materialism, in Russia, Eastern Europe, and much of Africa, a renewed Christian belief, already resurgent obviously in Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Hungary, Slovenia, and elsewhere. Persecution stimulates, rather than stifles, a people's religious faith-provided that the state's persecution is not perfectly effectual as it was not in the Roman Empire, and has not been even in the Soviet Union, let alone Romania. The history of the Jews attests this truth. And when the survival of a nation is identified with the survival a church, as in the history of Ireland, religion is stronger than ever ideology might be.
<p>
No religious creed supplies satisfactorily a plan of politics and economics: the purpose of religious faith is the ordering of the soul, not the ordering of the state. But religious dogmata do offer answers to ultimate questions; while ideology cannot convincingly answer such questions. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn touched upon this in his Templeton address in London in 1983. "Over a century ago, while I was still a child," Solzhenitsyn began, "I recall hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: 'Men have forgotten God; that's why all this happened.'"
<p>
And so, indeed, those disasters had come to pass, through the malign power of dialectical materialism. Now, Communist illusions having been repudiated, in much of the world men and woman may turn again to what Marx had called, falsely, "the opiate of the people": to the religious understanding that, among other hard truths, teaches why man and society are not perfectible here below.
<p>
It is even conceivable that the resurgent Christian belief of Eastern Europe may be communicated to a fair number of people in these United States, where increasingly both Protestant and Catholic churches have suffered from the inroads of ideology or of secular humanism.
<p>
How ever that may be, Marxist ideologues can take some small comfort from the knowledge that their ideology will not be altogether effaced from this earth. For as John Lukacs remarks, 'There will always be Communists-in Manhattan."
<p>
<b>Marx Refuted.</b> In foreign policy, no longer will our Department of State be contending with the fanatic irrationalism of ideology in Europe, Asia, or Africa-or, at any rate, not by the beginning of the twenty-first century, I believe. Great states and small are beginning to settle for politics as the art of the possible. Marx's insistence on the inevitability of Communism's triumph has been refuted totally-and almost overnight.
<p>
Forty years ago, Whittaker Chambers gloomily believed that in choosing the American cause of order, justice, and freedom, he was joining the losing side. It is said that Henry Kissinger, at the height of his influence in Washington, privately believed that his diplomatic endeavors-s where only postponing the eventual triumph of Communism and Soviet Union. How very different is our present prospect! One thinks of Edmund Burke's rejection of historical determinism at the end of his days in his first <i>Letter a Regicide Peace.</i> Providence, or mere individual strong wills, or chance, Burke says, abruptly may alter the whole apparent direction of a nation. "I doubt whether the history of mankind is yet complete enough, if ever it can be so, to furnish grounds for a sure theory on the internal causes which necessarily affect the fortune of a State," as Burke puts it. It is possible, he mentions, that great and sudden changes in the affairs of nations may be the consequence of the "occasional interposition and the irresistible hand of the Great Disposer." One may speculate on whether during the past three years the Great Disposer's instrument may have been the Great Communicator, Mr. Reagan.
<p>
Be that as it may, the power of the Marxist ideology, menacing even the United States for the past century and a half, appears to be broken. And the power of the Soviet empire, too, is breaking rapidly into pieces. The question even arises of whether Moscow will retain effective control of any territories beyond Great Russia and White Russia Civil war may consume the energies of what, for some seventy years, was the Soviet Union. No longer can the Soviet system compete in armaments with the United States; that competition, which sorely tried the finances of the United States, worked the ruin of that enormous domination which extends from the Baltic to the Pacific.
<p>
<b>No Worthy Rival.</b> Thus it has come to pass that the United States faces no rival power worthy of the name. China is sunk in poverty and hopelessly misgoverned; the British and French empires gave up the ghost four decades ago; Japan is strong economically, but not big enough to contest the mastery of the world; even a reunited Germany, chastened by the misfortunes of a half-century ago, will not aspire to exercise a hegemony over Europe, let alone to box seriously with the United States. Henry Luce and Richard Nixon used to say that the twentieth century must be the "American Century"; but that aspiration may be fulfilled, instead, in the twenty-first century.
<p>
Aye, nowadays America alone is a great power in the world, with resources-both military and financial-sufficient, in most respects, unaided to secure her national interest against all comers. But this vast question looms up: how should the United States employ the powers of its ascendancy? Are we Americans fulfilling a manifest destiny, the mission of recasting every nation and every culture in the American image?
<p>
Various American voices have been raised these past few months to proclaim enthusiastically that soon all the world, or nearly all of it, will embrace an order called "democratic capitalism." It seems to be the assumption of these enthusiasts-many of them members of the faction called Neoconservatives-that the political structure and the economic patterns of the United States will be emulated in every continent, for evermore.
<p>
This attitude brings to mind an observation of Daniel Boorstin, the best of our present generation of American historians, that the Constitution of the United States is not for export. Also it brings to mind a character in the best of American novels, George Santayana's <i>The Last Puritan.</i> That character is Cyrus P. Whittle, a Yankee schoolmaster, very like the type of academic that dominates American universities at the present hour. Whittle is a 
<p><blockquote>

sarcastic wizened little man who taught American history and literature in a high quivering voice, with a bitter incisive emphasis on one or two words in every sentence as if he were driving a long hard nail into the coffin of some detested fallacy.... His joy, as far as he dared, was to vilify all distinguished men. Franklin had written indecent verses; Washington-who had enormous hands and feet-had married Dame Martha for her money; Emerson served up Goethe's philosophy in ice-water. Not that Mr. Cyrus P. Whittle was without enthusiasm and a secret religious zeal. Not only was America the biggest thing on earth, but it soon was going to wipe out everything else; and in the delirious dazzling joy of that consummation, he forgot to ask what would happen afterwards.
</blockquote>
<p>
Just so: what sort of world would this projected universal Americanization produce? Ever since World War II, American publicists have been describing the Earthly Paradise to be created by the establishing of "democratic capitalism" in every land-even though the phrase "democratic capitalism" is of recent origin, a bit of neoconservative cant. For instance, in 1951 there was published in the British periodical <i>The Twentieth Century</i> an article entitled "The New American Revolution." Its author was a David C. Williams, director of research for the Political Action Committee of the AFL-CIO. His sentences are interestingly similar to certain outpourings of the new Endowment for Democracy and other organs of "global democracy."
<p>
"This twentieth century manifestation of the American Revolution has been aptly called 'the revolution of rising expectations'," Williams wrote.
<p><blockquote>

Americans insist that it would be under way even of there were no such thing as Communism in the world.... The agents of this new revolution are the numerous officials, businessmen, technicians, and trade unionists whom the American Government is sending abroad.... American businessmen have the task of convincing their European counterparts that it pays to modernize, and to produce for the masses rather than the classes. They can assure their European friends that it is possible for them to achieve as a group the position of highest prestige in their communities, displacing landowners, civil servants, and officers of the armed forces from their traditional places of honor.
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus American energy is to become a revolutionary influence rather than a conservative one, deliberately appealing to cupidity, class envy, and the itch for change: so Williarns argued. In Asia, he continued, we Americans will help to "break down the traditional bonds of caste and family which prevail" and "drive the handicraft producers to the wall." Will there be anguished protests? So much the worse for reactionaries. We will condescend to educate them out of their prejudices. The new American revolution is not to everyone's taste," Williams declared unflinchingly.
<p><blockquote>

Those whose traditional positions of prestige will be overturned of course abhor it. But perhaps the greatest spiritual distress is felt by European and Asian intellectuals. To them, the American way of life appears crass and vulgar. Many American intellectuals would agree with them. But they would also warn them that the logic of mass production and mass markets cannot be resisted. The 'happiness' which the average man wants, and will get, is not yet that of the aesthete. The Communists of Eastern Europe showed a sound instinct of self-preservation when they banned American jazz as a corrupting influence. Cheap music, cheap comic books, Coca-Cola, and cars are what the people want- understandably, because they have had no opportunity to learn to want, or to obtain, anything better. Culture can no longer be preserved by being made the monopoly of the favored few. The much harder task lies ahead of educating the masses to want better and more satisfying things than they do now.
</blockquote>
<p>
So America's contribution to the universal "democratic capitalism" of the future (David C. Williams' premises granted) will be just this: cheapness-the cheapest music, the cheapest comic books, and the cheapest morality that can be provided. This indeed would be the revolution of revolutions, the hell of universal vulgarity and monotony. This is Cyrus P. Whittle, telling himself that not only is America the biggest thing on earth, but it is soon going to wipe out everything else; and in the dazzling delirious joy of that consummation forgetting to ask what will happen afterward.
<p>
This advocacy of an American-directed culture of materialism is not confined, by any means, to publicists for the great labor unions. A few years after Wiliiams wrote, I found myself at a large assembly in this city of Washington, a speaker sandwiched between Vice President Nixon and the gentleman then president of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. This latter speaker read aloud an address written by a Grub Street hack of the libertarian persuasion, in which he declared that America, happily, was a revolutionary power, not at all conservative; and that it would be American policy world-wide, to efface archaic cultures and sell backward peoples no end of American goods and services; also to bestow upon such peoples democratic ways of politics, whether the recipients might welcome democracy or not.
<p>
<b>Preserving Identity.</b> Here I interject a general proposition of mine bearing some relation to American foreign policy. It seems to be a law governing all life, from the unicellular inanimate forms to the highest human cultures, that every living organism of every genus and species endeavors, above all else, to preserve its identity. Whatever lives tries to make itself the center of the universe; it resists with the whole of its power the endeavors of competing forms of life to assimilate it to their substance and mode. Every living thing, as part of a species, prefers even death as an individual, to extinction as a distinct species. So if the lowliest alga struggles fatally against a threat to its peculiar identity, we ought not to be surprised that men and nations resist desperately-perhaps unreasoningly-any attempt to assimilate their character to some other body social. This resistance is the first law of their being, extending below the level of consciousness. There is one sure way to make a deadly enemy, and that is to propose to anybody, "Submit yourself to me, and I will improve your condition by relieving you from the burden of your own identity and by reconstituting your substance in my image."
<p>
Just that, in effect, was what the Russian Communists said, at the end of the World War IL to the unfortunate inhabitants of the Baltic states. And today we behold the desperate reaction of those peoples. Can we suppose that forced-draft Americanization, in the name of the abstraction "democratic capitalism," would be much more cordially received throughout the world than forced-draft Russianization in the name of "proletarian dictatorship"?
<p>
<b>Ruinous Results.</b> Let me call to the attention of the zealots for global democracy-that is, of course, American-directed democracy-of certain ruinous results which have occurred, and are occurring today, when in the name of "democracy" or of "democratic capitalism" the government of these United States has intervened to thrust some approved pattern of democratic institutions upon some nation-state whose political culture is far removed from the politics of North America. I will not go so far as to describe Lyndon Johnson's endeavor to bomb the Vietnamese of the North into being good democrats; this zealous attempt was unsuccessful. Rather, in that land let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, of how President Diem was found insufficiently democratic by President John F. Kennedy and Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge; how, therefore, Kennedy and Lodge, at the urging of the 'Gung-Ho boys" in the Department of State, connived with certain ruthlessly ambitious military men in South Vietnam to overthrow, and promptly murder, President Diem, the only leader who might have held back the Communists of the North. The consequence? Why, nowadays the South of Vietnam, like the North, is a grinding and impoverished "people's democracy," Marxist style. What a triumph of the democratic dogma!
<p>
Or consider what is happening in the Republic of South Africa today, the politics of that land having been found insufficiently democratic by the present Congress of the United States, the wise and temperate statesmen of the United Nations General Assembly, and other deliberative bodies in various quarters of the world. Because Jeremy Bentham's and Earl Warren's doctrine of "one man, one vote" has not been applied to the Bantu peoples of South Africa-whose political tradition is thoroughly undemocratic, consisting rather of the rule of hereditary chiefs who succeed through the matrilineal principle of descent- severe economics penalties are imposed upon the only political order in Africa which adheres to parliamentary government and the prescriptive rule of modern law.
<p>
It has been the deliberate policy of certain political interests in the United States to bring down that constitutional government by any possible means, regardless of consequences. "Let justice be done, though the heavens fall!" Already the heavens are falling in Natal, where different Bantu peoples and factions struggle fiercely one against another. Will such "liberation" be carried so far as it was in the Congo, now Zaire, where today the brutal despot Mobutu rules absolutely, supported by Washington and the bankers of New York? What a charming democratic prospect for South Africa! But there being lands beyond Stirling and men beyond Forth, the government of South Africa may find economic salvation, at least, through new trade treaties with the states of Eastern Europe and even the Soviet Union. The new governments 
of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and other countries are not under the illusion that proletarian dictatorship, or its African equivalent, is an expression of true democracy.
<p>
In short, I venture to suggest that it would be highly imprudent for the government of the United States to set about undermining regimes that do not seem perfectly democratic to the editors of the <i>New York Times</i>-whether that undermining be worked through the suasion and the money of the Endowment for Democracy, or through the CIA and the military operations of this land of liberty. There has come into my hands a recent document of the Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force, entitled "Military Operations in Low Intensity Conflict." Even the modified version of this report which I have obtained discusses such measures as the equalizing of incomes in "host nations" or "Third World Countries" as a means of aiding insurgency or counter-insurgency; and touches upon political and economic measures which American forces intervening in such lands might implement. I suspect that behind these military designs lies an impulse to "democratize" oldfangled orders in the Third World, by force if need be. This is the ideology of democratism, advocated, for instance, by the International Security Council, an unofficial group made up principally of veteran Cold Warriors. Brief sentences must suffice here to suggest the rather belligerent notions of this Council: "An artificial ideal of noninvolvement should not be the benchmark against which the profile of an American policy is judged. This is particularly applicable to a policy that directly promotes the values and practices of democracy." So write the publicists of this International Security Council.
<p>
<b>Tyranny of the Majority.</b> "Four legs good, two legs bad"-such is the ideology of the pigs in Animal Farm. "Democracy good, all else bad"-such is the democratist ideology. A politicized American army operating abroad would be no more popular soon than the Red Army has been. An imposed or induced abstract democracy thrust upon peoples unprepared for it would produce at first anarchy, and then-as in nearly all of "emergent" Africa, over the past four decades-rule by force and a master. About 1956, Chester Bowles, previously head of the Office of Price Administration, was writing and lecturing about how gratifyingly democratic lands like Angola and Mozambique would become under American tutelage once the colonial oppressor was forced out. I trust that everyone present here today knows the present circumstances of Angola and Mozambique: certainly Archbishop Tutu, of South Africa, is aware that African states nowadays are far worse off, in terms of liberty and order, than they were when governed by European administrators. For what deTocqueville called "the tyranny of the majority" we see all about us.
<p>
If by the word "democratic" is meant the complex of republican political institutions that has grown up in the United States over more than two centuries-why, the new paper constitutions being discussed in Eastern Europe cannot magically reproduce American history. If by "capitalism" is meant the massive and centralized corporate structures of North America-why, massive and centralized state capitalism is precisely what the self-liberated peoples of Eastern Europe are endeavoring to escape. The differing nations of our time must find their own several ways to order and justice and freedom. We Americans were not appointed their keepers.
<p>
I have been suggesting, ladies and gentlemen, that a soundly conservative foreign policy in the age which is dawning should be neither "interventionist" nor "isolationist"; it should be prudent. Its object should not be to secure the triumph everywhere of America's name and manners, under the slogan of "democratic capitalism," but instead the preservation of the true national interest, and acceptance of the diversity of economic and political institutions throughout the world. Soviet hegemony ought not to be succeeded by American hegemony. Our prospects in the world of the twenty-first century are bright-supposing we Americans do not swagger about the globe, proclaiming our omniscience and our omnipotence.

<P>
My Heritage Lectures of 1989 have had to do with eminent conservative men of letters whom I have known. Three of those four have crossed the bar and put out to sea. My proclivity for quoting such vanished friends of mine provoked one auditor, a few years past, into observing aloud, "Dr. Kirk, you're an anomaly: all of your friends are dead."
<p>
Today, however, with your permission, I will talk about a gentleman still in the land of the living: Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge, who for some decades has believed himself to be tottering on the brink of eternity, but who has survived most of his generation and stands at the height of his fame. His many books are so quotable that one is tempted to compose a lecture entirely of passages from Muggeridge, unadorned by comments. Restraining myself, nevertheless, I will try to trace for you the course of Malcolm Muggeridge's abhorrence of the political and moral attitude that is called liberalism. With the passage of the years, his detestation of the liberal mentality has steadily swelled.
<p>
Muggeridge is the author of the most moving and memorable autobiography of the twentieth century, <i>Chronicles of Wasted Time.</I> His memoirs were supposed to run to three volumes, but he has not completed the third, and presumably never will. Last year, however, he published a slim volume, written in the third person, entitled <i>Confessions of a Twentieth-Century Pilgrim,</i> the concluding portion of which touches upon the religious perceptions of his later years. Young men and women groping for a clue to guide them through the chaos of our age would do well to look into these witty and candid books. Muggeridge is given to quoting this stanza by William Blake:
<p><blockquote>
I give you the end of a Golden String,<br>
Only wind it into a ball,<br>
It will lead you in at Heaven's Gate <br>
Built in Jerusalem's Wall.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
At Heaven's Gate Muggeridge has very nearly arrived, after much stumbling and tribulation and fierce combats with the pen as weapon. Others wandering in a dark wood may profit from both his blunders and his successes.
<p>
<b>Waking Consciences.</b> But it is not Muggeridge, the Christian apologist of late years, that I mean to discuss with you today. Rather, I give you Muggeridge the satirist, successor to Aristophanes, Juvenal, Rabelais, and Swift. In an age of general decadence, satire may miss its mark. In the dictionary's definition, satire is 'directed to the correction of corruption, abuses, or absurdities in religion, politics, law, society, and letters." Mockingly, the satirist contrasts what is with what ought to be, and particularly, he contrasts the squalid present with a nobler past.
<p>
Yet when standards or norms have been long flouted and almost forgotten, often satire is thrust before blind eyes, or falls upon deaf ears; for not many people remain who recall that once upon a time there was talk of virtue. Such is the condition, in large part, of our culture in the latter half of the 20th century. This considered, Muggeridge's success in waking wits and consciences has been phenomenal. For the past fifty-five years, Muggeridge (to borrow two lines from Ben Jonson) has dared to "strip the ragged follies of the time/ Naked, as at their birth." In particular, he has scourged the moral and political folly called liberalism.
<p>
<b>Participating in "New Civilization."</b> A socialist in his upbringing, the young Muggeridge taught for some years in India and Egypt; obtained a post on the staff of the Manchester Guardian; and at the age of twenty-nine, accompanied by his wife, Kitty, made his way to Moscow, where he succeeded William Henry Chamberlin as Moscow correspondent of the Guardian. The Muggeridges believed earnestly that they were departing from a dying bourgeois culture to participate in a "new civilization," in which the human potential would be fulfilled. They arrived in September 1932. Within six months, Muggeridge came to know the hideousness of the communist regime, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.
<p><blockquote>
It destroys everything and everyone; is the essence of destruction-in towns, a darkness; a paralysis; in the country, a blight, sterility; shouting monotonously its empty formula-a classless, socialist society -it attacks with methodical barbarity, not only men and classes and institutions, but the soul of a society. It tears a society up by the roots and leaves it dead. "If we go," Lenin said, "we shall slam the door on an empty house."
</blockquote>
<p>
So Muggeridge wrote in his Moscow diary.
<p>
The editor of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> chose not to print much of the truth that Muggeridge sent him from the heart of darkness. In disgust, Muggeridge resigned from that famous newspaper, leaving himself unemployed and in unhappy circumstances. Out of his Russian months came his sardonic novel, <i>Winter in Moscow,</i> recently republished with an introduction by Mr. Michael Aeschliman.
<p>
<b>Folly and Knavery.</b> In that grim and witty book, Muggeridge faithfully describes the cowardice, hypocrisy, and stupidity of the journalists from the West, who rejected or ignored the plain evidences of the Great Famine and the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union and lavishly praised the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. England's liberal conscience complacently accepted the horrors of existence in the USSR, once the Dictatorship was securely established. As Muggeridge writes in <i>The Green Stick,</i> the first volume of his autobiography:
<p><blockquote>
Shaw, the Webbs and the other leading Fabians were... strongly opposed to the USSR in its early struggling days; they only began to admire it when it had hardened into an authoritarian terrorist regime. Their admiration turned to besotted adulation when Stalin took on the role, and very much the style, of the deposed Czar, only more brutally, efficiently and vaingloriously.
</blockquote>
<p>
Muggeridge's indignation at the folly and the knavery, during his Moscow winter, of both Western visitors to Russia and foreign correspondents posted there became the recurring theme of his several books and his almost innumerable periodical pieces. Thirty-seven years later, he returned to his commination of the fatuous liberals that he encountered in Moscow. "In those days, Moscow was the Mecca for every liberal mind, whatever its particular complexion," he would write in 1970.
<p><blockquote>

They flocked there in an unending procession, from the great ones like Shaw and Gide and Barbecue and Julian Huxley and Harold Laski and the Webbs, down to poor little teachers, crazed clergymen and millionaires, and drivelling dons; all utterly convinced that, under the aegis of the great Stalin, a new dawn was breaking in which the human race would at last be united in liberty, equality, and fraternity for evermore....They were prepared to believe anything, however preposterous; to overlook anything, however villainous; to approve anything, however obscurantist and brutally authoritarian, in order to be able to preserve intact the confident expectation that one of the most thoroughgoing, ruthless and bloody tyrannies ever to exist on earth could be relied on to champion human freedom, the brotherhood of man, and all the other good liberal causes to which they had dedicated their lives.
</blockquote>
<p>
Malcolm and Kitty Muggeridge had arrived in Moscow quite as credulous about the dictatorship of the Proletariat as were the other visitors whose foolishness he soon would denounce. But they had eyes with which to see; and they departed much wiser and overwhelmed by sadness. They had learned the hard truth about the communist regime; they had learned the shallowness and falseness of the Western liberal ideology.
<p>
<b>Paying the Price.</b> So Malcolm Muggeridge rejected liberalism-from 1933 onward. And the liberal establishment rejected him. For after he left the <i>Guardian</i> in disgust, he could secure no post with any English paper, being found "too extreme" in his words about the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. An interim appointment in Switzerland with the League of Nations bureaucracy was shameful servitude; the attempt to support his household by occasional free-lance writing soon collapsed. A novel based upon his experiences at the <i>Manchester Guardian</I> was suppressed foolishly by its publisher, upon the threat of a suit for libel. He came upon an advertisement of an editorial post vacant at an English-language newspaper in India; knowing something of India, he applied, though he had been thinking of suicide. Off he went, perforce, to the <i>Calcutta Statesman;</i> but the time would come when he would be the best-known journalist in the world, and the most mordant and dashing adversary of the liberal mentality. His acerbic prose would bring down many an eminent pomposity. One thinks of the lines of John Taylor, the 17th century "Water Poet":
<p><blockquote>

Pens are most dangerous tools, more sharp by odds <br>
Than swords, and cut more keen than whips or rods.
</blockquote>
<p>
This lecture of mine not being a biography of Mr. Muggeridge, we turn now to the wit and the invective of his case against liberalism. If one would find a source for his detestation of the liberal mind-aside, that is, from his personal experience of liberalism's impotence in several quarters of the world today-why, that source is the wisdom of Dr. Samuel Johnson, Muggeridge's favorite English writer, so often quoted by him. Johnson died before "liberalism" had become a term of morals and politics, but the self-proclaimed
Enlighteners of France during the age of Johnson were the intellectual ancestors of our 20th century liberals. The common-sensical reasoning of Johnson was Muggeridge's weapon, too, and later in life, Johnson's reliance upon the authority of Christian teaching.  
<p>
In the 18th century, nobody was more "the true-born Englishman" than Samuel Johnson. In the 20th century, Muggeridge is our best extant example of old English character and the English cast of mind.
<p>
<b>Assailing Liberalism.</b> What is this liberalism that Muggeridge so valiantly assails? He is not referring to the economic doctrines of Manchester-not primarily, at least. Muggeridge is not given to quoting John Henry Newman, but a passage from Newrnan's Apologia may suggest Muggeridge's fundamental objection. Newman remarks that he first heard the word "liberalism" in connection with the opinions of Lord Byron and his admirers. "Afterwards," Newman continues, "Liberalism was the badge of a theological school, of a dry and repulsive character, not very dangerous in itself, though dangerous as opening the door to evils which it did not itself either anticipate or comprehend. At present it is nothing else than that deep, plausible skepticism,... the development of human reason, as practically exercised by the natural man." Doubt of tradition, authority, things long established; deep corrosive doubt of the long-received belief in a constant human nature; doubt especially of man's power of moral choice and man's moral responsibility for his actions-these had become the characteristics of liberalism by Muggeridge's day. Their descent from the liberal skeptics of Newman's day, and more remotely from the Enlighteners of Johnson's day, is sufficiently obvious.
<p>
Bourgeois society, from which the liberal mentality arose, has been working its own destruction, Muggeridge asserts in <i>The Green Stick;</I> far more than any mob of revolutionaries, the bourgeois liberals' innovating notions have gnawed at the footings of personal and social order. Two bourgeoisie-"a typical Viennese general practitioner, and a British Museum Reading Room enrage'-Freud and Marx...undermined the whole basis of Western European civilization as no avowedly insurrectionary movement ever has or could," Muggeridge writes, "by promoting the notion of determinism, in the one case in morals, in the other in history, thereby relieving individual men and women of all responsibility for their personal and collective behaviour."
<p>
<b>False Gospel.</b> Muggeridge's most burning piece of invective against 20th century liberalism, "The Great Liberal DeathWish," first was published in 1970 and is reprinted in my anthology <i>The Portable Conservative Reader.</I> He commences his slashing essay with a reference to his Moscow experiences in 1932-1933, and he then proceeds to trace the misfortunes brought on by liberalism-which, he was to declare later, would bring to pass the disintegration of Christendom.
<p>
The fundamental error of liberalism is its false gospel of automatic and ineluctable progress, Muggeridge declares. This fallacy grew out of infatuation with Darwin's theory of natural selection. He despises the evangels of Scientism:
<p><blockquote>

... a Herbert Spencer, or a poor, squeaky H.G. Wells, ardent evolutionist and disciple of Huxley, with his vision of an earthly paradise achieved through science and technology; those twin monsters which have laid waste a whole world, polluting its seas and rivers and lakes with poisons, infecting its very earth and all its creatures, reaching into Man's mind and inner consciousness to control and condition him, at the same time entrusting to irresponsible, irresolute human hands the instruments of universal destruction....
<P>
The enthronement of the gospel of progress necessarily required the final discrediting of the gospel of Christ, and the destruction of the whole edifice of ethics, law, culture, human relationships and human behaviour constructed upon it. Our civilization, after all, began with Christian revelation, not the theory of evolution, and, we may be sure, will perish with it, too-if it has not already.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Cult and Culture.</b> Along with T.S. Eliot and Donald Davidson, whose work I discussed in Heritage Lectures earlier this year, Malcolm Muggeridge tells us that, as Christian belief is rejected, so modern civilization stumbles down to dusty death. So thought the novelist Robert Graves; so the historian Eric Voegelin; so the sociologist Pitirim Sorokin. Culture arises from the cult; when the cult dissolves, so in time does the culture. Thus Muggeridge's declaration that the destruction of religious belief causes the collapse of modern society is not peculiar to him; but he expresses this shattering judgement with high sardonic power. Take this passage from 'The Great Liberal Death Wish":
<p><blockquote>

It is, indeed, among Christians themselves that the final decisive assault on Christianity has been mounted; led by the Protestant churches, but with Roman Catholics eagerly, if belatedly, joining in the fray. All they had to show was that when Jesus said that His kingdom was not of this world, He meant that it was. Then, moving on from there, to stand the other basic Christian propositions similarly on their heads. As, that to be carnally minded is life; that it is essential to lay up treasure on earth in the shape of a constantly expanding Gross National Product; that the flesh lusts with the spirit and the spirit with the flesh, so that we can do whatever we have a mind to; that he that loveth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. And so on. One recalls a like adjustment of the rules in Orwell's <i>Animal Farm.</I> A whole series of new interpretative 'translations' of the Bible have appeared supporting the new view, and in case there should be any anxiety about the reception of these adjustments in Heaven, God, we are told on the best theological authority, has died.
</blockquote><p>

Christian faith arose upon belief in Christ's promise of the resurrection of the flesh and the life everlasting. What liberalism seeks is not the life eternal, but the oblivion of death: the liberals' doctrinaire advocacy of contraception and abortion is evidence of their overpowering death wish. Copulation without population is their obsession. In Muggeridge's words:
<p><blockquote>

If sex provides the mysticism of the great liberal death wish, it needs, as well, its own special mumbojumbo and brainwashing device; a moral equivalent of conversion, whereby the old Adam of ignorance and superstition and the blind acceptance of tradition is put aside, and the new liberal man is born-enlightened, erudite, cultivated. This is readily to hand in education in all its many branches and affiliations. To the liberal mind, education provides the universal panacea. Whatever the problem, education will solve it. Law and order breaking down?-then yet more statistics chasing yet more education; venereal disease spreading, to the point that girls of ten are found to be infected?-then, for heaven's sake, more sex education, with tiny tots lisping out what happens to mummy's vagina when daddy erects, as once they did the Catechism; drug addiction going up by leaps and bounds, especially in the homes where television is looked at...- surely it's obvious that what the kids need is extra classes under
 trained psychiatrists to instruct them in the why and the wherefore of narcotics.
</blockquote>
<p>
Muggeridge touches in this article and elsewhere upon the liberals' perverse attachment to whatever political causes are hostile to things established in our civilization-for example, on why any friends to British or American interests are denounced by the liberals as reactionaries. One instance, "Why, in a world full of oppressive regimes and terrorist practices, in England the venom and fury of the liberal mind should pick on the white South Africans with particular spleen when their oligarchic rule only differs from that of a dozen others-Tito's, Franco's, Ulbricht's, Castro's, etc.-in that they happen to be anxious to be on good terms with the English."
<p>
<b>Life-Denying Freedom.</b> The liberal mentality seems bent upon annihilation of the convictions and circumstances that have made possible a liberal democratic society. Everywhere today's liberals demand more freedom. But freedom from what? Why, freedom from that order, public and personal, which has nurtured justice and true liberty. The typical latter-day liberal is not aware that his proposals and his actions are life denying; nay, he fancies that they are life enhancing; nevertheless, he is driven by his unrecognized death wish. Down with civilization that we may be liberated from all restraints. Indulge me in two more quotations from the concluding pages of Muggeridge's burning essay. He cries prophetically:
<p><blockquote>

I see the great liberal death wish driving through the years ahead in triple harness with the gospel of progress and the pursuit of happiness. These are our three Horsemen of the Apocalypse-progress, -- happiness, death. Under their auspices, the quest for total affluence leads to total deprivation; for total peace, to total war; for total education, to total illiteracy; for total sex, to total sterility; for total freedom, to total servitude. Seeking only agreement based on a majority, we find a consensus based on a consensocracy, or oligarchy of the liberal mind....
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>&quot;Wasteland of Satiety."</b> Malcolm Muggeridge abandons all hope for this temporal world of ours, this society in love with death, willing its own dissolution. I have quoted many times the final paragraph of his overwhelming jeremiad:
<p><blockquote>

As the astronauts soar into the vast eternities of space, on earth the garbage piles higher; as the groves of academe extend their domain, their alumni's arms reach lower; as the phallic cult spreads, so does impotence. In great wealth, great poverty; in health, sickness; in numbers, deception. Gorging, left hungry; sedated, left restless; telling all, hiding all; in flesh united, forever separate. So we press on through the valley of abundance that leads to the wasteland of satiety, passing through the gardens of fantasy; seeking happiness ever more ardently, and finding despair ever more surely.
</blockquote>
<p>
A decade ago, Malcolm and Kitty Muggeridge visited us at Mecosta for three days. We ought to have read aloud Whittier's <i>Snowbound,</I> for a great blizzard descended upon us all. The occasion was one of the seminars sponsored by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, which are held from time to time at our house of Piety Hill. "Pilgrims in the Dark Wood of Our Time" was the general title I had given to the seminar; possibly that put into Mr. Muggeridge's mind the title of his most recent books <i>Confessions of a Twentieth-Century Pilgrim.</i> On a Saturday afternoon, my wife and I took the Muggeridges walking in a dark wood of spruces and pines planted by me thirty years before, on my ancestral acres. We have a photograph of the four of us cheerful in a snowy grove, Malcolm wearing a black fur cap, Kitty with a scarf wound over her face, Annette laughing in green cap and muffler, I bareheaded and burly. This perhaps was, and is, one of those moments when, as T.S. Eliot puts it, time and the timeless intersect: the four of us may experience that wintry stroll through eternity.
<p>
<b>Good Riddance to Modernity.</b> In his lectures to our ISI seminar, Mr. Muggeridge was so despairing of our bent 20th century culture that the undergraduates in our audience, by contrast, took me for a carefree optimist. Corrupted by our intellectual delusions, intoxicated by our affluence, betrayed by our own gadgets, Muggeridge told our seminar, why, modernity is not long for this world, and good riddance.
<p>
The triumph of television seals our doom, he declared: mass inanity and the manipulation of public opinion, the overwhelming of decent taste, the undoing of books and schooling- these are the gifts of the boob tube. It is not possible to un-invent television.
<p>
Now it was through his regular and unforgettable appearances on television for the British Broadcasting Company that Malcolm Muggeridge had grown famous and prosperous in the 1960s. His craggy face with its deep-set eyes, his urbanity of manner, his sharpness of wit had won him an immense audience of viewers. The man who speaks from the television screen to gullible millions possesses power, but Malcolm Muggeridge rejected such power.
<p>
As Ian Hunter writes in his able biography of Muggeridge:
<p><blockquote>

...[he] has always been fascinated and repelled by the spectacle of power and those who wield it....Power is to the collectivity, he believes, what lust is to the individual-'an expense of spirit in a waste of shame' in Shakespeare's elegant phrase. Through the practice of half a century of journalism, and particularly since the advent of television, he has been brought in contrast with prime ministers, potentates, and despots, people who have achieved power over their fellowmen by acclamation, birth, persuasion, the ballot bow, or the barrel of a gun. Its effect on almost all of them, he has observed, is to corrupt-not in the more obvious sense in which Lord Acton spoke of power corrupting, but in subtler, more insidious ways; principally, by diverting their attention from what is enduring, true, and worthwhile to what is evanescent, circumstantial, and tawdry. 'Here am I, Captain of a Legion of Rome,' runs an inscription Muggeridge is fond of quoting, 'who served in the Libyan desert and learns and ponders this truth-there are in life but two things, love and power, and no man can have both.'
</blockquote>
<p>
His view has partly been shaped by his own experiences... of ballot boxes and interminable parliamentary debates in Paris and London and Washington, which finish up in societies so aimless and enfeebled that they are unable to resist either external aggressors or internal terrorists, yielding simultaneously to barbarians from without and within, and in their last legislative gasp striving to extinguish individual
 freedom through the closed shop and individual life through legalized abortion.
<p>
Choose love, not power, Muggeridge tells us. He does not show our society any way of escape from Avernus. But he does exhort us, as souls, to seek our salvation with diligence.
<p>
<b>Wise Child. </b>It is a sign of Malcolm Muggeridge's genuineness that children take to him. Our second daughter, Cecilia, ten years old when the Muggeridges made their way to our abode in the Michigan backwoods, sat in the front row during Mr. Muggeridges's lectures, quietly observant. Later we asked her, "Cecilia, did you understand what Mr. Muggeridge was saying?" She replied demurely, "Not everything, but more than I expected." She has been wise ever since.
<p>
We lodged Malcolm and Kitty in our own large bedchamber, which has a fireplace; for English people-and no couple is more English than the Muggeridges-are very fond indeed of open fires. Now at that time our youngest daughter, Andrea, aged three years, was in the habit, about the witching hour of creeping into our room from her own and snuggling herself between her parents. Our house, by the way, is notoriously haunted.
<p>
Forgetful that her parents had resigned their room to the English guests, tiny Andrea... but here I turn to a report from Kitty Muggeridge.

"We had a visitor in our room last night," Mrs. Muggeridge told us, "a small figure in white. It came silently, and crawled into bed between us."
<p>
"It looked at Malcolm, and next at me. Then, after an interval, it said, 'I'd better be going now,' and departed."
<p>
"How long did it stay?" we asked Mrs. Muggeridge.
<p>
"Long enough so as not to give offense by leaving," she told us.
<p>
<b>The Only Happiness.</b> As a pilgrim for eighty-six years in this dark wood of our time, Malcolm Muggeridge has beheld the destruction of much and the ugly alteration of more. Yet, like Democritus, he is always laughing. "All that I can claim to have learnt from the years I have spent in this world is that the only happiness is love," he writes in the first chapter of <i>The Green Stick,</i> "and that the world itself only becomes the dear and habitable dwelling place it is when we who inhabit it know we are migrants, due when the time comes to fly away to other more commodious skies."
<p>
So, sincerely, writes the most convincing satirist of our age. At whatever risk, ever since 1932, Malcolm Muggeridge has uttered the truth. One of his harder truths is that liberalism now has become rotten to the core. Somewhere Muggeridge remarks that people learn not from exhortation, but from experience. Before this century is out, doubtless the surviving votaries of liberalism will be taught some more disagreeable lessons.

Leviathan is a Hebrew word signifying "that which gathers itself in folds." In the Old Testament, Leviathan is the great sea-beast: "Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?" In the 17th century, Thomas Hobbes-whom T.S. Eliot calls "that presumptuous little upstart"- made Leviathan the symbol of the state, or rather of mass-society, composed of innumerable little atomic individual human beings.
<p>
Today I am concerned not with Hobbes, but with Donald Davidson and his book <i>The Attack on Leviathan</i>. In 1938, long before the administration of Lyndon Johnson popularized the slogan "The Great Society," Davidson wrote that his Leviathan is "the idea of the Great Society, organized under a single, complex, but strong and highly centralized national government, motivated ultimately by men's desire for economic welfare of a specific kind rather than their desire for personal liberty." Four decades later, Leviathan looms larger than ever.
<p>
The southern states that once formed the Confederacy have been the most conservative region of America, it is generally agreed. Once upon a time, Richard Weaver told me that Middle Tennessee is the most southern part of the South. There in Middle Tennessee, near the town of Pulaski, in 1893, Donald Davidson was born. Surely Davidson was the most redoubtably conservative of those able American men of letters who have been called the Southern Agrarians. As poet, as critic, as historian, and as political thinker, Davidson was a stalwart defender of America's permanent things during an era of radical change.
<p>
<b>Scourging the Centralizers.</b> I propose to discuss with you Donald Davidson as the latter-day champion of the South's political and social inheritance. Ever since the forming of the Union in 1787, the dominant political tendency in the southern states has been resistance to the centralizing of power. Far more than any other region, the South has set its face against Leviathan-that is, against the swelling omnipotent nation-state, what Tocqueville called "democratic despotism," the political collectivity that reduces men and women to social atoms. In his strong book <i>The Attack on Leviathan</i>, published in 1938, Davidson scourged the centralizers- and that at a time when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was doing much as he liked with the United States of America.
<p>
Permit me first to say something about Davidson and his writings; and then to discuss the social principles for which the Southern Agrarians and their allies stood.
<p>
Browsing in the library at Michigan State College, in 1938, an earnest sophomore, I happened upon a new book, published by the University of North Carolina Press, entitled <i>The Attack on Leviathan,</I> subtitled <i>Regionalism and Nationalism in the United States.</i> It was written eloquently, and for me it made coherent the misgivings I had felt concerning the political notions popular in the 1930s. The book was so good that I assumed all intelligent
<p>
Americans, or almost all, were reading it. Actually, as I learned years later, the University of North Carolina Press pulped the book's sheets after only a few hundred copies had been sold: clearly an act of discrimination against conservative views. I had a hand in the reprinting of the book by another firm in 1963; and now I aspire to bring out a third printing in the Library of Conservative Thought, which I edit for Transaction Books.
<p>
Opinion Shapers. Professor Davidson rowed against the tide of opinion among America's intellectuals in 1938. Centralizing nationalism, he argued, is of necessity tyrannical and enslaving. For a specimen of his method and style, take this passage from his chapter on American literature. He has been criticizing Emerson, and he finds that the opinion shapers of New York and Boston during the 1930s are Emerson's heirs:
<p><blockquote>
In our own time, the metropolitan critics are making national prescriptions that are equally partial, though somewhat more confused. In one sentence they assure us that the industrial unification of America is desirable and inevitable; but in the next sentence they declare that the civilization thus produced puts upon us an intolerable spiritual bondage from which the artist cannot escape save through the shibboleths of Marxism and Freudianism. Wearily, they proclaim that America is standardized; but angrily they scorn the rural backwardness of regions that prove to be, after all, less urban than New York. Confidently they announce that America must be industrialized; but they sneer at Mr. Babbitt of the Middle West, the creature of industrialism. They urge the provinces to adopt the intellectual sophistication of the Eastern metropolis; but among themselves they bewail the poverty of the modern temper, which in its sophistication has left them nothing to enjoy.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Now could one write, in this year of 1989, a better description of the mentality of such American intellectuals? One might substitute, of course, the phrase "the industrial unification of the world" for that of America; for nowadays the whole of the world must be subjected to those environmental mischiefs and social discontents that already have worked immense harm in the "developed countries."
<p>
<b>Sword of Imagination.</b> Davidson was bold enough to defend the agricultural economy against industrial aggrandizement. (Parenthetically, it seems worth remarking that in recent years the dollar volume of agricultural produce in the industrial state of Michigan has exceeded the dollar volume of manufactured products.) Bolder still, he took up the cause of his own region, the South, against the nationalizers of New York and Washington. He appreciated, too, other American regions: New England, the Great Plains, the Lake States, the Pacific coast. But it was the South which required the service of Davidson's sword of imagination.
<p>
"Can principles enunciated as Southern principles, of whatever cast, get a hearing?" he inquired in <i>The Attack on Leviathan.</I>
<p><blockquote>
...It seems to be a rule that the more special the program and the more remote it is from Southern principles, the greater the likelihood of its being discussed and promulgated. Southerners who wish to engage in public discussion in terms that do not happen to be of common report in the New York newspapers are likely to be met, at the levels where one would least expect it, with the tactics of distortion, abuse, polite tut-tutting, angry discrimination and so on down to the baser devices of journalistic lynching which compose the modern propagandist's stock in trade. This is an easy and comparatively certain means of discrediting an opponent and of thus denying him a hearing. It is also a fatal means. For if such approaches to public questions are encouraged and condoned, then confusion has done its work well, the days of free and open discussion of ideas is over in the South, only matters of crass expediency can come into the public forum at all, and we face the miserable prospect of becoming the most inert and passive section of the United States, or else of falling into blind and violent divisions whose pent-up forces will hurl us at each other's throats. Then will Jefferson's prophetic vision come true. We shall take to eating one another, as they do in Europe.
</blockquote>
<p>
Such matters have not much improved since Davidson wrote those sentences, half a century past: the South continues to be treated by Congress as if it were a subject province (in voter registration especially), and the New York newspapers remain ungenerous.
<p>
<b>Urban Symbol.</b> New York City was to Donald Davidson the abomination of desolation. He and his wife spent their summers at Middlebury College in Vermont; and Davidson took extraordinary pains to avoid passing through New York City en route. For that matter, he detested sprawling modern cities generally, Nashville included, though he found it necessary to reside most of his life in the neighborhood of Vanderbilt University. To his volume of poems <i>The Tall Men</i> (published in 1927) Davidson had a prologue, She Long Street," the antithesis of the rural Tennessee of yesteryear, that land of heroes. That Long Street-I think of devastated Woodward Avenue in Detroit- is the symbol of a dehumanized urban industrial culture:
<p><blockquote>

The grass cannot remember; trees cannot <br>
Remember what once was here. But even so, <br>
They too are here no longer. Where is the grass? <br>
Only the blind stone roots of the dull street <br>
And the steel thews of houses flourish here <br>
And the baked curve of asphalt, smooth, trodden <br>
Covers dead earth that once was quick with grass, <br>
Snuffing the ground with acrid breath the motors <br>
Fret the long street. Steel answers steel. Dust whirls. <br>
Skulls hurry past with the pale flesh yet clinging <br>
And a little hair. <br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Thirty-five years later, Davidson published another volume of verse, to which he transferred the title <i>The Long Street.</i> In his poem "Old Sailor's Choice" he describes Ulysses's voyage to hell and beyond. Contrary to the counsels of a modern Circe, Ulysses chooses Charybdis over Scylla, though modern men lust for Scylla's deadly embrace, "the monstrous lips, the darting neck of their love-death." Davidson describes the ensnaring monster Scylla, a very modern horror:
<p><blockquote>
Within her cliffs of sheer synthetic rock<br>
She glides on steely pathways. Plastic walls<br>
Checkered in pseudo-marble cavern her lair.<br>
These throw you off guard. "How," you ask,<br>
 Can anything go wrong where all is right- <br>
Rectangular, side-ruled, and functional? <br>
Mercy, pity, peace can be manufactured. <br>
Scylla can end your pain <br>
Now that the State decrees a tax increase <br>
And no one can complain. <br>
The neat-cut stencil echoes the brisk type. <br>
Machines do the rest. The postage is metered. <br>
And there is your release: <br>
Well-packaged, mercy, pity, peace. <br>
And I saw the stretching neck and the grinning teeth <br>
In the soundproof room where artificial daylight <br>
Blacks out the scudding clouds and the churning storm-wrack <br>
And the secretary with half-naked breasts <br>
Extends the telephone on a crimson claw <br>
And murmurs Washington is calling! <br>
</blockquote>
<p>
Washington did not call Donald Davidson, who was a guardian of the permanent things, which perish on the pavements of the Long Street. The Scylla of "Old Sailor's Choice" is the enormous welfare state, which devours the spirit.
<p>
Poetic Works of Politics. We return to Davidson's prose. Politics, I never tire of repeating, is the art of the possible-and the preoccupation of the quarter-educated. That is, politics ranks low in order of precedence of the works of the mind, if one refers simply to defecated political theory and practice, cut off from revelation and right reason and imagination. But Professor Davidson never divorced politics from religion or imaginative literature or tradition. He knew that the greatest works of politics are poetic. In his later collection of essays entitled <i>Still Rebels, Still Yankees</i> (1957), he writes about the dissociation of the poet from society, now
<p><blockquote>

...painfully apparent as society has accepted the dominance of science and consequently has become indisposed to accept poetry as truth.... In this phase of operations the poet may well become an outright traditionalist in religion, politics, and economics. He examines the defects of modern civilization. He develops a sense of catastrophe. With an insight far more accurate than the forecasts of professional social philosophers, he begins to plot the lines of stress and strain along which disaster will erupt. He predicts the ruin of modern secularized society and makes offers of salvation. These are unheard of or unheeded. Then upon the deaf ears and faceless bodies of modern society he invokes the poet's curse.
</blockquote>
<p>
Eliot's poetic curse was that famous fatal dismissal, "This is the way the world ends/ Not with a bang but a whimper." Davidson, fiercely though he reproached a sensate age, was not quite ready to pronounce a curse upon his time . Tradition still might reassert its old power. Take this passage from his essay "Futurism and Archaism in Toynbee and Hardy" contained in <i>Still Rebels, Still Yankees:</i>
<p><blockquote>

'You cannot turn the clock back!' is the commonest taunt of our day. It always emerges as the clinching argument that any modernist offers any traditionalist when the question is: 'What shall we do now?' But it
 is not really an argument. It is a taunt intended to discredit the traditionalist by stigmatizing him a traitor to an idea of progress that is assumed as utterly valid and generally accepted. The aim is, furthermore, to poison the traditionalist's own mind and disturb his self-confidence by the insinuation that he is a laggard in the world's great procession. His faith in an established good is made to seem nostalgic devotion to a mere phantom of the buried past. His opposition to the new-no matter how ill-advised, inartistic, destructive, or immoral that new may be-is defined as a quixotic defiance of the Inevitable. To use a term invented by Arnold J. Toynbee, he is an Archaist. By definition, he is therefore doomed.
</blockquote>
<p>
To abide by Tradition is not to fall into Archaism, Davidson told the rising generation. As for turning back the clock-why, as Davidson puts it, "Neither can you turn the clock forward, for Time is beyond human control." When a Futurist uses this clock metaphor, we perceive an unconscious revelation of his weakness. He wishes to imply that his design, and his only, is perfectly in step with some scientific master cloak of cause and effect that deter nines the progress of human events. This implication has no basis in reality, since the Futurist actually means to break off all connection with the historical process of cause and effect and to substitute for it an imagined, ideal process of quasi-scientific future development which is nothing more than a sociological version of Darwinism.
<p>
<b>Gifted and Versatile.</b> Such was the conservative mind of Donald Davidson. If I have made him seem somewhat abstract-why, that has been my blunder. He was remarkably versatile: a collector of folk ballads, a gifted lecturer, a writer of librettos, an historian, even from time to time active in the troubled politics of Tennessee. He was all too well aware of the huge blunders in public policy during the 20th century. If one turns to the second volume of his history of the Tennessee River, one finds three chapters accurately exposing the failures of that enormous undertaking, so ardently commended by the liberal press and most Tennessee politicians-yet so founded upon economic and social fallacies.
<p>
In person, Davidson was a lean and austere gentleman who smiled rarely; his conversation, nevertheless, was lively, and he was a kindly host. He had been a courageous soldier. To the end he lived with dignity, lamenting the destruction of dignity within universities. Once I walked with him on the campus at Vanderbilt; he told me of how most of the trees there had been felled not long before to make space for more automobiles. This was bad enough; but to make his indignation perfect, grim rows of parking meters had been installed. A militant survivor from what he called "the old regime," Davidson spoke contemptuously of his university's administrators. Students venerated him. He wrote to me on August 31,1954: "Living in Nashville and teaching at Vanderbilt University is very hard on a Southern Agrarian, I can assure you. It is, in fact, nothing but warfare, and we can't survive very long without some place to lick our wounds for a while." (He wrote this from Ripton, Vermont, where the Davidsons spent their summers at the Breadloaf School.)
<p>
<b>Neglected Agrarians. </b>Vanderbilt's administration disparaged the Agrarians and, in effect, would not accept Davidson's or AllenTate's papers as gifts. For that matter, the literate South generally neglected those Agrarians, the most illustrious of southern sons, in their own time. Only when New York paid attention to Tate, Warren, Ransom, Lytle, and others did the South prick up its ears. As that 17th-century "Person of No Quality" put it,
<p><blockquote>

Seven cities now contend for Homer dead,<br>
Through which the living Homer begged his bread.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
I fear I have given you, ladies and gentlemen, only a fragmentary summary of Donald Davidson's social thought. But now I pass to some remarks on the Southern Agrarians generally-one of them, Mr. Andrew Lytle, will spend some days at a seminar in my house, next month, so the breed is still quick-and to the pressing question of what to do about Leviathan.
<p>
Nearly sixty years ago, when I was a fourth-grader in the very northern town of Plymouth, Michigan, twelve southerners published a book entitled <i>I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition. </I> That slim volume, a heartfelt defense of the permanent things in the South's culture, has been discussed ever since; a literature of assent or of disapproval has developed about it. Young men and women who come to study with me in my northern fastness discover this literature-even without my having commented on any of it-and read-the books, night upon night, even to the witching hour of three.
<p>
Christian humanism, stern criticism of the industrial mass society, detestation of communism and other forms of collectivism, attachment to the ways of the Old South, in valor and in manners- these were the principles joining the twelve Southern Agrarians who took their stand in Dixieland in 1930. Their twelve essays were approved by T.S. Eliot and some other reflective people at the time the book was published; yet for the most part the Agrarians met with hostility and ridicule. Today their book sometimes meets with understanding, for we are farther down the track to Avernus.
<p>
<b>Reminder and Challenge.</b> As Louis Rubin says of the Twelve Southerners, <i>In Take My Stand</i> "is the rebuke to materialism, a corrective to the worship of Progress, and a reaffirmation of man's aesthetic and spiritual needs. And because the South has come so late into the industrial world, it appeals to the hungering memory within the Southerner's mind of the tranquil and leisurely Southern life that existed before the machines and superhighways came. As such the book constitutes both a reminder and a challenge. What are you losing that you once possessed? Are you sure that you want to discard it entirely?"
<p>
Despite the considerable attention paid nationally to these Agrarian writers, it was not easy for them to find publishers; or, if their writings should be published, to keep them in print. Yet they persisted; and in the long run their high talents as men of letters gave them for some years, about the period of my college days, ascendancy over the realm of letters, even in Manhattan-a mild domination that endured until recent years, when it was overthrown by the squalid oligarchs of the <i>New York Review of Books.</i> (Even here the South has made a successful counterattack, most conspicuously in the homage paid to Flannery O'Connor and Walker Percy.) As a group, the Agrarians illustrated well the remark made by Lionel Trilling in 1950 that the 20th century writers possessing imagination were not liberals-distinctly not.
<p>
<b>Demolished and Uglifiled.</b> The Twelve Southerners, Donald Davidson among them, knew that the South would change. As Stark Young put it in his essay "Not in Memoriam, But in Defense," which concluded their book "That a change is now in course all over the South is plain; and it is as plain that the South changing must be the South still, remembering that for no thing can there be any completeness that is outside its own nature, and no thing for which there is any advance save in its own kind. If this were not so, all nature by now would have dissolved in chaos and folly, nothing in it...."
<p>
Yet the South's pace of change has been more rapid, these six decades past, and more overwhelming, than even the gloomiest of the Twelve Southerners expected. Old Nashville, the domicile of the Fugitives and the Agrarians, has been thoroughly demolished and uglified, Strickland's capitol on its hill besieged by the haughty office towers of state and federal bureaucracies and of teachers' unions. Much else, in Nashville and nearly all the South, has gone by the board-among those losses, the disappearance of Southern architectural styles.
<p>
Along with the dwindling of a distinctive Dixie has come relative economic prosperity. It is factory-town prosperity. The rural pattern of existence, which the Agrarians praised, still endures here and there south of Mason's and Dixon's Line, but it has been brutally buffeted during the past sixty years.
<p>
Of the Twelve Southerners, two-Andrew Lytle and Robert Penn Warren-still are here in the land of the living. Modernity has been doing its worst to wipe out Southerners of their sort, in part by sweeping away-in the South and elsewhere-the sort of schooling that men like Davidson and Lytle and Warren profited by. And the welfare state has striven to efface, as impoverished and culturally deprived, the old rural pattern of the South-or, for that matter, of Northern rural counties like that I inhabit-which endured little altered until the building of the "good roads."
<p>
Tide what may betide, the Southern Agrarians will loom large in histories of American thought and -letters. With liberalism in America now nearly mindless, some of the rising generation in this land are finding in Donald Davidson's prose and verse, and in the writings of other Agrarians, an understanding of personal and social order far removed from desiccated liberal attitudes.
<p>
Six decades after Donald Davidson, Andrew Lytle, Lyle Lanier, Allen Tate, John Crowe Ransom, Frank Owsley, John Gould Fletcher, H.C. Nixon, Robert Penn Warren, John Donald Wade, Henry Blue Kline, and Stark Young took up arms against Leviathan, how goes the fight?
<p>
Like the Celts of the Twilight, it seems, the Agrarians have gone forth often to battle, but never to victory. America's farmers now total perhaps 5 percent of the national population. The South has been subjugated a second time by the federal government, and endures a second political Reconstruction-although this time the southern economy is far from ruined. Centralization of power in Washington was carried much farther by Lyndon Johnson than ever it had been by Franklin Roosevelt; states still nominally sovereign are reduced to a condition little better than that of provinces. The nationwide television broadcasters are rapidly effacing any remnants of regional cultures. The public educational establishment exhorts its teachers and its charges to sing "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" rather than "Dixie." In many other ways, Leviathan looms far vaster than the monster was in 1930.
<p>
<b>Swallowed by Leviathan.</b> And yet the predictions of the Twelve Southerners like those of Cassandra, are being fulfilled. Our great cities, a hundred Long Streets, are nearly ruined, ravaged by crime, their population corrupted or endangered by deadly narcotics, all community destroyed. Our boasted affluence is given the lie by the swift and sinister growth of a genuine proletariat, voracious and unruly, subsisting at public expense. Our layers of governmental bureaucracy are increasingly inefficient and vexatious. Our legislatures, national and state, seem willing to yield to every demand of a pressure group, regardless of the true public interest. Our judges, or many of them, have turned demagogues. Our air is polluted badly, our countryside uglified, public taste corrupted. Our children are brought up indulgently on images of terrible violence and gross sexuality. Schooling at every level is reduced to child care, adolescent sitting, and collegiate mating: humane letters and history are contemned. While we talk windily still of free enterprise, the industrial and commercial conglomerates move toward oligopoly on a tremendous scale. Religious belief and observance have been first reduced to the ethos of sociability, and then to ignorant discourses on revolution. Leviathan, the monstrous society, has swallowed his myriads. What hope for the person and the republic?
<p>
Certain sanguine neoconservatives inform us that America in this year of our Lord 1989 is virtually an earthly paradise of democratic capitalism. This sensate, materialistic, bored, trivial, and often perverse culture of ours today, the summit of human striving? What an absurd contention! But then, most neoconservatives are liberals thinly veiled. Leviathan does not need to pursue such people: they swim eagerly into his maw. The patronage empire of the great "charitable" foundations, by the way, is yet another manifestation of Leviathan.
<p>
<b>Salute to the Southerners.</b> So I do commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, the genuine conservatism of the Twelve Southerners. It is not the only mode of conservative thought, but it is an important mode. The authors of I'll Take My Stand did not propound a rigorous ideology or display a model of Utopia: their principal purpose it was to open our eyes to the illusions of Modernism. The Southern Agrarians proclaimed when I was a child that the southern culture is worth defending; that society is something more than the gross national product; that the country lane is healthier than the Long Street; that more wisdom lies in Tradition than in Scientism; that Leviathan is a devourer, not a savior. Your servant, a northerner of northerners, salutes those Twelve Southerners, some quick, some dead. Study what they have written, and you will discover that they are no mere Archaists.
<p>
"Worn out with abstraction and novelty, plagued with divided counsels, some Americans have said: I will believe the old folks at home, who have kept alive through many treacherous outmodings some good secret of life." So Donald Davidson writes in his chapter "The Diversity of America." He continues, "Such moderns prefer to grasp the particular. They want something to engage both their reason and their love. They distrust the advice of John Dewey to 'use the foresight of the future to refine and expand present activities.' The future is not yet; it is unknowable, intangible. But the past was, the present is; of that much they can be sure. So they attach themselves-or re-attach themselves-to a home-section, one of the sections, great or small, defined in the long conquest of our continental area. They seek spiritual and cultural autonomy....They are learning how to meet the subtlest and most dangerous foe of humanity-the tyranny that wears the mask of humanitarianism and benevolence. They are attacking Leviathan."
<p>
Amen to that, Donald Davidson, my old friend, now passed into eternity. Ladies and gentlemen, go forth and do likewise: strike a blow against Leviathan, the monster of the mass-age.

Today I offer you some observations concerning Wilhelm Roepke, a principal social thinker of the 20th century-and, incidentally, the principal architect of Germany's economic recovery at the end of the Second World War. His books are out of print in this country at present, but I plan to reprint in a series that I edit, <I>The Library of Conservative Thought,</i> his study <i>The Social Crisis of Our Time,</i> and later other books of his. And to my remarks on Professor Roepke, I shall add certain related reflections of my own.
<p>
Roepke was the principal champion of a humane economy: that is, an economic system suited to human nature and to a humane scale in society, as opposed to systems bent upon mass production regardless of counterproductive personal and social consequences. He was a formidable opponent of socialist and other "command" economies; also a fearless, perceptive critic of an unthinking "capitalism." Although German by birth, during the Second World War, Roepke settled at Geneva, where he became professor of economics at the Graduate Institute of International Affairs. There he wrote <i>Civitas Humana; The Social Crisis of Our Time; Economics of the Free Society; The Solution of the German Problem;</I> and the essays included in the volumes <I>Against the Tide and Welfare, Freedom, and Inflation.</i> The title of his last book, <I>A Humane Economy,</I> which was published in America, was suggested by me.
<p>
A gentleman of high courage and a sincere Christian, Roepke set his face against both the Nazis and the communists. He was intellectually and physically vigorous: an accomplished skier, he always climbed back up the mountainside, rather than riding a chair-lift. Knowing that man is more than producer and consumer, Roepke detested Jeremy Bentham's Utilitarianism and found that most of his fellow economists perceived human existence imperfectly, being blinkered by utilitarian dogmata.
<p>
<b>Opposing A Malign Power.</b> Before turning to Roepke's arguments, I venture to offer some background of his thought during the disorderly period that followed upon the Second World War, a time during which the idea of grand-scale social planning exercised a malign power. Roepke was the most effective opponent of that <I>Plannwirtschaft.</I>
<p>
That highly speculative division of knowledge, which our age calls "economics," took shape in the 18th century as an instrument for attaining individual freedom, as well as increased efficiency of production. But many 20th century teachers and specialists in economics became converts to a neo-Jacobinism. (Burke defines Jacobinism as "the revolt of the enterprising talents of a nation against its property.") Such doctrines of confidence in the omnicompetence of the state in economic concerns came to predominate in state polytechnic institutes and state universities especially. Quite as 18th century optimism, materialism, and humanitarianism were fitted by Marx into a system that might have surprised a good many of the <i>philosophes,</i> so 19th century utilitarian and Manchesterian concepts were the ancestors (perhaps with a bend sinister) of mechanistic social planning. The old Jacobins scarcely realized that their centralizing tendencies were imitative of the policies of the "old regime"; so it is not surprising that recent humanitarian and collectivistic thinkers forget their debt to Jeremy Bentham. Yet the abstractions of Bentham, reducing human beings to social atoms, are the principal source of modern designs for social alteration by fiat.
<p>
<b>Planners' Distorted Perspective.</b> At the end of the Second World War, centralizers and coercive planners were mightily influential in Western Europe and in Britain, and they were not missing in the United States. The modern nation-state enjoys effective powers of coercion previously unknown in political structures. But the increase of coercion frustrates the natural course of development; economic theory as a basis for state coercion has -repeatedly proved fallible; "planning" destroys the voluntary community and tries to substitute an ineffectual master plan (as, most ruinously, in Iran under the Shah); the goals of state action should be primarily moral, not economic; and thus the whole perspective of social planners is distorted. In opposition to the dominant school of economic theory just after the Second World War, such economists as Roepke, W. A. Orton, F. A. Hayek, and a handful of others strove to restrain the economic collectivists.
<p>
Although he proved himself very competent to deal with the vast postwar economic difficulties of Germany, a major industrial country, Roepke nevertheless much preferred the social and economic patterns of Switzerland, where he lived from the triumph of Hitler until the end of his life. His model for a humane economy can be perceived by any observant traveler in Switzerland.
<p>
Professor Roepke and I once conversed about the Swiss town of Thun, at the foot of Thunersee, enormous peaks looming above the town, and the beautiful long lake stretching southward from Thun's miniature harbor. At Thun one perceives the Swiss achievement in dealing with the problem of social tranquillity-and in reconciling the old world with the new.
<p>
<b>Swiss Success.</b> From the railway station at Thun you cross the river, make your way through twisted streets between very old but perfectly preserved houses, and presently reach the steep hill on which stand the square-towered <i>schloss</i> and the old church. From the battlements of the <i>schloss,</i> you look down upon the remains of the city walls, the venerable <I>rathaus,</I> and all the immaculate prosperity of a prospering Swiss municipality. And then your eye discovers that Thun is also an industrial town of some importance, for across the railroad tracks are factories and warehouses, busy as the old town is sedate. Here is an industrialism that has not blighted the traditional life of a society. There can be few regions more pleasant for the industrial worker than Thun. Eat at a cafe frequented by workingmen, and you are surprised by the cheerfulness, cleanliness, and good appearance of the place-which serves highly satisfactory food. Zurich, Basel, Fribourg, Bern, and other places much larger than Thun also have been successful in keeping their industrial life decent-in contrast with what industrialism has done to British, let alone American, cities.
<p>
I have mentioned Thun because it illustrates well enough the embodiment of Roepke's idea of a humane economy. Now permit me to turn to Roepke's thought.
<p>
Roepke seemed to have read everything. He was familiar, for instance, with the social ideas of John Calhoun and James Fenimore Cooper, concerning which most U.S. professors of economics are densely ignorant. Wilhelm Roepke knew the insights of religion and poetry, the problems of history and morality. His book, <i>The Social Crisis of Our Time,</I> is at heart an analysis of the menace that Roepke called "the cult of the colossal." Social equilibrium has been overthrown in our age, Roepke knew. Here are some moving sentences of his concerning that grim subject.
<p><blockquote>
Men having to a great extent lost the use of their innate sense of proportion, thus stagger from one extreme to the other, now trying out this, now that, now following this fashionable belief, now that, responding now to this external attraction, now to the other, but listening least of all to the voice of their own heart. It is particularly characteristic of the general loss of a natural sense of direction-a loss which is jeopardizing the wisdom gained through countless centuries-that the age of immaturity, of restless experiment, of youth, has in our time become the object of the most preposterous overestimation.
</blockquote>
<p>
Of all our afflictions, Roepke continues, the product of moral decay, of consolidation, and of the worship of bigness, the worst is proletarianization. Capitalism may have introduced the modern proletariat, but socialism enlarges that class to include nearly the whole of humanity. Our salvation, Roepke argues, lies in a third choice, something different from either ideological socialism on doctrinaire capitalism. He writes:
<p><blockquote>

Socialism, collectivism, and their political and cultural appendages are, after all, only the last consequence of our yesterday; they are the - last convulsions of the nineteenth century and only in them do we reach the lowest point of a century-old development along the wrong road; these are the hopeless final state toward which we drift unless we act.... The new path is precisely the one that will lead us out of the dilemma of 'capitalism' and collectivism. It consists of the economic humanism of the &quot;Third Way.'
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Restoring Local Institutions, Choices.</b> Roepke's "third way" is not "gas and water socialism or consumer cooperatives or a managed economy. Instead it is economic activity humanized by being related to moral and intellectual ends; humanized by being reduced to the human scale. Roepke proposes to abolish the proletariat, not by reducing everyone to proletarian status, the method of socialism, but by restoring property, function, and dignity to the mass of men. His ideas, although not new, are put with a clarity, practicality, and assurance that other people who wish to simplify and decentralize the economy sometimes lack. A liberal in the tradition of Tocqueville, Roepke believed in the restoration of local institutions and local choices, not in a centralized bureaucratic elite. He desired a society with reverence, stability, personal rights, and manners; he saw that, if we do not restore such a society, presently we may have no civilized society at all. The work of the French Revolution must be undone, he reasoned, not to reinstate a rule of force, but instead to recognize order and authority, established by prescription and consent. Society cannot be organized, he wrote, "in accordance with rational postulates while disregarding the need for genuine communities, for a vertical structure."
<p>
That same infatuation with "rationalism," which terribly damages communal existence, also produces an unquestioning confidence in the competitive market economy and leads to a heartless individualism which, in Roepke's words, "in the end has proved to be a menace to society and has so discredited a fundamentally sound idea as to further the rise of the far
<p>
more dangerous collectivism." In such a world, where old landmarks have been swept away, old loyalties ridiculed, and human beings reduced to economic atoms, "men finally grasp at everything that is offered to them, and here they may easily and understandably suffer the same fate as the frogs in the fable who asked for a king and got a crane."
<p>
In his chapter, "The Splendor and Misery of Capitalism," Roepke examines succinctly the maladies of our current economy and observes that the same economic disharmonies become chronic under socialism. Then he turns to the second part of <i>The Social Crisis of Our Time,</I> entitled "Action." Roepke there instructs us:
<p><blockquote>
Socialism-helped by the uprooted proletarian existence of large numbers of the working class and made palatable for them by just as rootless intellectuals, who will have to bear the responsibility for this -is less concerned with the interests of these masses that with the ; interests of those intellectuals, who may indeed see their desire for an abundant choice of positions of power fulfilled by the socialist state.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Healthy Roots.</b> Roepke relishes this class of persons as masters of society even less than he does the monopolists and the managers. His object is to restore liberty to men by promoting economic independence. The best type of peasants, artisans, small traders, small and middle-level businessmen, members of the free professions and trusty officials and servants of the community-these are the objects of his solicitude, for among them traditional human nature still has its healthiest roots, and throughout most of the world they are being ground between capitalistic specialization and socialistic consolidation. They need not vanish from society; once more, they may constitute the masters of society; for Switzerland, in any case, "refutes by its mere existence any cynical doubt regarding the possibility of realizing our program."
<p>
Loathing doctrinaire rationalism, Roepke is careful not to propound an arbitrary scheme of alteration and renovation. Yet his suggestions for deproletarianizing are forthright. Family farms, farmers' cooperatives for marketing, encouragement of artisans and small traders, the technical and administrative possibilities of industrial decentralization, the diminution of the average size of factories, the gradual substitution for the "old-style welfare policy" of an intelligent trend toward self-sufficiency-none of these projects is novel, but they are commended by an economist possessing both grand reputation and sound common sense. Roepke saw no insuperable difficulties. To cushion society against the fluctuations of the business cycle, for instance, the better remedy is not increased centralization, a very dubious palliative, but instead stimulating men to get a part of their sustenance from outside the immediate realm of financial disturbance. Specialization often works mischief, he says:
<p><blockquote>

The most extreme examples of this tendency are perhaps some American farmers who had become so specialized and so dependent on their current money incomes that when the crisis came they were as near starvation as the industrial worker. At the other, more fortunate end we see the industrial worker in Switzerland who, if necessary, can find his lunch in the garden, his supper in the lake, and can earn his potato supply in the fall by helping his brother clear his land.
</blockquote>
<p>
Roepke told me once, apropos such alternative means of subsistence in industrial society, of an amusing exchange between himself and Ludwig von Mises-who, though agreeing with Roepke in a good many matters, was a disciple of Jeremy Bentham in his utilitarianism. During the Second World War, the city of Geneva had made available to its citizens plots of ground along the ring around the city where the ancient walls had stood. On these allotments, in time of scarcity of food, the people of Geneva, particularly the laboring folk could cultivate vegetables for themselves. These allotments turned out to be so popular, both as recreation and as a source of supplementary food, that the city continued to make this land available to applicants after the war was over.
<p>
<b>Producing Human Happiness. </b>Now Mises, who had been professor years before at the Geneva Institute of International Affairs, came to visit Roepke in Geneva, about 1947. Happy at the success of these garden allotments, Roepke took his guest to see Genevan working people digging and hoeing in their gardens. But Mises shook his head sadly: "A very inefficient way of producing foodstuffs!" he lamented.
<p>
"Perhaps so," Roepke replied. "But perhaps a very efficient way of producing human happiness."
<p>
Humanizing of economic structure was the kernel of Roepke's proposals. They are not detailed in Roepke's book, <i>The Social Crisis of Our Time,</I> nor buttressed by tables of statistics. But they are cheering. In Wilhelm Roepke's pages, political economy has an ethical foundation; and it is made clear that the purpose of industry is personal security.
<p>
Roepke was no apologist for an abstraction called "capitalism"-a Marxist term, incidentally, foolishly pinned to themselves by numerous vain glorious champions of economic competition. He knew that the worship of Mammon is ruinous.
<p>
<b>Florentine Reception.</b> Because of his independence of thought, Roepke's influence extended to some curious quarters. A few years after the war, Roepke was invited to Florence, where some distinction was to be conferred upon him. Descending from his railway coach at the Firenze station, Roepke was greeted by dignitaries and escorted by mounted carbinieri to the Palazzo Vecchio. There he was received enthusiastically by a great throng of the rank, fashion, officialdom, and intelligentsia of Florence. This crowd parted abruptly to make way for some personage who was hurrying toward Roepke on the dais. The man approaching him was fantastical y dressed in unusual colors, fat, gesticulating, and effeminate seeming. This person seized Roepke's hands, kissing them ardently. "Maestro! Maestro!" he murmured; then bowing low, he retired backward into the assemblage.
<p>
Roepke had been astonished at the splendor of this gathering in the Palazzo Vecchio; he was yet more surprised at the adulation of this odd personage. "Who is that gentleman?" he inquired of his hosts.
<p>
"Why, don't you know him, Professor Roepke? He is your disciple, the man who invited you to Firenze and arranged this ceremony. He is the Chief for the Communist Party in Firenze."
<p>
Italian communists notoriously differ from their comrades in most of Europe; already, at the time of Roepke's visit, they were endeavoring to seem almost bourgeois. Perhaps their Florentine chairman may have perceived in Roepke an economist fruitful in means, however much their ends might differ. Yet Roepke, who had been a fearless opponent of the Nazi regime, assailed the communists with equal intrepidity.
<p>
At Florence, as elsewhere, Roepke spoke of the human condition and of how we might win our way back to a humane economy. Three decades later, we have lost ground in this endeavor. Washington, London, and Moscow are even more obsessed by the Gross National Product than they were in the 1950s, although the paper statistics of the GNP have not produced contentment or stability, and the terrorist walks abroad. There comes to mind the legend inscribed on a chateau's sundial in 1789: "It is later than you think." The nexus of cash payment, never a strong social link, does not suffice to keep down fanatic ideology or even to assure prosperity.
<p>
Permit me now to shift the scene to the U.S., and the time to half a century ago, on a June morning. I was then a guide at Greenfield Village. There came up to me, unexpectedly, a tall but stooped old man in a black suit and a sailor hat-my employer. He knew my face, but not my name; in that I had the advantage of him, for I was aware that his name was Henry Ford. He took me into the little brick shed where he had constructed his first automobile, and there he told me of those days in 1893-told me with satisfaction, yet satisfaction tinged with uneasiness, as if he wished to be sure of the approbation of the young-"It don't seem long since I built it." He glanced out the window at his enormous museum of a dead America, Greenfield Village, which encompassed us; and then he stared across the wooded acres of his lands toward the stacks of the Rouge Plant, hemmed about by the ugly streets of East Dearborn and Melvindale and River Rouge. In those flatlands, once, he had been a farm lad; and now he had obliterated, without willing it, the country he had known as a child, except for this lifeless sanctuary within brick walls. In his heart, I suspected then, was doubt. The economy he had created was inhumane.
<p>
<b>Sense of Community.</b> I mention Henry Ford in this connection not because I mistake him for a conspicuous example of the inhumane capitalist, but rather, because he retained some sense of community and some respect for our cultural patrimony. At large expense, he had undertaken several attempts toward reconciling the old rural order with the new urban industrial life. For one thing, he had purchased and restored water mills in small towns of southern Michigan-Plymouth, Nankin Mills, Waterford, and elsewhere-with the intention of maintaining industrial employment on a humane scale and nurturing small-town life. He made available small garden plots near these mills to Ford employees who might wish to cultivate their own vegetables and flowers; at the Plymouth mill, my uncle, a Ford chemist, was the only person to request and work such a garden. Although doubtless Henry Ford would not have employed the word "proletarian," these experiments were meant to help factory hands keep from sinking into a proletarian condition. But all was abandoned at Ford's death; and the Ford Foundation, inheritor of most of his great wealth, has wasted its benefactions in grandiose abstract schemes that do nothing to humanize the economy.
<p>
All my life I have known the city of Detroit, called-during World War II "the arsenal of democracy." In Celine's famous novel <i>Journey to the End of Night,</I> the journey terminates at Detroit. In the shocking decay of that great city nowadays, we behold the consequences of an inhumane economy-bent upon maximum productive efficiency, but heedless of personal order and public order. Henry Ford's assembly-line methods had much to do with the impersonality and monotony of Detroit's economic development; and so, in some degree, did Ford's concentration of his whole productive apparatus at the Rouge Plant; but of course Henry Ford had no notion, in the earlier years of his operation, of what might be the personal and social effects of his highly successful industrial establishment; nor did the other automobile manufacturers of Detroit. Indeed, they seem still to be ignorant of such unhappy consequences, or else indifferent to the consequences, so long as profits continue to be made. Consider the wiping out of Poletown through the unholy alliance of industrial, municipal, and ecclesiastical power structures, regardless of the rights and the wishes of Poletown's inhabitants-all to build on the site of Poletown a new industrial complex, which already, far from supplying the promised increase in tax revenues for Detroit, is involved in grave difficulties.
<p>
An economy obsessed by an alleged Gross National Product-no matter what is produced, or how-becomes inhumane. A society that thinks only of alleged efficiency, regardless of the consequences to human beings, works its own ruin. Here there comes to my mind a passage from the writings of W.A. Orton, an American conservative economist, a contemporary of Roepke. In his book <I>The Economic Role of the State,</I> Orton ironically describes the cult of efficiency:
<p><blockquote>
Let us therefore praise the great god Efficiency. All he demands is that we make straight his path through the desert and purge the opposition.... How much more mastery is evident in the controls of a supersonic plane than in the clumsy splendor of some medieval shrine! How much higher a peak of human achievement! Human? Let us not be too particular about that, for this is where science plays the joker .... We arrive at 'justice' without mercy, 'liberation' without liberty, 'victory' without peace, 'efficiency' without effort, 'power' without potency-because the means we collectively employ lie on a plane so different from that of the ends we humanly desire that, the more they succeed, the more they fail. That is the nemesis of all 'great powers' and the end of all who put their trust in them. God knows, this is not a new story.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Social Failure.</b> Detroit, now ruinous and ungovernable, more frequently referred to as "the murder capital of America" than as "the arsenal of democracy," has worshipped the great god "Efficiency." Detroit, during my own lifetime, has produced tremendous wealth in goods and services. But it has been a social failure. And so have nearly all of America's other major cities.
<p>
I am arguing that, unless we begin to think of humanizing our American economy, our cities will continue to disintegrate, and the American people will grow increasingly bored and violent. Some people in authority are beginning to understand that human nature will revolt at having an inhumane scale thrust upon humankind. The failure of high-rise public housing, in city after city, is an illustration of this hard truth. In Newark, New Jersey-the one large city in America that is worse decayed than Detroit-the Scudder Homes, a monolith of "housing" thirteen stories high, was demolished by high explosives, life having become intolerable there for the low-income tenants. Town houses of two or three stories are being built as replacements-a healthy reaction against public housing anonymous collectivism. New Jersey's manager of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, just before the destruction of Scudder Homes, delivered a public address. In his words, "Sophocles said, 'Though a man be wise, it is no shame for him to live and learn.' It is no shame for us to learn from this experience."
<p>
<b>Nurturing The Humane Imagination.</b> Is it so difficult, after all, to convince Americans that simplicity may be preferable to complexity, modest contentment to unrestrained sensation, decent frugality to torpid satiety? If material aggrandizement is the chief object of a people, there remains no moral check upon the means employed to acquire wealth: violence and fraud become common practices. And presently the material production of such a society commences to decline, from causes too obvious for digression here. Our industrial economy, of all economic systems man ever created, is the most delicately dependent upon public energy, private virtue, fertility of imagination. If we continue to fancy that efficiency and affluence are the chief aims of human existence, presently we must find ourselves remarkably unprosperous-and wondrously miserable.
<p>
Roepke, Orton, Colin Clark, and a few other political economists have been so instructing us for the past half century. President Bush speaks of bringing about "a kinder, gentler America" That consummation, so much to be desired, requires the humane imagination. And study of the thought of Wilhelm Roepke will nurture that imagination.

<P>
One hundred years ago, Thomas Stearns Eliot was born into an intelligently conservative family in St. Louis. His grandfather, a Unitarian minister and a man of mark founded the Church of the Messiah and Washington University; the Eliots of St. Louis were Republican reformers, active in good causes, pillars of order.
<p>
If one visits St. Louis today and searches for Eliot's birthplace, one is oppressed by a sense of the vanity of human wishes. The Eliot house vanished long ago; the Church of the Messiah, too, vanished long ago; the whole quarter, once elegant, where the Eliots lived is devastated and depopulated. No memorial to the great poet of the 20th century stands in the city where he was born. Nor in London, except for the memorial stone in Westminster Abbey, does one encounter any visible trace of Eliot, who never owned a house. The expectation of change, in the 20th century, has been greater than the expectation of continuity, nearly everywhere. And the permanent things, as Eliot called them-those enduring truths and ways of life and standards of order are awash in the flood of sensual appetite and ideological passion. As Eliot expressed this phenomenon of decadence, referring to standards of education, in his book <i>Notes towards the Definition of Culture,</i> we are "destroying our ancient edifices to make ready the ground upon which the barbarian nomads of the future will encamp in their mechanised caravans."
<p>
From his youth, Eliot took up the defense of the permanent things, with some boldness. A great innovator in poetry, he became a great conservative in morals and politics, so that my book on conservative thought begins with Burke and ends with Eliot. At no time in his life was he afflicted by political radicalism. After a decade of residence in London, he announced that he was a classicist in literature, a royalist in politics, and Anglo-Catholic in religion. "I am aware that the second term is at present without definition," he wrote, "and easily lends itself to what is almost worse than clap-trap, I mean temperate conservatism...." He would have despised the current American political label "moderate": the Conservative Party of England was not nearly conservative enough for T.S. Eliot.
<p>
<b>Affirming Tradition.</b> In 1922, poor and overworked in London, he founded a magazine, <i>The Criterion,</i> which endured until January 1939 when Europe was about to erupt. The magazine was intended to work among the educated classes of Europe "an affirmation and development of tradition," as opposed to the dissemination of Marxism and other ideologies among the intelligentsia. Also, though not quite avowedly, the review was meant to work a political resurrection, touching often upon political theory and institutions. Its circulation never exceeded 800 copies. George Orwell would have liked to buy it, but lacked the purchase price-yet it published the writing of men and women of very high talent, and the bound volumes of this periodical remain worth reading earnestly, if need be to the exclusion of any magazine of our own day.
<p>
In Eliot's editorial "Commentaries" in that magazine will be found many shrewd or wise observations about politics -- short pieces never reprinted. In such observations he impartially scourged the leaders of all political factions in Britain with the partial exception of Stanley Baldwin, because Baldwin was something of a classical scholar as well as an honest man. Although a high Tory in English political tradition, he never participated in the action of the Conservative Party - except, late in life, to lecture to the London Conservative Union, in 1955, concerning which memorable lecture, more presently.
<p>
Two of Eliot's slim books are concerned in part with political questions: <i>The Idea of a Christian Society,</i> published just after the Second World War, and <i>Notes towards the Definition of Culture,</i> published when socialism had descended upon Britain shortly after that war. Eliot wrote one political or quasi-political poem, <I>Coriolan.</i> I have reprinted in <i>The Portable Conservative Reader</i> his succinct, mordant remarks on Marxist critics of literature. Other Eliot observations on politics may be found in certain of his literary essays, notably those on William Bramhall, Charles Whibley, and Machiavelli.
<p>
Now this may seem, bibliographically, rather a slight bulk of literary production to justify Eliot's eminence as a leader of conservative opinion. Permit me, then, to explain why Eliot is so much read, and so much respected, by men and women attached to the "permanent things."
<p>
<b>Thinkers and Actors.</b> In his lecture on 'The Literature of Politics," published in his collection <i>To Criticize the Critic,</i> Eliot refers to an essay by your servant, in which I mentioned, as American conservative thinkers, Paul Elmer More, Irving Babbitt, Bernard Iddings Bell, and Robert Nisbet-none of whom had plunged into the hurly-burly of practical politics. Eliot comments upon this separation of serious political writing from political action,
<p><blockquote>
This is not a very healthy state of affairs, unless the views of such writers become more widely diffused and translated, modified, adapted, even adulterated, into action. It seems to me that in a healthy society, there will be a gradation of types between thought and action; at one extreme the detached contemplative, the critical mind which is concerned with the discovery of truth, not with its promulgation and still less with its translation into action, and at the other extreme, the N.C.O. of politics, the man who in spite of relative indifference to general ideas, is equipped with native good sense, right feeling and character, supported by discipline and education. Between these two extremes there is room for several varieties and several kinds of political thinking; but there should be no breach of continuity between them.
</blockquote>
<p>
A little later in the same lecture, Eliot adds, 'To go more directly to the point, a political tradition in which the doctrinaire dominates the man of action, and a tradition in which political philosophy is formulated or re-codified to suit the requirements and justify the conduct of a ruling clique, may be equally disastrous."
<p>
<b>Penetrating to the Core.</b> Eliot concludes his lecture by remarking that he is not concerned with those temporary writers of alleged influence, "or with those publicists who have impressed their names upon the public by catching the morning tide, and rowing very fast in the direction in which the current was flowing." Rather, he says "there should always
<p>
be a few writers preoccupied in penetrating to the core of the matter, in trying to arrive at the truth and to set it forth, without too much hope, without ambition to alter the irnmediate course of affairs and without being downcast or defeated when nothing appears to ensue."
<p>
Now Eliot was himself one of those few writers, alluded to by him, who have endeavored to get at the political truth, or a more general truth in which political order is involved, and to set it forth: men of talent who labor intellectually in what Eliot called the "prepolitical" area. Eliot's moral imagination, his broad learning, and his poetic talents enabled him indeed to penetrate to the core of the matter, when he touched upon the civil social order and that order's relationships to a transcendent order. Conservatively inclined people on either side of the Atlantic, and farther afield than that, therefore often turn to Eliot's prose, and not infrequently to his verse, for light. In short, Eliot's seminal mind, with its keen perceptions -- Eliot's armed vision -- opened the way for seekers after intellectual order and moral order and social order to penetrate beyond the cant and slogan of the hour.
<p>
<b>Slamming Shaw.</b> For when Eliot in his writings touches upon Hobbes, or Freud, or Marx, or Mannheim, or Shaw, or H.G. Wells, he punctures balloons as deftly as, two centuries earlier, did a very different man of letters, David Hume. Take, for instance, another passage from his lecture on the literature of politics. Eliot remarks that sometimes one is tempted to suspect "that the profounder and wiser the man, the less likely is his influence to be discernible." Then he goes on to give a tremendous knock to George Bernard Shaw:
<p>
<blockquote>Yet the immediate influence of -- shall we say -- Mr. Bernard Shaw in the period of his most potent influence, I suppose, at the beginning of this century, must have been more appreciable, and more widely diffused, than that of much finer minds; and one is compelled to admire a man of such verbal agility as not only to conceal from his readers and audiences the shallowness of his own thought, but to persuade them that in admiring his work they were giving evidence of their own intelligence as well. I do not say that Shaw could have succeeded alone, without the more plodding and laborious minds with which he associated himself; but by persuading low-brows that they were high-brows, and that high-brows must be socialists, he contributed greatly to the prestige of socialism. But between the influence of a Bernard Shaw or an H.G. Wells, and the influence of a Coleridge or a Newman, I can conceive no common scale of measurement.
</blockquote><p>
What Eliot gives us is not the posturing glibness of Shaw, but wisdom after the mode of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and John Henry Newman. Incidentally, or accidentally, by showing that a famous innovating poet could reject ideology -- socialist, communist, or fascist ideology -- Eliot contributed greatly to the prestige of conservatism, in the better sense of that abused word.
<p>
<b>Saving the World from Suicide.</b> Now in remarking that Eliot was prepolitical in the sense that he concerned himself principally with ultimate questions, I do not mean that he took little thought for the political exigencies in his era. On the contrary, Eliot was most earnestly, and sorrowfully, concerned with the disasters and the grim prospects of our bent world. His commentaries in <i>The Criterion</i> often bore directly on political questions and men of the hour; and indeed a fundamental purpose of his review was to save the world from suicide through joining together writers and public men of intelligence, in Britain, Europe, and America.
<p>
<b>Aspiring Toward a Healthy Democracy.</b> During the years when we met occasionally and exchanged lengthy letters, he was possessed of a good knowledge of practical politics in the United States -- always thinking of himself as an American -- as well as a lively familiarity with matters of state in Britain and the Continent. During the 1950s though alarmed at educational follies in Britain and America, he was not so depressed by public affairs as he had been while editing <i>The Criterion,</i> between the World Wars. In December 1928, Eliot published in his magazine his essay 'The Literature of Fascism" -- which he rejected, along with the literature of Communism. "A new school of political thought is needed," he wrote, "which might learn from political thought abroad, but not from political practice. Both Russian communism and Italian fascism seem to me to have died as political ideas, in becoming political facts." He was no enthusiast for an abstract democracy, an ideology of democratism; but a healthy democracy, rooted in old institutions, he aspired to restore. He continued in his article on Fascism,
<p><blockquote>

It is one thing to say what is sadly certain, that democratic government has been watered down to almost nothing....But it is another thing to ridicule the idea of democracy....A real democracy is always a restricted democracy, and can only flourish with some limitation by hereditary rights and responsibilities....The modern question as popularly put is: 'democracy is dead, what is to replace it?' whereas it should be: 'the frame of democracy has been destroyed; how can we, out of the materials at hand, build anew structure in which democracy can live?'
</blockquote><p>

Eleven years later, in his little book <i>The Idea of a Christian Society,</i> Eliot exhorted liberals and socialists, as war with the Axis powers was imminent, that "The term 'democracy'...does not contain enough positive content to stand alone against the forces that you dislike -it can easily be transformed by them. If you will not have God (and He is a jealous God) you should pay your respects to Hitler or Stalin."
<p>
<b>Question of Questions.</b> For behind the virulent ideologies -substitutes for religion -- in the 20th century, behind the feeble politics of liberalism, behind the ineffectuality of conservatives, Eliot perceived, lay a refusal to admit ethics and theology to political thinking. As he would conclude his lecture on the literature of politics in 1957: "For the question of questions, which no political philosophy can escape, and by the right answer to which all political thinking must in the end be judged, is simply this: What is Man? what are his limitations? what is his misery and what his greatness? and what, finally, his destiny?"
<p>
I need hardly remark to you, ladies and gentlemen, that such principles of politics provoked wrath and ridicule among the intelligentsia of Bloomsbury in Eliot's time -- even though Eliot's overwhelming reputation as a poet and the strength of his personality somewhat muted outcries against his Toryism. In recent years, most critics have endeavored to ignore Eliot's politics altogether as irrelevant; while some have reproached him venomously as an enemy of democracy and equality of condition.
<p>
It is mildly amusing to find Eliot denounced for his Christian faith and his "feudalist" politics by tenured professors of English, some of them enjoying salaries in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, comforted and cosseted by serried ranks of word-processor operators and go-fers, amply provided with funds for travel and somewhat dubious "research," generously pensioned when they retire from their occasional teaching of a seminar or two -- these scholars and gentlemen who preach egalitarian doctrines; these unimaginative pedants who, should a socialist regime ever come to this land, would be mightily reduced in their circumstances and privileges. Eliot was hard pressed for money until late years; and when at length he was awarded the Nobel Prize, the only substantial sum received by him in a lifetime, he was promptly deprived of the lion's share of it by the Inland Revenue.
<p>
The Pope of Russell Square, as some called him, from his little office at the firm of Faber and Faber where I called upon him occasionally in the 1950s -- looked down with some -contempt upon the crowd of literati of the Left, some of them political simpletons, others unscrupulous opportunists. All that could be said for the London crowd was that they were less silly than the Manhattan crowd of writers or would-be-writers; as Eliot put it, "The worst form of expatriation for an American writer is residence in New York City." It is so still.
<p>
<b>New York Intellectuals.</b> "It is natural, and not necessarily convincing," he wrote mordantly in 1933 in the pages of The Criterion, "to find young intellectuals in New York turning to communism, and turning their communism to literary account. The literary profession is not only, in all countries, overcrowded and underpaid...it has much ado to maintain its dignity as a profession at all." Marxism might provide the aspiring writer with both a new creed and an assured income. "It is not always easy, of course, in the ebullitions of a new movement, to distinguish the man who has received the living word from the man whose access of energy is the result of being relieved of the necessity of thinking for himself. Men who have stopped thinking make a powerful force. There are obvious inducements, besides that -- never wholly absent -- of simple conversion, to entice the man of letters into political and social theory which he then employs to revive his sinking fires and rehabilitate his profession."
<p>
Eliot lifelong refused to run with these hounds; he subscribed his name to no ideological protests and manifestos; he rejected root and branch British socialism, not to speak of communism, fascism, and Naziism (which Hannah Arendt calls &quot;an ideology in embryo"). But this repudiation of collectivist ideology aside, to what political convictions, realistically speaking, did Eliot adhere? Did his politics consist merely of negotiations?
<p>
Not at all. There are two aspects, or perhaps jurisdictions, of Eliot's practical politics: his British views, and his American views. Permit me first to say something about his American politics, that being the briefer subject.
<p>
<b>Rooted in New England.</b> Eliot wrote to me once that the America for which his family stood had ended with the defeat of John Quincy Adams by Andrew Jackson in the presidential contest of 1828. (Eliot's distant kinsman Henry Adams made a similar observation.) So one may say that the politics of the Eliot family had been very like the politics of their kinfolk of the Adams family: Federalist so long as a Federalist party cohered, suspicious of leveling democracy, austerely moral, rooted in the culture of New England. These political views and habits were transferred by William Greenleaf Eliot, T.S. Eliot's grandfather, to Missouri. If I may take the liberty of quoting from my own works, a paragraph from my book about Eliot is pertinent here:
<p><blockquote>
The political exemplar of Eliot's youth had been a gentleman as real to the St. Louis boy as if he still had sat at the head of the dining table on Locust Street: the grandfather he never actually saw, the Reverend William Greenleaf Eliot, 'the nineteenth-century descendant of Chaucer's parson.' That grandfather had been a Christian hero -- and a pillar of the visible community, a reforming conservative, as well as a buttress of the community of souls. In St. Louis he had reformed the schools; founded the university; become the apostle of gradual emancipation of the slaves, the champion of national union, the leader in a dozen other turbulent causes of reform -- but always in the light of the permanent things....His grandfather's notion of perfectibility, and some others beliefs (among them the grandfather's zeal for prohibiting strong drink), T.S. Eliot would discard; and yet a grandfather like that must weigh more lifelong, for an adherent of Tradition, than all the political metaphysicians in the books.
</blockquote><p>

I having been blessed with a grandfather rather like Eliot's, we got on well when we talked about American politics, Eliot and I. Eliot's profession of royalism, by the way, signified mostly that he supported the English throne, having become a British subject, and that he approved of long-established monarchies elsewhere -- such of them as had survived the tooth of time and the frenzy of revolutionaries that had followed hard upon both World Wars. He had not the faintest intention of saddling the United States with a monarch, any more than had his ancestor John Adams (who, nevertheless, had been accused of just such a design): in America, a royal house would have been an unnatural and untenable imposition.
<p>
<b>Little on America's Politics.</b> Eliot having written next to nothing about America's practical politics, it is unnecessary here to go farther into his American views, except to remark in passing that he entertained a low opinion of Franklin Roosevelt and a good opinion of the elder Senator Robert Taft. He sympathized strongly with the group called the Southern Agrarians, and among them was well acquainted with Allen Tate, a frequent contributor to <i>The Criterion;</i> he had been influenced by the conservative political convictions of Irving Babbitt (his Harvard mentor) and Paul Elmer More, the chief humanist critics; he shared their misgivings as to the tendencies of the American democracy, but proposed no alteration of the constitutional framework; so far as he touched upon American remedies, his hope lay in the restoration of learning -- a subject he discussed at some length in a series of lectures at the University of Chicago during 1950. (These "Aims of Education" lectures are included in his collection <i>To Criticize the Critic.</i>)
<p>
A journal published by the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago,<i> Measure,</i> published Eliot's lectures on education shortly after their delivery. Robert Hutchins, then chancellor of the University of Chicago, published in a following number of <i>Measure</i> a rather sharp rejoinder, in which Hutchins said, among other things, that "the only difference between Edmund Burke and T.S. Eliot is that Eliot is a democrat and Burke was not." When next in Chicago, Eliot found himself at a party in his honor with Robert Hutchins as a guest. Seeking Hutchins out, Eliot inquired of him, in his accustomed very civil manner, "Dr. Hutchins, I am grateful for your trouble in commenting upon my lectures on education; but I am puzzled by your remark about Burke and me. I never have called myself a democrat; and I suppose that Burke in his age, was more of a democrat than I am in my age. So could you tell me what you meant?
<p>
"But Mr. Hutchins turned his back and walked away. Why did he do that, Dr. Kirk?"
<p>
"Because he never had read Burke," I replied. "Hutchins once signed his name to an article attacking Burke that was published in <I>The Thomist;</i> but the article was written entirely by someone else; and that is all that Hutchins knows about Burke You had unveiled his abysmal ignorance of much."
<p>
Like many other people in universities, Robert Hutchins was an egalitarian democrat in theory and an exacting autocrat in practice. Eliot had a talent for vexing such people.
<p>
<b>Consistent Tory. </b>As for English politics, Eliot was a consistent Tory, rather than a regular Conservative. (The two partisan labels are not identical: Disraeli thought of changing the party's name back to Tory, after Peel had made it the Conservative party; but Metternich, in exile, dissuaded Disraeli.) Toryism means loyalty to King and Church; the Tories are bound up with the Church of England -- and, at least in times past, with the squirearchy, the smaller landed proprietors. So it was with Eliot: he had declared himself a royalist (though, for that matter, nine out of ten English subjects approve of the royal family); he was a most devout communicant of the Church of England and for some years a churchwarden in London; and he believed that the class of the old county families of England supplied the nation with leaders, in many walks of life, who ought not be supplanted by an elite, an alleged meritocracy.
<p>
Yet the political thinkers and leaders he most admired included the great Whig Edmund Burke -- whose name appears more frequently in Eliot's lectures after, on his decision, Faber and -Faber published my book <i>The Conservative Mind.</i> Both in his early essay on Charles Whibley and his late lecture on the literature of politics, Eliot comments on four political writers, masters of literary style, who clearly have influenced his own views: Bolingbroke, Burke, Coleridge, and Disraeli. (In his essay on Whibley, he mentions also Lord Halifax.) Eliot's political thought, in considerable part, is descended from those great conservatives; it more nearly approximates that of Coleridge, whom Eliot recognizes as "a man of my own type."
<p>
<b>Conservative Hollow Man.</b> So there is nothing very exotic about Eliot's political principles: they are bound up with English history, the English constitution, and the great divines of the Church of England. Those very principles dissuaded him from praising the Conservative Party of his day. In June 1929, when MacDonald and Labour won the general election, forcing out of office Baldwin's Conservative government (even though the Conservatives had obtained a plurality of the popular vote) Eliot found that the new Lib-Lab cabinet had not one new idea among them. What might be done, in an hour when fascists and communists grew in influence among the intellectuals and among the mass of voters? He wrote in <i>The Criterion:</I>
<p><blockquote>
This is of course a great opportunity -- for the Conservative Party, an opportunity which we are quite sure it will fail to seize. It is the opportunity of thinking in leisure, and of appreciating the efforts of private persons who have committed some thinking already. The Labour Party is a capitalist party in the sense that it is living on the reputation of thinking done by the Fabians of a generation ago....The Conservative Party has a great opportunity in the fact that within the memory of no living man under sixty, has it acknowledged any contact with intelligence. It has, what no other political party at present enjoys, a complete mental vacuum: a vacancy that might be filled with anything, even with something valuable.
</blockquote><p>

The leaders of the Conservatives were Hollow Men. Eliot feared that the political and social institutions of Britain were giving way; that feeble politicians, belligerent trade unions, a cumbersome bureaucracy, an apathetic public, a Church that no longer held meaning for most English people, an obsession with getting and spending -- these phenomena and circumstances were eroding irrevocably the England that Eliot had come to love. For the most part, Eliot's vaticinations would be justified by subsequent events.
<p>
<b>Seeking to Retain a Humane Society.</b> Like my friend Wilhelm Rothou, ladies and gentlemen, and do likewise. You will find therein, for one thing, a demolition of Karl Mannheim's proposals for a planned society -- indeed, for universal planning. "For one thing to avoid is a universalized planning," Eliot writes; "one thing to ascertain is the limits of the plannable."
<p>
Probably Eliot would have said, if asked, that the most important passage in this last slim book of his is one concerned with the dependence of our culture, or of any culture, upon religious belief. Here is that passage, in part:
<p><blockquote>

I do not believe that the culture of Europe could survive the complete disappearance of the Christian Faith. And I am convinced of that, not merely because I am a Christian myself, but as a student of social biology. If Christianity goes, the whole of our culture goes. Then you must start painfully again, and you cannot put on a new culture ready made. You must wait for the grass to grow to feed the sheep to give the wool out of which your new coat will be made. You must pass through many centuries of barbarism. We should not live to see the new culture, nor would our great-great-great-grandchildren; and if we did, not one of us would be happy in it.
</blockquote><p>

<b>Continued Decay.</b> Since Eliot's death, many unhappy choices have been made in Britain, and the decay that he lamented has continued apace, in several ways -- though not in all. The deliberate lowering of intellectual standards in British schools and universities, and formal protestations of disbelief by eminent bishops and archbishops, have been among those dismaying phenomena. Yet it is not possible, Eliot instructs us, to measure the long-run influence of a poet or a philosopher. In the fullness of time, perhaps it will be found that Eliot sowed better than he knew, and that his political and cultural writings will endure along with his great poems and bear some fruit. We must be very patient, said Eliot, awaiting the dissolution liberalism and the recovery of tradition.
<p>
My friend Eliot did not expect to turn back the clock by any social or literary magic; nor did he fancy that we would be pleased by the result, even were it possible; for we all are creatures of the age into which we have been born. As he expressed this hard truth in "Little Gidding" 
<p>
<blockquote><I>We cannot restore old policies <br>
Or follow an antique drum.</i></blockquote>
<p>
Reading Eliot will not tell us how to balance the federal budget and reduce the national debt -- even though the poet of <I>The Waste Land</I> was a banker for some years. But his poetry tells us much about the human condition, in its splendor and its misery; and his prose makes us acutely aware of the permanent things. I knew Eliot somewhat during his later years, and understand him better now that his ashes lie in the medieval church of East Coker. For, as Eliot wrote, also in "Little Gidding" 
<p><I>
<blockquote>And what the dead had no speech for, when living, <br>They can tell you, being dead. the communication<br> Of the dead is tongued with the fire beyond the <br>language of the living.</blockquote>
</I>

<h3>"First Principles in the Public Arena"</h3>
<b>By Governor John Engler</b><br>
<p>
Michigan Governor Engler delivered the first <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a> on Tuesday, September 26, 1995, at The Heritage Foundation, Washington D.C.
<p>

	This weekend, Michigan Republicans held a leadership conference on Mackinac Island. For all practical purposes, we met in honor of Dr. Russell Kirk. After listening to the various presidential candidates and to Speaker Gingrich, it was clear that many of the ideas Russell had written about since the 1950s not only had taken root, but had blossomed. He always said it took about 30 years for a new generation of ideas to enter the public arena--and in this, as in so much else, he proved right.
<p>
	I am honored to be in this redoubt of conservative thought to inaugurate the Russell Kirk Memorial Lectures. It is a humbling experience for me to stand in this auditorium, knowing that I follow in the footsteps of giants. Russell himself must have given some 60 lectures within these walls. In 1986, at a landmark Heritage event, President Reagan paid a wonderful tribute to the Sage of Mecosta, calling him a pillar of post-war conservative thought.
<p>
	Who could have foreseen it back in 1952, when Russell submitted a manuscript to Henry Regnery called <i>The Conservative Rout</i>? Strange as it may seem to us today, that was the original title Russell proposed for the classic the world would know as <i>The Conservative Mind</i>. Back in the early 1950s, Russell was concerned that there was not a more spirited defense of what he and T. S. Eliot called "the permanent things." But he never put his pen down in despair. Over the course of four decades, he wielded the "Sword of Imagination" against an "antagonist world" and gave new strength to conservative ideas.
<p>
	How the battle had turned at the close of the day, for Russell could see the makings of a liberal rout. One can only imagine what mordant comment he would have made about last November's historic elections and the resulting confusion and chagrin in the Liberal Mind, which more than a few are characterizing as brain-dead. Michigan's own Jack Kevorkian--otherwise known as Dr. Death--could be the poster boy of latter-day liberals.
<p>
	If you have ever been to St. Paul's Cathedral in London, you may have seen Sir Christopher Wren's tomb. Wren designed the cathedral and is buried there. On his tomb is an epitaph, which in translation reads, "If you seek my monument, look around you." I think that epitaph is apt for our purposes today, because if you seek a monument to Russell Kirk, look around  you.
<p>
	This foundation, this audience, and in significant ways this city, which today is becoming an epicenter of conservative policies and ideas, all bear Russell's mark. As Ed Feulner eulogized at last year's Memorial Mass in Russell's honor, the Sage of Mecosta "made a real impact on Washington. In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists, legislators, and staffers...of prudence and of taking the long view."
<p>
	Not just in Washington, but on both sides of the Atlantic, conservatives looked to Russell for inspiration and guidance. Closer to home, I sought his counsel as well. We both lived in central Michigan's "stump country," just two dozen miles from each other, and Russell was a trusted friend. He and Annette, whose hospitality is known around the world, always kept the door at Piety Hill open, not only for the refugee, the hobo, and the scholar, but also for a young legislator just out of college and eager to learn from Michigan's pre-eminent man of letters.
<p>
	I don't think Russell ever held public office except for a brief time as Justice of the Peace. He was, above all, a man of ideas. Yet he was wise to the nature of politics. He always used to say--and it's good advice to remember in Washington these days--that "politics is the art of the possible." The trick is not only to fight for reform, but to live to tell about it.
<p>
	As an aside, let me say that the Republican Party today has a great advantage over Democrats. It is conservative Republicans and their ideas that are driving the debate. And I think the more Americans get to know Republican ideas, the more they will vote for Republican candidates. But whatever their party affiliation, Russell had much to say to the men and women charged with the responsibility of governing. Nobody was more eloquent than Russell in defending what he called the "first principles" of conservative thought. At the center of these "first principles" is the apprehension that order, justice, and freedom are mutually dependent on one another.
<p>
	Another way Russell used to put it: For there to be order in society, there must be order in the soul--and vice-versa. You cannot have one without the other. So it is not just freedom, but ordered freedom that we must strive to preserve. Otherwise, the barbarians will come crashing through the gates.
<p>
	There are a number of first principles that Russell wrote about and that have been important to me as governor. What I would like to do today is tell you how I have tried to apply one of them in the public arena. It concerns the importance of community and the need to respect state and local government because they are closest to our communities.
<p>
	Here, as in so much else, Russell followed the lead of Edmund Burke. The great British statesman wrote that the true wellsprings of community are "the little platoons we belong to in society." By that quaint term, Burke was referring to the groups that we voluntarily seek to associate with and that give our lives meaning. Our church and alma mater, the professional and civic organizations to which we belong, the volunteer charities and friendships we seek out--these are the little platoons that enrich our lives and humanize our relations with one another.
<p>
	Russell early perceived that the centrifugal forces of modern times were tearing apart these little platoons, which are the fabric of our communities. He wrote:
<blockquote>
We have more voluntary organizations than has any other nation.... But it is tempting and easy to let centralized power assume the burdens which necessarily accompany the privileges of community.... I may add that this disintegration of community, and its supplanting by centralized authority, commonly have been accompanied by a proportionate decay of culture and morality.... A nation is no stronger than the numerous little communities of which it is composed.1</blockquote>	These words, though written some four decades ago, ring truer than ever today. They certainly resonate with Marvin Olasky's landmark work, <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, which I am sure Russell would have applauded. For in the court of public opinion, the verdict is in: We have seen the unintended consequences of a horrendous, $5 trillion experiment in centralized authority known as the Great Society. After three decades, even liberals are beginning to concede that the Great Society was neither great nor good for society.
<p>
	In one of his last Heritage lectures, Russell said that the centralizing tendency of the Great Society, combined with the centrifugal forces of modem times, had helped create "a mass of people who have lost...community, hope of betterment, moral convictions, habits of work, sense of personal responsibility, intellectual curiosity, membership in a healthy family, property, active participation in public concerns, religious associations, and awareness of the ends of human existence."2 How could this tragedy come about?
<p>
	At the diseased heart of the Great Society there evolved more than 300 welfare programs, a number of which rewarded ignorance, idleness, and illegitimacy--the absolute antithesis of the qualities you want a free citizenry to possess. These programs have worked untold mischief on the American republic.
<p>
	As many of you know, the welfare debate is a battleground on which, as governor, I have fought from the beginning. Soon after I took office, back in 1991, I made a priority of getting the Michigan legislature to abolish a state version of the Great Society	known as General Assistance. GA provided a monthly check to almost 100,000 able-bodied adults without children. In essence, it paid them not to work.
<p>
	We put an end to the program with some dispatch and said we wanted these tax-takers to become taxpayers. And you know what? Despite bitter denunciations in the liberal media at the time, not one of the four Democrats who challenged me in my 1994 re-election campaign called for the restoration of GA. That is significant because abolishing GA was, I believe, the first tangible sign in America that the nation was serious about ending welfare as we know it. Nobody else had said, "Get rid of a $250 million government welfare program; it won't exist next year." But that's what we did--and it signalled the beginning of the paradigm shift that is currently afoot.
<p>
	As my friends at the Heritage Foundation know, I have some thoughts about Washington's role in welfare. I am not an advocate of pruning federal programs, because those of you who are gardeners know that pruning just makes things grow faster than ever. What I advocate is getting a firm grip on the system as we know it and pulling it up by the roots. That means pulling welfare's roots out of Washington and letting the states decide what to transplant and what to reject. To stick with my gardening metaphor--and to use the words in a recent issue of <i><a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html">National Review</a></i>--let 50 flowers bloom instead of the weed patch in Foggy Bottom.
<p>
	As a result of last November's historic elections, the relationship between Washington and welfare is undergoing radical redefinition. Under Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole, the l04th Congress is taking an extraordinary step: It is beginning the process of relinquishing power and returning it to the 50 states. Getting Washington out of the way is the crucial first step in the long process of returning authority and responsibility to where they ultimately belong--to the "little platoons" of civil society, our families and neighborhoods, churches and charitable organizations.
<p>
	In the area of welfare, I and other governors are hopeful that this historic opportunity will result in no-strings-attached block grants. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: There is no devil in devolution. No-strings-attached block grants are the first crucial steps to meaningful reform. But I am not content to stop there. Ultimately, the goal of welfare reform is to cut federal taxes and return all the fiscal and policy initiatives to the states. This is consistent with America's heritage. There are both constitutional and historical grounds for removing the federal government from such programs as Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
<p>
	Two weeks ago, the Heritage Foundation teamed up with the Federalist Society to present a working conference on the Tenth Amendment. I do not know whether Russell's book <i>The Conservative Constitution</i> was cited, but it should have been, because in it we are reminded that the Constitution set up a federal government that was to be supreme in its sphere, while the states were to remain supreme in their sphere. Washington and the states were meant to be co-sovereigns, with a host of undelegated powers reserved to the states. Welfare is one of those areas in which the states were meant to be supreme.
<p>
	This point is buttressed by the fact that our Founders never gave any indication that welfare should be the responsibility of the federal government. America was at its founding, and still is in many ways, a nation of immigrants, and almost 100 percent of the immigrants who have come to our shores have been poor. The men who drafted our Constitution knew the face of poverty. Despite numerous innovations that came out of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, no one called for giving the federal government a role in alleviating poverty. Yet over the last 60 years, as we have moved from the social insurance system proposed by FDR to the massive giveaway programs enacted by LBJ, Uncle Sam has become Big Daddy. And a tragic number of American citizens have been hurt in the process.
<p>
	I would not be so adamant about getting Washington out of the way if I did not think the states could succeed. If given a chance, the states can and will succeed. Remember the classic by Jonathan Swift, <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>? We in the states are like poor Gulliver on the beach, tied down by small-minded Lilliputians who remind me of the army of federal bureaucrats in Washington. If, like Gulliver, we can extricate ourselves from the entanglement of federal rules and regulations, we will be free to experiment and find better ways of truly helping the needy go to work and become independent.
<p>
	In Michigan, for example, an array of welfare reform initiatives over the past three years is yielding dramatic results. One goal of reform has been to get people to work and thereby enable welfare recipients to accept more responsibility for their lives. Because Michigan recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children must sign a Social Contract, they are working, training for a job, or volunteering in communities at least 20 hours a week. As a result, the number of Michigan AFDC recipients earning income is up to an all-time high of almost 30 percent, compared to just 8 percent nationally.
<p>
	A second goal has been to shrink the size of welfare rolls and save taxpayers money. Again, because of our enforced Social Contract, over 67,000 cases have been closed since 1992 because families are earning enough to be independent. Consequently, Michigan's AFDC caseload has declined to its lowest level in over two decades--and that is saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars as a result.
<p>
	A third aim of reform has been to keep at-risk families intact. In Michigan, our family preservation programs have a proven track record of reducing foster care and helping troubled families work through their problems. Much of our success is due to the fact that we contract out to private agencies, many of them church-run, because they an important moral element in the battle against poverty.
<p>
	Finally, the most critical objective has been to lower the illegitimacy rate. Efforts of the public-private Michigan Abstinence Partnership have helped bring about the lowest teen pregnancy rate in the Great Lakes State in a decade. However, our task--and America's task--is far from finished. In Michigan, 70 percent of births to teen mothers are to unwed teen mothers. If you think that is shocking, in Detroit it is 95 percent.
<p>
	My friends, this is a crisis of unprecedented proportions. As a state we could move even more aggressively to tackle the problem were it not for one thing--and that thing is the federal government. Like Gulliver, the states have been tied down by Lilliputians in Washington who make reform difficult, if not impossible.
<p>
	I hope the people who complain about the lack of federal control over welfare reform will look at the example of states like Michigan. I also hope they will acknowledge that the 50 governors have at least one credential that nobody in Washington has: We governors must actually administer the welfare system. We are closer to the problem than any federal bureaucrat. We know what works and what doesn't. We know what needs changing and how to change it. And if our reforms are not working, we can tackle the problem quickly rather than wait literally years for the federal government to act. Fifty states experimenting will create what are tantamount to market forces that will encourage governors and state houses to be responsible to both tax-takers and taxpayers.
<p>
	Whatever the final shape of welfare when the 104th Congress adjourns, more is at stake than whether this group of conservatives or that wins the debate. At bottom, this is a fight for the freedom of the states to exercise their constitutional authority and responsibility. If the states lose and Congress insists it has the right to micromanage welfare programs among the 50 states, then an important principle of freedom will have been compromised.
<p>
	But I do not think the states will lose. And in this I draw strength from our good friend, Russell Kirk. One of the things I appreciated most about Russell was his ability, no matter what the challenges, "to let a little cheerfulness break in."
<p>
		I want to close on the last words of one of the last lectures he delivered here at Heritage. This passage summarizes both his belief in the "little platoons" and his indomitable spirit of hope:
<p><blockquote>
		Spritually and politically, the twentieth century has been a time of decadence. Yet as this century draws to a close, we may remind ourselves that ages of decadence sometimes have been followed by ages of renewal.
<p>		What can you do, young men and women of the rising generation of the 1990s, to raise up the human condition?... Why, begin by brightening the corner where you are, by improving one human...yourself, and by helping your neighbor.
<p>	You will not need to be rich or famous to take your part in redeeming the time: what you require for that task is moral imagination joined to right reason....
<p>	Shrug your shoulders at things indifferent; set your face against things evil; and by doing God's will...find that peace which passeth all understanding.3
</blockquote><p>
	<i>Requiescat in pace</i>, my friend.

My estimation of Russell can best be summed up by an incident that occurred several years ago:  
After an especially tiresome travel schedule delivering lectures in several states, Russell returned 
home with a very sore throat. When I phoned the doctor's office to obtain an appointment for him, 
the receptionist said she had no appointments available for at least a month. Hoping to explain the 
urgency of my request, I burst out, "But he's a national treasure; civilization needs him!"
<p>
And so it did and does need the words of Russell Kirk and those other giants who serve as 
guardians of culture, transmitters of our heritage. We are but dwarves standing on the shoulders of 
these giants who provided the philosophical underpinnings of our present political discourse. 
Russell's own significant historical and literary contributions have been widely recorded. As Ken 
Cribb observed, "He lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony from dusty oblivion."
<p>
After almost 30 years of marriage to Russell Kirk, there is simply so much to say that it is hard to 
know where to begin. Russell recounts his life in his memoir, <i>The Sword of Imagination</i> 
(published by Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1995). Today, I will offer my reflections on what life with 
Russell was like, and insight into how his conservative heart shaped his conservative mind.
<p>
Let me begin by answering a question I am often asked:  "Where did you and Russell meet?"  
When I was a junior in college, and president of the student body, I attended many student 
gatherings, at which I met the young men and women who were later to emerge as the leaders of 
the conservative movement. During this time, I became involved in the founding of several 
conservative youth organizations. One snowy Saturday morning in February of 1960, I spoke at a 
conference in Manhattan on a book entitled <i>The American Cause</i>. At the luncheon, I was 
invited to sit next to the author, Russell Kirk. I found him charming and shy and, by dessert, 
discovered that we were kindred spirits. 
<p>
The next year, as a college senior, I arranged lectures for him at my college, as well as at several 
campuses on the east coast. After graduation, I began teaching English and directing dramatic 
productions in a high school on Long Island, while also taking courses for a master's degree and 
remaining politically active. During these years, Russell and I saw each other on many occasions, 
but wrote each other even more often. The two years prior to our marriage, he wrote long missives 
daily -- letters often amusing, but always full of wise insights.
<p>
In addition to writing long letters, Russell also sent me books as gifts -- books such as W.H. 
Mallock's <i>An Immortal Soul</i>, George Gissing's <i>The Private Papers of Henry 
Ryecroft</i>, and <i>The Mind and Heart of Love</i> by the theologian Martin D'Arcy. It was 
this last book, which contrasts the classical concept of love as eros with the Christian concept of 
love as agape, that captured our imagination. We discovered that we both envisioned marriage as a 
vocation, an opportunity to serve not only each other and one's family, but one's community, one's 
culture. To explain how we got from this point of agreement on marriage in the abstract, to my 
writing him a letter agreeing to marry him in particular, would take at least another lecture. So 
suffice it to say that it had long been evident that Russell wished to marry me. Simultaneously, I 
came to the conclusion that I wanted to live all my days with him, to be part of his life, of his world 
-- in short, that I loved him.
<p>
On March 17, 1964, I wrote Russell a letter announcing, "Our marriage is inevitable," which 
sounds rather dour at this distance. Amused, he replied, "Yes, inevitable like death and taxes."  We 
were married on September 19 of that year at my parish chapel, named "Our Lady of the Skies" 
because it was located at, of all places, Kennedy Airport. A zither-player from a restaurant called 
the House of Habsburg performed, and after a small reception at my parents' home, during which 
Bill Buckley held court in the kitchen, we were driven to the airport to depart for our honeymoon in 
a 1929 Rolls-Royce Phantom II hearse, with a bumper-sticker affixed to it proclaiming "Goldwater 
for President."  A classmate of Russell's from St. Andrews University was trying to sell this car and 
was eager to drive us to the church. This seemed a bit much, but not wanting to offend him, we had 
him take us to the airport instead, with our wedding party in the back of the hearse.
<p>
After a brief honeymoon on remote Beaver Island in the middle of Lake Michigan -- a long way 
from the pleasant cafs and hectic pace of New York City where we had courted -- we soon 
departed for California, where we feverishly campaigned for Senator Goldwater in the weeks 
before the election. This was the first of many campaigns in which we would be active, attending 
state conventions as delegates and hosting in our home innumerable gatherings for candidates for 
public office.
<p>
In Henry Regnery's preface to the 40th anniversary edition of <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, there 
is a description of Russell as a young man:  "He doesn't say much, about as communicative as a 
turtle, but when he gets behind a typewriter the results are <i>most</i> impressive."
<p>
During the first few years of our acquaintance, I experienced the truth of that statement -- Russell's 
preference for typing rather than talking. If he happened to be in New York when my parents held 
their Sunday evening gathering of conservatives, Russell would come. If he were asked a question, 
he would give an excellent response. When one asked him to tell a story, he kept us in charmed 
awe. Otherwise, he was mostly silent. Within a few days after the gathering, however, once he had 
returned to his typewriter, I would receive a letter from Mecosta containing wonderful comments 
and reflections provoked by our discussions.
<p>
After some years of marriage, one of Russell's assistants put the question to him:  "Dr. Kirk, you 
and Mrs. Kirk are two very different people. Mrs. Kirk is very energetic, always on the move, and 
outgoing. You, on the other hand, are more meditative, stoical, and reserved. How is it that you 
have such a happy marriage?"  Russell replied in his typical manner -- without hesitation and to the 
point -- "What you have said is true -- we are very different. First Principles -- this is the basis of 
our happiness."  Needless to say, the young man was startled to receive such an encapsulated 
answer.
<p>
We did agree on all important matters. Yet, there were two items on which there was some 
contention -- how much the monthly phone bill should be and whether we should drive home the 
70 miles from the airport via the expressway or the scenic route. I'll leave it to you to guess who 
always wanted to take the scenic route.
<p>
Perhaps some background on my education can shed light on Russell's response to the question 
posed to him about our apparent differences, and in doing so touch upon his influence on my mind 
as well as on my heart. When I attended a Catholic college in the late '50s, the curriculum was 
designed to introduce students to first principles, to both the life of the mind and the realm of the 
spirit -- to dispose them to what Newman termed a "philosophical habit of mind."  Philosophy, 
emphasizing logic, and theology, especially apologetics, were then at the core of the curriculum.
<p>
Unlike most of the young men I knew, Russell enjoyed discussing the essential questions in which I 
was interested -- questions such as the metaphysical understanding of "being," the proofs for the 
existence of God, and the meaning and purpose of life. While he agreed that what made man unique 
was his ability to reason and to know the difference between right and wrong, Russell also believed 
that pure reason had its limits and that logical proofs were not needed to validate religious truths. 
He persuaded me that even if a transcendent order were denied in the realm of reason, evidences of 
every sort -- proofs from natural science, history, and physics -- demonstrated that we were part of 
some grand mysterious scheme working upon us providentially.
<p>
Russell introduced me to the "illative sense," an expression employed by Newman to explain a 
method of reasoning beyond logic. The illative sense is constituted by impressions that are borne in 
upon us from a source deeper than our conscious and formal reason. It is the combined product of 
intuition, instinct, imagination, experience, and much reading and meditation. (See <i>The 
Conservative Mind</i>, Chapter VIII, "Conservatism with Imagination:  Disraeli and Newman.") 
Quoting Pascal, Russell often reminded me that "The heart has reasons that the reason does not 
know."
<p>
Russell's emphasis on things of the heart and the hearth became more evident after we were married 
and began to have daughters. So mindful was he of pleasing children that when building an addition 
onto his ancestral home, he instructed the carpenters to place the windows closer to the floor so 
little ones could look out more easily. He also made sure there was a room in a tower that could be 
used as a clubhouse and a winding staircase to a cupola set atop the house allowing them to view 
village fireworks on the Fourth of July. To entertain them he created a garden walk and called it the 
Troll's Path.
<p>
Perhaps an episode that occurred when our first three daughters were young will illustrate Russell's 
enjoyment of everyday life and display how he derived profound insights from ordinary events. In 
his memoirs, which he wrote in the third person, he recounts this tale:
<p><blockquote>
        At Mecosta, snowdrifts persist well into April; when the drifts vanish, the lilacs 
bloom. On the first warm and bright morning of April 1971, there burst out of the 
pantry door of the Old House Monica, aged three; Cecilia, aged two; and Felicia, 
aged eleven months -- the latter two in their pajamas. They commenced to caper and 
sing.
<p>
        Monica, emulated enthusiastically by Cecilia, began piling stones on the back steps. 
"Stones for breakfast!"  she shouted, "We're going to have stones for breakfast 
tonight!"  While Felicia writhed in an endeavor to escape from her father's clutch to 
crawl on the new grass, Cecilia, not to be outdone in fantasy, tried to feed her 
pebbles while exclaiming, "Tones for b'ekfas'!"
<p>
        "Hush!"  said Monica, "I hear a bird!"  Cecilia spied a picturesque insect. Only [her 
father's] prompt exertions prevented Felicia from devouring pebbles in earnest.
<p>
        Returning from the post office, Annette reproved [her husband] for surrendering 
feebly to the desires of their strong-willed daughters who might catch cold outside 
in their pajamas; he protested that their gamboling could not be restrained. Before 
their marriage, Annette had declared that any husband of hers ought to be ready to 
romp with the children. Now she found her Russell all too liberally fulfilling her 
commandment. 
<p>
        In the spring of life, Kirk reflected, nearly everything is wondrous. The fortunate are 
those who have not lost their sense of wonder; who subsist upon the bread of spirit, 
laughing at the stones of dullness and hard materialism.
<p>
        "The life eternal is determined by what one says and does here and now"; so Martin 
D'Arcy had said. With these three playful daughters, that spring morning, Kirk 
enjoyed one of those moments in which time and the timeless intersect:  a glimpse 
of immortality.... 
<p>
        Those men and women who fail to perceive timeless moments are the prisoners of 
time and circumstance. Only by transcending the ravenous ego, and sharing their joy 
with others, do mortals come to know their true enduring selves and to put on 
immortality.
</blockquote><p>
Russell believed that we all long for immortality, for the garden before the fall. Perhaps this is one 
of the reasons why he derived such pleasure from gardening. Our fourth daughter, Andrea, who has 
tended sheep, and shared her father's love of the land, has written:
<p><blockquote>
        When he first took up residence at Piety Hill, my father found the land shaved of its 
lush trees by the family's first settlers, earning it the name "Stump Country."  So to 
make amends for the sins of his ancestors, he planted hundreds of trees on our land 
and in the village. Despite this great number, it seemed as though he could 
remember when each tree was planted and any other interesting detail about it.
<p>
        Agrarian life was well understood and appreciated by my father. Under the dimming 
September sun he and I worked together planting and pruning. He loved to watch 
the progress his labors had achieved; the growth of new life from his ancestral earth. 
The most precious objects in my father's life were his family, his home, and his five 
acres of land.
</blockquote><p>
With Chesterton, Russell believed that all life is an allegory and could be understood only in 
parable. Thus, he relied chiefly on myths, fables, and imaginative tales to teach his children how to 
live in a bent world.
<p>
In an essay entitled "A Literary Patrimony," our second daughter, Cecilia, recalls:
<p><blockquote>
        Night after night my father read aloud to us, all of us delighted by the stories. 
Sometimes we listened for hours. Occasionally, he was even more eager to read 
than we were inclined to listen:  when we fell asleep, we were carried up the 
wooden hill -- the stairs -- to the land of nod.
<p>
        My father also invented his own tales. He related these stories as installments beside 
the fireplace, the traditional place for a community's stories, developing the 
characters and plots as he spoke. We followed "Hew and His Knife," "The Elusive 
Earl," and other tales. Often he would conclude an episode with the protagonists 
caught in a perilous predicament -- surrounded by bandits or the like -- which on 
one occasion so infuriated us that we demanded that he "get those children home to 
their momma."  Laughing, he appeased us with a more satisfactory conclusion.
<p>
        Haunting works, far removed from the tales he told us, my father's published fiction 
often considers the eerie, the macabre, even the diabolic. For the sheer pleasure of 
their evocative titles, I specify: <i>Old House of Fear</i>, <i>The Surly Sullen 
Bell</i>, <i>The Princess of All Lands</i>, <i>Lord of the Hollow Dark</i>, and 
"The Invasion of the Church of the Holy Ghost."  His published fiction and 
unwritten children's tales do, however, share a common element:  the appeal to the 
normative consciousness, touching upon struggles of an ethical nature.
<p></blockquote>

During our three decades together, Russell and I enjoyed the company of dozens of people who 
became, for months or years, part of our extended family. Because of their presence, we were able 
to celebrate more fully holidays, feast-days, and birthdays. At one point, we had so many 
celebrations that Russell conferred upon one of our "little platoon" the distinction of "Mistress of 
Revels."
<p>
Halloween was always an especially festive night. Russell wore his saffron-colored St. Andrews 
academic gown. The village children always referred to him as "The Great Pumpkin."  Later in the 
evening, after the doorbell stopped ringing, he would gather us all around to play an English game 
called "Snapdragon," which involved snatching flaming raisins soaked in brandy from a brass tray 
and eating them while they were still burning.
<p>
During those years, our household included students, refugees, several musicians, and Russell's 90-
year-old aunt, who lived in a log cabin next door. Every day at 5 p.m., tiny Fay Jewell invited all of 
us to join her in her daily drink, a single glass of whiskey and water. The students always liked to 
join her to hear her tales of Mecosta and to take a break from their more scholarly pursuits.
<p>
One could give innumerable examples of Russell's hospitality, shown in large and small acts of 
kindness to others regardless of age or stature. Perhaps the best illustration of this hospitality was 
his acceptance of the hobo who lived with us for six years until he died. A stalwart white-haired 
Viking with piercing blue eyes, Clinton Wallace came to us on probation, having done time for 
stealing from church poor-boxes. He reasoned that he was the poor, and so he was justified in 
taking what he needed. Other than stealing on occasion, his only vices were laziness and buying 
lottery tickets. For years he had kept himself warm while on the road by visiting libraries, where he 
actually read the books. He memorized reams of poetry and loved to recite it at our seminars, 
especially Shakespeare and the <i>Rubiayat of Omar Khayyam</i>. Russell wrote his best and, to 
my mind, most beautiful short story about Clinton and called it "A Long, Long Trail A-Winding."  
In it, the main character, Frank Sarsfield, patterned after Clinton, dies in a snowstorm. Ironically, 
just one year later, Clinton died in a snowstorm, on his way home after seeing the movie "Across 
the Great Divide."  He is buried in our family plot, next to Russell.
<p>
For two decades, we held formal weekend seminars several times a year, sponsored by the 
Intercollegiate Studies Institute. These seminars addressed a wide variety of topics, including "Our 
Classical Patrimony," "Historical Consciousness," "In Search of the American Spirit," "Literature 
in an Ideological Age," and "Can Virtue Be Taught?"  We also held hundreds of informal seminars 
for the many graduate students who lived with us. All together, some two thousand students and 
professors attended these gatherings. 
<p>
Several of these ISI/Piety Hill seminars were held over the New Year's Eve holiday, and so 
naturally called for a celebration. After three days of serious discussion, furniture in the drawing 
room was pushed back to accommodate the dancing of reels, the singing of carols, and the breaking 
of a piata. The most memorable of these New Year's Eve seminars was the one attended by Kitty 
and Malcolm Muggeridge. The topic was "Pilgrims in the Dark Wood of Our Time."  It was an 
awesome experience to hear Muggeridge reflect upon his fascinating life, to take walks in the 
snowy woods, returning to drink hot cider before the fireplace in Russell's library -- the barn-like 
structure in which all such seminars were held and where Russell did almost all of his writing for 
40 years.
<p>
His writing, or "scribbling," as he referred to it, resulted in 30 books, 500 <i>National Review</i> 
articles, 2,500 newspaper columns, and 400 essays. He also wrote introductions and prefaces to 
countless numbers of books, and edited 30 titles for his series "The Library of Conservative 
Thought."
<p>
Russell was never a dry-as-dust type of scholar. He departed from academe early on and instead 
strove to write evocative prose which spoke to a larger audience, one he identified as "the common 
reader."  He deemed it urgent to speak to this group -- which might include scholars, but mainly 
consisted of people in commerce, the professions, public officials, parents, or students. He wished 
to reach those who perceived that civilization had lost its object, its aim or end, had become 
decadent. He sought to articulate this loss, and to give hope that renewal was possible, to 
continually remind us that for there to be outer order in society, there must be inner order in the 
souls of its members.
<p>
Russell desired us to recognize that a conservative disposition always displays piety toward the 
wisdom of its ancestors. Piety, by which he meant reverence not merely for things spiritual, but also 
for habit, custom, tradition, and history, provides us with an understanding of the limits of our 
intellect and leaves us open to the paradoxes and mysteries of life. Of piety, Richard Weaver has 
said:
<p><blockquote>
        [I]t seems to me that it signifies an attitude toward things which are immeasurably 
larger and greater than oneself without which man is an insufferably brash, 
conceited, and frivolous animal. I do not in truth see how societies are able to hold 
together without some measure of this ancient but now derided feeling.... The 
realization that piety is a proper and constructive attitude... helped me to develop 
what Russell Kirk calls "affection for the proliferating variety and mystery of 
traditional life."... [This realization] was for me a kind of recovery of lost power or 
lost capacity for wonder and enchantment.
</blockquote><p>
It seems significant that the last book Russell published before he died was <i>The Politics of 
Prudence</i>, a selection from the 60 lectures he gave here at The Heritage Foundation over a 
period of 16 years. The last chapter of this book is entitled, "May the Rising Generation Redeem 
the Time?"  One reviewer wrote:  "There is something fitting about Russell Kirk addressing the 
younger generation... because there is a remarkable youthfulness about Russell Kirk himself.... His 
impishness, his capacity for wonder and delight, his intellectual enthusiasm, his freedom from 
academic cant -- all make him the ideal pedagogue for the next generation of conservatives."  Of 
those Heritage lectures, Ed Feulner commented:  "I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable 
overflow crowd of young people who couldn't get enough of him. I asked one of them what his 
hold was on them.... [A] young Reagan appointee said, 'He taught us all why our role was important 
beyond ourselves and beyond politics.'" 
<p>
Russell did not live to see the great congressional victory of '94. While he would have been pleased 
at this turn of events, he would have cautioned us to place this triumph in perspective. Probably, he 
would have approved the "Contract with America," but he would have reminded us of another 
contract, which joins in the community of souls those dead, those living, and those yet to be born -- 
the contract of eternal society.
<p>
This understanding of being part of a "community of souls" was very much evident in a eulogy for 
her father delivered by our third daughter, Felicia:
<p><blockquote>
        My father was delighted at my discovery at the age of fifteen of the Afrikaaner 
writer Sir Laurens van der Post. One of the first books of the many he presented to 
my mother before they were married was <i>The Seed and the Sower</i> by van 
der Post, whom he considered "a wise man."
<p>
        As my interest in the works of Sir Laurens grew, my father began searching his 
favorite book shops and catalogues for anything of a similar topic. On my last 
birthday I received eighteen books in this field. He often sent me postcards, typed of 
course, relating his progress in this endeavor. Our talks were of the bushman and his 
myths, of the land of Ethiopia, and the wonder of the world.
<P>
        This was the original basis of our friendship -- a bond of two of "God's spies," who 
did indeed as Shakespeare wrote in <i>King Lear</i>:  "live, and pray, and sing, 
and tell old tales and laugh at gilded butterflies... and take upon's the mystery of 
things."
<p>
        At our last Christmas gathering my father gave me a tape of an interview with Sir 
Laurens entitled "From the Heart."  We watched it together and listened to Sir 
Laurens speak of the prospect of his impending death and how after seeing "people 
of all races, of all cultures, and of all conditions die" [it was extraordinary to see 
how] "a certain majesty and dignity inside the human spirit comes to take people on 
to the end."  This was the way my father met death -- with reverence and dignity. 
What stories we'll have to tell, God willing, when next we meet!
</blockquote><p>
Being with Russell was never boring. Because he viewed life as a perpetual adventure and loved so 
deeply, we were continually surprised by joy. Through my reflections and through the words of 
others, especially his daughters, I have tried to reveal the essence of his mind and heart, which 
continues on in the legacy that he has left us.
<p>
Perhaps our eldest daughter, Monica, best expressed our family's thoughts on life with Russell:  
"My father was a great intellectual and a distinguished writer. He was a teller of ghostly tales and a 
planter of trees. He was a devoted husband and loving father. But above all, in his words and in his 
actions, my father was a gentleman. Even when he was in considerable pain, my father never lost 
his gracious dignity. When I made a commitment to help my mother care for my father in his 
illness, I knew that it was my duty. I now realize that it was an honor."
<p>
For those of us who knew and loved Russell Kirk, the promulgation of his wise words is both a 
duty and an honor. In this regard, T.S. Eliot's words seem especially appropriate:  "The 
communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living."

<h2>Civil Society, Social Disorder and the Role of Politics in Renewal</h2>
<b>by Don Eberly</b>
<p>
America is in the midst of deep cultural conflict and accelerating social
decay. It is hard to recall a previous account in American history when we
faced such a "cultural crisis" or "culture wars" -- civil strife, and even
civil war, but not a crisis of culture. Today's conflict goes to
fundamental questions about ultimate reality, the nature of man and the
role of religious belief in a free, well-ordered society. It is
qualitatively different than previous periods of conflict; they occurred
within the framework of American principles, while today the conflict
concerns the principles themselves.
<P>
Growing numbers of people seek an understanding of the nature and roots of
this crisis, guidance on how we can find our way out, and clarification in
particular on the role politics will play in the process of renewal. The
role of politics will not be easily resolved because the conditions we are
now coping with may be unique in American experience.
<P>
How exactly are our current circumstances different? Their chief
characteristic is a crisis of authority and order -- a collapse of the
values and ideals that once animated and restrained Americans, and a
profound weakening of the institutions that sustain a well ordered society.
The result is a lurching toward the nihilistic abyss. Understood this way,
one can begin to appreciate both the importance and the limitations of the
ballot box as a tool for social change.
<P>
To understand how politics and culture intersect and to determine their
relative importance, one must appreciate that although these realms affect
each other, they are different. Culture is about the non-authoritative
realm of values, attitudes and conduct -- the "habits of the heart" which
are lived out by individuals. Politics, at least as we now practice it,
attends to the authoritarian realm of government.
<P>
Many social theorists maintain that, as a general rule, politics more
reflects than shapes culture over the long haul for the simple reason that
politics can be counted upon to be representative. Politicians like to
please and to win elections and few will dare frustrate the expectations
people have of politics, however flawed and exaggerated they may be; most
office seekers will rise (or descend) to the occasion.
<P>
<h2>Comparing The Functions of Politics and Culture</h2>

Perhaps the easiest way to resolve the question of politics versus culture
is to compare those things which can be done through politics, and perhaps
only through politics, to those things which cannot be done predominantly
through politics. Those committed to one strategy to the exclusion of the
other will likely discover that efforts to both reform government and
restore civil society should be pursued on parallel and equally urgent
tracks. The call to politics, as well as the call to shape culture, present
themselves compellingly.
<P>
Consider the task of politics. Without power, one cannot reform the
middle-class entitlements that are bankrupting the country. One cannot
curtail the federal regulatory behemoth or reform overweening welfare
programs without power. One cannot restore a proper respect for liberty and
property to our judiciary without gaining and exercising power. Even when
it comes to the culture, one cannot curb the complete politicization of
society and the use of government to legitimize lifestyles without, to some
degree, confronting power with power -- whether in our schools, courts,
regulatory agencies or social welfare programs.
<P>
So politics is important and honorable work which must be attended to. But
the limitations of politics must also be squarely faced. If you accept that
the gravest danger to the republic's survival is the unraveling of the
social order, you will appreciate just how little can be done through even
the most sweeping electoral gains.
<P>
Legislative strategies, by themselves, are highly limited in reversing teen
pregnancy and illegitimacy, violence, the vulgarity of culture, the
coarsening of manners, the collapse of marriage as a cultural ideal,
individualism and materialism, and the devaluation of fatherhood. Nor can
politics seriously strengthen the pursuit of excellence in business and
education, create social and spiritual vitality, or recover lost character
or meaning. These are social realities, and they are profoundly affected by
the ideals which are prevalent in the culture at any given time. Over the
long haul, you cannot make up in politics what you have failed to achieve
in culture, and you may not be able to reverse the culture by simply
getting the politics right.
<P>
<h2>Social Disorder and Renewal</h2>

Few appreciate just how much degradation has occurred to private
institutions that nourish character and self-restraint (especially the
family), or comprehend the impact of social systems that too happily
embrace pathology as health and mediocrity as merit. For example, tens of
millions of Americans who now occupy positions of leadership in society are
products of an educational system that teaches dogmatic relativism and
compulsive skepticism.
<P>
Doing away with the therapeutic state might do less than imagined to cure
the pathologies upon which it feeds, except over the very long haul. A
return to full Republican control in 1996 would painfully illustrate this
point. As much as it would reverse objectionable policies coming out of
Washington, and even produce some worthwhile reforms, the most remarkable
result might be its minimal impact on the things that can kill a republic.
One should not fail to recall that 12 years of Republican Presidential
control of the policy reins and bully pulpit produced surging economic
growth, renewed national confidence and family values boosterism -- all of
which did nothing to slow the downward slide of culture (the cultural
indicators took their most southward turn during the 1980s).
<P>
This should not supply an excuse for giving up on politics, but neither
should it supply a mandate for immodesty in our political expectations. The
crisis in America is certainly a crisis of overloaded, intrusive and
increasingly bankrupt democratic institutions, but even more so it is the
attendant collapse of the institutions of civil society. Our goal should be
to get government to do well those things which it alone must do, and
otherwise to develop strategies to shore up civil society.
<P>
The latter will not be done through a preoccupation with legislative
strategies; indeed, in a nation starving for social order, the wrong form
of politics can forestall badly needed social movements and individual
reforms. Government is more capable of tearing down than building up civil
society for the simple reason that civil society does not find its origins
in the authoritarian realm. Order must be restored through other means:
religious revival; social reformation; new social sanctions against
deviance; a renaissance in private character-shaping charity; reviving
fatherhood as a dignified institution; restoring citizenship to its fuller
dimensions; and, renewing a commitment among leaders across all sectors of
society, not just politics, to the First Things.
<P>
<h2>The Politics-Culture Dichotomy</h2>

Here is where the difference, and sometimes incompatibility, of political
and cultural movements arise. The primary purpose of political movements is
often to tear down one's opponent in order to govern; it is to exploit
public issues in order to advance one's partisan, personal or institutional
interests, not necessarily to solve them. The purpose of cultural movements
is to build up a new vision for the good society, embracing all citizens
regardless of politics; it is about changing people and strengthening civil
society, not just directing the affairs of government.
<P>
The primary use of politics in a nation experiencing social disorder is to
revert to a more classical notion in which politics is used to call the
nation to consider the higher ends of life and join in building the good
society. The statesman would seek to reverse the collapse of our governing
consensus, and confront the dangers of internal disorder and fragmentation.
This is a different task than leading a nation through the crisis of war or
economic collapse in which the leader's arsenal consists of military or
policy tools. Moreover, victory or defeat would not be measured in
conventional terms of elections or military surrenders. The work of the
statesman today must be seeking a cure for cultural cancer and reviving
what James Davison Hunter calls "substantive democracy," not simply leading
a holy war against the infidels.
<P>
The unfolding crisis will certainly attract demagogues, but it will take a
statesman of the stature of Lincoln to solve. The tragedy is that most
leaders today, even if they understand the problem, only end up
trivializing and exploiting the issues. There are few persons today who can
simultaneously practice politics effectively and still manage to advance
the things which are not of politics: virtue, character and culture.
<P>
If the problem is deeper than politics, the statesman must not simply be
preoccupied with annihilating political enemies, but equally preoccupied
with strategies for renewal that transcend politics to even include
political opponents. If you believe, as I do, that the nation is nearing
emergency conditions, then indeed the luxury of turning every public
concern into an opportunity for ideological or partisan advancement, on the
theory that political victory equals social salvation, is a luxury America
can no longer afford.
<P>
<h2>Rome and America: From Virtue to Vice, Democracy to Despotism</h2>

The social crisis of America will not be reversed by simply reforming
politics. When ancient Rome slid from a shining city into a darkened
jungle, it was because the people abandoned virtue for decadence. Just as
sure as virtue produced prosperity, the plunge into decadence eventually
destroyed it. Society celebrated deviance as a symbol of liberation from
religious constraints, more and more people substituted leisure for work
and lived off the state, and the record of government policy was to simply
accommodate the "changing values."
<P>
This social disintegration occurred within an economic, governmental and
legal apparatus that was one of the most advanced in human history. No law
and order government, no well conceived legal system and no wealth
enhancing economic structure could prevent the disintegration from within
of a once proud and virtuous society. The lesson of ancient Rome for modern
America is that the forces of cultural nihilism do not stop to pay their
respects to democratic capitalism; our disintegration is of a similar kind
-- it is social.
<P>
Then, as now, the preoccupation of the leadership class was with legal and
economic structures. But no amount of attention to the power plant
prevented the lights from steadily going dim. Then, as now, the leadership
class faced the crisis by simply doing what they knew to do, only trying
harder. Social disorder drove society inexorably toward chaos. Politics was
characterized by endless and pointless polemics that descended unavoidably
into bitter and eventually violent recriminations. This was a society,
completely politicized, whose warring ideologues insisted they could turn
the lights back on if only they got control of the power plant. And it is
this reality, as much as the cultural disintegration in whose name the
fight is fought, that represents the arrival of barbarians at the city
gate. A politics that raises hopes unrealistically high only nourishes the
brutish beast of frustrated expectations, leaving the people even hungrier
for destructive revolutionary change.
<P>
<h2>A Politics of Honesty</h2>

As C.S. Lewis said, civilization is a rarity, "attained with difficulty and
easily lost." Political movements which fail to appreciate the fragility of
society can drive it toward the abyss. To simply win politically does not
mean civil society will necessarily be recovered.
<P>
What we need is a politics based upon principle, honesty, and telling the
truth. Honesty admits the limitations of politics to treat the deepest
roots of our moral and social crisis. A well articulated politics of
honesty may reap dividends in an ideologically exhausted land. Few have
grasped the importance of what Peter Drucker meant when he predicted the
end of the notion of "salvation by state." It is the collapsing of
confidence in the business of the state and the politics that feeds our
current obsession with governmentalism.
<P>
There is a mentality among some political activists of various stripes that
we may need to burn the village down in order to rebuild it. The problem
is, the village these well meaning people have in mind rebuilding would
probably never reemerge in a society that has substituted revolutionary
expectations for the cultivation of virtue and self-governance. Do not
expect stronger civil institutions to magically reappear. Ideological zeal
then, in a disordered society, may be more the disease than the cure.
<P>
<h2>Dividing the Labor of Politics and Culture into Three Zones</h2>

How, then does one organize the work of politics and the work of culture?
Consider three zones, each depicting a function that is important and
complimentary if not always compatible. One is centralized partisan
politics. The closer one comes to Washington, the more one is likely to
practice this form of politics and to be uncomfortable with the analysis
set forth here because it appears to represent a distraction from the
urgent work of government. For diehard politicos, the work of culture
represents a possible diminution of political effort -- politics versus
culture is seen as a zero sum game.
<P>
Those who occupy this first zone indeed are engaged in critical work,
particularly ensuring government "does no harm." And it entails challenging
Americans to do things that only they can do -- strengthening citizenship,
rebuilding moral communities and returning to virtue and mutual respect.
<P>
The second zone is decentralized politics -- less partisan and ideological,
more focused on local government. It involves expanding beyond ideological
constituencies. Alvin and Heidi Toffler predicted that we are moving beyond
"mass movements," "mass politics," "mass parties" and "mass media." Mass
movement politics, which relies on a high degree of cohesion and
conformity, does not fit well in this more fragmented and diffused
political environment. Politics will be driven more and more from the
bottom, and the closer the issue is to home the less people will care to be
identified with national movements.
<P>
The final zone is the cultural-civic realm, a realm which almost requires
that one's ideological commitments be placed in neutral, since the object
of this work is not winning legislative battles but finding solutions
through the community. Some of the most creative work in the coming decades
will be done outside of politics, and this should be embraced as equally
valuable to the cause of renewing America. One might say the work of
civic-cultural renewal involves regeneration, whereas the work of
government should be guided simply by the Hippocratic oath -- do no harm.
<P>
The greatest political movements of the twentieth century achieved their
goals not primarily through legislation, but by affecting the thinking and
attitudes of Americans. The sexual revolution, feminism, the civil rights
movements and environmentalism deeply affected how Americans think about
sex, women, minorities and the environment as much as they changed the
legal system.
<P>
As Lincoln said: "He who moulds public opinion goes deeper than he who
shapes statutes." Still, those who would espouse a "culture over politics"
strategy should accept that a good part of cultural renewal will not be
possible without power, whether applied in government or in confronting the
cultural deconstructionists who have lodged themselves in positions of
power on campuses, the newsrooms and other power centers in the private
sector.
<P>
Those who espouse a "politics over culture" strategy, who believe that the
answer to crime, family collapse and ethical corruption is to become a
Republican should boldly say that, but they should also tell the rest of
the story: politics cannot deliver all the goods. They should use political
platforms to explain that the kind of dynamic cultural/moral/spiritual
renewal the nation now needs will not likely emanate from political action
alone.
<P>
<h2>Finding a Framework for Citizenship and Civic Republicanism</h2>

How then can one use politics, both to reform government and to enlist
Americans in the cause of cultural renewal? We will be aided by an
understanding of an older, fuller notion of citizenship along with reviving
the great American tradition and language of shared American values called
civic republicanism.
<P>
The notion of citizenship is a term that connects the individual to the
totality of public life: the political and the cultural are integrated. The
term certainly embraces democratic duty, i.e., voting and organizing, but
also includes social sympathy, volunteerism, community renewal, civic
participation, and the full range of social responsibilities. Citizens do
more than participate in elections: they organize their communities against
crime; develop strategies against teen pregnancy; volunteer at local soup
kitchens; take their local parks back from drunks; join the PTA; and, pray
for their country at churches and synagogues.
<P>
Civic republicanism offers a framework for transcending religious and
ideological factionalism by reviving a language that is neither secular nor
sectarian. It is a language of social fraternity, strengthened
neighborhoods and a well moderated pluralism of shared values without the
normal linkage to governmentalism. Civic republicanism places the focus of
concern on strengthening the institutions of civil society -- family,
neighborhood, church and synagogue, and voluntary associations. In other
words, the focal point is community, not the central, homogenizing and
totalizing entities (such as national politics and the entertainment/media
culture) that remain so alluring. Indeed, it is local communities that
represent a bulwark against the encroachments of the central state.
<P>
This approach should not be confused with the traditional politics of
limited government, which is based upon the debatable assumption that the
private sector will thrive again in government's absence. This alternative
framework offers a bold call to social reformation; it seeks to mobilize
citizens and leaders from all sectors of society; and, it unashamedly calls
for a return to the American Creed of responsibility, self-governance,
character and community. We must start by appreciating what civil
institutions do -- they habituate (J. Q. Wilson's term) individuals to
restrain themselves and respect others. This approach also acknowledges
that the government as we know it is as much the effect as the cause of
declining civil society.
<P>
Comprehensive reform of government is called for in the form of
decentralization and the wholesale elimination of wasteful, duplicative
programs. However, while demonizing government is good politics, it will
not, by itself, restore a civil and humane society. Indeed, the swift and
indiscriminate elimination of federal poverty programs, absent a
simultaneous, well-orchestrated campaign for community renewal, may only
drive some communities, particularly our cities, closer to state of nature.
<P>
Americans are looking for a new vision for empowerment and civic renewal
that is both political and cultural in impact. Michael Novak, who has long
articulated this vision of empowerment, said: "The American political party
that best gives life and breath and amplitude to civil society will not
only thrive in the twenty-first century. It will win popular gratitude and
it will govern."
<P>
A new paradigm for renewal is emerging, and it presents huge possibilities
for reversing America's social regression. Its arrival will be aided
greatly by a clear-headed understanding of the relative value of political
versus social change and how the work of politics and culture can be
integrated.
<P>
Realizing the possibilities will not be easy. Though deeply American, this
ascendant paradigm has fallen out of practice and even memory, and is thus
hard to visualize. Plus, its rebirth may very well be aborted by a
deepening cultural and ideological polarization. Moreover, the traditional
cycle of American renewal will have to work its way through a different
social and political topography this time. America is different today,
radically so: changes in structure and demographics; the information
overload resulting from the technology revolution; globalization; the rise
of racial and ethnic identity and the decline in common culture; and, the
weakening of nation state as an organizing construct all make the task so
much more complex.
<P>
In the end, acknowledging that the crisis is social presents both the bad
and good news. The good news is that periodic self-renewal, just like
today, is usually preceded by a broad acceptance that things are bad, and
beyond conventional solutions. If there is such a thing as American
Exceptionalism, its chief ingredient is this unique capacity to renew
itself.
<P>
Great opportunities await us. Millions are looking into the abyss of
nihilism and don't like what they see. They are confused about what to do.
Is it politics and power, or is it culture and community. It is both: each
embraced and used to promote the restoration of a civil and humane society.

<title>The Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act</title>
<center> 
<h2>The Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>Our government is too big, and it spends, taxes, and regulates too much.</h3>
 This is the true crisis facing America in the 1990s.  The Freedom and Fairness
Restoration Act will begin a roll back.  It launches a frontal assault on Big Government,
radically changing virtually everything the government does.<p>
Consider:<p>
In America today, more people work for government than are employed in
manufacturing.<p>
The U.S. public sector is now larger than the entire economy of any country in
 the world save Japan and the United States itself.<p>
The average family today pays more in taxes than it spends on food, clothing
 and shelter combined.<p>
 Taking into account the total cost of government--taxes as well as regulation--an
 American works from January 1st through July 10th not to support himself and
 his family, but to support the government.<p>
<h3>A Fundamental Choice</h3>
If being an American means freedom from the unfair demands of distant rulers--if
it means being able to use one's own efforts to build a better future for one's children--then this state of affairs is very wrong.  The growth of government is a grave danger to
the American Dream.<p>
Americans must now make a fundamental choice:  Should the government
become ever larger as our freedom diminishes--or should we take dramatic action now
to halt the growth of government and restore the promise of greater freedom to our
citizens?<p>
The Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act is a way of saying "Enough is
enough."<p>
 It is a comprehensive assault on Big Government, designed to halt its growth,
expose its true cost, and limit its influence on the lives of free Americans.<p>
It does this by radically reordering the three major activities of the government--
taxing, spending, and regulating.  In brief, the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act:<p>
Creates a flat tax.  Replaces the current tax code with a neutral tax code based
on a 17 percent flat tax on all income.<p>
Simplifies the tax code. Makes the tax code simple enough to file a tax return
on a postcard.<p>
Promotes jobs and higher wages.  Eliminates the double taxation of savings,
 including eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>
Cuts taxes on families.  Eliminates the marriage penalty and  doubles the
deduction for dependent children.<p>
Promotes secure retirement.  By ending the double taxation of savings, it
provides all Americans the tax equivalent of an unlimited IRA.  The FFRA also
 repeals the estate tax and the Clinton tax hikes on Social Security recipients.<p>
Restores honesty in government.  To expose the hidden cost of government, it
ends income tax withholding and requires the government to calculate the cost
 of regulations.<p>
 Ends profligate deficit spending.  The FFRA sets rigid spending caps, freezing
 government spending for one year, then allowing it to grow at the rate of
 inflation.<p>
 Reinvents government.  Forces the true reinvention of government by
 sunsetting virtually all existing federal spending programs.<p>
Protects private property rights.  Requires the federal government to
 compensate private property owners whenever federal regulations significantly
 reduce the value of their property.<p>
Requires rational risk assessment.  Forces Congress to determine the cost,
benefits, and risks of all new regulations before it imposes new costs on the
 economy.<p>
<h3>The following is a detailed explanation of H.R. 4585</h3><p>
 The Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act <p>
 Introduced by Representative Dick Armey on June 16,1995<p>
<b> Title I: A New, Fair Tax System</b><p>
Establish a flat income tax rate of 17 percent on all income.<p>
Under the bill, the current complicated tax system is replaced with a low, simple
 flat tax.  All income would be taxed once -- and only once -- at a rate of 17
 percent (when fully phased in by 1997).  Income would be taxed under either the
 individual wage tax or the business tax.<p>
 Individual Wage Tax.  Under the individual wage tax, all wages, salaries, and
 pensions are taxed at the flat 17 percent rate.  In 1997, a personal exemption of
 $13,100 would be permitted for a single person, $17,200 for a single head of
 household, $26,200 for a married couple filing jointly and $5,300 for each
 dependent.  For virtually all taxpayers, this would result in a tax cut, especially for
 families with children.  To prevent the double-taxation of income, earnings from
 savings is not included in taxable income, and, therefore, not subject to taxation.<p>
Business Tax.  Under the business tax, owners of  businesses would pay a 17
percent rate on the difference (if positive) between revenue and expenses. 
Subject to the business tax are corporate, partnership, professional, farm, and rental profits and royalties.  The base for the tax is gross revenue less purchases
of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land, and wages paid to
employees.  No deductions are permitted for fringe benefits, interest, or
payments to owners.<p>
Because the various exemptions, loopholes, complicated depreciation
schedules, and targeted tax breaks are eliminated, the tax return is simple
enough to be filled out on a postcard, saving taxpayers countless hours and
expense filing tax returns.  By eliminating the double-taxation of saving and allowing complete expensing, the bill will spur investment and economic growth. 
Because of the generous exemptions, millions of taxpayers are taken off the rolls
entirely, and middle income Americans receive a tax cut.  The doubling of the
dependent deduction would provide significant tax relief for families with children.<p>
Minimize the initial static revenue loss by phasing in the 17 percent as spending
and the deficit fall.<p>
The Armey bill provides for a new contract with the American people.  As federal
spending falls and the deficit is lowered, taxes will be correspondingly lowered. 
Under the bill, the tax rate is set at 20 percent in the first year, providing most
Americans a modest tax cut yet limiting revenue loss.  In the third year, the rate
is lowered to 17 percent, providing additional tax relief.  This can be
accomplished for two reasons.  First, as the economy grows because of the
favorable treatment of saving, investment, and low marginal tax rates, revenue to
the Treasury will grow.   Second, the spending restraint provided for in the bill
(discussed below) will reduce expenditures.  Therefore, higher revenue coupled
with lower spending will reduce future deficits, freeing up resources to be
returned to the American people.  That's why the rate is lowered to 17 percent in
the third year, providing Americans additional tax relief.<p>  
Eliminate the hidden cost of government by ending income tax withholding.<p>  
Because most income taxes are taken directly out of Americans' paychecks, the
burden of high federal taxes is largely hidden from the American people.   By
concealing the true cost of government, the political class has built in a bias in
favor of larger government.  Under the Armey bill, withholding is eliminated. 
Because Americans would write a check to the IRS each month when they pay
their other bills, they would be able to measure the true cost of government
against the benefits.<p>
<b>Title II: Real Spending Restraint</b><p>
Reinvent government by sunsetting virtually every federal program.<p>
Under the bill, all unearned entitlement and discretionary programs would be
sunset within the first two years of passage.  An "unearned" entitlement is
defined as an entitlement not earned in service or paid for in total or in part by
assessments or contributions.  Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits and
retirement programs are earned entitlements, and are not sunsetted.  All other
programs would be sunsetted within two years of passage of the bill.  All
unearned entitlements and discretionary programs would be sunset every ten
years, after each census.<p> 
This provision would genuinely reinvent government by forcing Congress to
review virtually every federal program.  Sunsetting forces Congress to
periodically review the effectiveness of programs, set new priorities, and reduce
unnecessary spending.<p>
Place spending caps on the growth of entitlement programs.<p>
The total level of entitlement spending -- excluding Social Security -- may not
exceed the increase in the consumer price index plus the growth in eligible
population.  If the increase in these programs exceeds this level, an entitlement
sequester to eliminate the excess spending will occur on all entitlements except
Social Security.<p>
Entitlement spending now accounts for more than half of spending and is the
fastest growing portion of the budget.  The entitlement sequester will place
strong pressure on Congress to make genuine reforms when reauthorizing
sunsetted programs.<p>
Establish caps on total federal spending.<p>
The plan would limit the growth in total federal spending after freezing it for one
 year in 1995.  If spending exceeded the maximum spending amount established
in law, an across the board sequester would cut 80 percent from domestic
discretionary spending and 20 percent from defense spending.<p> 
The bill also contains a "look-back" sequester.  On July 1 of each fiscal year,
OMB is required under this bill to determine the extent to which the spending cap
may be exceeded.  If the limit will be exceeded, a look back sequester will
eliminate the excess spending under the same 80-20 formula.<p>
Capping federal spending with an enforceable sequester is the only way to
ensure that federal spending does not exceed a certain level of growth. 
Provide for a joint budget resolution.<p>
The bill would provide for a joint budget resolution, replacing the present
concurrent resolution, making the president a full participant in the budget
process early in the year.  Besides making the president a full participant in the
drafting in the federal budget from the beginning of the process, this also
prevents the rules committees from waiving budget points of order because a
joint budget resolution has the force of law.<p>
<b>Title III: Open and Honest Regulating</b><p>
Protect private property rights.<p>
This provision protects the rights of private property owners by requiring the
federal government to compensate landowners when federal regulations have
the effect of significantly reducing the value of private property.<p>  
Many private property owners have had their land essentially seized from them
through regulatory takings that prohibit most uses for the land.  Requiring the
federal government to reimburse property owners for these takings would restore
protection for property owners.<p>
Provide for a regulatory budget<p>.
Within one year of passage of the bill, OMB would be required to determine the
costs of federal regulations to the American economy.  OMB would also be
required to calculate the cost of federal regulations to state and local
government.  If OMB determines the cost of regulations will exceed the previous
year's level, it would be required to submit to Congress proposed changes in 
existing legislation or regulations which would keep regulatory costs in line with the previous year.<p>
This section of the bill forces Congress and the Executive Branch, for the first
time, to calculate and reveal to the public the economic costs of federal laws and
regulations, allowing public officials and the American people to weigh their costs
against the expected benefits.<p> 
Require cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment for new legislation and
regulations.<p>
Just as the budgetary effects of proposed legislation is calculated by the
Congressional Budget Office before it is considered by the House or Senate, this
provision requires a CBO analysis of the economic costs of proposed
regulations.  For each bill considered by Congress, CBO would determine:<p>
*  The degree of risk to the public health and safety targeted by the legislation; 
*  The costs associated with implementing and complying with the measure; and 
*  The effects on the economy.<p>

<title>Lugar Proposes A National Sales Tax
Press Release From the Office of the Senator</title>

<h3>Lugar Proposes A National Sales Tax<br>
Press Release From the Office of the Senator</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>
U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar will tell a congressional committee today that the best way to increase wages, spur robust cconomic growth and reduce federal government intrusion in Americans' lives is to abolish the income tax and replace it with a national sales tax.<p>
"It is time to stop working around the edges of the tax code.  We must transform it completely. By taxing savings and investment at least twice, the tax system has become the biggest impediment to economic growth," Lugar said.<p>
Representative Bill Archer, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Lugar advocate instituting a national sales tax that would tax the purchase of goods and services rather than income. Such a consumption tax would encourage savings and investment because people would be taxed only on the money they spend, "Our net national savings rate has reached alarmingly low levels. Because of this low rate of savings, capital to fuel our economy has become increasingly scarce. "  Lugar cited a Concord Coalition Study that estimates annual median family income would be $50,000, instead of the current S35.000, if U.S. productivity had maintained its pre-1974 level of 2.9 percent per year. It is currently 1.1 percent.<p>
The simplicity of a national sales tax makes it thc most effective and appealing way to reform the current tax system, Lugar said, "The burden of complying with thc Income tax code would be lifted. The money you make is your own. You don't have to report it or hide it."<p>
Such a straightforward approach to taxation would substantially reduce the role of the lnternal Revenue System. The income tax represents the worst form of intrusion into the lives of citizens, Lugar said. Each year, Americans spend more than five billion hours of time to comply with it. "The IRS would no longer look ovcr thc shoulder of every American. There will be no audits. Arnericans will not waste time and effort worrying about record keeping, deductions or exemptions that are part of the current tax code."<p>
In order to avoid placing a greater tax burden on low-income Americans, exemptions could be established for a certain annual dollar amount of purchases or categories of purchases, such as food, medicine and housing.<p>

<title>A MAN OF HIS WORD</title>
<body>
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<p>
<h2>A MAN OF HIS WORD</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<p>
Anne Ellsworth Redd</i></center>
<p>
In a 17th century poem by Richard Lovelace, a soldier, who is just
about to go to war, explains
to his grieving lover, &quot;I could not love thee, dear, so much/
Loved I not honor more.&quot;  He is saying that his very expression
of love depends upon his character, his honor.  It seems that
this concept -- that a man's contribution in life and love would
depend upon his faithfulness to integrity -- is lost to us today.
 Some say that this kind of man no longer exists, or, even, that
he never did exist.  But this is the kind of man my father is.
<p>
There was a time, when I was in high school, that my dad proved his
faithfulness to me in a way that moves me, years later.  As a
surface naval officer, he was away from home for much of my last
three years of high school.  High school is a challenging (put
mildly) time for the best of us.  I had certain ideas about my
independence and made all kinds of mistakes in an effort to &quot;find
myself.&quot;  The very last people that I was interested in were
my parents.
<p>
Throughout this period (perhaps you're familiar with
the poetic, brooding, black-turtleneck stage?) my father wrote
me letters -- weekly, if not more.  I remember them well:  long,
sincere letters on heavy white stationery, written in his own
trademark hand and folded over once.  He told me that he loved
me, he asked me about my life and my interests, he described places
that he visited and challenges that he faced, he shared ideas
about life and God.
<p>
In one memorable letter, he told me that
he understood that I wanted to be &quot;free,&quot; and said that
he and my mother wanted to give me as much freedom as they possibly
could.  &quot;But there are two kinds of decisions,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;important decisions and <i>life-changing</i> decisions.  The latter
will profoundly affect you for the rest of your life.  These decisions
are decisions about sex, about drugs, about college...&quot; and
he went on to list some of these life-changing decisions (he is
always frank).  He said that he and my mother needed to be a part
of these latter decisions.  Though I took all of the letters and
good advice for granted at the time, looking back I am moved by
the kind of faithfulness and love that would cause him to write
so consistently.
<p>
When I was in eighth grade, my father was diagnosed
with cancer.  The doctors operated, in an attempt to remove all
of the malignancy.  From the moment of his learning of his illness
and throughout his hospitalization, I remember his strength. 
There were tears and hugs of love, and there was much pain.  But
there was strength under it all, and a complete
selflessness in his suffering.  He was cured, thankfully, but
he and my mother both used the pain as an opportunity to grow
-- as an exercise in faith.
<p>
In the face of cancer, long hours,
six-month-long deployments, and all the other things that life
brings with it, he has kept his promise to my mother and to God
by remaining faithful to her.  Their marriage has been a partnership,
a friendship, a haven, and a love affair.  The commitment that
my parents have for each other has modeled for us, their children,
faithfulness in a world sadly lacking it.  His faithfulness to
me, his daughter, has laid a foundation of dignity and confidence
that should serve me well in my family and career.  And he has
been a model for my brothers of the kind of man each of them should
strive to be.
<p>
As a naval officer, my dad works hard  to serve his
country.  As a leader, he is uncompromising in his beliefs, unflinching
in his morals, and unrelenting in his pursuit of excellence. 
Though we tease him that he sounds like a broken record, my dad
talks often about what he calls the fundamentals of leadership
-- Vision, Excellence, Character, Teamwork, Respect.  He has a
commitment to truth and goodness that doesn't depend on popular
opinion or trends.
<p>
A true man initiates in leadership, in integrity,
<i>and</i> in apology.  He is the first to make a stand for what is right,
and he is the first to admit when he is wrong.  In fact, a true
man may often find himself standing alone in this society.  But
he will always find himself standing.  As a leader, my dad is
honest about his failures and weaknesses, and he strives to learn
from them.  He is not perfect (and he will be the first to say
so), but he is persevering.  He is not faultless, but he is faithful.
 These things make him great.
<p>
In a society shaken by divorce and
marital unfaithfulness, we need men who keep their promises. 
In a culture sated with drugs and MTV and O.J. Simpson and &quot;safe
sex,&quot; we need men who are ready to lead a more radical movement
-- an Integrity Movement.  We need leaders with the compassion
for victims of this culture, and who, like Lovelace's soldier,
have the conviction to lift up a brighter and clearer standard
of living for everyone.
<p>
When we accept the premise that we are
trapped in cultural quicksand -- that we cannot demand more from
our youth or our leaders -- we have lost our hope in the soul's
potential, and we have denied the evidence of the lives of men
like my dad.

<title>SHANNON FAULKNER IS GONE</title>

<p>
<h2>FAULKNER IS GONE, BUT<br>
BATTLE OVER SINGLE-SEX<br>
SCHOOLS THREATENS<br>
EDUCATIONAL DIVERSITY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Shannon Faulkner's decision to quit The Citadel does not stop
the battle over state-sponsored same-sex education.  That controversy
won't even be resolved when a federal judge decides whether an
alternative for women at Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C.
eliminates the need for a co-ed Citadel program, and daily reports
of Faulkner replacements or other touching profiles of military
women won't change the issue.  The gender assault goes much farther.
<P>
The Clinton Justice Department will take this case to the Supreme
Court and the high court could strike down public funded single-gender
education forever -- damaging America's academic diversity.  That
is a serious threat.
<P>
The Citadel's loss of the Faulkner trial would threaten the more
than 80 all-women's colleges that depend on taxpayer support.
That's why some of these colleges have expressed their support
for The Citadel in amicus briefs.  Their fear is that prohibitions
against direct funding of single-sex educational institutions
would lead to prohibitions against &quot;indirect funding&quot;
of single-sex colleges through federal financial aid and tax exemptions.
 This would make it difficult for any single-sex educational institution
to survive.
<P>
A diversified educational system should include single-sex schools
because same-gender settings are best for some students.  The
benefits of single-sex schools for some students are marked. 
Students do better academically, and women tend to pursue majors
in science, math and management, hold more leadership positions,
and are more likely to seek higher academic degrees.  Both genders
are more likely to participate in
honors programs and pursue careers in business, law or teaching,
and both sexes tend to find their overall academic experience
more rewarding.
<P>
One argument raised by critics of single-sex educational institutions
is that schools like The Citadel exacerbate the bias against women.
 But over the past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase
in the educational attainment of women in this country.  Diane
Ravitch, a former assistant secretary of education in the Bush
Administration, reports that:  67 percent of women high school
graduates go to college, compared to 58 percent of men; 55 percent
of all college undergraduates are women; women earn 59 percent
of all master's degrees; and women earn 39 percent of all doctoral
degrees, up from 14 percent in 1970.
<P>
Besides enhancing academic diversity, single-sex education can
help curb the epidemic of youth violence.  Same-gender schools
have emerged as a means to help at-risk inner city boys -- especially
those in elementary school.
<P>
Same-sex settings give boys a greater chance to succeed in life.
 Boys learn most when they perceive their teacher as a disciplinarian
and competitor.  They respond better to teaching based on the
adversary model of education, which incorporates contest and competition
in a disciplined environment.  And male teachers provide possibly
the only male role model alternative to a street gang leader for
some inner-city boys.  
<P>
Single-sex schools for girls have a positive academic effect and
protect them from aggressive boys.  They have better affective
outcomes and higher test scores.  They also enjoy higher self-esteem
than their co-ed peers.
<P>
Studies have shown that single-gender education works in the inner
city.  Seventh graders who had attended the Malcolm X Academy
in Detroit, an all-boys inner city school, had the highest math
scores among 77 Detroit schools and the second highest in Michigan
among 780 schools.
<P>
Cornelius Riordan, a professor at Providence University, found
that African-American and Hispanic students in single-gender schools
outperformed their coed peers by nearly a grade level.  And inner
city single-mothers recognize the value of same-sex schools, especially
for boys.
<P>
Unfortunately, single-gender public schools are illegal because
they allegedly discriminate based on gender.   Groups like the
American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization of
Women have threatened to file lawsuits claiming a violation of
Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  These are the same groups
which lined-up behind Shannon Faulkner's fight with The Citadel.
<P>
Some critics of single-sex education compare policies that exclude
because of gender to policies that discriminate according to race.
 They contend that the issues involved in The Citadel case are
the same as those in the 1954 Supreme Court case of <I>Brown v.
Board of Education</I>.  But this is a false analogy.
<P>
Gender differences are very different from racial differences.
 In some parts of the country, races were once segregated on public
transportation, in schools and in bathrooms.  But when racial
segregation finally ended, beneficial forms of segregation by
gender continued.  We continue to have &quot;separate but equal&quot;
male and female public bathrooms because most people recognize
that gender is different than race.
<P>
The battle over state-funded single-sex classes is not about bigotry
and is not a civil rights &quot;retreat.&quot;  The truth is single-gender
schools diversify America's educational experience and provide
wider options to individuals -- both women and men -- that might
benefit greatly from them.   They also give constructive male
role models to fatherless boys growing up in inner-cities.
<P>

<title>Job Prospects for College Graduates</title>

<h3>Job Prospects for College Graduates:  What's the Problem?</h3><br>
<h4>by Kate Obenshain Griffin<br>
Director of Program Development<br>
<a href="/yaf">Young America's Foundation</a><br>
September 7, 1995</h4><br>
</center>

	Students arriving at the "Ivies" this fall are encountering a surprising phenomenon.  Women's studies courses outnumber economics classes, often by as much as two to one.  Princeton remains the lone exception, but not by much:  25 women's studies courses compared with 32 in economics.<p>
	This phenomenon has something to do with the fact that over 50 percent of those who graduated from college in May still cannot find jobs appropriate for their degrees.  But that's only half the picture;  the following anecdote completes it.  <p>
	<i>New Republic</i> editor and outspoken liberal Michael Kinsley wrote this of his attempt to hire a recent college graduate as his research assistant:  "[T]he government makes it comically difficult for the honest citizen to hire a single employee."  Comical to some, but not to the new graduate.  Kinsley said government regulation "plunges you into an entirely new dimension of complexity as an employer" with "a minimum of 37 different forms and 50 separate checks to hire a single employee for a year."  As a result of government regulation, Kinsley's young assistant ended up right back where he found her:  in the unemployment line.<p>
	Two simple reasons explain why half of today's college graduates cannot find jobs befitting their degree.  First, colleges are not preparing students adequately and employers know it.  They are focusing on fads such as women's studies rather than spending limited resources on core academic subjects.  And second, burgeoning government regulation is having a pernicious, and often underestimated, impact on the job market. <p>
	Thanks to a dramatic shift in the direction of college curricula, a degree no longer indicates proficiency in the basic skills.  The <i>New York Times</i> reported that employers, "express a lack of confidence in the ability of schools and colleges to prepare young people for the workplace."  According to a major report by the National Center on the Educational Quality of the Workforce, employers, well aware of grade inflation, "pay little attention to measurements of school performance."  Nevzer Stacey of the Department of Education went one step further:  "Employers have given up on the schools."<p>
	What are our colleges and universities doing wrong?  While skill requirements for employment are increasing (57 percent of employers say skill requirements have increased), the quality and substance of our educational institutions are eroding.  Except at a few select schools which have maintained their commitment to quality academic instruction, multicultural and politically correct courses supplant classes that have practical value for future employment.  <p>
	What courses are now preparing our students for the work force?  At Columbia University this fall: <i> Race, Gender, and the Politics of Rock 'n' Roll</i> and <i>The Invisible Women in Literature</i>:<i> The Lesbian Literary Tradition</i>.   At Penn:  <i>Search for Extraterrestrial Life</i> and <i>(Im)possible Animals</i>.  At Brown:  <i>Unnatural Acts and Split Britches</i>, <i>Circumcision: Male and Female, Jewish and Gentile and Daughters of Darkness: Lesbian Tropes</i>.  And Harvard, not to give students the idea that the free market might is a good thing, offers <i>Alternative Economies:</i>  <i>The Case Against Capitalism</i>, <i>1648-1848</i> in addition to activist-oriented <i>Status of Environmental Justice as a Public Policy Issue</i> and<i> AIDS, Health, and Human Rights</i>.  Other courses influencing students' outlook on the free market include Cornell's <i>The Selfish Individual and the Modern World</i>, Princeton's <i>Income Distribution</i>, and Yale's<i> Gender and the Politics of Resistance:  Feminism, Capitalism and the Third World.</i> <p>
	According to a recent survey in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, finding a good job is the number one reason students attend college.  Yet schools are so caught up in hot political issues that they have lost sight of a critical aspect of their mission:  training students for the workforce.  As Wendy Bounds of the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> said, "After an outlay of thousands of dollars, college graduates discover that a bachelor's degree doesn't buy what it did 10 years ago."<p>
	Hand in hand with higher education's own responsibility for the attrition of opportunities for college graduates is another culprit:  government regulation.  While Clinton panders to the twenty-something crowd with his expensive AmeriCorps and student loan programs, his administration's regulatory policies are having a baleful effect.  Businesses are forced to spend vast resources on compliance with regulations rather than on expansion and hiring.  Take the paper industry for example.  Over the past four years, one of the largest book paper suppliers in North America, P.H. Glatfelter, spent <i>$180 million</i> to satisfy regulatory requirements.  That is $180 million that will not be spent developing the business or hiring new workers. <p>   
	The numbers are staggering.  There are four times more federal regulations today than in 1965 and 14 times more than in 1950, totaling over 200 volumes and 132,000 pages.  Estimates show regulations costing the U.S. economy over $500 billion annually.  Employment quotas, for instance, set businesses back between $5 and $8 billion annually on direct compliance (government paperwork, mandated advertising in minority newspapers, etc.).  Many billions more, however, are lost in indirect costs due to the diversion of management time, resources, and energy.  And according to author Thomas Sowell, minorities have not benefited from this loss.  He says the relative economic position of minorities has actually fallen since the United States implemented employment quotas.  <p>
	As a result of new and existing regulations, the jobs students have counted on are just not there.  Rather than pay the price of expansion, businesses are either stagnant or cutting back.  During July and August 1995, manufacturing jobs declined by an average of 38,000 per month.  Yet in August alone, government <i>increased</i> its payroll by 73,000 jobs.  That is 73,000 new bureaucrats to write, revise and enforce regulations which are largely responsible for factories losing 120,000 jobs overall in 1995. <p>
	While universities educate students in <i>The Drama of Homosexuality </i>(Harvard) and <i>Spirit Possession</i>, <i>Shamanism</i>, <i>Curing and Witchcraft</i> (Cornell), the Clinton administration is doing little to plan for the employment needs of future graduates.   For instance, there are <i>one million </i>cosmetology grads who cannot find jobs in their field.  Yet this year, there will be <i>200,000</i> new cosmetology students, many of whom will seek and receive assistance from federal loan programs.  While the Clinton administration demands increases in student loan program funding, those funds are not granted to students according to any reasonable estimate of what the market can sustain.  Rather, this administration is more concerned about building demand for federal student loan programs than in planning for employment needs.  Consequently, higher education continues to send graduates into ridiculously glutted markets, or no markets at all. <p> 
	Is it any wonder that over 50 percent of May's graduates are still looking for the jobs they hoped their degrees would lead them to?  If we continue to ignore the obvious impact of an increasingly politically correct curriculum, staggering new and existing regulations, and poor investment planning with taxpayer dollars on the part of the Clinton administration, recent college graduates, once our brightest hope for the future, will be increasingly unwanted in the workforce.<p>

<title>What I Really Learned in School Today</title>

<h2>What I Learned at School Today</h2>
<i>Peter W. Schramm</i>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
I went to the former Soviet Union again this April. For a week I 
lectured and conducted seminars for sixty Estonian (both Estonian 
and Russian speaking) high school teachers. You would think that 
teaching the principles and practices -- with its many flaws of 
democracy to people who have been living under communist tyranny 
for five decades would be quite a chore. The truth is it is not. 
They are intelligent, hard working, and keen to learn. Besides, 
the principles of natural rights, constitutional government, 
equality of opportunity, and so on, seem to be something they 
almost instinctively understand. Their new laws reflect their 
sound understanding.<p>
I arrive back home heartened by what I have seen and the progress 
Estonia has made since my last visit. In good spirits I return to 
the classroom, my home. Sharing my excitement and what I have 
learned with my students, my thinking seems clearer and more 
deliberate. A few days later I enter my seminar on the 
theoretical difference between the French and American 
Revolutions. Surprised by seven or eight young girls in the room 
whom I had never seen, I am told that they are junior high school 
students from a nearby community in Northern Ohio who are 
visiting the University, part of a program to encourage them to 
start thinking about higher education.<p>
After the introductions, I politely ask them what they are about, 
what they are interested in, and so on. I was thinking that after 
a few minutes of civility, I would just begin my class and they 
would have an idea of what goes on at a university.<p>
But something unexpected happened. Without hesitation or 
provocation they began making pronouncements. They begin by 
telling me that they do not stand for the National Anthem, nor do 
they recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Although surprised by both 
the subject and the tone, I pursue it by asking them why. They 
assert that because both Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln (!) 
had slaves, America is profoundly corrupt, always ready and 
willing to be oppressive. That is what the flag represents. The 
situation, they maintain, is not much better now. They all feel 
oppressed, prejudice reigns, and they are in a continual state of 
depression as a result.<p>
I decide to begin with a fact. Abraham Lincoln did not own 
slaves, and was opposed to slavery his whole life. One student 
responds firmly: that is not true, our history book says that 
Lincoln owned slaves. I maintain the opposite, but not 
persuasively. Finally, I think more as a result of my position 
and age, they seem to let me have my way about this one fact. 
However, without taking a breath, she begins to maintain that it 
doesn't matter if he actually owned slaves or not because he had 
black people working for him, and that's just like slavery 
anyway, isn't it? After all, she was certain that they weren't 
well paid.<p>
Although shocked at the turn of the discussion, I regroup and 
take a different tack. I rhetorically start defending slavery. I 
tell them that I think slavery is a good thing. They are aghast, 
but I push on. I tell them that slavery has existed in virtually 
all societies for millennia. Indeed, it is only during the last 
couple of centuries or so that it has been called into question 
and actually ended, at least in the West. I ask them what the 
matter is with slavery; I think slavery is good. They are 
squirming in their seats now. I ask again, "If you think that 
slavery is wrong, tell us why it is wrong." They murmur, hem and 
haw, but no answer. I repeat my question, in different form, to 
see if they are thinking. I ask, why should one human being not 
rule another human being without his consent? Why should a person 
not treat another as I treat my cow or dog? I think I sense that 
their minds are beginning to go into first gear. Yes, I begin to 
see movement. One thirteen year old says: "You shouldn't treat 
people like dogs because they are not dogs." They are different, 
she says.<p>
All right, I say. Now there is a document, a very important 
document at the founding of the United States that uses this 
self-evident truth. What is the principle, and what document is 
it to be found in? They're quiet again. But this time I know they 
are starting to think. Definitely a movement, a lurching forward. 
After some minutes of thoughtfulness -- and some huddling on 
their part -- one of them announces, "All men are created equal, 
and it's in the Constitution."<p>
First part true; second false. What document? Another try claims 
that it's the Bill of Rights. No. They are thinking again. Two 
minutes later someone says, "The Declaration of Independence." 
All right! Now I try to articulate, by continuing to pose 
questions to them, what this means. If it is true that all -- I 
emphasize the all -- men are created equal, that none is so 
obviously superior to another as to be his natural ruler, then 
what follows this self-evident truth is that men have to agree to 
be ruled by someone else, and only for a limited period. Slavery, 
one man ruling another without the other's consent, is wrong. 
They agree. And they are much quieter than they have been. 
Although one is daydreaming, the others seem focused and even 
eager to see where we go next.<p>
Next I merely point out to them that before the founding of the 
United States of America, no political order, no country, had 
ever asserted such principles. This was the first time. We're 
back to the fact that slavery continued to exist in this new 
political order, but in understanding this practical 
imperfection, we now begin to see it at its theoretical best. 
This is the thing Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr. could 
appeal to when they wanted to bring the country back to its true 
self. They see it.<p>
The discussion is by no means finished. I get back to the Pledge 
of Allegiance and ask what it is they object to in it. After some 
false starts they maintain that they do not like to pledge to the 
flag because it is a symbol of the imperfection; of slavery, of 
taking the Indian's land, etc. I get someone to recite the 
Pledge, and she finally does so not without some assistance. I 
point out that it says that the flag stands for the Republic and 
for "liberty and justice for all." I ask if there are any 
objections to liberty and justice for all. I emphasize the all. 
Someone whispers, "No, I don't have an objection to liberty and 
justice for all." Thank you.<p>
Sometime during this discussion one of the girls announces that 
she is a mulatto. Pretending not to know what this means, I ask 
what it is and why is it important. She says that her father is 
white and mother is black, and a grandparent was an Indian. This 
is important, she maintains, because it allows her to clarify 
what she is as a person. It gives her identity. We have a long 
discussion about race that culminates in my asking, "Have you 
ever met anyone who is not a mulatto?" She sees my point. No, she 
never has met any such person. We then talk about our own 
individual characters, and how nice it would be if we were all 
judged only by the content of our character, rather than the 
color of our skin, or who our grandparents were, or where we came 
from. This way we could take responsibility for our own lives. 
Everybody is thinking now, also feeling a bit better about 
themselves and what the future may portend.<p>
We then conclude our discussion by talking more explicitly about 
what an education is, an education that should be liberating of 
the self from the reigning silly opinions one encounters. We talk 
about reading books, writing, thinking. We talk about waking up 
each morning knowing we are better human beings than we were the 
day before because we learned something that day . We have tested 
our mettle a bit, and we are better for it.<p>
These were your average, normally intelligent, young Americans. I 
liked them. I could spend time with them; they are capable of 
learning and thinking. They are capable of becoming citizens. But 
isn't it interesting that eight full grades into their public 
education, they don't seem to know very much, and what they think 
they know is almost never so. Who is responsible for this state 
of affairs? Why has it come to pass? Why do I go to Estonia to 
teach? I should stay at home, there is no travel involved, and 
much more need.<p>

<title>SCHOOL DAYS, SEX DAZE</title>

<h2>SCHOOL DAYS, SEX DAZE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>
<p>
As little Johnny or Joanie adjust to the reality of another school
year, they might find that it is a little bit tough to concentrate
on academics.
<p>
How, indeed, can children keep their mind on arithmetic when they
are exposed to sex in a big way?  From kindergarten on, many children
are learning the ABC's of sexuality, taught in a &quot;morally
neutral&quot; manner in state-mandated programs.
<p>
Despite two decades of documented failure to reduce the ravages
of teen sex, the effort to sexualize children at younger and younger
ages continues apace.  The rationale used to be &quot;sexual health&quot;
or reproductive safety.  Now, the same bad medicine is being peddled
under the rubric of  &quot;AIDS prevention.&quot;  Each year,
it gets earlier, more graphic, and increasingly incorporates &quot;alternative
lifestyles.&quot;
<p>
Parents are being cut out of the act.  In Falmouth, Massachusetts,
a court ruled recently that schools could pass out condoms even
if parents object.  In school libraries, books like <i>Heather
Has Two Mommies</i> are taking their place alongside Dr. Seuss.
 Parents who object are called &quot;bigots&quot; and &quot;religious
fanatics.&quot;
<p>
Why did much of America's educational establishment buy into the
notion that children should be taught about sex years before puberty?
 Part of the answer can be found in Indiana, at the world-famous
Kinsey Institute.  It was here, in the late 1940s, that Dr. Alfred
C. Kinsey published his famous Kinsey Report, formally known as
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>.  As revealed by Dr.
Judith A. Reisman in a 1981 paper, and further explored in the
1990 book <i>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</i>, by Dr. Reisman, Edward
W. Eichel, Dr. J. Gordon Muir and Dr. John H. Court, the Kinsey
material contains a chapter on child sexuality that has been the
basis for the view that children are sexually viable at all ages.
<p>
Graph tables (Tables 31 and 34) report data that can have been
gathered only during the sexual molestation of children from two months
to 15 years of age with climaxes recorded by the use of a &quot;second
hand or stopwatch.&quot;
<p>
In one instance, a four-year-old boy was said to have had 26 &quot;orgasms&quot;
in a 24-hour period.  Because molestation of children is illegal,
the Kinsey studies have been the only data on child sexuality
to achieve wide usage.
<p>
Efforts to open the Kinsey files on the child sex experiments
have been rebuffed by current director John Bancroft as well as
his predecessors.  How did Kinsey get this data?  Where did the
children come from?  Are their identities known today?  Who committed
these acts?  These questions remain unanswered.
<p>
Incredibly, even as the rest of the Kinsey Report became the touchstone
of the sexual revolution, the child data has largely been ignored
by the popular culture -- even though it may have had the most
far-reaching effect on academic views about child sexuality.
<p>
The Kinsey view of child sexuality, although based on criminal
abuse of children, has been promoted for years through major sex
education institutions to which Kinsey's disciples migrated. 
Taxpayers are being forced to fund the Kinseyan agenda through
federal grants to the Sex Information and Education Council of
the United States (SIECUS), which was founded by Kinsey colleagues
and disciples.
<p>
SIECUS co-founder Mary Calderone, former medical director of Planned
Parenthood, has said that the SIECUS mission is to educate society
&quot;very broadly and deeply with awareness of the vital importance
of infant and childhood sexuality.&quot;
<p>
Current SIECUS President Debra Haffner has envisioned a &quot;national
petting project,&quot; in which youngsters are taught to strip
and masturbate each other and to engage in &quot;outercourse&quot;
as a way to forestall intercourse.  This view was echoed by former
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who on the advice of SIECUS counselors,
advocated teaching children how to masturbate.
<p>
But educators are not the only intended carrier of the Kinsey
gospel.  In its blueprint document, <I>Sex Education 2000</I>,
SIECUS &quot;calls on the national media to present sexuality
as a positive aspect of the total human experience <I>at all stages
of the life cycle</I>&quot; (emphasis mine).
<p>
Apparently, Calvin Klein got the message, judging by its recent
kiddie-porn style ad campaign for jeans.  The print and TV ads
show young teens in various states of undress with camera angles
and settings that evoke classic themes of child pornography. 
Klein's defense of the lascivious commercials was vintage Kinsey/SIECUS.
In a  full-page ad in <I>The New York Times</I>, the designer
called the campaign &quot;positive&quot; because the ads convey
the idea that &quot;young people today...have a real strength
of character and independence.&quot;  Translated: You are great,
kid.  Only <I>you</I> know what is right.  Now strip for the camera.
Then get back to class.  You've still got a lot to learn.
<p>
It is time for the Kinsey Institute to open its file and solve
a 50-year-old cover-up that is still having a profound effect
on our culture.  And it is time to curb the ongoing crusade in
education and popular culture to rob our children of an irreplaceable
treasure -- their innocence.

<title>NATIONAL SURVEY FINDS THAT BLACKS FAVOR GETTING TOUGH ON 
CRIMINALS</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>NATIONAL SURVEY FINDS THAT<br>
BLACKS FAVOR GETTING<br>
TOUGH ON CRIMINALS</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Whites often blame blacks for the crime problem, and some believe
blacks have no interest in getting tough on criminals.  But new
evidence shows that the black community is very interested in
fighting crime.  After all, they are the most frequent  crime
victims, their sons go to jail more often, and they suffer most
from drug-related crime.
<p>
A new national poll sponsored by the Family Research Council found
that blacks favor get-tough policies on crime, including forcing
prisoners to work, requiring them to pay restitution, and ensuring
they are drug-free before release.
<p>
<center><h3>BENEFITS OF WORK FOR PRISONERS</h3></center>
<p>
More than eight in 10 black Americans told Voter/Consumer Research
(a Maryland-based national pollster commissioned by FRC to do
this study) that they favor requiring convicted criminals to work
while serving their sentences.  They share the commonly held view
that prison should be punishment and not a health resort for body
building.
<p>
Apparently, black citizens sense that requiring work while in
jail improves the chances that some inmates will turn away from
crime once released.
<p>
Although most Americans favor requiring criminals to work, only
9 percent of America's inmates are employed while serving time
and few inmates actually do obtain jobs.  Nonetheless, the Federal
Bureau of Prisons found that inmates who enrolled in industrial
work were substantially less likely to cause disciplinary problems in 
prison or be rearrested after release.  Similarly, research by Anne 
Piehl of Harvard University found that prisoners enrolled in high school 
classes were 10 percent less likely to be rearrested four years after
their release than those who did not participate.
<p>
<center><h3>BENEFITS FOR VICTIMS</h3></center>
<p>
The FRC survey also found that more than three out of every four
black Americans favor requiring convicted criminals to pay their
victims and their victims' families financial compensation for
the pain, suffering and economic hardship they caused.  Those
most apt to support restitution are single women and divorced
and single parents.
<p>
The women who favor restitution are in one of the most victimized
groups in America.  According to the Justice Department, the violence
victimization rates for single and divorced women are four times
greater than for married women.  Many black females find themselves
very vulnerable to crime and understandably are outspoken about
victim restitution.
<p>
But for inmates, earning money to make restitution payments to
victims can be difficult.  More might be willing to work, but
many jurisdictions have laws that do not permit prison factories
to make products that compete with the private sector.   Understandably,
law-abiding citizens often object to giving up jobs so felons
can be employed.   Some prison systems have found a way, however.
<p>
In Lockhart, Texas, 138 inmates make computer circuit boards,
eyeglasses and air conditioners.  Prisoners put their names on
waiting lists to get jobs and agree to have most of their wages
deducted to help offset the $21,000 per year cost of their incarceration
as well as to support a victims compensation fund.
<p>
Although recovering some of the billions spent on prisons is a
worthy objective, most taxpayers are not willing to sacrifice
public safety to save money.  There are alternatives to incarceration
for non-violent offenders, however.
<p>
In 1992, one-third of new prison inmates were drug offenders.
 All violent drug criminals belong behind bars.  But many were
non-violent, low level drug offenders.  For them, punishment could
include public service with frequent drug testing to ensure they
stay drug-free.  This would save prison space for the truly violent
criminals and save taxpayer dollars.
<p>
<center><h3>DRUG-TESTING MAKES SENSE</h3></center>
<p>
Black Americans know that drug abuse and crime are linked.  FRC's
survey found that 85 percent of blacks favor drug testing to insure that 
a criminal is drug-free prior to release.  In addition, more than three of 
every four blacks oppose drug legalization.
<p>
The Justice Department found that half of all state prison inmates
have used cocaine and half used some drugs during the month prior
to their current offense.  Thirty-one percent of inmates admitted
they were using drugs at the time of the offense.  Black and white
inmates are equally likely to have used a drug in the month before
their current offense.
<p>
The Justice Department's 1994 crime &quot;Sourcebook&quot; profiles
a study that drug tested arrestees in 23 cities.  Based on voluntary
and anonymous urine samples and interviews, the study found that
81 percent of men arrested in Chicago and 83 percent of women
in Manhattan, New York tested positive for drugs.  The lowest
numbers, although still remarkable, were found in Omaha, Nebraska
(54 percent) and San Antonio, Texas (42 percent).
<p>
Black Americans want law enforcement agencies to wage the drug
war vigorously and curb crime.  Lawmakers must heed the message
of the FRC's recent survey.  Laws that mandate work serve to both
punish and save criminals; restitution helps crime victims; requiring
drug-testing reduces the likelihood of criminals returning to
prey on more victims.

<TITLE>THE CASE AGAINST THE US EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>THE CASE AGAINST<BR>
THE US EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Jennifer A. Marshall and Eric Unsworth</I></CENTER>
<P>
A century and a half ago, Alexis de Tocqueville
recognized that increased centralization and bureaucratization
take away civic and individual responsibility: &quot;[A] centralized
administration is fit only to enervate the nations in which it
exists, by incessantly diminishing their local spirit.&quot;
<P>
It
isn't just fiscal crisis that necessitates the latest round of
proposed budget cuts -- our social crisis demands that the role
of the federal government be cut back.  Bureaucracies like the
US Education Department breed local apathy and mediocrity and
should be eliminated -- even if we had a budget surplus.
<P>
Once upon
a time the federal role in education was constitutional: it had
none. Things began to change in the 1930s when the New Deal brought
increasing federal involvement.  Later, under President Eisenhower,
Congress created the cabinet-level Department of  Health, Education
and Welfare.  In 1965, Lyndon Johnson rammed through Congress
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which vastly expanded
federal involvement.
<P>
Then, in 1976, candidate Jimmy Carter promised
a separate education department and received the backing of the
National Education Association (NEA) as a result.  In 1979, President
Carter, facing a liberal challenge from Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.),
set about to make good on his promise.  But there was strong opposition
from the American Federation of Teachers, from much of higher
education, and from the general public.  The AFL-CIO attacked
the idea and even the Washington Post argued that bureaucratic
costs would increase.
<P>
Marvin Stone, writing for U.S. News &amp;
World Report, articulated the fears of many Americans:  &quot;Would
the Education Department have the power to tamper with America's
traditional local control of education?  Of course it would. 
Where there is money to be given, there is the implicit responsibility
to make sure that it is spent according to the purposes of the
donors -- or else.&quot;  Though the bill establishing the department
stated emphatically that state and local control would not be
undermined, Stone was not convinced, citing a &quot;subtle schizophrenia
meandering through the legislation&quot; that revealed the authors'
true intentions. 
<P>
The US Education Department,
then, is a bureaucracy with a dubious past.  Its conception was
of doubtful legitimacy, given the strictures of the Constitution
and tradition.  The circumstances of its birth were also suspect
-- more or less a political payoff to the NEA.  And the US Education
Department has not improved American education.
<P>
Before its creation,
President Carter could point to &quot;[o]ur Nation's pluralistic
education system&quot; as &quot;the most competent and open in
the world.&quot;  No longer so.  According to former Secretary
of Education William Bennett, more than 90 percent of the students
entering US colleges today would not be admitted to institutions
of higher learning anywhere else in the world.
<P>
Meanwhile, the US
Education Department has grown into a huge bureaucratic &quot;blob,&quot;
 elbowing its way into places it does not belong.  Federal intrusiveness
reached a new height with passage of Goals 2000, which John Jennings,
director of the Center on National Education Policy, calls &quot;a
monumental movement away from local control of education&quot;
(emphasis added).
<P>
Goals 2000 promotes national education goals
and standards that override local priorities and ignore the fact
that many private entities have developed gauges for student learning.
 University of Virginia professor E.D. Hirsch has written a series
of books on cultural literacy, describing fundamentals of education
at each grade level.  The Family Research Council has published
an outline of US history entitled Let Freedom Ring.  William Bennett's
best-selling Book of Virtues is a wonderful source on America's
literary heritage.  All of these examples meet the need for a
high academic standard.
<P>
How is it possible that a program like
Goals 2000 -- quite inimical to American tradition -- has become
the manual for running local schools?  Partly through subterfuge:
 the insistent repetition that it is entirely voluntary.  Partly
because the profound crisis of American education has convinced
many that only an enormous federal initiative can cope with it.
 But this conviction is based on a fallacy:  the fallacy that
the federal government has money of its own.  Our culture of dependency
has forgotten that the only money the US Education Department
or any other federal agency has, is money that citizens have earned.
<P>
Tocqueville's
lesson has been relearned in our times:  centralization and huge
bureaucracies don't work very well. That truth swept away the
regimes of the Soviet Union and half a host of other countries.
 Finally, it's beginning to hit home, too.  
<P>
Today, no politician
would dare highlight the facts which President Carter touted in
his proposal for a US Education Department:  over 150 programs,
16,200 employees, and a budget of more than $13 billion, making
Education larger than five other departments.  Such big-government
philosophy has been rightfully stigmatized.  
<P>
Bureaucracy must
be pruned back to effect a renewal of the local spirit that Alexis
de Tocqueville praised so highly in 1835: 
<UL> I know of no people
who have established schools so numerous and efficacious, places
of public worship better suited to the wants of the inhabitants,
or roads kept in better repair.  Uniformity or permanence of design,
the minute arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative
system must not be sought for in the United States; what we find
there is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild,
is at least robust, and an existence checkered with accidents,
indeed, but full of animation and effort.</UL>
<P>It's time to disestablish
the US Education Department -- for the sake of American education,
our fiscal health, and the renewal of local spirit.

<H2>ILLEGITIMACY AND ABORTION:<BR>
TWO SIDES OF A SINGLE COIN </H2>

<P>
Republicans in Congress have a vested interest in precluding further
debate about the impact of the family cap on marginal abortion
rates.  A united front will send a stronger message to the states
that the welfare system must be radically changed and, at the
same time, will suggest more powerfully than words that neither
politicians nor the party need be hamstrung by an unequivocal
commitment to life.
<P>
By offering cash bonuses to states that reduce out-of-wedlock
births <U>and</U> abortions, the House Ways and Means committee
has seized upon an ideal opportunity to showcase pro-life consensus
-- without muting the emphasis on illegitimacy.
<P>
The incentives measure explicitly avoids reducing illegitimate
births by increasing abortions because changes in the amount of
the grant depend upon a ratio that defines <U>both</U> illegitimate
births and abortions as negative outcomes.  The current bill defines
the &quot;negative outcome ratio&quot; as the total number of
out-of-wedlock births plus abortions, divided by the total number
of births in the state in the applicable year.
<P>
 
By including abortions and out-of-wedlock births in the same total,
the measure eliminates all incentive for states to promote abortion
-- instead of abstinence and marriage -- as the means to ensure
that fewer children are born out of wedlock.  In fact, if passed,
the measure would represent the first time the federal government
has actually rewarded states for implementing policies that contribute
to a lower abortion rate.
<P>
At the same time, the incentives provision strengthens the anti-illegitimacy
provisions in the Republican bill.  The subcommittee bill, for
example, targeted only welfare mothers under the age of 18; but
the new language encourages states to reduce the illegitimacy
rate in all age groups.
<P>
One of the greatest appeals of an incentives solution is that
it explodes the myth that reducing illegitimacy and eliminating
abortion are mutually exclusive goals -- a pernicious misconception
that has been manufactured by liberal observers with a vested
interest in dividing conservative support for welfare reform.

<P>
Pro-lifers should combat that perception at all costs, short of
compromising our principles.  What we think about the right to
life has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind of
society we should institute -- and spiraling illegitimacy rates
erode our national character in ways that inevitably warp our
vision of the good society.
<P>
While we know that abortion is not an acceptable means to reduce
illegitimacy, we do not know which strategy will work best to
stem the tide of family breakdown.  James Q. Wilson argues that
&quot;the federal government cannot have a meaningful family policy
for the nation, and it ought not to try.&quot;  Codifying that
admonition, the new amendment guarantees the maximum amount of
flexibility that is consistent with a rigorous emphasis on the
reduction of illegitimacy -- and with an insistence on state accountability
for the use of federal funds.
<P>
One caveat Professor Wilson cites (and Speaker Gingrich has reiterated)
is that &quot;every major new [state] initiative must be evaluated
by independent observers operating in accordance with accepted
scientific canons.&quot;  By linking the funding mechanism to
changes in the negative outcomes ratio, the incentives provision
guarantees that states will generate objective data regarding
the number of non-marital births and abortions each fiscal year
-- and that policymakers can assess the &quot;success&quot; of
state experimentation accordingly.  By measuring &quot;outputs&quot;
independently of the dollar inputs which produce them, the amendment
ameliorates one of the worst non-market failures of the current
system.
<P>
By contrast, block grants without any semblance of accountability
threaten to turn the governors into the country's 50 biggest welfare
clients.  Lacking profit as a measure of performance, a state
welfare agency would view its budget as the proxy goal to be maximized.
 In studying the Reagan-era strategy of devolution-by-block-grant,
liberal analysts Richard Nathan and Fred Doolittle discovered
what they termed &quot;the paradox of devolution&quot;:  devolutionary
initiatives activated state and local governments to increase
their own support for programs cut at the federal level -- and,
in turn, to lobby heavily for the restoration of cuts and creeping
increases in grants.  In the end, the Reagan block grants failed
to reverse the growth of government at any level.
<P>
Nathan and Doolittle conclude: &quot;Our advice to politicians
would be for liberals to support state role enhancement in policymaking
and administration in conservative periods.&quot;  The advice
should give conservatives pause before they promote schemes that
give unfettered latitude to the states without also eliminating
all federal funding.
<P>
Short of radical devolution, the best alternative is a measure
that will turn the current incentives structure on its head. 
By rerouting federal dollars to reward the reduction of illegitimacy
rather than the expansion of bureaucracy, an incentives amendment
models a useful mechanism for revising federal-state relations
as well as accomplishing other worthwhile policy goals.

<title>NEW WELFARE POLL SHOWS STRONG SUPPORT FOR COMBATTING 
ILLEGITIMACY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>NEW WELFARE POLL SHOWS<br>
STRONG SUPPORT FOR<br>
COMBATTING ILLEGITIMACY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
<p>
Opposition runs strong and deep to &quot;increasing a welfare
mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of
wedlock,&quot; according to a new national poll commissioned by
the Family Research Council.
<p>
Two-thirds (66 percent) of the 1,000 Americans surveyed said they
&quot;strongly&quot; oppose such increases.  Another 18 percent
said they &quot;somewhat&quot; oppose welfare benefit increases
for illegitimacy.  Only 13 percent said these increases were justified.
<p>
These findings should allay any doubts Congressional Republicans
may have about whether the public supports their &quot;family
cap&quot; proposal to cease welfare benefit increases when women
bear additional children out of wedlock.  The &quot;family cap&quot;
is a central feature of the welfare reform legislation House and
Senate GOP leaders will be sending soon to the President.
<p>
Interestingly, support for the family cap among rank-and-file
pro-lifers is at least as strong as support from other Americans.
 Among those who &quot;strongly&quot; favor prohibitions against
abortion, 70 percent &quot;strongly&quot; support the family cap,
and another 16 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; support such an approach.
 (Some pro-life leaders have expressed concern that the &quot;family
cap&quot; might increase abortions, while others have argued that
curbing out-of-wedlock pregnancy will lower the number of abortions
long term since most abortions are to unmarried women.)
<p>
The FRC poll also found that Americans are more hopeful about
efforts to combat illegitimacy than about &quot;workfare&quot;
strategies.
<p>
By a margin of roughly two-to-one (64 percent to 33 percent),
Americans say &quot;getting young people to delay having children
until they are able to support themselves and a family&quot; is a more 
attainable goal than &quot;getting single mothers with few job skills into 
jobs that will pay them enough to support themselves and their children.&quot;
<p>
This does not mean Americans oppose workfare.  In fact, fully
90 percent say welfare recipients should have to work for their
benefits.
<p>
But the poll results do suggest that Americans expect policymakers
to give at least as much attention to a preventative, anti-illegitimacy
strategy as they do to a remedial, workfare strategy.
<p>
And should there not be enough &quot;workfare&quot; jobs to go
around, most Americans believe welfare mothers of preschool children
should be permitted to go to the back of the line.
<p>
Eighty-two percent say preschool moms should be the &quot;last&quot;
group required to work for benefits.  Most say &quot;mothers of
school-aged children&quot; and (especially) &quot;fathers of dependent
children&quot; should have to meet work requirements first.
<p>
These findings suggest that significant increases in day care
spending are not needed to complement &quot;workfare&quot; requirements,
since neither House would require states to provide jobs for all
welfare recipients.
<p>
The FRC poll was conducted in mid-October by Voter/Consumer Research,
a research firm based in Bethesda, Maryland.  The poll surveyed
1,000 randomly-selected Americans.  It has a margin for error
of plus or minus three percent.

<TITLE>FAMILIES NEED TAX FREEDOM</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>FAMILIES NEED TAX FREEDOM<BR>

<P>
Now that May
6 has finally arrived, families across America can breathe a sigh
of relief.  For May 6 is Tax Freedom Day, the day when Americans
cease working to support The Tax Man and start working to support
their families.
<P>
That's right, when you calculate how many days
one would have to work to pay off all the taxes owed by the average
taxpayer, the Tax Foundation in Washington reports that one would
not be free to keep their own earnings until May 6.
<P>
 But if the
new Republican House of Representatives has its way, tax freedom
will come sooner in the future.
<P>
The House recently passed a major
income tax cut that was hailed as the &quot;crown jewel&quot;
of its Contract with America.  The tax cut bill had a number of
 important pro-family features -- including a provision to make
it easier to claim home office deductions and a provision to write
off expenses associated with adopting a child.  But no provision
in the bill is as important as the bill's centerpiece:  a new
$500 children's tax credit for taxpaying parents.
<P>
The $500 children's
tax credit is designed to address the steady erosion in per-child
tax benefits that has occurred over the last four decades.  This
erosion in per-child benefits is part of the reason the average
family today sends Uncle Sam nearly a quarter of every dollar
earned, whereas the average family in 1950 sent only two-cents
of every dollar earned to the federal government.  And it is the
chief reason several national commissions -- including the 1986
White House Working Group on the Family and the 1991 National
Commission on Children -- made pro-family tax relief their top
policy recommendation.
<P>
  Unfortunately, the fate of the House GOP's
tax cut bill is very uncertain in the Senate.  Several key Republican
Senators -- most especially, Finance Committee Chairman Robert
Packwood (R-OR) -- have publicly raised doubts about tax cuts
in general, and the per-child tax credit in particular.  Others,
like Senators Dan Coats (R-IN) and Rod Grams (R-MN), have pledged
to take a $500 tax credit proposal to the Senate floor if Packwood
blocks committee passage of a bill patterned after the House GOP
Contract.
<P>
The fact that parents need tax relief can be seen not
just in the economic statistics showing a dramatic rise in the
tax burden facing Americans, but also in the
cultural statistics William Bennett publishes showing a dramatic
decline in the various indices of family well-being.  
<P>
To be sure,
pro-family tax relief cannot single-handedly solve these problems.
 Pro-family tax relief cannot cause husbands to love their wives
or children to respect their parents.  It cannot clean up filthy
TV or remove child predators from neighborhood streets.  It cannot
improve the quality of America's schools.
<P>
In short, pro-family
tax relief cannot, by itself, magically solve the various social
problems facing America's families, neighborhoods, and communities.
<P>
But
pro-family tax-relief will make it easier for families to thrive
by reducing economic stress on financially-strapped parents. 
It will make it easier for time-starved parents to monitor their
children's TV viewing habits and after-school play activities
and educational studies.
<P>
In essence, pro-family tax relief will
empower parents to address many family needs that only they can
meet.  As such, pro-family tax relief is a useful complement to
the cuts in wasteful government and social programs. 
<P>
 Hopefully,
the full Senate will soon adopt a $500 tax credit for children.
 Such a credit is needed, if Tax Freedom Day is to come any sooner
in the years ahead.

<title>UN THREATENS NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY</title>

<p>
<h2>UN THREATENS<br>
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gary L. Bauer and Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
The operational philosophy and military role of the United Nations
have radically changed.  In the UN's first five years it launched
only two peacekeeping missions, but since the fall of the Soviet
Union the UN has mounted 19 operations involving more than 70,000
blue-helmeted soldiers.  Last year these operations cost $3.6
billion.  The U.S. was assessed $1.2 billion and the Clinton Administration
spent another $1.7 billion for U.S. military participation in
UN missions.  Today, thousands of American soldiers wear UN blue
helmets in 10 countries ranging from Haiti to Lebanon to the former
Yugoslav republics.
<p>
Indeed, the UN has experienced a renaissance with the unexpected
fall of the Soviet Union, rising from near impotence in the early
1980s to worldwide peacemaker in 1995.
<p>
Harvard fellow Ronnie Dugger has called for the creation of a
United Nations military force composed of volunteer peacekeepers
financed by global citizen-members who pay dues and carry citizenship
cards.  If that doesn't fly, Dugger told <i>New York Times</i>
readers in June, perhaps nongovernmental organizations like Greenpeace
could become citizen-members of their own international agency
and elect a world parliament to pass and enforce laws through
a voluntary military force. 
<p>
Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned the UN as an organization dealing
with traditional inter-state aggression rather than the type of
internal conflicts that now dominate its agenda.  But the 50-year-old
organization is transitioning to the &quot;new world order.&quot;
 That change is echoed by UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
 who has issued <I>An Agenda for Peace</I> suggesting a greatly
expanded UN peacemaking role.  He endorses the principle of &quot;universal&quot;
sovereignty:  &quot;Underlying the rights of the individual and
the rights of peoples is a dimension of universal sovereignty
that resides in all humanity and provides all peoples with legitimate
involvement in issues affecting the world as a whole.&quot;
<p>
Boutros-Ghali has used this concept to sanction UN efforts in
Somalia: 
<P>
&quot;The magnitude of the human tragedy constitutes a threat
to international peace and security.&quot;  This justified the
world body's intervention in the sovereign affairs of a nation-state
without invitation.  The same happened in Iraq after the Gulf
War. 
<p>
The 1990 invasion of Kuwait posed a classic situation for the
UN, a case of aggression in which the armies of one state crossed
international borders to invade another.  Desert Shield/Storm
was a successful international effort to expel the invaders and
restore the sovereignty of Kuwait.  The follow-on 1991 UN-sanctioned
incursion into northern Iraq to protect the Kurds (Operation Provide
Comfort), however, was the first time the Security Council authorized
the use of force to address strictly internal affairs of a member
state.  Thus began a dangerous new era for UN &quot;peacemaking.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Loose constructionists of the UN Charter believe the existence
of such problems justifies expanding UN jurisdictions to deal
with them,&quot; says former U.S. Ambassador to the UN Jeane Kirkpatrick,
who warns, &quot;We are slipping into practices which enhance
only the power of the strongest.  Is this what we want to do?
 Someone had better think through this question -- and soon.&quot;
<p>
But Boutros-Ghali awards supremacy of rights to individuals and
groups within countries.  He argues that &quot;the centuries-old
doctrine of absolute and exclusive sovereignty no longer stands.&quot;
 Outside forces, then, do have a right to trump national sovereignty.
<p>
The UN's &quot;right&quot; to intervene in the sovereign affairs
of a country leaves all member countries, including the U.S.,
vulnerable to having their own sovereign territory compromised.
  For example, the next time Korean Americans bear the brunt of
a Los Angeles riot, the South Korean government could ask the
UN to intervene to protect its citizens' rights.   It couldn't
happen now because the U.S. would veto the move procedurally and
militarily.  But it could happen in the future, especially if
the UN has a standing military governed by a liberal world community.
<p>
There is no shortage of potential Bosnia-like situations on the
horizon.  The conscious choices that the international community
makes about these situations will decide the new order.  We can
only hope that the UN will avoid the temptation to resolve these
problems with the sword.
<p>
Meanwhile, the UN's military focus has been growing.  The UN Department
of Peacekeeping has expanded from a staff of 23 to more than 350
with a modern situation center, staffed 24 hours a day, linked
electronically to all UN hot spots.  It has a standby system to
tap troops and equipment from 185 member nations and it has established
a base in Italy to stockpile equipment like armored personnel
carriers for rapid deployment to peacekeeping missions.  
<p>
There have been calls for a standing UN Army.  Former French President
Francois Mitterand endorsed the creation of a &quot;UN Legion.&quot;
 This brigade-size unit of thousands  would be available for immediate
deployment when the Security Council authorizes military action.
 A &quot;UN Legion&quot; has been discussed at the U.S. Army Peacekeeping
Institute, where representatives from various U.S. government
agencies met with UN representatives in 1993 and 1994.  Anticipating
future trends, the U.S. Army recently published a field manual
entitled &quot;Peace Operations&quot; outlining relationships
with the UN and including extracts from the UN Charter.
<p>
Last year the Clinton Administration issued Presidential Decision
Directive-25 on reforming multilateral peacekeeping operations.
 This was supposed to make them more selective and more effective.
 The directive claims, &quot;The U.S. does not support a standing
UN Army, nor will we earmark specific U.S. military units for
participation in UN operations.&quot;  
<p>
Despite this assurance, White House Press Secretary Michael McCurry
said President Clinton supports America's continued UN involvement
and Madeleine K. Albright, U.S. Permanent Representative to the
United Nations, told Congress, &quot;The Clinton Administration
believes very deeply in the potential of the UN system.&quot;
<p>
The Clinton Administration has overseen the UN's radical transformation,
but some Americans don't share the optimism.  Presidential hopeful
Senator Bob Dole said, &quot;It is high time we rein in UN peacekeeping,
which is out of control.&quot;  Senator Jesse Helms called the
UN &quot;the nemesis of millions of Americans.&quot;  
<p>
We must heed the warning signs.  History teaches that the acquisition
of military power traditionally has been the first step toward
establishing governance over a territory.  Coupling the UN's changing
military strength with the new operational philosophy favoring
individual over state sovereignty sends a warning flare that no
liberty loving people can afford to ignore.

<title>ADVICE TO BEIJING CONFEREES</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>ADVICE TO BEIJING CONFEREES:<br>
GET A PROMISE KEEPER TO<br>
HELP DO DISHES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
Forget the Enjoli Woman.  The delegates to the UN's Fourth World
Conference on Women taking place in Beijing, China aren't interested
in proving that they &quot;can bring home the bacon <I>and</I>
fry it up in a pan.&quot;
<P>
According to Grete Berget, who heads the Norwegian delegation,
the conferees are interested instead in finding effective ways
to &quot;get men to share working at home.&quot;
<P>
I've got a little tip for Ms. Berget and other delegates looking
for men willing to help with the vacuuming and the dishes:  go
to church.
<P>
Now, that may sound like strange advice.  And it's probably not
the kind of hint most Beijing delegates would consider helpful.
<P>
But a recent study by sociologist Gary Hansen at the University
of Kentucky found that the men most apt to help their wives with
household chores are orthodox Christians.
<P>
That's right, men who strongly believe the Bible is &quot;God's
word&quot; and &quot;the answer to all important human problems&quot;
spend more time than other men doing household chores like cooking,
cleaning, and dishwashing.
<P>
Lest anyone get the wrong impression, these Christians do not
believe in gender blending.  In fact, Hansen reports they are
more likely than others to support traditional breadwinner-homemaker
arrangements and to believe young children suffer when Mom is
employed outside the home.
<P>
Yet, orthodox Christian men aren't afraid to roll up their sleeves
and help out around the house.  According to Hansen, they devote
more time to household chores than do less-orthodox and non-orthodox
men.  
<P>
That the women who get the most help around the house are married
to men who attend churches that extol the virtues of male leadership
seems rather surprising.  
Surprising, that is, until one considers that the Bible instructs
men to mimic the leadership style of the One who said He came
&quot;not to be served, but to serve.&quot;  And who proved it
by doing things like washing others' dirty feet.
<P>
Challenging men to be &quot;servant leaders&quot; is one of the
main purposes of Promise Keepers, a Christian men's organization
which has hosted a series of stadium-packed conferences this summer
that have attracted more than 600,000 male attendees.  Several
of these gatherings have been picketed by activists from the National
Organization for Women (NOW) -- a fact which David Blankenhorn
of the Institute for American Values finds curious.
<P>
&quot;The more I listen to Promise Keepers' message -- that men
should be faithful to their wives and involved in their children's
lives and willing to express emotion and quick to admit mistakes
-- the more I hear the echoes of those frustrated housewives who
gave 1960s feminism much of its animating spirit,&quot; he says.
<P>
This is not to say that Promise Keepers is singing from one of
Betty Freidan's old song sheets.  But it is to say that their
tune is at least similar enough that 1990s women tired of coming
home from work to loads of laundry ought to at least give a listen.
<P>
Indeed, Hansen's research findings bring to mind the mid-1980s
song by the B-52s in which Kate Pierson expresses longings for
&quot;someone who's <I>heaven sent</I>, someone to help pay rent,
someone to share dreams and wishes, someone to help me do the
dishes.&quot;       
<P>
It is possible that the delegates in Beijing will stumble across
new ways to make men more sensitive to women's needs.  But it
isn't likely.  
<P>
Tensions between the sexes -- and disputes about housework --
date back to, well, Biblical times.  And throughout history, the
only way these tensions and disputes have been eased consistently
is to challenge members of both sexes to lay aside scorekeeping
and serve one another.
<P>
Grete Berget and the other delegates attending the Beijing conference
are right when they say that many men today are failing to serve
their wives.  But if the University of Kentucky study is any indication,
the answer to this problem is less likely to come from the UN
conference in Beijing than from the Promise Keeper rallies sweeping
America. 
<P>
Praise the Lord and pass the Palmolive.

<title>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP IN CONFERENCE</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP<br>
IN CONFERENCE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
<p>
As the conference committee convenes to resolve differences between
the House and Senate welfare bills, the defining issue will be
the family cap.
<p>
A modest first step, if passed by the Congress, the cap would
simply deny a federally-funded increase in the cash benefits to
mothers who bear additional children while on welfare.  A federally-imposed
cap places no restriction on Medicaid, food stamps, and housing
-- or the use of state funds.  States are fully free to fund additional
cash benefits with state money.  Indeed, states are free to use
federal block grant money to fund vouchers for goods and services,
just so long as they freeze the dollar amount of the AFDC check.
 This &quot;restriction&quot; is scant in proportion to the scale
of devastation wrought by illegitimacy's open-ended draw on the
Treasury.
<p>
In many instances, added cash benefits have reduced the birth
father to no more than a passing stranger, and marriage is teetering
on the brink of anachronism in communities with a high concentration
of welfare recipients.  To the extent that the state provides
ready alternatives, marriage, work, and self-sufficiency will
inevitably seem less hallowed, less than necessary.
<p>
The purpose of the family cap is not to reduce births per se,
but to restore a sense of personal responsibility by insisting
that families on welfare live by the same values and confront
exactly the same choices as the general population.  Lowering
our expectations of a woman on welfare and the father of her child
is no different from lowering our estimation of their capability
-- implying that they are a different, less human sort than the
rest of us who can and do live by the rules.
<p>
Government policy that dumbs down the standards for welfare recipients
so that &quot;measuring up&quot; no longer has any content, or
makes any economic sense, is unjust.  Women on welfare should
have equal opportunity to follow the playbook that for centuries
has been the surest guarantor of human happiness.  What Edmund
Burke wrote long ago is truer today: &quot;We know that we have
made no discoveries, and we think that no discoveries are to be
made, in morality.&quot;  Yet, we perpetuate a welfare system that makes it 
harder for men and women to pursue virtuous living.
<p>
The argument for the family cap rests not on value premises alone,
but on certain assumptions about human nature and social causation
that are empirically verifiable.  And the most recent data from
New Jersey's experiment with the family cap provides evidence
that proponents of the cap are indeed correct in their assumptions.
<p>
The formal evaluation study at Rutgers University has found no
significant difference in the rate of births to women in the 
&quot;experimental&quot; group, who are subject to the restriction on 
additional cash benefits, and women in the &quot;control&quot; group, who 
are exempt from the cash limitation.
<p>
Contrary to press reports, the null difference between the experimental
and control birth rates does NOT imply that the cap has had no
impact on births to welfare mothers.  The correct explanation
for the null difference is that births dropped within both groups
after the new policy took effect.  The family cap, in other words,
has had an even larger and more dramatic impact on births than
expected.
<p>
The most plausible explanation for the cap's success is that the
change in policy sent a clear moral signal that was at least as
important an aspect of the policy as the actual restriction on
cash benefits.  Public discussion of the ideas and values motivating
the law reached women in both the &quot;treatment&quot; and &quot;control&quot;
groups, thus triggering the observed decline in births.
<p>
Critics of the cap may question whether a public relations campaign
promoting personal responsibility could be sufficiently forceful
to obviate the need for changes in current welfare policy.  Those
critics forget that laws are indeed moral signaling devices, that
policies cannot belie principles, and that governments cannot
instill a sense of responsibility <I>and </I>provide material
support for the alternative at the same time.  A public relations
campaign is not sufficient precisely because welfare obviates
the need for personal responsibility.
<p>
If the family cap derives its power from a larger cultural context,
publicizing the moral reasoning behind the change in law, clearly
all institutions in the community must redouble their efforts
to send strong, unequivocal messages advocating right living.
 Perhaps the most compelling argument for the cap is that it is
a symbolic first attempt to begin scaling back the government
programs that have eroded the strength of the character-forming
institutions -- the families, schools, and churches -- by negating
their functions.
<p>
Conferees who vote against the cap will squander a golden opportunity
to begin replenishing our nation's moral capital, one heart at
a time.

<title>GENDER BENDERS IN BEIJING</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<p>
<h2>GENDER BENDERS IN BEIJING</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>
<p>
The &quot;gender feminist&quot; agenda embodied within the Platform
for Action of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women
is a direct attack on the family as we know it.  The conference,
which is to be held in Beijing, China, from September 4-15, 1995,
purports to advance women's rights, but the Platform itself reveals
a clear intention to promote &quot;gender feminism.&quot;
<P>
The Beijing document -- the text of which was heavily influenced
by Bella Abzug and other radical feminists -- includes over 200
references to &quot;gender&quot; in various contexts, i.e., &quot;gender
equality,&quot; &quot;mainstreaming a gender perspective,&quot;
&quot;gender diversity,&quot; etc.  However, &quot;husband&quot;
and &quot;wife&quot; are nowhere to be found in the 121-page document,
and the terms &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;family&quot; are up
for debate against the proposed substitutes of &quot;caretaker&quot;
and &quot;household&quot; respectively.  Clearly, the effort to
change the semantics associated with the family is the first step
in altering the way the world thinks about the family.
<P>
But why are gender feminists so intent on redefining the family?
 Because gender feminists believe that the husband-wife relationship
is inherently oppressive to women and that the traditional family
propagates this &quot;oppression.&quot;  Radical feminist Shulamith
Firestone wrote in 1970 that &quot;the heart of women's oppression
is her [sic] childbearing and child rearing roles.&quot;
<P>
Thus, gender feminists envision a brave new world in which reproduction
is <I>socially-constructed</I>, rather than biologically-determined.
 Firestone argues that &quot;the elimination of sexual classes
requires the revolt of the underclass (women) and seizure of control
of reproduction, restoration to women of ownership of their own
bodies, as well as feminine control of human fertility....so that
the end goal [is]...not just the elimination of male privilege
but of the sex distinction itself; genital differences between
human beings would no longer matter culturally.&quot;  Moreover,
feminist Alison Jagger asserts that &quot;the radical feminist
equality means not just equality under the law nor even equality
in satisfaction of basic needs; rather it means that women, like
men, should not have to bear children....  The destruction of
the biological family, never envisioned by Freud, will allow the
emergence of new women and men, different from any people who
have previously existed.&quot;
<P>
That the gender feminists have left their fingerprints on the
Beijing document is obvious.  From the document's emphasis on
&quot;reproductive rights&quot; (i.e., abortion and 
unlimited contraceptive availability, even to minors without parental
consent) to promoting &quot;gender equality&quot; and the mainstreaming
of a &quot;gender perspective,&quot; the document clearly seeks
to subvert the traditional family.
<P>
In all this, the United Nations has done nothing to defend natural
families.  When asked to define the term &quot;gender&quot; during
a preparatory meeting for the conference, the UN rejected the
proposal that &quot;gender&quot; should be defined as the biological
classifications of male and female.  The UN instead settled on
a non-descript, ineffectual definition that gender is to be understood
in &quot;its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;  While the UN did
not embrace the feminist definition of &quot;socially-constructed
roles which society assigns to men and women&quot; (i.e., a spectrum
of genders, including heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and
transsexuals), it has left the door open to varying interpretations
of the term.
<P>
But despite the gender feminist agenda being incorporated into
the Beijing document, despite the Clinton Administration's backing
of the document, and despite the UN's dullness, the natural family
will not so easily succumb.  The crafters of the document, in
their attempt to advance a new worldview, still have much with
which to contend.
<P>
Biology, for instance.  Men and women differ biologically.  That
is a universally-recognized fact, not a socially-constructed idea.
 It is no wonder, then, that transsexual Kate Bornestein laments
the fact that &quot;the current gender system relies heavily on
everyone's agreement that it's inflexible.&quot;
<P>
Second, despite the rantings of radical feminists who say that
motherhood equals oppression, women worldwide will still freely
choose to bear and rear their children.  Some would even say that
mothering is a <I>natural</I> instinct within women, which is
why feminist Simone de Beauvoir believes that &quot;no woman should
be authorized to stay at home and raise her children...because
if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one.&quot;
<P>
Third, despite their success in infiltrating the Beijing document
with their terminology, gender feminists must still hurdle many
other language &quot;barriers.&quot;  After all, Webster's dictionary
still defines &quot;gender&quot; as &quot;the fact or condition
of being a male or a female human being....&quot;  Moreover, most
languages have no equivalent of the English term &quot;gender.&quot;
 Thus, even in the Beijing document, the phrase &quot;gender justice&quot;
is rendered in French as &quot;l'egalite entre les hommes et les
femmes,&quot; and in Spanish, the phrase &quot;gender-sensitive
initiatives&quot; translates to &quot;iniciativas que tengan en
cuenta las diferencias entre hombres y mujeres.&quot;
<P>
These gender feminists cannot hope to overthrow the family by
simply tinkering with a UN document.  But even with regard to
this UN document, families -- and women -- worldwide are seeing
to it that this radical feminist agenda will not be thrust upon
them without a fight.

<h2>STAY MARRIED,<br>
GO TO CHURCH,<br>
LIVE LONGER. NO SWEAT.</h2>

<p>
If you want to live longer, lose weight.  So says a widely-publicized
study recently published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>.
<p>
But there's actually another, more effective way to help increase
your own, your spouse's, and your <I>children's</I> longevity,
without the sweat or the bland food.  It's staying married.
<p>
According to a 70-year prospective study recently reported in
the <I>American Journal of Public Health</I> and the <I>American
Psychologist</I>, either the breakup of one's own marriage or
the divorce of one's parents reduced the average life span of
a group of 1,500 gifted children studied throughout their lifetimes.
<p>
That's right.  Divorce may be hazardous to your health.  Men and
women who at some point in time went through a divorce, even if
they remarried, had a 40 percent greater risk of premature death
than those who were steadily married.  Those who did not remarry
fared even worse.  Men who remained divorced or separated were
120 percent more likely to face earlier death.  Among women, the
risk jumped 80 percent.
<p>
Dr. David B. Larson, president of the National Institute for Healthcare
Research (NIHR) in Rockville, MD, recently released an extensive
research report that further details the impact of divorce on
health.  Among other findings, Dr. Larson found that divorced
people were more likely to be afflicted with terminal cancer,
three times more likely to commit suicide, and among men, twice
as likely to die prematurely from cardiovascular disease than
their married counterparts.  In fact, divorced men who didn't
smoke had only a slightly lower risk of dying from cancer than
married men who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day.
<p>
While the threat of premature mortality might not weigh heavily
in the minds of couples who are seeking a divorce, the startling news
that their divorce might shorten the lives of their <I>children</I>
may give reason for pause.  The <I>American Journal of Public
Health</I> study found that when parental divorce occurred before
the children reached age 21, the children's risk of mortality
increased by 44 percent.  Moreover, children whose parents divorced
were more likely to experience marital breakup themselves.  But
even after controlling for the dissolution of one's own marriage,
parental divorce during one's childhood was still a significant
predictor of premature mortality.  Perhaps the once oft-quoted
advice of staying together &quot;for the children's sake&quot;
should be heeded more seriously.
<p>
Interestingly, the negative outcomes associated with growing up
in a broken home can be offset by religious faith.  Dr. Larson
of NIHR found that religious commitment not only decreases the
likelihood of divorce, but it also predicts greater satisfaction
in marriage.  Furthermore, several other studies have confirmed
the positive relationship between religious commitment and increased
longevity.
<p>
A study of an elderly population published in the <I>American
Journal of Epidemiology</I> found that the less religious had
mortality levels twice as high as those of the more religious
-- even after controlling for age, marital status, education,
race, gender, the person's health, and previous hospitalizations.
 Moreover, according to a 10-year follow-up of 2,700 persons in
another epidemiological health study, increased church attendance
was the only social factor that effectively decreased mortality
rates in women.
<p>
While divorce is clearly a major public health issue, deterring
divorce is admittedly a hard thing to do.  But it's far from impossible.
 After all, weight loss is a hard sell, too.  And yet, Americans
everywhere will put down their Big Macs, call Weight Watchers,
and join a health club so that they can lose weight and live longer.
<p>
Who knows?  A whole new market to promote marriage might burgeon.
 TV shows could portray more married couples and fewer divorces;
marriage counselors could advertise themselves as marriage <I>and</I>
life savers; warning labels could even be adhered to marriage
certificates reading, &quot;Breaking this covenant may be hazardous
to your health.&quot;  If nothing else, these findings do give
new meaning to the term &quot;life-long&quot; marriage.

<h2>WATCHING IS NOT OKAY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>
What happened to Dr. Kevorkian as he worked in steel rooms cutting
into the last remains of someone's family? What happened to the
pathologist whose job it was to determine the way death came --
rather than to be the cause of that death?
<p>
What kind of thoughts entered his mind as he saw the signature
of death? Did he wish he could have been there? 
<p>
And then later, this scavenger of death, this man whose entire
living depended on the deaths of others, later his thoughts turned,
where?  To, &quot;I can be there&quot; or &quot;I can be the cause&quot;?
<p>
Recently Dr. Kevorkian was involved in another woman's death,
but this time, she wasn't so sick.  Physicians seemed to have
halted the decline toward death. Until Dr. Kevorkian.
<p>
And so we find in this drama that the reality was that the true
state of this woman's health was her mental health. And she was
abandoned to a voyeuristic death, Dr. Kevorkian having helped
her decide that her life wasn't worth living.
<p>
Or was it?
<p>
No one seems to remember that the first duty to one's depressed
friend -- to a fellow human being -- is not to speed them to death,
but to cheer them up and help them find the strength to go on.
We are inspired by the lovely wife of Christopher Reeve who helps
him see all that remains in life for him to accomplish.
<p>
But today they seem rare, for we live in a culture that glamorizes
death.
<p>
Recently my husband and I drove by a prominent theater in our
nation's capitol, and on the marquee every movie hawked a vision
of death. <I>Copy Cat</I> and the thrill of serial killing; <I>Devil
in a Blue Dress</I> and the fun of blackmail and betrayal, <I>Dead
Presidents</I> and the joy of a horrific war experience followed
by unemployment; <I>7</I> and the beauty of twisted 
justice; even a <I>Vampire in Brooklyn</I> and the spice of the
&quot;undead&quot; and their appetites.
<p>
But for those of us weaned on shootings and our &quot;right&quot;
to bad taste, no mere knowledge of death will do any longer for
some.
<p>
We can't know -- in Alfred Hitchcock fashion -- that someone in
the next room just left this mortal coil. Now we must see it,
slow motion, full color, <I>Pulp Fiction</I> frame by frame, until
we're so hardened to the sight of human suffering, that the nausea
rape, torture, murder and old fashioned fear just don't do much
for us anymore.
<p>
But blood isn't a big screen phenomena. If the money is not in
the budget for movies, there is always television.
<p>
One recent Friday night, free speech and hardened sensibilities
served up battery and slow death in prison on the <I>X-files</I>;
murderous people killing enemies by slow death by maggots on <I>American
Gothic</I>, and various forms of shootings, stabbings and stalkings
-- and that is without all those really seamy &quot;true-to-life&quot;
cop dramas where we not only get to see brain-like matter splatter,
we are exposed to portly policemen in the shower, making washing
decisions on a national screen despite what modesty and good taste
would indicate.
<p>
Having been a reporter who covered the court and police beats,
I can say first hand that  what is missing from these true to
life dramas is real life. Police are usually people working hard,
thinking of their kids, trying to find out what really happened
at the scene of a tragedy. They're not soap operas in blues. They
live out the unglamorous reality of hard work and dignified people.
<p>
So where does this leave America? Where does this lead the world?
Into the valley of the shadow of death, into the imagined worlds
of men like Dr. Kevorkian, who seems to believe that just because
he can invent a machine that kills he should be allowed to ...
and allowed to watch.
<p>
Ironically, when Dr. Kevorkian kills, the media responds by putting
on &quot;reasoned&quot; discussions of euthanasia, asking bubble-headed
bleach blonde questions about the &quot;right to die&quot; rather
than seeing that there is little difference between an elderly
man with a death machine, and kids killing kids with baseball
bats &quot;to watch.&quot;
<p>
News stories show us pictures of &quot;real life&quot; dramas
of children killing children to &quot;see what it was like&quot;
or to see a real murder. Children throwing tiny victims from high-rise
apartments. Children raping, stabbing and shooting. Life is worth
less than tennis shoes or jackets, and people have less worth
than laboratory rats.
<p>
Groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals advocate
using coma patients and those classed as brain dead for medical
experiments rather than the kinds of creatures that civilizations
have historically understood to be of less worth than children.
And in a survey I heard about, some people don't seem to understand
that if a child and a dog were drowning, the child should be the
first saved.
<p>
Out of what hole did Dr. Kevorkian crawl? Where did his passion
for death come from? In part, one wonders, from the notion that accidental 
life isn't worth the DNA it haphazardly &quot;evolved&quot; on.
<p>
From the deliberate rejection of founding ideals like the holding
of truths to be self evident, that all people are created equal
&quot;and they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable
rights, among these are life ...&quot;
<p>
Human life ... each one unique, valuable, irreplaceable. Each
person with something to offer. And it does not have to be the
same things ... nor even the same abilities to walk or think or
paint.
<p>
A society that loses the sanctity of life has nothing left to
share but death. If there are no reliable standards of right and
wrong, then there is no reason to persevere or overcome -- if
you don't want to. No reason for people to reach out to you in
your darkest moment if they don't feel like it.  If we have no
common dignity then we share, at least, a common end. And so our
culture seems to revel in death, both by  murderous flashing images
on a screen and the real live voyeurism of thugs and Dr. Kevorkian.
<p>
Somewhere along the line, Dr. Kevorkian seems to have decided
that he wanted to watch. In a civil society, the answer to that
is, &quot;No,&quot; and  &quot;Get some help.&quot;
<p>
Until we determine to embrace human life as the sacred and valuable
thing that it is, unique in all the world, and determine that
we will work together to enrich the human experience in practical
and real ways, we will have nothing in common but the fear and
fascination we have with the only thing we know for sure  -- the
fact that we will all die.
<p>
But there is more to life than death ... at least, there should
be.

<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear that the cap could promote an
increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates who support the measure
share both this concern and the long-term goal of driving abortions
to the point of zero.  Unlike the more conventional conflict between
pro-life and pro-choice groups, pro-life differences over the
family cap represent a dispute over means, not ends, that is complicated
by the absence of any hard data from actual experimentation.
<P>
Such differences lend themselves to reasoned discussion and, ultimately,
resolution far more easily than the larger debate for and against
abortion rights, which Laurence Tribe has characterized as a &quot;clash
of absolutes.&quot;  While the choice between life and death cannot
be accurately described as a &quot;clash of absolutes,&quot; the
phrase does capture usefully the impossibility of winning adherents
to the pro-life cause without first changing hearts, one at a
time.  We should forfeit no battles, but neither can we expect
to win the war against abortion on demand without a comprehensive,
long-term strategy to develop and sustain a pro-life consensus.
<P>
While a pro-life position must be part of the agenda for national
renewal, opposition to abortion must be only one plank of the
pro-life platform.  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on
demand requires a transformation of the political and moral culture
as well as a reform of law.  Reducing illegitimacy is the <I>sine
qua non</I> of moral reconstruction; and right-to-life activists
should realize that, as one of the few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy
arsenal, the family cap not only serves their cause in the long
term but deserves their active support in the short term.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap would be the number
of lives saved in the short term -- if such a number could be
approximated in the future as it cannot be now.  The question
itself is a red herring because it obscures the larger and more
important 
issue: &quot;What constitutes progress toward ending altogether
the culture that finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
To increase the logic and appeal of pro-life arguments to a significant
number of people who do not now see the moral force in such arguments,
we must begin the task of rebuilding civil institutions that will
nourish human souls and liberate them to fulfill their full potential.
 Such an ambitious project will require a multifaceted strategy,
and eliminating the welfare benefits that encourage illegitimacy
must be a key component of that strategy.
<P>
The real fault-line in the current welfare debate is not between
pro-life social conservatives and economic libertarians.  Rather,
the crucial dispute pits those who think relimiting government
is a prerequisite for moral reform against those who believe that
the size of government bears no relation to cultural decay.
<P>
Most of the outspoken pro-life opponents of welfare reform do
not deny that reducing illegitimacy will reduce abortions.  Instead,
they deny that welfare subsidies increase illegitimacy.  The blame
belongs exclusively, they say, to &quot;the sex-drenched culture.&quot;
<P>
Yet, in a perverse twist of logic, the same pro-lifers also maintain
that abortion rates respond quite sensitively to small changes
in the size of cash benefits.
<P>
If man is more than a material being, then it is not unreasonable
to expect some individual moral decisions to override the economic
incentives that run against the grain of virtue.  Nor is it implausible
to suggest that, of all the choices an individual mother must
make, the decision to abort her child -- the most galvanizing
moral issue of our day -- is the one <I>least</I> likely to respond
to economic policy variables.  To suggest otherwise, in fact,
is to assert a particularly virulent form of economic determinism,
with the implication that morality is little more than a product
of rational choices in response to dollar incentives.
<P>
Thus, some pro-life advocates arrive at the argument that government
must pay women not to have abortions.  And while they advocate
incentivizing virtue, they are unwilling to give any credence
to the suggestion that welfare's economic incentives encourage
vice -- including abortion.
<P>
Cultural conservatives believe the diametric opposite: Public
policy can undermine, but never instill, virtue because government
cannot be an effective moral teacher.  Rather than attempting
to devise the perfect bundle of carrots and sticks to reward virtue
and penalize vice, we must eliminate altogether the government
subsidies that skew welfare recipients' decisions by shielding
them from the natural economic consequences.
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  The vast
majority of pro-life social conservatives support restrictions
on welfare benefits, while the majority of pro-lifers who oppose
reform couple their concerns about abortion with a commitment
to big government.
<P>
Failure to understand the real source of the pro-life dispute
now threatens to obscure the critical nexus between morality and
freedom from government intervention.  Misunderstanding the relationship
between morality and freedom in turn threatens both the moral
authority of limited government and the efficacy of cultural reform.
<P>
The Founders instituted a limited government to secure natural
rights, including the right to life; but as George Will noted
in a recent editorial, &quot;Our creed of limited government has
a corollary vision of human capacities and of the life worth living,&quot;
captured by the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot;
<P>
The Founders would have scoffed at the notion that the protection
of life and limb alone is an adequate notion of &quot;happiness,&quot;
and right-to-life proponents forget that at their peril in the
present debate over illegitimacy.  By opposing the current system
of welfare benefits, we advocate a transformation of the political
and social culture that will sustain both &quot;happiness&quot;
and a more enduring pro-life consensus than even legal reform
can hope to accomplish.

<H2>ENDURING LESSONS<BR>
 FROM NEW JERSEY'S <BR>
WELFARE REFORM</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>

<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
While a burgeoning white illegitimacy rate has helped strip the
debate of racial overtones, a black Democrat named Wayne Bryant
has pioneered in the state of New Jersey one of the key anti-illegitimacy
provisions recently adopted by the U.S. House.  The so-called
&quot;family cap&quot; would deny benefit increases to mothers
who bear additional illegitimate children while on welfare.
<P>
By incorporating the family cap, Senator Bryant intended -- not
to constrict reproductive choices or to reduce births per se --
but to promote a sense of responsibility by insisting that families
on welfare live by the same values and confront exactly the same
choices as the general population.
<P>
Echoing Bryant's most popular argument, California's welfare commissioner
Eloise Anderson observes: &quot;Working women do not get automatic
raises when they have children.  Why should our expectations of
a woman on AFDC be any different than any other woman?  Do we
think they're stupider or less capable of being rational?&quot;
<P>
Since the family cap took effect in New Jersey in August of 1993,
the birth rate among welfare mothers in the state has dropped
substantially -- powerful proof that women on welfare are indeed
capable of governing their own decisions.
<P>
Even the most conservative estimate of the birthrate decrease
reported by the New Jersey Department of Human Services (11.4
percent) vindicates the two fundamental principles underlying
the current national debate: that economic incentives do influence
out-of-wedlock childbearing and that subsidizing irresponsible
sexual behavior has accelerated the moral and cultural decline
beyond what even Daniel Patrick Moynihan envisioned 30 years ago.
<P>
James Q. Wilson explains the moral implications of economic incentives:
&quot;Virtue is not learned by precept; it is learned by the regular
repetition of right actions. . . .  Seen this way, there is no
conflict between economic thought and moral philosophy: The latter
simply supplies a fuller statement of the uses to which the former
can and should be put.  We induce habits of right conduct by arranging
confronting youngsters in the ordinary aspects of their daily
lives so that right action routinely occurs.&quot;
<P>
Yet, morality is not merely a product of rational choices in response
to economic incentives.  If man is more than a material being,
then it is not unreasonable to expect some individual moral decisions
to override the economic incentives that run against the grain
of virtue.  Nor is it implausible to suggest that, of all the
choices an individual mother must make, the decision to abort
her child -- the most galvanizing moral issue of our day -- is
the one least likely to respond to policy variables.  
<P>
Precisely because human behavior is governed by a unique complex
of moral instinct and rational choice, the elimination of additional
cash benefits in New Jersey has decreased the birthrate without
causing an upsurge in the abortion rate.  While it is far too
premature to draw any decisive conclusions, there is absolutely
no statistical confirmation as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the New Jersey family cap took effect August
1, 1993.
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  Only the most callous of mothers
places a price tag on her baby's head, and welfare mothers are
apparently more inclined to consider the intangibles than any
other population group.  Public opinion data collected by the
Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more morally
repugnant to poor women; and the fact that abortion rates for
teen welfare mothers are <U>lower</U> than national averages for
all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic factors
determine the decision to carry a child to term.
<P>
The findings in New Jersey are striking evidence of the latent
moral potential in welfare mothers begging to be cultivated, rather
than frustrated by the perpetuation of policies that subsidize
immorality.  Remedial policies should reconcile the current tension
between moral knowledge and the economic incentives of the welfare
system -- before moral knowledge is altogether gone from the inner
city.
<P>
Charles Murray explains that, when illegitimacy reaches a critical
mass, the neighborhood effects create problems that extend far
beyond the recipients of welfare.  Community values and the norms
for male behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young
men and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.
<P>
Yet, conservatives must take care to acknowledge that government
cannot be an effective moral teacher.  Public policy can undermine,
but never instill, virtue.  Rather than attempting to devise the
perfect bundle of carrots and sticks, we must eliminate altogether
the government subsidies that skew welfare recipients' decisions
by shielding them from the natural economic consequences.
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  In <U>The
Road to Serfdom</U>, F. A. Hayek emphasized the symbiotic relationship
between morality and freedom from government intervention:
<P>
 Freedom to order our own conduct in the sphere where material
circumstances force a choice upon us, and responsibility for the
arrangement of our own life according to our own conscience, is
the air in which alone moral sense grows and in which moral values
are daily re-created in the free decision of the individual.
<P>
It is the intrinsic truth of Hayek's observation that motivated
Wayne Bryant to institute the family cap in New Jersey -- a cap
he himself describes as a mechanism to reduce government constriction
of personal choices.
<P>
Government must instead cede ground to the character-forming institutions
that are found in every community -- families, churches, schools,
charities, and other traditional arrangements that have been supplanted
by public authorities.
<P>
Unless those institutions are reinvigorated and social functions
are restored to neighborhoods and communities, the behavioral
problems Daniel Patrick Moynihan described in his famous report
will only continue to grow more acute, jeopardizing personal freedoms
and ultimately the survival of the republic itself.  If it is
true that moral values do not have concrete meaning in the absence
of freedom, it is also true that the preservation of political
liberty depends upon the cultivation 
of virtue in the people.

BILL ARCHER
RETHINKING FEDERAL TAXATION

	<P>As the year 2000 draws near, we must develop and agenda for the next century.  We must rethink the way government does its job--and be willing to investigate bold changes to those things which are incompatible with the new reality of the U.S. in a global marketplace.
<P>	In today's world, our nation's income tax has become a liability.  I believe that the time has come to tear the income tax out by its roots and implement a whole new way of raising federal revenues.  
<P>	In Ways and Means Committee hearings we have begun the process of developing a new design of federal taxation which would meet these goals.
<ul>
<li>Truly achieve simplicity and remove the I.R.S. from our lives as much as possible.
<li>Tax the "underground" economy
<li> Allow for maximum savings
<li> Advance our competitiveness over seas
</ul>

I am convinced that these goals can only be met by a broad-based form of consumtion tax.<p>
	
Complying with the I.R.S. is a huge drain on our national economy.  It takes me two days to do my return.  Nationwide, individual taxpayers spend an estimated 1.8 billion hours complying with the tax code, and businesses spend about 3.6 billion hours.  Taxpayers who have their returns prepared for them spend all together about $65 billion a year -- and businesses spend more still.<p>
	Imagine if all that time and money were productively spent!<p>
	<P>By taxing consumtion, we could remove the I.R.S. almost completely from our lives.  Even the simplified "flat" income tax that some reformers favor would still require that every taxpayer send name and income to the I.R.S., and be subject to audit.
<P>	Many people in America don't pay any taxes at all.  The "underground economy" is the name given to the many men and women whose incomes are unreported, and therefore untaxed.  Some are drug dealers.  Others are illegal aliens.  Many are providers of services who get payments in cash, and many others have simply fallen through the cracks.
<P>	The Treasury reports that the underground economy acounts for anywhere from $100 billion to $200 billion each year in uncollected tax revenues.  Taxpayers are tapped to make up the difference.
<P>	A consumption tax would reach the underground economy.  Everytime a drug dealer bought a car, every time a house painter bought a can of paint, they would be paying their fair share for the cost of our government.
<P>	A flat tax would not get at the underground economy.  Becasue it is an income tax, it is reasonable to expect that the same income that is unreported now would continue to be unreported -- and the difference would continue to come out of your paycheck.
<P>	But, in addition to lowering taxes, a consumption tax would greatly favor savings.  Almost every economist will tell you that the one single financial crisis facing this country is its lack of savings.  Under my proposal, only consumption would be taxed.  Any dollar a taxpayer saved would not be taxed at all.  Houses and other capital assets that , since they aren't consumed items, would also escape taxation.  Our economy would become a great sponge for job-creating capital investments from all over the world.
<P>	In the future, it is my hope that conflicts between nations will be resolved not on the battlefields, but in the international marketplace.  It is vital that we position the U.S. to be the world's economic superpower.
<P>	Right now, our income tax hurts the competitiveness of our products.  To pay it, our companies have to increase the prices of the products they sell overseas.  A consumption tax would avoid this altogether, decreasing the prices of our products overseas.
<P>	At the same time, foreign products that are consumed in the United States would be taxed.  They would contribute to out cost of government, and make our products more competitive at home.
<P>	If we moved to a consumption-based tax, we would gain an immense competitive advantage perfectly acceptable under international trade rules.  The rest of the world would be srambling to catch up.  A flat tax would not have these benefits.
<P>	We can and must minimize problems associated with the consumption tax.  For example we must develop a way for low income earners not to be adversely affected.  But you can be sure: I intend to all I can to pursue these changes and make America as strong as it can be -- today, tomorrow, and in the 21st century.

<title>UN CONFERENCE MISSES MARK</title>

<p>
<h2>UN CONFERENCE MISSES MARK<br>
ON MARRIAGE, VIOLENCE<br>
AGAINST WOMEN</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Ambassador Madeleine Albright will present US priorities to the
Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, in early September.
 As the head of the US delegation, Albright promises &quot;to
see that American views and values are well represented.&quot;
 But some of those &quot;views and values&quot; are truly alien
to our traditions.
<P>
The conference's road map, &quot;Program for Action,&quot; was
heavily influenced by western feminists like Bella Abzug, a former
New York congresswoman, who is described as &quot;arguably the
most important lobbyist&quot; behind the UN conference.  According
to State Department sources, many of the US delegates to the Beijing
conference are members of the Women's Linkage Caucus (WLC) which
is headed by Ms. Abzug.
<P>
The WLC heavily influenced the 121-page UN document, including
a section on violence against women which falsely implies that
most violence against women takes place in the home.  The document
says, &quot;In many cases, violence against women and girls occurs
in the family or within the home, where violence is often tolerated&quot;
and goes on to say, &quot;[v]iolence against women encompasses...physical,
sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including
battering, sexual abuse of female children...marital rape.&quot;
 But a new Justice Department study indicates that the safest
place for a woman today is married and living with her husband.
<P>
The August, 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistics study, &quot;Violence
Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey,&quot; reports
that a woman's relationship to the offender is a key variable.
 The study found that when all acts of violence against women
(rape/sexual assault, robbery and aggravated/simple assault) are
considered, married women are 30 times less likely than separated
women to become violence victims.  Moreover, 
married women are at least four times less likely than never-married
women to be crime victims.
<P>
The study also found that twenty-something women are the most likely
victims of violence.  They are twice as likely to become victims,
compared to teenagers and women in their 30s and 40s.  Although
the Justice Department report does not explain the difference,
US Census Bureau statistics show that the older female cohort
tends to be married, and the younger cohort is more likely to
live in homes where there is a protecting father.
<P>
Even incidents of rape and sexual assault are low for married
women.  The 1995 study found that a woman is three times more
likely to be raped and sexually assaulted by a boyfriend and 10
times more likely to be raped and sexually assaulted by an acquaintance
than by a spouse.  Single women are just as likely to be raped
and sexually assaulted by a stranger as they are by a boyfriend.
<P>
Instead of spreading feminist propaganda, Ambassador Albright
ought to take this data to the Beijing Conference.  Perhaps the
delegates would rethink their stand on marriage.  The UN plan
includes only seven uses of the term &quot;marriage,&quot; and
the words &quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are not found
at all.  This is an interesting omission, given that every great
society in history has been built upon the foundational concept
of family.
<P>
Ambassador Albright should embrace a message that works and not
failed feminist distortions.  If the conference &quot;on women
will affect directly the lives of half the people on earth,&quot;
as Albright claims, shouldn't her message be one that offers the
truth and solutions to violence rather than distortion and compromise?
<P>

<h2>Choice in Action:</h2><br>
<h3>What's Working Around the Country</h3><p>
<i>The Center for Education Reform</i> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
With the increasing demand for better schools, dozens of states and 
communities are providing more options to families. By doing so, they 
are not only improving the condition of education for those children, but 
having a dramatic impact on how schools operate in their communities.  
Armed with the evidence presented below, lawmakers in each of a dozen 
states will soon give serious consideration to launching and expanding 
upon the school choices provided to their citizens.<p> 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, implemented the nation's first pilot school 
choice plan in September, 1990.  The program provides up to 1,500 low-
income children with a grant of half the Milwaukee per-pupil expenditure 
($3,200 for the 1994-95 school year) to attend the private, non-sectarian 
school of their choice.   In 1990, 341 Milwaukee children used grants at 
six private schools.  Today, the initiative is enabling 830 students to 
attend one of thirteen participating private schools -- with hundreds of 
children on waiting lists. Participation in the Milwaukee program has 
been limited because of restrictions on the schools that may participate.  
However, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson has pledged to expand 
the program to allow all private schools, including sectarian schools, to 
participate, and has included funds for such an expansion in his 1995 
budget.<p> 
Evaluations for the Milwaukee program show that choice students are 
ten times more likely than their public school counterparts to stay in their 
choice school through the year, and 50% more likely to be there the next 
year, despite the fact that choice students are more often from single-
parent homes on welfare, closest to the poverty line.  The choice program 
has resulted in high levels of parent and student satisfaction, increased 
parental involvement in their children's education and with the schools, 
and improved discipline and attendance.(1)<p> 
In September, 1993, the Puerto Rico legislature passed the first state-
wide full school choice law, providing $1,500 grants for children from 
low-income families to attend a private school or a public school of their 
choice.  In 1993, 1,596 students participated in the program; in 1994 that 
number increased more than ten-fold, to 16,899.  The vast majority of 
those students -- 88% -- chose to transfer from a private or a public 
school into another public school; the rest opted for a private school.  In 
1994, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court declared the section of the program 
extending to private schools unconstitutional, but the decision did not 
affect the nearly 15,000 children using the public school choice option.  
The ruling also did not affect the reality that so many children, once 
empowered, chose to go to a different school, whether public or private.<p> 
The earliest evidence of choice working came from New York's East 
Harlem school district.  In 1974, the school district gave parents the right 
to choose among diverse schools-within-schools created by teachers.  The 
resulting competition increased education quality: graduation rates shot 
up from less than 50 percent to more than 90 percent; the district, which 
ranked last of New York City's 32 districts in reading scores, climbed to 
16th; community morale soared as the choice program brought parents 
and teachers together to work on behalf of their children; and the plan 
continues to attract students from districts across New York City, creating 
voluntary desegregation.  The students are strong choice proponents, and 
say it gives them a sense of ownership and pride in their schools that they 
did not have before.<p> 
In 1993, when another three New York City districts opened up schools 
to choice, a summer school fair drew over 1,000 parents eager to learn 
about their options.  Choice for the city's 80,000 high schoolers is 
available through the wide array of magnet schools that operate 
throughout New York City, many on a selective admissions basis.  And 
the trend has spread to other urban districts demanding a better system.  
In Boston, Massachusetts (enrollment 60,000), Indianapolis, Indiana 
(enrollment 47,000), and Detroit, Michigan (enrollment 50,000), parents 
must choose which school their child will attend.  In Boston, 57% of 
students now choose to go to schools other than those to which they were 
assigned.<p> 
The competition among schools trying to attract students -- even when 
limited to the public sector -- has forced schools to be more informative 
to parents and to offer a better product.  When open enrollment was 
introduced in Los Angeles in the Fall of 1993, with 22,000 seats open in 
the district, schools aggressively marketed their wares via cable television 
and local newspapers to attract parents and show they could offer their 
children something better.  And when schools in a choice state are faced 
with dipping enrollments, they are forced to raise their own standards.  
When high school students began to use Minnesota's post-secondary 
enrollment option to earn their high school credits on college campuses, 
high schools responded by quadrupling the number of advance placement 
courses they offered in order to attract students, and their funding, back 
to the high schools.<p> 
In fact, in Minnesota 15% of the state's 750,000 public school students 
participate in the various choice programs available throughout the state -
- using their school choice to get the education best tailored to their 
needs.  In 1987, the program's first year, over 2,000 dropouts enrolled in 
alternative schools through the new choice plan; by 1993, 14,000 
dropouts were opting back into schools through Minnesota's various 
"second chance" programs.  Recently, the first religiously affiliated high 
school joined the ranks of private high schools in the state contracted by 
districts to educate at-risk students that the public school system can no 
longer handle. Through a similar program in Arizona, districts every year 
send about 2,000 children who aren't benefiting from their district school 
to private schools more suited to their needs.<p> 
Meanwhile, private scholarship programs are working in more than 20 
cities to enable over 8,500 children from disadvantaged families to attend 
the school of their choice.  And nearly 10,000 children are on waiting 
lists. The infusion of private enterprise into the choice equation not only 
enhances the options available to children, particularly the most 
underprivileged, but also imposes a greater challenge to existing public 
schools to respond more directly to children's' needs.<p> 
Throughout the country, dozens of public and private sector programs 
are expanding the choices available to families, and, in so doing, are 
having a positive effect on the quality of education all children receive.<p>
