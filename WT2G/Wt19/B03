<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

SOFIA (Surface of the Ocean, Fluxes and Interaction with the
Atmosphere) is a research program carried out by French groups from
the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement (CRPE),
Laboratoire l'Aerologie (LA)-Toulouse, Centre de Meteorologie Marine
(CMM)-Brest, Institut Francais de Rechercher sur la Mer
(IFREMER)-Brest, Service d'Aeronomie-Paris, and Laboratoire de
Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)-Palaiseau with cooperation from Centre
National de Recherche Meteorologique (CNRM)-Toulouse.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.

This data set contains radiosounding measurements of pressure,
temperature and humidity at selected points (B) and radiosounding
measurements of wind at selected points (C).

<STRONG>ABSTRACT</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
        The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) is a comprehensive
source of information about satellite and in situ Earth science data,
with broad coverage of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans, solid
earth, and biosphere.  The GCMD currently contains more than
3,500 descriptions of Earth science data sets, representing more
than 650 data centers and research institutions throughout the
world.  These database entries are recorded and updated using a
relational database management system and the Directory
Interchange Format (DIF) for metadata.  The GCMD has
developed several on-line systems that enable querying of the
GCMD database by controlled field and free-text searches.  A
World Wide Web interface which uses controlled database fields to
build SQL statements allows the user to search the database
directly. Free-text searches may be executed via a Z39.50 search
and retrieval gateway, which also allows for distributed/multiple
database searching among different host computers. In
collaborating with other organizations, the GCMD is able to obtain
and share international data set descriptions, share new database
and World Wide Web technology, and make the database available
to more users globally.

<STRONG>1.O INTRODUCTION</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<p>

The growth of the Internet in the last five years has provided users with a greater
variety and number of potential resources of information but also has made it



much more difficult to determine which of those resources are best suited to meet
their information needs.  With a network that allows virtually anyone to go on-line,
it is often difficult to quickly separate the valuable information from the
uninformative, and users often must resort to sorting through the query results of
one of the many on-line World Wide Web search engines.  Some sites may lack
the detailed content or information for which the user searches,  while others may
have ample content but lack a suitable interface or search mechanism to direct the
user to it.  Williams (1994) suggests that there are three important conditions that
should be met by on-line services:


<p>
(1)  people must want and need the information and services provided;
(2)  there should be a large market for the services or information being provided;
(3)  the services should be provided with "...a good retrieval engine through an
interface that is easy to use."

<p>
As a provider of information on the location of data sets relevant to the Earth
science, environmental and global change disciplines, the GCMD has been
successful in assessing the needs of the scientific community and has populated a
database with over 3,500 data set descriptions from research institutions and data
centers throughout the world.  This paper discusses how the GCMD addresses the
third condition above with two different approaches.   The first World Wide Web
search interface design uses database fields and a list of controlled terms to build
SQL statements and search the database directly.  This approach shall be referred
to as the controlled search method.  The second is designed to search an external
index using free-text terms and Boolean operators.  This approach shall be
referred to as the free-text method.   The benefits and shortfalls of each method
are covered, as well as the use of the Z39.50 protocol as a standard for
distributed/multiple database searching.


<p>
<BR><CENTER>
<STRONG>2.0 CONTROLLED SEARCH METHOD</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<p>
The GCMD uses the Directory Interchange Format (DIF)  for metadata to
populate a relational database with  Earth science data set descriptions and
supplemental information.  A relational database management system is used for
maintenance and update purposes.  A  World Wide Web interface allows users to
directly access the database, either by selecting from a list of valid terms or filling
in fields directly.  The interface uses a series of Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
programs to access, query and retrieve information from the database and return
the data to the user.  Figure 1 illustrates the architecture used.  Users are first
presented with a World Wide Web form where they may either enter text in one of
several blank fields or click one of several buttons for a list of controlled terms
which are acceptable for each field.  The `mainquery' program is used to build the
Standard Query Language (SQL) statement used to retrieve the controlled terms
from the database and insert them into a selection box on a new web page.  Users
can then select from the controlled terms and/or fill in additional fields.  Users are
able to repeat this process in order to select valid terms for as many or as few
fields as they choose.  Upon submission,  the `mainquery' program uses these
entries to build the SQL  statement to query the database for matching data set
descriptions and return the titles to the user.  A program called `getdif' returns the
actual data set description to the user after a title is selected.

<STRONG>3.0 FREE-TEXT SEARCH METHOD</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<p>
One disadvantage of the controlled search method is that only valid terms may be
searched, and large blocks of uncontrolled text in the data set descriptions are not
searchable.  In order to perform Boolean searches on uncontrolled text, a separate
search software package (I-Search developed by the Center for Networked
Information Discovery and Retrieval) is used.  To use this package, the collection
of data set descriptions are extracted from the relational database and stored in an
ASCII text database.   An index file is created for more efficient searching and the
desired data set descriptions are extracted directly from the text database and
returned using HTML code for display (Fig. 2).

<p><BR><CENTER>
<STRONG>4.0 DISTRIBUTED SEARCHING</STRONG>
</CENTER>

<p>
The free-text architecture described above is actually a subset of the distributed
searching architecture which provides distributed, fielded, free-text searching
using software which is Z39.50 compliant.  Z39.50 is a protocol standard that
"... specifies a type of computer to computer communication"  that allows multiple
databases to be searched with one single, configurable interface (Schneider, 1996).
A World Wide Web/Z39.50 gateway and client is established and configured to
send queries received from the user's web browser  to one or more Z39.50 servers
on the Internet (Fig. 3).  The selected servers then perform the same query as the
free-text search described above using the I-Search software, and appropriate data
set descriptions are merged at the gateway and returned to the user.

<p>
<BR><CENTER>
<STRONG>5.0  DISCUSSION</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<p>
There are several other methods used to access or search databases using a World
Wide Web interface or gateway.  Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS) were
the predecessors to the free-text architecture described above and are still
commonly used for search and retrieval of Web pages, gopher information and
USENET News articles.  The progress made in the area of natural language
searching has appealed to many, but studies have not shown significant differences
in recall or precision between natural language and Boolean searches (Hersh,
1995).   The GCMD has found that the combination of a Boolean free-text search
page and a controlled database search page provides users with the necessary tools
needed to find data sets at the directory level.  The pages have been accessed by
users on an equal basis (673 accesses of the controlled search page and 619
accesses of the free-text page for the month of July, 1996), which may indicate a
need for both search methods as different users have different preferences for their
method of searching.  The equal use of both pages may also indicate that both
pages are being accessed by most users.  Studies are being done to determine user
search preferences and success based on both methods.  Future studies may
investigate the benefits of combining both search methods into one interface, i.e.
users may perform a free-text search on the results of a controlled search.
Additional work on distributed searching will be conducted with participating
nodes of the Committee of Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) International
Directory Network (IDN), a network of agencies worldwide which share scientific
metadata.

Data were collected from the NCAR Electra aircraft during the FIRE
Marine Stratocumulus experiment in July 1987.  The data were produced
by the NCAR Research Aviation Facility (RAF) Data Management Group,
with the GENPRO-II data processing software.  The format of these data
include a header file and a data file which corresponds to all or part
of a particular aircraft flight.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

Canada and the United States carried out an atmospheric research
program called the Eulerian Model Evaluation Field Study (EMEFS) from
June 1, 1988 to May 31, 1990 under the coordination and management of
a bi-lateral, multi-agency Project Management Group (PMG).

The objective of the program was to collect daily air and
precipitation chemistry data for use in evaluating two Eulerian
long-range transport models: the Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM)
developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the
Atmospheric Deposition and Oxidants Model (ADOM) developed jointly by
Environment Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy,
the German Umweltbundesamt, and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)
(<A HREF=http://www.epri.com/>http://www.epri.com/</A>)


Data collected have been and continue to be used to evaluate estimates of
sulfate (SO4-) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in air and
precipitation.

The EMEFS surface network consisted of approximately 130 sites in five
networks sponsored by different governmental and non-governmental
agencies.  Site selection was coordinated by the agencies to establish
a regionally representative network.

The Canadian Air and Preipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN),
operated by Environment Canada, Atmospheric Environment Service (AES)
is one of five EMEFS surface networks consisting of 22 EMEFS sites.

Routine air quality data include:

precipitation: sulfate (SO4), nitrate (NO3), Chlorine (Cl), ammonium
(NH4), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S(IV)),
and depth.

Aerosol Particles: mass, sulfate (SO4), nitrate (NO3), and ammonium (NH4).

Gaseous: nitric acid (HNO3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and ozone (O3).

The Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team, located at the U.S.
Geological Survey's Eros Data Center, is accessible via the World Wide Web:

<A HREF=http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/sast/sast-home.html>http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/sast/sast-home.html</A>

The SAST maintains the SAST Database of Environmental data for the
Upper Mississippi and Missouri River Basins.

The following information about the SAST project was abstracted from the
SAST home page:

Through a directive from the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy, an interdisciplinary Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team
(SAST) was formed "to provide scientific advice and assistance to Federal
officials responsible for making decisions with respect to flood recovery
in the Upper Mississippi River and Missouri River Basins, and to develop
and provide information to support the decision making process regarding
both nonstructural and structural approaches to river basin management."
The team included scientific specialists from the Soil Conservation
Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, National
Biological Survey, U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection
Agency, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In-depth technical
and scientific support is provided by the U.S. Geological Survey's Earth
Resources Observation System (EROS) Data Center and its in-house
contractor, Hughes STX Corporation.

Over a period of 3 months at the EROS Data Center, the team developed a
substantial Environmental Information System for the Upper Mississippi and
Missouri River Basins. This system includes satellite data, elevation
data, digitized aerial photographs, data on historic river channels,
man-made structures, hazardous/toxic waste sites, spatially referenced
information on soils, and various geologic, biologic, hydrologic, and
hydrographic themes. The component data sets were designed for widely
different purposes, and were received in a variety of formats and map
scales. Data were edited, reformatted, and carefully documented to provide
consistency and accuracy for analysis based on overlay and mensuration.

The majority of data were provided by Federal agencies, and are in the
public domain. These will be available for release to the public for the
cost of distribution. A small number of data sets have distribution
restrictions due to proprietary agreements or to protect resources at
sensitive locations such as archaeologic sites or endangered species
nesting areas. Data sets will be managed and maintained at various sites
and will be distributed using Internet access as part of a clearinghouse
function. One approach to Internet access involves Mosaic software and
World-Wide Web services. Application of Mosaic hypertext provides a
window-based browser environment allowing interested persons to read or
download documents, graphics, and data layers.

In describing the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), the Federal
Geographic Data Committee said, "Geospatial data form the foundation of an
information-based society" (Nancy Tosta, NSDI, written commun., May,
1993). The SAST has provided a prototype for the development, planning,
creation, and distribution of a quality environmental information system
for the Federal Geographic Data Committee's National Spatial Data
Infrastructure.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-02<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between ISCCP data, GCM
parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

The MODIS Airbourne Simulator (MAS) is a modified Daedalus Wildfire
scanning spectrometer which flies on a NASA ER-2 and provides spectral
information similar to that which will be provided by the Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), scheduled to be launched
on the EOS-AM platform in 1998 (King et al. 1992).  The principal
investigators for the MAS are Dr. Michael King (NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt
MD), and Dr. Paul Menzel (NOAA/NESDIS, Madison WI).

In January 1992, the modified Wildfire instrument was converted to MAS
configuration.  In June 1992 the MAS was flown over portions of the
Atlantic Ocean in the region of the Azores during the ASTEX
experiment.  Although the MAS instrument is a 50 band spectrometer,
the data system used in this experiment could only record 12 channels
(at 8-bit resolution).

The MAS spectrometer acquires high spatial resolution imagery in the
wavelength range of 0.55 to 14.3 microns. A total of 50 spectral bands
are available in this range, and the digitizer can be configured to
collect data from any 12 of these bands.  The digitizer was configured
with four 10-bit channels and seven 8-bit channels.  The MAS
spectrometer was mated to a scanner subassembly which collected image
data with an IFOV of 2.5 mrad, giving a ground resolution of 50 meters
from 20000 meters altitude, and a cross track scan width of 85.92
degrees. The data granules were written using the self documenting
file storage format provided through the netCDF interface routines
included in the HDF libraries.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface based instruments for in situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

GENERAL INFORMATION

The ISCCP DX and flux dataset consists of analyses of data acquired
from the GMS satellite and the NOAA 11 and 12 satellites in support of
TOGA-COARE. Principal Investigator Bill Rossow of the Goddard
Institute for Space Studies (GISS) subsetted this dataset both
temporally and spatially to conform to the TOGA COARE period and
region.

Temporal Coverage and Resolution: All times are in GMT. The temporal
coverage for the TOGA COARE campaign and for this ISCCP subset is 4
months from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993. The sampling
interval for these data is about 3 hr for GMS and 12 hr for each NOAA
polar orbiter.

Spatial Coverage and Resolution: The ISCCP subsets for the TOGA COARE
campaign cover the region:
       Longitude:  120E --> 190E
       Latitude:    20S -->  20N
The spatial resolution is about 30 km for sensors on all 3 satellites.


ISCCP SCIENCE OBJECTIVES

Investigation of the role of clouds in climate involves a complex
interrelated study of many different processes and addresses many
different questions. The ISCCP's scientific objectives are:

- to produce a global, reduced resolution, infrared and visible,
calibrated and normalized radiance dataset containing basic
information on the radiative properties of the atmosphere from which
cloud parameters can be derived;
- to stimulate and coordinate basic research on techniques for
inferring the physical properties of clouds from the condensed
radiance dataset and to apply the resulting algorithms to derive and
validate a global cloud climatology for improving the parameterization
of clouds in climate models;
-to promote research using ISCCP data and contribute to improved
understanding of the Earth's radiation budget (top of atmosphere and
surface) and hydrological cycle.

General Description: This analysis is based on data from the GMS, NOAA
11 and NOAA 12 satellites;

GMS (Geostationary Meteorological Satellite): Operated by the Japan
Meteorological Agency (JMA), GMS is a spin-stabilized spacecraft
maintained at 140E longitude. Imaging data are from the Visible
Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR), with high resolution (1.25 km)
visible images obtained by four identical detectors scanning in
parallel. The spin-scan is from west to east and from north to south.

The NOAA TIROS-N series satellites are three-axis stabilized in 850 KM
(nominal) circular, near-polar, sun-synchronous orbits with an
inclination angle of approximately 99 degrees (retrograde) to the
equator. The orbital period is about 102 minutes. Sequential orbits
observe adjacent longitudes near the equator and provide overlapping
coverage in both polar regions. The instrument complement is as
follows:

NOAA 11:
       - AVHRR, 5 channels
       - HIRS/2, 20 channels
       - MSU, 4 channels
       - SSU, 3 channels

NOAA 12:
       - AVHRR, 5 channels
       - HIRS/2, 20 channels
       - MSU, 4 channels
       - SBUV



DATA ORGANIZATION

a) DX Data

General Characteristics: ISCCP DX data are the individual pixel-level
results of the analysis that contain the visible and IR radiances, the
clear-sky radiances, the surface reflectance and temperature from the
clear-sky radiances, the cloud detection decision, and the retrieved
physical quantities. For clear pixels, these are the surface
reflectance and temperature; for cloudy pixels these are the cloud top
temperature/pressure and optical thickness. The cloud top temperature
is obtained with three different models: assuming an opaque cloud (all
times of day), assuming a liquid water cloud or an ice cloud
(daytime).

The ISCCP DX TOGA COARE subset totals 2129 data files and is about
approximately 1.07 GB in volume. Each file contains data for one
GMT. Files are named 'FC_DT_KA.YYMMDDHH' where YY=92, 93 (year),
MM=11, 12, 1, 2 (month), DD=01, 02,.., 31 (date) and HH=00, 03, .. 21
(GMT).

Data Format: Each data file comprises 448 (28 X 16) grid boxes, each
containing 48 1792 byte records corresponding to the 48 parameters.

There are a variable number of data records in each DX image. Each
record contains packed binary pixel data as follows:

    I*4   IWEST   Western-most longitude (0-3600 degrees*10)
    I*4   IEAST   Eastern-most longitude (0-3600 degrees*10)
    I*4   INORTH  Northern-most latitude (0-1800 degrees*10)
    I*4   ISOUTH  Southern-most latitude (0-1800 degrees*10)
    I*4   NPIX    Number of pixels
    I*4   IOUT    Number of bytes in packed data BUFFER
    I*2   LONBUF(NPIX) Longitudes for NPIX pixels (0-3600 degrees*10)
    I*2   LATBUF(NPIX) Latitudes for NPIX pixels (0-1800 degrees*10)
    I*2   XBUF(NPIX)  X-positions for NPIX pixels (1-1440)
    I*2   YBUF(NPIX)  Y-positions for NPIX pixels (1-550)
    I*1   BUFFER(IOUT) Packed data for NPIX pixels
    remainder of record is filled with I*1 255 values.

The contents of the buffer as it is unpacked are as follows:

NOTE 1: Numbers on the left identify the byte number from 1 to 37.
This is the MAXIMUM number of bytes that a pixel can have.  Not all
bytes are present for all pixels.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

Mission Objective:
Please see the relevant SIR-C/X-SAR Mission description contained in the
references and as Supplementary Information for "sensor"(X-SAR).

There were two Missions with the following time frame:
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-59:
Start_Date: 1994-04-09
Stop_Date: 1994-04-20
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-68:
Start_Date: 1994-09-30
Stop_Date: 1994-10-11
Worldwide coverage and map prints are available on World Wide Web (see below).


Data Set Content:
The X-SAR geocoded image, with terrain correction (GTC) registers the pixel
values of the SAR slant range image due to terrain offset and
cartographic presentation.
The basic image generation physics of SAR implies less or no
radiometric information in regions affected by layover and shadowing,
respectively. Therefore, the radiometric values (digital counts) in
extreme layover areas are more or less meaningless. Shadowed regions
will be precisely mapped but stay shadowed in a geocoded image.
To indicate, where the regions of layover and shadow can be found in
the geocoded image, the user of a terrain corrected geocoded image can
get an additional data set in the same carthographic presentation,
showing the pixels affected by those radiometric distortions.  The
binary pixel values represent a degree of terrain slope vs. the
regional incidence angle of the SAR. Shadow and layover conditions are
indicated by different bits. The amount of data will be as large as for
the geocoded image to which it belongs. The GIM product can be
generated for GTC and GMQ product sizes.

Intended Use:
Aid for the SAR Geocoded Product user for thematic interpretation of
the image content.  In digital form, this data may be used as an
additional image layer to generate masks with the image processing
system.

Input Data:
-  The standard MGD product formatted in CEOS, including parameters used
   for the slant to ground range projection.
-  Orbit data from the PATH tape annotated in the MGD product
-  Map projection constants to be applied
-  Digital Elevation Model

Processing Algorithm:
The incidence angle, layover and shadow mask is a by-product during terrain
corrected geocoded product generation. During the application of the
radargrammetric references the sensor is considered as a geometric
scanner with reference to its zero-Doppler position and timing.
By using the geometric relationships, the nominal incidence angle on
undulating ground can now be calculated.
For detection of layover and shadow, two passes in range are necessary.

Access to the data:
On-line access to data and information as well to digital quicklook DQL
or browse data is provided by the Intelligent Satellite Data Information
System (ISIS), developed by DLR as a client / server configuration.
It represents the interface of DLR-DFD to users, providing easy access to
catalogue-, inventory-, browse- and general textual information.

ISIS can be accessed with World Wide Web by URL:
        <A HREF=http://www.dfd.dlr.de>http://www.dfd.dlr.de</A>

and clicking on `Information Services (ISIS)` or `Accessing ISIS` (telnet).

ISIS can also be accessed by telnet directly:
        input: telnet isis.dfd.dlr.de
        user: dlrpid
        password: -

Other procedures (modem or X-25) to access ISIS are described as 'Supplemen-
tary Information' for data centers (keyword 'ISIS'. Access presumes the in-
stallation of the client software (available free of charge) which can be
easily done by users (supplied by DLR/DFD).

Digital and photographic products may be ordered at DFD - Help Desk,see Data
Center Contact.
There is also available on CD-ROM and on Web a set of image sample products
as well as general and specific information about the X-SAR missions. This
'user-kit' can be accessed via Web with URL:

Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

Mission Objective:
Please see the relevant SIR-C/X-SAR Mission description contained in the
references and as Supplementary Information for "sensor"(X-SAR).

There were two Missions with the following time frame:
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-59:
Start_Date: 1994-04-09
Stop_Date: 1994-04-20
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-68:
Start_Date: 1994-09-30
Stop_Date: 1994-10-11
Worldwide coverage and map prints are available on World Wide Web (see below).


Data Set Content:
The RAW data set contains X-SAR raw and ancillary data, transcribed from
the HDDT as well as precise orbit data taken from the PATH tape. The
radar samples which can have 4 or 6 bit quantization are reformatted
into bytes. The samples are aligned at the MSB of the byte.

Intended Use:
The raw data are the starting point for all subsequent SAR off-line
processing outside the major processing and archiving facilities at
ASI, DLR and JPL. The data are supplied on a computer compatible medium
in order to avoid problems with expensive HDDT recorders, frame
synchronizers and interfaces.

Input Data:
- X-SAR raw data from HDDC
- Orbit data from the PATH tape annotated in the MGD product.

Processing Algorithm:
The raw data from HDDT and the orbit data from PATH tape are transcribed
on a one to one basis into the corresponding records of the CEOS
format.

Mission Objective:
Please see the relevant SIR-C/X-SAR Mission description contained in the
references and as Supplementary Information for  "sensor"(X-SAR).

There were two Missions with the following time frame:
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-59:
Start_Date: 1994-04-09
Stop_Date: 1994-04-20
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-68:
Start_Date: 1994-09-30
Stop_Date: 1994-10-11
Worldwide coverage and map prints are available on World Wide Web (see below).


Data Set Content:
The MGD data set contains range and azimuth compressed SAR image data which
are detected and projected on the earth ellipsoid. The number of range
and azimuth looks are variable, depending on the mission parameters
selected. These are in particular the incidence angle, the PRF and the
coarse or fine resolution mode. The image pixels are detected and their
amplitudes are quantized with 16 bits per sample. Information regarding
instrument and platform as well as processing, calibration and image
quality is appended.
The product is presented in range-line order. Range lines are
deskewed to zero Doppler lines and organised in ascending time
reference. The data set contains a scene of 100 km in sensor flight
direction and a maximum of 62.5 km across track. The actual swath
width, which can be smaller, is dependent on the chosen mission
parameters like the incidence angle.

Intended Use:
This is the standard bulk product of the German and Italian PAF for
X-SAR. It is compatible with the standard detected ground range
image produced by JPL for the SRL L- and C-band and can be used for all
applications which require no geocoded or complex data.

Input Data:
- X-SAR raw data and ancillary data from HDDC
- Orbit data from the PATH tape

Processing Algorithm:
Signal processing is performed by two-dimensional matched filtering in
range and azimuth direction. Windowing is applied to meet the specified
PSLR and ISLR values. Doppler parameters are calculated from orbit
data and the SAR raw data itself, during a preprocessing step. The
azimuth processing bandwidth is selected according to the used PRF in
order to guarantee the specified 'Signal to Azimuth Ambiguity Ratio'
SAAR.
The effective number of looks in range and azimuth are chosen to
maintain a spatial resolution of 25 m by 25 m. In case the inherent
spatial resolution is higher, the number of looks will be increased.
Hence, it is the processing strategy to fix the spatial resolution and
to vary the radiometric resolution by the number of looks used in range
and azimuth direction.  (Those users who are interested in full spatial
resolution may use the 'X-SAR.SAR.SSC' product.) The look processing is
either performed in the frequency domain or by a weighted time domain
pixel averaging.
The projection to ground range is done by a one-dimensional
interpolation. Resampling and detection is performed to achieve a
12.5 m by 12.5 m pixel spacing.
Due to the nonlinear nature of the Slant-to-Ground range projection the
ground range resolution in the MGD product will vary slightly over
range. The specified value for the spatial resolution is therefore only
applicable for mid-swath.

Calibration:
The MGD product is fully calibrated.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

Mission Objective:
Please see the relevant SIR-C/X-SAR Mission description contained in the
references and as Supplementary Information for "sensor"(X-SAR).

There were two Missions with the following time frame:
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-59:
Start_Date: 1994-04-09
Stop_Date: 1994-04-20
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-68:
Start_Date: 1994-09-30
Stop_Date: 1994-10-11
Worldwide coverage and map prints are available on World Wide Web (see below).

Data Set Content:
The GEC data set contains X-SAR detected images, represented in a uniform,
preselected cartographic presentation. The image axes (i.e. the row and
column direction of the pixels) are parallel to the cartographic coordinate
system used.The cartographic system used for worldwide reference is the
Universal Transversal Mercator System (UTM).
The product mentioned here can be produced for each region of the world,
which is imaged by the X-SAR sensor. Except for the cartographic references
and possibly maps for quality control test, it does not utilize data sets
outside the SAR image generation chain. Therefore, no terrain correction
is applied to this product. The SAR inherent geometric terrain distorsions
like layover and shadowing are not considered and degrade the absolute pixel
location accuracy to maps especially in hilly terrain.

Intended Use:
Geocoded data will be available after availability of off-line processed
precision MGD products. Geocoded data sets can be used by the scientific or
commercial community which will refer the actual SAR data to
geographic/cartographic places. Ellipsoid corrected geocoded products are
intended for that area of applications or when relative geometric
accuracy can be dispensed with some purposes.

Input Data:
-  The standard MGD product formatted in CEOS, including parameters used for
   the slant to ground range projection.
-  Orbit data from the PATH tape annotated in the MGD product
-  Map projection constants to be applied.

Processing Algorithm;
The geocoding is based on the radargrammetric functions delivered by sensor
references and processing parameters. These are:
    - orbit state and velocity
    - precise range measurements by sensor and corresponding annotation
      within the processor
    - azimuth timing information within the processor (i.e. The range
      line must be annotated with the zero-Doppler orbit time.)
    - map projection formula, where geographic latitude and longitude are
      transferred to appropriate map coordinates.
As ellipsoid reference is used, the discrete transformation formula will
only be computed for a mesh of discrete points. Bilinear interpolation is
performed within  this grid. Oversampling is applied to avoid aliasing when
resampling to map grid. The standard resampling procedure is cubic convolution.

Product Parameter:
Equivalent no. of looks
      in azimuth                   1.5 - 2.5
      in range                     1 - 3
Geometric representation           cartographic UTM

                                             and for flat terrain)
Pixel spacing
      northing                     12.5 m

Image data volume                  up to 160 MBytes


Access to the data:
On-line access to data and information as well to digital quicklook DQL
or browse data is provided by the Intelligent Satellite Data Information
System (ISIS), developed by DLR as a client / server configuration.
It represents the interface of DLR-DFD to users, providing easy access to
catalogue-, inventory-, browse- and general textual information.

ISIS can be accessed with World Wide Web by URL:
        <A HREF=http://www.dfd.dlr.de>http://www.dfd.dlr.de</A>

and clicking on `Information Services (ISIS)` or `Accessing ISIS` (telnet).

ISIS can also be accessed by telnet directly:
        input: telnet isis.dfd.dlr.de
        user: dlrpid
        password: -

Other procedures (modem or X-25) to access ISIS are described as 'Supplemen-
tary Information' for data centers (keyword 'ISIS'. Access presumes the in-
stallation of the client software (available free of charge) which can be
easily done by users (supplied by DLR/DFD).

Digital and photographic products may be ordered at DFD - Help Desk,see Data
Center Contact.
There is also available on CD-ROM and on Web a set of image sample products
as well as general and specific information about the X-SAR missions. This
'user-kit' can be accessed via Web with URL:

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

Mission Objective:
Please see the relevant SIR-C/X-SAR Mission description contained in the
references and as Supplementary Information for "sensor"(X-SAR).

There were two Missions with the following time frame:
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-59:
Start_Date: 1994-04-09
Stop_Date: 1994-04-20
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-68:
Start_Date: 1994-09-30
Stop_Date: 1994-10-11
Worldwide coverage and map prints are available on World Wide Web (see below).

Data Set Content:
The SSC data set contains range and azimuth compressed SAR image data which
are complex and kept in the slant range representation. The data are
processed to full range and azimuth resolution, hence no look
processing is applied. The data elements are presented in 16 bit real
plus 16 bit imaginary format.
Information regarding instrument and platform as well as processing,
calibration and image quality is appended.
The product is presented in range-line order. Range lines are
deskewed to zero Doppler lines and organised in ascending time
reference. The data set contains a scene of app. 100 km in sensor
flight direction and a maximum of 3870 samples across track. The actual
swath width is dependent on the chosen mission parameters like the
incidence angle.

Intended Use:
This product shall be considered by scientific users who are interested
in the SAR system itself, for example for calibration purposes. The
data contains both amplitude and phase information of the SAR imaging
process. No look processing for speckle reduction is performed in
order to additionally preserve the full bandwidth in the product.
Therefore, the user has full flexibility in order to gain a full
spatial resolution image by interpolation and detection of the complex
pixel or to control the radiometric resolution by look overlay or
weighted pixel averaging.
Another application of this product is the extraction of any desired
look out of the complex 'data'. This can be performed for special
applications by the user himself, making use of the Doppler centroid
information supplied in the ancillary data record.

Input Data:
Input data are X-SAR raw data and ancillary data from HDDC and
orbit data from the PATH tape provided by the Mission Control Center.

Processing Algorithm:
Signal processing is performed by two-dimensional matched filtering in
range and azimuth direction. In order not to alter the spectral content
of the SAR data no windows are applied during range and azimuth
processing. During a preprocessing step, Doppler parameters are
calculated from orbit data and the SAR raw data itself. The azimuth
processing bandwidth is chosen to be the same as for the MGD product.
The bandwidth is maintained through the whole correlation process, i.e.
no look processing is applied.
The product is sampled with the same rate as the raw data, i.e. in
azimuth direction with the PRF and in range with the coarse or fine
resolution mode sampling rate. The data are kept in the slant range
domain, i.e. no slant to ground projection is performed.

Calibration:
The SSC product is fully calibrated.

  Spacecraft Brief Description
    DMSP  5D-2/F10  is  one  of  a  series  of  meteorological  satellites
    developed   and   operated   by   the  Air  Force  under  the  Defense
    Meteorological  Satellite  Program  (DMSP).   This program, previously
    known   as   DAPP  (Data  Acquisition  and  Processing  Program),  was
    classified  until  March  1973.   The  objective of this program is to
    provide  global  visual  and  infrared cloudcover data and specialized
    environmental  data  to  support  Department  of  Defense  operational
    weather  analysis  and  forecasting  requirements.  Operationally, the
    program  consists  of  two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits,
    with  the  ascending  node  of  one satellite in early morning and the
    other at local noon.  The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four
    sections:  (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment
    requiring   precise   alignment;   (2)  an  equipment  support  module
    containing  the  electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological
    sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing
    the  third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction
    control  equipment;  and  (4)  a  9.29-sq-m  solar  cell  panel.   The
    spacecraft  stabilization  is controlled by a combination flywheel and
    magnetic  control  coil  system  so that sensors are maintained in the
    desired  earth-looking  mode.   One  feature is the precision-pointing
    accuracy  of  the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor
    and  an  updated  ephemeris  navigation system.  This allows automatic
    geographical  mapping  of  the  digital imagery to the nearest picture
    element.    The  operational  linescan  system  is  the  primary  data
    acquisition  system  that  provides  real-time or stored, multi-orbit,
    day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds.  A supplementary
    sensor   package  contains  five  special  sensors:  (1)  a  microwave
    temperature   sounder,   (2)   an  advanced  X-ray  detector,  (3)  an
    ionospheric/scintillation  monitor,  (4)  a precipitating electron/ion
    spectrometer,   and  (5)  a  microwave  imager.   Either  recorded  or
    real-time  data  are  transmitted  to  ground-receiving  sites  by two
    redundant S-band transmitters.  Recorded data are read out to tracking
    sites  located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and at Loring AFB, Maine,
    and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB,
    Nebraska.   Real-time  data  are  read  out  at  mobile tactical sites
    located  around  the  world.   Additional  information concerning this
    satellite  can  be  found in the report by D. A. Nichols, 'The defense
    meteorological  satellite  program,' Optical Engineering, v. 14, n. 4,
    p. 273, July-August 1975.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

Mission Objective:
Please see the relevant SIR-C/X-SAR Mission description contained in the
references and as Supplementary Information for "sensor"(X-SAR).

There were two Missions with the following time frame:
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-59:
Start_Date: 1994-04-09
Stop_Date: 1994-04-20
- Space Shuttle Mission STS-68:
Start_Date: 1994-09-30
Stop_Date: 1994-10-11
Worldwide coverage and map prints are available on World Wide Web (see below).

Data Set Content:
The GTC data set contains a X-SAR detected image, represented in a
uniform, preselected cartographic presentation. The image axes (i.e.
the row and column direction of the pixels) are parallel to the
cartographic coordinate system used.
The cartographic system used for worldwide reference is the Universal
Transversal Mercator System (UTM) .
The SAR inherent geometric terrain distortions, which are introduced to
SAR imagery due to actual terrain height and SAR-sidelooking geometry,
will be restituted to the best possible degree, to achieve map
reference even in regions of layover and shadow.
Of course, the terrain height restitution, which is basically a
resampling in range direction, can only be as exact as the Digital
Elevation Model (DEM). The planimetric accuracy will depend on DEM
accuracy. Accuracy for geocoded products means how well the geocoded
product fits the map reference. The availability of DEM data will be
the most restrictive impact on the generation of this product.

Intended Use:
Geocoded data will be available after availability of off-line
processed precision products and the required DEMs. Geocoded data sets
can be used by the scientific or commercial community which will refer
the actual SAR data to geographic/cartographic places. Terrain
corrected products are intended for applications where high absolute
and relative geometric accuracy is required, even in hilly terrain.

Input Data:
-  The standard MGD product formatted in GEOS, including parameters used
   for the slant to ground range projection.
-  Orbit data from the PATH tape annotated in the MGD product
-  Digital Elevation Model
-  Map projection constants to be applied

Processing Algorithm:
The geocoding is based on the same data as for ellipsoid correction
geocoding except:
    - a precise digital elevation model (DEM) is used to set up the
      radargrammetric mapping function for each point on earth
    - azimuth timing information within the processor (i.e. The range
      line must be annotated with the zero-Doppler orbit time.)
    - the earth to image is computed for each point rather than for only
      a grid - no oversampling is applied
    - no radiometric correction is done due to terrain induced radiometric
      distortions (layover, foreshortening, shadow)
      A special GIM product will be available for follow-on investigations
      on this topic
    - some automatic/interactive tiepointing will be performed to enhance
      the overall geometric accuracy of the product

Product Parameter:

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-03-01<br><pre>

The  Atmospheric  Trace  Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment was
flown on the Space Shuttle STS-51B as part of the Spacelab-3 laboratory
to  demonstrate  the  capability  to  monitor environmental  quality
by  surveying the  atmosphere  for  trace constituents  and  by  identifying
their  sources, flow patterns, and decay  mechanisms.  The ATMOS experiment
objective  was  to determine concentration profiles for a large number of
stratospheric  species for altitudes from  20 to 80 km, with a vertical
resolution of 2 km. The ATMOS instrument viewed the sun through the
stratosphere and measured the spectral absorption of solar energy. Each
data-taking run was initiated before the sun emerged from or disappeared
behind the earth.  Data from the instrument for these sunrise and sunset limb
encounters were interferograms that were processed on the ground to
provide absorption spectra.  ATMOS also collected IR solar spectral data
on the molecular processes occuring near the Sun's surface and on the
physical structure and composition of the Sun's chromosphere and
photosphere. The instrument was a continuous-scanning Fourier spectrometer
that operated in the 2- to 16-micrometer  wavelength  region and generated
one interferogram each  second, with a spectral resolution of 0.01 (1/cm).
The ATMOS instrument is part of NASA/JPL's long-term atmospheric
measurement program. ATMOS was also flown on ATLAS-1 and ATLAS-2 as
part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth Progrm (MtPE). ATMOS will be
flown on subsequent ATLAS shuttle missions.

85-034A-14A: Trace and Minor Gas Mixing Ratio Profiles

This set of trace and minor gas volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles was
supplied by the experimenter on one 5 1/4-inch floppy disk in
IBM-compatible, ASCII format. The data were acquired during the
Shuttle flight of Spacelab 3 in April-May 1985. Profiles for more
than 25 atmospheric species, including CO and halogenated
hydrocarbons, were retrieved from high-resolution (0.01 cm-1
unapodized), IR (2-16 micrometer), solar occultation spectra. They
cover both the Northern Hemisphere (at about 30 deg N.) and the
Southern Hemisphere (at about 47 deg S.) at altitudes that range from
10 to 150 km, with an average resolution of 4.1 km. For most of the
species, separate profiles for sunrises (.SR) and sunsets (.SS) are
listed. Besides the data files, there is also an occultation file
that lists all occultations by longitude and latitude in chronological
order, a physical model file that tabulates models that are derived
from the spectra and are used in establishing the VMR profiles, and an
information file that documents the contents of the disk.

85-034A-14B:  Atmospheric IR Spectra Data

This data set consists of individual infrared spectra taken by the
ATMOS experiment on Spacelab-3 (STS-51B) in April-May 1985. The data
resides on 22 magnetic tapes and consists of absorption spectra of the
Earth's atmosphere from 5 to 140 km covering the 600-4800 wavenumber
region of the infrared with a spectral resolution of 0.01 cm^-1 and a
vertical resolution of 4 km, derived from the Fourier transformation
of the interferometric data. The Fourier transforms were made at the
ATMOS Data Analysis Facility at JPL. The individual spectra are filled
in the order in which they were taken during the shuttle flight. The
format of each tape consists of a short header followed by the
spectra, with one file per spectrum. The data were derived from 7
sunrise occultations in the southern hemisphere and 13 sunset
occultations in the norther hemisphere.

85-034A-14C:  ATMOS IR Spectral Atlas, Hardcopy

This data set is an atmospheric atlas that constitutes Vol. II of 'A
High Resolution Atlas of the Infrared Spectrum of the Sun and the
Earth Atmosphere from Space'. The atlas contains spectra covering
altitudes from the top of the mesosphere (about 80 km) to the lower
stratosphere (20 km). The spectra were compiled from the zonal
averages of sunset occultations, with a frequency range of 650 to 3380
cm**-1 and a high spectral resolution of 0.01 cm**-1. The spectra were
ratioed against the zonal average solar specrum in order to remove the
lines of solar origin, instrument photometric background shape, and
the instrument lines and artifacts. The resulting spectra, in
transmittance form, contain only lines that originate in the Earth's
atmosphere. Besides the hardcopy, NSSDC is also distributing the raw
unprocessed spectra on magnetic tapes.

85-034A-14D:  Solar IR Spectral Atlas, Hardcopy

This data set is a solar atlas that constitutes Vol. I of 'A High
Resolution Atlas of the Infrared Spectrum of the Sun and the Earth
Atmosphere from Space.' The atlas contains spectra that were compiled
from solar occulation observations made in the frequency range of 650
to 4800 cm**-1, with a high spectral resolution of 0.01 cm**-1. The
spectra are free from absorptions due to constituents of the Earth's
atmosphere. In addition to lines of solar origin, however, there are
artifacts including instrument residual absorption lines due to gas in
the instrument compartment. These contaminous lines are much narrower
than the solar absorption lines because of the big Doppler broadening
of the solar lines. Hence, the sunset zonal averages are displayed
above the sunrise zonal averages; any line shift in positions between
the sunset and sunrise spectra can be easily identified as of
instrumental origin. Besides the hardcopy, NSSDC is also distributing
the raw unprocessed spectra on magnetic tapes.

85-034A-14E:  Raw Solar IR Spectral Data Tapes

This dataset was taken by the ATMOS experiment on Spacelab-3 (STS-51B)
during April-May 1985. The dataset consists of solar-only spectra. The
dataset is a very high signal-to-noise infrared solar spectra from 2.1
to 16 micrometers and was obtained by averaging large numbers of
solar-only spectra. The dataset resides on only 1 magnetic tape
consisting of 55 files, each an individual solar spectrum. The tape
consists of a header followed by the solar spectra records.

  Spacecraft Brief Description
    DMSP  5D-2/F11  is  one  of  a  series  of  meteorological  satellites
    developed   and   operated   by   the  Air  Force  under  the  Defense
    Meteorological  Satellite  Program  (DMSP).   This program, previously
    known   as   DAPP  (Data  Acquisition  and  Processing  Program),  was
    classified  until  March  1973.   The  objective of this program is to
    provide  global  visual  and  infrared cloudcover data and specialized
    environmental  data  to  support  Department  of  Defense  operational
    weather  analysis  and  forecasting  requirements.  Operationally, the
    program  consists  of  two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits,
    with  the  ascending  node  of  one satellite in early morning and the
    other at local noon.  The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four
    sections:  (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment
    requiring   precise   alignment;   (2)  an  equipment  support  module
    containing  the  electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological
    sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing
    the  third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction
    control  equipment;  and  (4)  a  9.29-sq-m  solar  cell  panel.   The
    spacecraft  stabilization  is controlled by a combination flywheel and
    magnetic  control  coil  system  so that sensors are maintained in the
    desired  earth-looking  mode.   One  feature is the precision-pointing
    accuracy  of  the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor
    and  an  updated  ephemeris  navigation system.  This allows automatic
    geographical  mapping  of  the  digital imagery to the nearest picture
    element.    The  operational  linescan  system  is  the  primary  data
    acquisition  system  that  provides  real-time or stored, multi-orbit,
    day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds.  A supplementary
    sensor   package  contains  five  special  sensors:  (1)  a  microwave
    temperature    sounder,    (2)   an   X-ray   spectrometer,   (3)   an
    ionospheric/scintillation  monitor,  (4)  a precipitating electron/ion
    spectrometer,  and (5) a microwave imager.  A magnetometer may also be
    included  on  this  spacecraft.  Either recorded or real-time data are
    transmitted   to   ground-receiving  sites  by  two  redundant  S-band
    transmitters.  Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at
    Fairchild  AFB,  Washington,  and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by
    SATCOM  to  Air  Force  Global  Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska.
    Real-time  data  are  read out at mobile tactical sites located around
    the  world.   Additional  information concerning this satellite can be
    found  in  the  report  by  D. A. Nichols, 'The defense meteorological
    satellite  program,'  Optical  Engineering,  v.  14,  n.  4,  p.  273,
    July-August 1975.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-02<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between ISCCP data, GCM
parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

The MODIS Airbourne Simulator (MAS) is a modified Daedalus Wildfire
scanning spectrometer which flies on a NASA ER-2 and provides spectral
information similar to that which will be provided by the Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), scheduled to be launched
on the EOS-AM platform in 1998 (King et al. 1992).  The principal
investigators for the MAS are Dr. Michael King (NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt
MD), and Dr. Paul Menzel (NOAA/NESDIS, Madison WI).

In November/December 1991, the modified Wildfire instrument was flown
during the FIRE Cirrus-II experiment onboard a NASA ER-2 in
coordination with other aircraft and satellites over the Coffeyville,
KS field site as well as the Texas and Louisiana Gulf coast.

The MAS spectrometer acquires high spatial resolution imagery in the
wavelength range of 0.55 to 14.3 microns. A total of 50 spectral bands
are available in this range, and the digitizer can be configured to
collect data from any 12 of these bands. The digitizer was configured
with four 10-bit channels and seven 8-bit channels.  The MAS
spectrometer was mated to a scanner subassembly which collected image
data with an IFOV of 2.5 mrad, giving a ground resolution of 50 meters
from 20000 meters altitude, and a cross track scan width of 85.92
degrees. The data granules were written using the self documenting
file storage format provided through the netCDF interface routines
included in the HDF libraries.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-06-15<br><pre>

This entry describes two similar data products containing vertical
profiles of stratospheric ozone.  They are derived from observations
made by the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE I and SAGE
II) onboard the Application Explorer Mission II (AEM-2) satellite and
the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), respectively.

The ozone profiles are inverted from solar irradiances measured during
solar occultation at 600 nm by SAGE I and SAGE II.  There are 15
sunrise and sunset events per day, with each event sweeping over
various latitude ranges (from approximately 80 deg N. to 80 deg S.)
and separated by 24 deg longitude.  Vertical profiles of ozone number
density (concentration) and volume mixing ratio cover from cloud top
(>10 km) to 45 km at 1-km resolution, and the uncertainty in the value
is about 10%.

Except for the first year of each launch, each tape contains data from
December of one year to November of the following year.  All tapes are
written in the CDC 60-bit format.  This data set covers SAGE I data
from February 1979 to November 1981, and SAGE II data from October
1984 to the present.

SAGE I and SAGE II Ozone (O3) profiles are also available in Common
Data Format (CDF) through the NASA Climate Data System (NCDS) at the
Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).

SAGE I and SAGE II O3 profiles are also in CDF on the Greenhouse
Effect Detection Experiment (GEDEX) CD-ROM along with other SAGE I and
SAGE II profiles and other related satellite measurements.

Closely related to this data set are the vertical profiles of ozone
data from the Nimbus 7 Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere
(LIMS), although the uncertainty is 20%.  The LIMS data are available
from NSSDC.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-19<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (July 1 - July 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

Microwave radiometer with steerable antenna was used for the
measurement of column amounts of liquid water in clouds, and
precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere.  Antenna was directed to
the zenith during FIRE I.

Operating frequencies:  20.6, 31.65, 90.0 GHz

Spatial resolution:     2.5 deg antenna beamwidth
   (44m @ 1.0 km range)

Temporal resolution:    60 sec

Estimated accuracies
     Liquid water:      +/- 10 percent or better (absolute)
   Noise level +/- .025 mm
     Water vapor:       0.08 cm rms relative to radiosonde
     (Vapor and liquid data retrievals were from 20.6 and 31.65 GHz
      data only)

Radiometer location:  San Nicolas Island, northwestern tip
        33.27N,  119.58W

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-06-27<br><pre>

The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) on board the Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS), NOAA-9, and NOAA-10 satellites  consists of two
instrument packages: a scanning radiometer with three narrow-field-of-view
(NFOV) sensors (0.2-5, 5-200, and 0.2-200 microns) and a nonscanning cavity
radiometer which includes two fixed wide FOV sensors that view the entire disk
of the Earth, two fixed medium FOV sensors limiting the view to 1000 km in
diameter, and a fixed solar monitor.

These missions had a design requirement of one year and a goal of two  years.
The ERBS spacecraft was placed in orbit in October 1984, and the  instruments
began operating November 1984. The NOAA-9 spacecraft was  launched in December
1984, and the instruments began operating February  1985. NOAA-10 was placed in
orbit in September 1986 and began operating  in October 1986. The ERBE scanning
radiometers operated until February  1990 on ERBS, until January 20 1987 on
NOAA-9, and until May 1989 on  NOAA-10.

The Raw Archival Tape data set (RAT, S-1) contains raw radiometric  counts for
all the sensors.  It also contains telemetry, ephemeris, attitude, and other
housekeeping data. The Processed Archival Tape data set (PAT, S-8) contains the
scanner and nonscanner radiometric measurements in engineering units, i.e.,
total, shortwave, and longwave (scanner only) radiances.  It also contains
scanner unfiltered measurements, the scene identified for each scanner pixel,
estimates of the radiant exitance at the top of the atmosphere (30 km) and
estimates of the radiant exitance from nonscanner instruments.

Each RAT or PAT tape image contains one day's worth of data per spacecraft. The
PAT is only produced for days that the scanner is  operational. Tapes images
are grouped by month and spacecraft and are available on 12-inch WORM optical
disks that were created on Optimum drives in an Adquidneck system.  The optical
disk  of the month also contains the combined satellite monthly products:
time-space averages (S-4), Scanner Earth Radiant Exitance and Albedo (S-9) and
Nonscanner Earth Radiant Exitance and Albedo (S-10).  A monthly product summary
is produced for the RAT and PAT data,  which includes an explanation of the
data coverage for the month.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve data
products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general circulation
models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to seek the basic
understanding of the interaction of physical processes in determining life
cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems and the radiative
properties of these clouds during their life cycles and (2) to investigate
the interrelationships between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and
higher space and time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13
- December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The PRT-6 radiometer is a chopped bolometer which can passively sense
infrared targets within the spectral range of 2 to 20 microns.  The
radiometer is configured to accept optics with either a 2 or 20 degree
field of view.  The output is a voltage signal sampled at a frequency
of 1/0.1 sec.  The average of the sampled voltage was recorded every
10 seconds, which is nominally linear with respect to the incident
radiant power.

For the FIRE ASTEX deployment the instrument was configured with a
field of view of 2 degrees and made use of an interference filter.
This filter effectively limited the spectral bandpass to 885 to 945
inverse centimeters.  Most of the measurements were made with the
instrument pointing vertically upward, although for brief intervals
zenith angles of 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 degrees were also utilized.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-06-16<br><pre>

The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) is a payload
installed aboard the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) that was
launched on October 5, 1984, from NASA Space Shuttle Flight 41-G.  The
SAGE II instrument is a multi-channel spectral radiometer that
measures the attenuation of solar radiation at seven wavelengths as
they pass through the Earth's atmosphere during the spacecraft's
sunrise and sunset events.  In one day's time the ERBS spacecraft
encounters approximately fifteen sunrise and fifteen sunset events.
The SAGE II instrument captures solar radiation data for each event.
The data span a vertical distance from about 140 kilometers to the
horizon or a cloud top.  The ground-track slew distance during data
capture varies directly with the duration of the event.  Event
duration will vary with the beta angle of the event; the larger the
absolute beta angle, the longer the event will be.

The Ozone Monthly Average data set is a Level 3 data product which
consists of the ozone mixing ratio averages from the Ozone Profiles
data set.

The data are available in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).  This data
set is archived at the EOSDIS Langley DAAC in Hampton, Virginia.

The joint US/French TOPEX/POSEIDON mission, launched in the summer of 1992,
consists of a satellite dedicated to obtaining global measurements of
sea-surface height using radar altimetry.  From the resulting maps of
ocean-surface topography, the speed and direction of ocean currents can be
calculated.  The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and
the French Space Agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), have
selected 38 teams from the international scientific community to receive
regularly processed, validated, and calibrated ocean-topography data from
TOPEX/POSEIDON.  The science teams will use these data to develop and refine
ocean models relating changes in ocean currents with atmospheric and climatic
patterns.

TOPEX/POSEIDON is a core element of the international World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) and Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere (TOGA) seagoing
measurements programs.  Analysis of the satellite altimetry data, together with
WOCE and TOGA ocean measurements, will yield major advances in our quantitative
understanding of the circulation of the oceans and their influence on climate.

TOPEX/POSEIDON builds on previous missions.  With improved mission
characteristics and instrumentation, TOPEX/POSEIDON will obtain measurements of
global ocean surface topography with unprecedented precision - approximately
two cm.  The objectives of the optimized altimetric mission are to:

o Study ocean circulation and its interaction with the atmosphere, to better
understand climate change;
o Improve our knowledge of heat transport in the ocean;
o Model global tides;
o Study the marine gravity field;
o Calculate sea-level variations on both global and local scales.

The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite has a design lifetime of five years.
The orbit is at an altitude of 1336 km, inclination of 66 degrees,
and repeating every ten days.

Instruments:

o Dual-Frequency Radar Altimeter (ALT): 13.6 GHz, 5.30 GHz; Measures height of
satellite above the sea, wind speed, wave height, and ionospheric correction.

o TOPEX Microwave Radiometer (TMR): 18.0 GHz, 21.0 GHz, 37.0 GHz; Measures
water vapor along the path viewed by the altimeter; this measure corrects the
altimeter data for pulse delay due to water vapor.

o Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA): Used with ground-based lasers to track the
satellite and to calibrate and verify altimeter measurements of height.

o Single-Frequency Solid-State Radar Altimeter (SSALT): 13.65 GHz; Measures
height of satellite above the sea, wind speed, and wave height.

o DORIS Dual-Doppler Tracking System Receiver: 401.25 MHz, 2036.25 MHz;
Receives signals from ground stations for satellite tracking, gravity field
measurements, and ionospheric correction for the SSALT.

o GPS Demonstration Receiver (GPSDR): 1227.6 MHz, 1575.4 MHz; Provides a new
tracking data type (range difference) for precision orbit determination.

--------

A new bulletin board named TOPEX.Poseidon was established in January 1993 by
Lee Fu (NASA Project Scientist) and Michel Lefebvre (CNES Project Scientist)
The board is on and accessible to all ScienceNet (OMNET) users.   The project
teams at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and CNES's Toulouse Space Center will
use this board to disseminate information on the status of the mission and
significant events.

Science data users are encouraged to use this board as a forum  for exchange of
information about the data (new findings, handy  software, reports of
anomalies, etc.).  Discussions of significant  issues that are of general
interests to the TOPEX/Poseidon  community are also appropriate for the board.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-27<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

These data were collected by the University of Utrecht (The
Netherlands) during ASTEX experimental campaign, June 1992, at the
surface site of Santa Maria (36.99 N; 25.17W; ASL=50M).

Every file contains the following variables:

    -time (UTC): Universal Time Coordinated time.
   Data were taken every 2 minutes.

    -T6(C):  Temperature at 6 meters.
   Accuracy of the temperature sensor 0.2 C

    -T2(C):  Temperature at 2 meters.
   Accuracy of the temperature sensor 0.2 C

    -rh6(%):  Relative humidity at 6 meters.
   Accuracy of the relative humidity sensor 2 %.
   Above 90% the measurements are less accurate.
   Highest value measured by the sensor: 95%.

    -rh2(%):  Relative humidity at 2 meters.
                 Accuracy of the relative humidity sensor 2 %.
   Above 90% the measurements lose accuracy.
   Highest value measured by the sensor: 99%.

    -ff6(m/s)    Wind speed at 6 meters.
   Accuracy of the sensor 0.2 m/s.

    -dd(deg)     Wind direction at 6 meters.
   Accuracy of the sensor 4 deg.

    -fsin(W/m2)  Incoming shortwave radiation at 1.5 meters.
   Pyranometer measures the irradiance between 305
   to 2800 nm with a precision 2 W/m2.

    -fsou(W/m2)  Outcoming shortwave radiation at 1.5 meters.
   Pyranometer measures the irradiance between 305
   to 2800 nm with a precision 2 W/m2.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface based instruments for in situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

The NASA ER-2 is a high altitude, single pilot aircraft based at Ames
Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, and deployed globally in support
of a variety of atmospheric research projects. It has a maximum
altitude of 70,000 feet (21 km), a range of 3000 nautical miles, a
maximum flight duration of 8 hours (nominal 6.5 hours) and a top speed
of 410 knots true air speed. The aircraft accommodates about 2700
pounds (1200 kg) of payload.  For the TOGA COARE campaign, the ER-2
payload consisted of a variety of radiometers, a lidar, a conductivity
probe and a camera.

FLIGHT INFORMATION

The following table relates MAS data files to ER-2 and DC-8 flight
numbers and to the UTC dates for the 13 mission flights of the
NASA/TOGA COARE campaign and 2 additional flights of the ER-2 on which
MAS data was acquired. The objectives (Obj) column is included for the
convenience of the user; the mission objective defaulted to radiation
(Rad) unless convection (Con) was forecast in the target area.

INSTRUMENT INFORMATION

The MODIS Airborne Simulator is a visible/infrared imaging radiometer
that was mounted, for this campaign, in the right aft wing pod of the
ER-2 aircraft. Through cross track scanning to the aircraft direction
of flight, the MAS instrument builds a continuous sequence image of
the atmosphere surface features under the aircraft. Wavelength
channels of the instrument are selected for specific cloud and surface
remote sensing applications. Also the channels are those which will be
incorporated in measurements by the spaceborne MODIS instrument. The
MAS instrument acquires eleven simultaneous wavelengths with 100
meters or better resolution at the surface.

Principles of Operation: The MAS Spectrometer acquires high spatial
resolution imagery in the wavelength range 0.55 to 14.3 microns. A
total of 50 spectral bands are available in this range, and currently
the digitizer is configured before each mission to record any 12 of
these bands during flight. For all pre-1994 MAS missions the
12-channel digitizer was configured with four 10-bit channels and
seven 8-bit channels. The MAS spectrometer is mated to a scanner
sub-assembly which collects image data with an IFOV of 2.5 mrad,
giving a ground resolution of 50 meters from 20,000 meters altitude,
and a cross track scan width of 85.92 degrees. A 50 channel digitizer
which records all 50 spectral bands at 12 bit resolution became
operational in January 1995.

DATA ORGANIZATION

Data Format: The archive tapes are created by writing each output data
file (1 straight-line flight track) to tape in fixed-length blocks of
16384 bytes, in time ascending order. One end-of-file (EOF) mark is
written at the end of the data blocks for each file, and an extra EOF
is written at the end of the data on the tape.  The last block of each
file has good data at the start of the block and unused bytes (filled
with null characters) at the end. Information on the length of the
file is encoded in the header when the file is created. No file name,
protection, or ownership information is written onto the archive
tape. All information necessary to identify the file is stored in the
file itself.

Documentation: In addition to this document, please obtain Volume 3,
MODIS Airborne Simulator Level 1B Data Users Guide, resident in this
directory in postscript file MAS_Usr_Guide.ps.

Browse Products: There are 2 GIF image files per flight line, named
93ddd??v.gif and 93ddd??i.gif where 93 is the year, ddd the Julian day
of the flight, ?? the flight line number, and v or i, indicating
respectively visible (VIS) or Infrared (IR) imagery.

Images from each flight, accompanied by a flight statistics summary
file, reside in a subdirectory named with the date of the flight
(02feb93) under mas/images.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-29<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

A subset of the ISCCP Stage DX Cloud Product (Revised Algorithm) are
included for the FIRE Marine Stratocumulus region.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

The development of parameterizations requires an understanding of the
processes that generate, maintain, and dissipate boundary layer
clouds. This development is currently impeded by lack of understanding
of the transition from stratocumulus clouds to trade cumulus clouds
and the factors that control cloud type and amount in the boundary
layer.  The Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition EXperiment (ASTEX) was
designed to address key issues related to stratocumulus to trade
cumulus transition and mode selection.  ASTEX involved intensive
measurements from several platforms operating from 1-28 June 1992 in
the area of the Azores and Madeira Islands.  The purpose was to study
how the transition and mode selection are effected by 1) cloud-top
entrainment instability, 2) diurnal decoupling and clearing due to
solar absorption, 3) patchy drizzle and a transition to horizontally
inhomogeneous clouds through decoupling, 4) mesoscale variability in
cloud thickness and associated mesoscale circulations, and 5) episodic
strong subsidence lowering the inversion below the LCL.  Detailed
descriptions of the scientific goals of ASTEX are in the FIRE Phase
II: Research plan (1989) and in the ASTEX Operations Plan (1992).

This ASCII formatted data set includes data collected aboard the
University of Washington's Corsair 131A airplane.  Several different
probes were used to gather data on the liquid water content of clouds,
the droplet radius/diameter, and condensation nuclei measurements.
All sulfur parameter measurements were made using filter methods.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-03-14<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFD (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13
- December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

This data set contains altitude vs. time images (RTIs) of cirrus
clouds collected during FIRE Cirrus 2 at Coffeyville, Kansas.  The
images were sampled at 5 km intervals in the cross wind scans.

DATA ACCESS

The TOGA COARE International Project Office is in charge of
distributing all information related to TOGA COARE.  The FTP address
for the TCIPO is <A HREF=ftp://tcdm.coare.ucar.edu/>ftp://tcdm.coare.ucar.edu/</A>; the URL for the TCIPO

is <A HREF=http://www.coare.ucar.edu/>http://www.coare.ucar.edu/</A>.  Essential TOGA COARE information can

also be obtained from the University of Delaware's CDIU at
<A HREF=http://diu.cms.udel.edu/coare/>http://diu.cms.udel.edu/coare/</A>.


Information about the LIP data are available from the NASA GSFC DAAC
via ftp from daac.gsfc.nasa.gov in subdirectory
pub/toga_coare/aircraft/nasa_dc8/lip (/nasa_er2/lip) or via the WWW
using the URL <A HREF=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/WORKINPROGRESS/TOGA/dc8_lip.html/>http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/WORKINPROGRESS/TOGA/dc8_lip.html/</A>

(er2_lip.html).  The actual data can be requested from Dr. Richard
Blakeslee at NASA/MSFC. (richard.blakeslee@msfc.nasa.gov).

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high-level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface-based instruments for in-situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Lightning Instrument Package (LIP) on the DC-8 consists of four
electric field mills, a lightning location detector (i.e., a 3M
Stormscope), and the associated data system.  The LIP90 is an
independent subset of the LIP that has been integrated onto the ER-2
in recent years. LIP90 consists of two electrical field mills,
conductivity probe and data systems.

OBJECTIVES

The primary objectives for the LIP deployment in TOGA COARE were:

- to develop and improve algorithms employing multi-sensor data for
precipitation estimation;
- to investigate the structure, kinematics and evolution of tropical
thunderstorms and relate these to lightning; and
- to study the electric fields, currents and charges in the vicinity of
convective storms and determine the storm's contribution to the global
electric circuit.

MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS AND CHARACTERISTICS

The electric field mills measure the vector components of the electric
field over a dynamic range from less than 1 V/m to over 10**6
V/m. Hence fair weather electric fields as well as large thunderstorm
fields were measured. The field mills also provided a measurement of
the electric charge on the aircraft.  Abrupt electric field changes
are used to identify lightning discharges (flash type and
characteristics, storm lightning activity, etc.). The 3M Stormscope on
the DC-8 is a lightning direction finder that detects lightning
spherics, obtains a bearing to the discharge, and estimates the
distance. The 3M Stormscope can detect lightning out to about 200
nautical miles from the aircraft.  The conductivity probe on the ER-2
provided a measure of the air conductivity at the aircraft
altitude. Conductivity contributions due to positive and negative ions
are measured simultaneously. All measurements were recorded with a
PC-based data system and archived on an Exabyte 8mm tape drive. Data
is continuously recorded throughout the duration of each mission.

DATA PRODUCTS

A.  Electric Field Components and Aircraft Self-Charge (DC-8, ER-2)

Period:         Continuous record, entire flight
Resolution:     10 HZ
Comments:       Total lightning (cloud-to-ground, intracloud)
                can be determined from electric field changes
                in the data.  Data will also provide
                information on the electrical structure in the
                vicinity of thunderstorms.  Maxwell, displacement
                and conduction current densities can be derived
                using the electric field and air conductivity
                measurements from other aircraft and
                from a ground based lightning location network
                located near the IFA.

B.  Stormscope Data (i.e., lightning location data) (DC-8)

Period:         Continuous record, entire flight
Resolution:     SLP video recording (lightning detection up to
                200 nautical miles from the DC-8)
Comments:       VCR video tapes will be made available


C.  Air Conductivity (ER-2)

Period:         Continuous record, entire flight
Resolution:     10 Hz
Comments:       Simultaneous measurements provided of both polar
                components of the air conductivity (i.e.,
                contributions from positive and negative ions).
                Storm electric conduction current densities can
                be derived when used with electric field data.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface based instruments for in situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

AIRCRAFT

The NASA ER-2 is a high altitude, single pilot aircraft based at Ames
Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, and deployed globally in support
of a variety of atmospheric research projects. It has a maximum
altitude of 70,000 feet (21 km), a range of 3000 nautical miles, a
maximum flight duration of 8 hours (nominal 6.5 hours) and a top speed
of 410 knots true air speed. The aircraft accommodates about 2700
pounds (1200 kg) of payload.  For the TOGA COARE campaign, the ER-2
payload consisted of a variety of radiometers, a lidar, a conductivity
probe and a camera.

INSTRUMENT INFORMATION

The MIR was flown on the NASA ER-2 from 12 January through 24 February
1993. The overall measurement objectives of the MIR include the
evaluation of millimeter wavelengths for the detection and estimation
of convective rainfall, and the study of the effects of cloud
microphysical structures on rainfall estimation and water vapor
profiles. The collected data will be useful in developing algorithms
for interpreting data collected from future spaceborne microwave
sensors such as Advanced Microwave Sensor Unit (AMSU) that will be
flown onboard the EOS PM satellite.

The MIR was nadir-oriented in the forward compartment of the right
wing pod of the ER-2 aircraft. It scannned in a plane perpendicular to
the direction of flight with a swath of +/- 50 degrees from nadir.
Each scan took 3 seconds and produced 57 brightness temperature
values.

The following table summarizes some characteristics of the MIR
radiometer:

Channel         Bandwidth       Temperature Res.        Beamwidth
 89  GHz        1.0 GHz         <0.2 K                  3.5 Deg.
150             1.0             <0.2                    3.5
220             3.0             <0.3                    3.5
184             1.0             <0.4                    3.5
186             2.0             <0.3                    3.5
190             2.0             <0.5                    3.5


The MIR data consist of calibrated brightness temperatures in degrees
Kelvin at 89, 150, 183.3+/-1, 183.3+/-3, 183.3+/-7 and 220 GHz.

The total volume of the MIR data set is approximately 148 MB. There
are 12 MIR data files, each containing data from one mission flight of
the NASA ER-2. These files have a typical size of approximately 12.5
MB. The file naming convention is

                toga_flightXX.mir

where XX is a 2-digit flight number.

Flight coordination table: The following table relates MIR filenames
to ER-2 and DC-8 flight numbers and dates for the 13 mission flights
of the NASA/TOGA COARE campaign. Also included is ER-2 flight 93-061
of 7 February, that produced MIR data although it was not designated
as a mission flight.

Data format: The data are in IEEE 32-bit (floating point) words. Each
logical record has 359 words. The blocking factor is 20 and hence each
physical record has 28720 bytes (20 x 4 x 359).

Each logical record contains one calibrated MIR scan comprising
temporal, spatial and aircraft attitude information for the nadir
position (beam position 29) of the scan followed by a brightness
temperature value for each of 57 beam positions at all 6 MIR
frequencies.

data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

There are three types of NOAA wind profiler data, all have been
splined to a 25-meter vertical resolution and a 1-hour temporal
resolution.  Parameters include potential temperature derived from the
CLASS (CSU, Steve Cox) radiosonde (100 to 2300 M above sea level),
smoothed merged Pennsylvania State University (PSU) sodar and profiler
wind speeds and directions (300 to 2075 M above sea level) and derived
Richardson Numbers from these data (325-2050 M MSL).

     In order to determine the properties of a sample of sea-water
it is necessary first to obtain the sample.  For a surface sample,
all that is required is a bucket.  For subsurface samples a variety
of 'water sampling bottles' are available.

     These bottles are generally metal or plastic tubes with either
plug valves at each end (Nansen bottle) or spring loaded end caps
with rubber washers.  The bottle with the ends open is attached to
a wire and lowered to the desired depth.  There it is closed by the
tripping action of a messenger (a small metal weight) which slides
down the wire.  Generally a number of bottles (12 to 24) are
attached at predetermined intervals in series along the wire (a
'bottle cast') and closed in succession.  When the bottles have
been brought back to the deck the water samples are drawn through
a tap, following a routine designed to obtain a pure sample.  In
some designs, the bottle when tripped is released at its upper end
and rotates through 180 degrees about a hinge at its lower end
where it is clamped to the wire.  This is for the purpose of
operating the 'reversing thermometers' and leads to the bottles
being referred to as 'reversing bottles'.  In other designs, the
bottle remains stationary while a frame carrying the reversing
thermometers rotates.  A capacity of 1.25 liters is common for
these bottles but for special purposes, such as carbon-14 analysis,
larger bottles are used - up to several hundred liters capacity.

     Another arrangement of water bottles is in the form of a so-
called 'rosette sampler'.  In this, 12 to 20 water bottles are
mounted in a single frame which is attached to the end of the
oceanographic wire.  This has an electrical conductor incorporated;
the bottles can be closed when desired on electrical command from
the deck.  This rosette arrangement is generally used in
conjunction with a CTD sensor head with deck read-out so that water
samples can be obtained to check the CTD or to obtain confirmation
of interesting features in the water profile.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

The development of parameterizations requires an understanding of the
processes that generate, maintain, and dissipate boundary layer
clouds. This development is currently impeded by lack of understanding
of the transition from stratocumulus clouds to trade cumulus clouds
and the factors that control cloud type and amount in the boundary
layer.  The Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition EXperiment (ASTEX) was
designed to address key issues related to stratocumulus to trade
cumulus transition and mode selection.  ASTEX involved intensive
measurements from several platforms operating from 1-28 June 1992 in
the area of the Azores and Madeira Islands.  The purpose was to study
how the transition and mode selection are effected by 1) cloud-top
entrainment instability, 2) diurnal decoupling and clearing due to
solar absorption, 3) patchy drizzle and a transition to horizontally
inhomogeneous clouds through decoupling, 4) mesoscale variability in
cloud thickness and associated mesoscale circulations, and 5) episodic
strong subsidence lowering the inversion below the LCL.  Detailed
descriptions of the scientific goals of ASTEX are in the FIRE Phase
II: Research plan (1989) and in the ASTEX Operations Plan (1992).

The University of Washington Convair data are best considered raw at
this point and should be validated by comparing with data collected
from other platforms where possible if high accuracy is desired.

Of the three measures of liquid water content available from the
Convair, the Johnson-Williams (JW) hot-wire probe is considered the
most readily usable, although there is a significant drift in the
output that should be accounted for.  The Forward Scattering
Spectrometer Probe (FSSP) measured the liquid water content using
optical scattering principles.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (July 1 - July 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

Cirrus IFO-II was conducted from November 9 to December 8, 1991 in
Coffeyville, Kansas.  The NCAR King Air aircraft measured radiation
and microphysical properties of the cloud layers, in addition to
temperature, moisture, and air motions.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high-level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface-based instruments for in-situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

AIRCRAFT

The NASA ER-2 is a high altitude, single pilot aircraft based at Ames
Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, and deployed globally in support
of a variety of atmospheric research projects. It has a maximum
altitude of 70,000 feet (21 km), a range of 3000 nautical miles, a
maximum flight duration of 8 hours (nominal 6.5 hours) and a top speed
of 410 knots true air speed. The aircraft accommodates about 2700
pounds (1200 kg) of payload and offers the following science support
systems:

- Inertial navigation
- Satellite NBS Time Code receiver
- Navigation data recording system
- Real-time telemetry data link

For the TOGA COARE campaign, the ER-2 payload consisted of a variety
of radiometers, a lidar, a conductivity probe and a camera.

INSTRUMENT INFORMATION

The ER-2 navigation dataset consists of navigation parameters gathered
by the aircraft's onboard systems in support of the payload
instruments. It includes times and geo-referencing information which
can be used to determine temporal and spatial coordinates associated
with each measurement collected from the above instruments.

DATA CHARACTERISTICS

The ER-2 navigation dataset contains 18 ASCII files ranging in size
from approximately 1 MB to approximately 4 MB with a total volume for
the dataset of approximately 27 MB. Each file contains data from one
flight, of which 13 were mission flights and 5 were ferry or pilot
proficiency flights. The naming convention for the files is er2_X.dat,
where X is the flight number.

The following table relates the ER-2 NAV data files to ER-2 and DC-8
flight numbers and to the dates for the 13 mission flights of the
NASA/TOGA COARE campaign. The objectives column is included for the
convenience of the user; the mission objective was convection when it
was forecast in the target area and radiation when it was not.

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (July 1 - July 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

Cirrus IFO-I was conducted from October 13 to November 2, 1986 in
central Wisconsin.  The NCAR King Air aircraft measured radiation and
microphysical properties of the cloud layers, in addition to
temperature, moisture, and air motions.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>
    The  temperature,  geopotential height and wind fields are used for
    European stratospheric ozone research projects, such as EASOE and SESAME
    as well as other EU funded projects.

    The data are extracted from the ECMWF MARS archive.

    There are data for 12 UT every day from early November through April
    starting Nov. 1991.

    The data are transferred to NILU through the Norwegian Meteorological
    Institute.

    Data are ANALYSES (forecast hrs = 0) or FORECASTS of the isobaric
    meteorological parameters given above.
    Data are stored in the NASA Ames format number 3010 and are organized the
    following way:

    The first data line after the header is a line containing the first value
    of the independent variable (1000 hPa)  followed by the auxilliary
    variables.

    This line is then followed by a block of 250 lines containing the 3600
    geopotential heights in the format 15I5.
    Immediately after this block follows a new block with the temperatures,
    then a block with u-wind and a block with v-wind.

    After these four data blocks comes a line with the next value of the
    independent variable (850 hPa) followed by the auxilliary variables. This
    line is then followed by the same four data blocks as described above. This
    pattern is repeated for 700, 500, 400, 300, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30 and
    10 hPa.

    The data are on a 2.5x2.5 degree longitude/latitude grid starting at-177.5
    degrees east and 90 degrees north. The longitude is the most rapidly
    varying variable, which means that the second element is at
    -175.0 degrees east and 90 degrees north and so on.

    The last element of each block is the value at 177.5 degrees east and 30
    degrees north.

    The geographical position of element (i,j) in the matrix can be calculated
    as follows:

    Longitude = -177.5 + 2.5*(i-1) i=1,2,...,144
    Latitude  =   90.0 - 2.5*(j-1) j=1,2,..., 25

Data Set Progress: Ongoing (approximately yearly update)

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface based instruments for in situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

AIRCRAFT

The NASA ER-2 is a high altitude, single pilot aircraft based at Ames
Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, and deployed globally in support
of a variety of atmospheric research projects. It has a maximum
altitude of 70,000 feet (21 km), a range of 3000 nautical miles, a
maximum flight duration of 8 hours (nominal 6.5 hours) and a top speed
of 410 knots true air speed. The aircraft accommodates about 2700
pounds (1200 kg) of payload.  For the TOGA COARE campaign, the ER-2
payload consisted of a variety of radiometers, a lidar, a conductivity
probe and a camera.

INSTRUMENT INFORMATION

The Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer (AMPR) remotely senses
passive microwave signatures of geophysical parameters from an
airborne platform. The instrument is a low noise system which can
provide multifrequency microwave imagery with high spatial and
temporal resolution. AMPR data are collected at a combination of
frequencies unique to current NASA aircraft instrumentation. These
frequencies are well suited to the study of rain cloud systems, but
are also useful to studies of various ocean and land surface
processes.

The AMPR is a cross-track scanning total power microwave radiometer
with four channels centered at 10.7, 19.35, 37.1 and 85.5 GHz. It has
a dual lens antenna to accommodate two separate feedhorns. One horn
that feeds the three higher frequency channels is a copy of the
Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) spaceborne multifrequency
feedhorn currently flying aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite
Program (DMSP) F8 and F10 satellites. The other AMPR feedhorn
accommodates the 10.7 GHz frequency.

The following table lists several of the AMPR performance
characteristics:

                               85.5GHz 37.1GHz 19.35GHz 10.7GHz

Beam Efficiency (%)             TBD     98.8    98.7     97.8
Cross Polarization (%)          TBD     0.4     1.6      0.2


The AMPR radiometer is designed to fly in the Q-bay of a NASA ER-2, a
compartment in the belly of the aircraft directly behind the pilot's
cockpit. The dual antenna and scanning mirror extend below the
aircraft body into a hatch opening. The instrument has a 90 degree
total scan centered at nadir. The data footprints are contiguous at
85.5 GHz and coincident at all four channels leading to oversampling
at the lower frequencies. Rotating polarization for all four channels
is currently used during scanning. The polarization varies from
vertical at 45 degrees to the left of nadir. At the nadir position,
the polarizations are equally mixed. This scanning geometry allows
dual-polarized information to be collected at the extreme scan angles
with opposite aircraft passes over a given target.

DATA

The total volume of the AMPR dataset, including browse products, is
111 MB. There are 12 AMPR data files, each containing data from one
mission flight of the NASA ER-2. These files total 85 MB in volume and
have a typical file size of approximately 7.5 MB. The files are named

        amprtb93.XXX_toga_v023.dat

where XXX is the Julian day on which the flight took off.

The following table relates AMPR data file names to ER-2 and DC-8
flight numbers and to the dates of the 13 mission flights of the
NASA/TOGA COARE campaign. The objectives column is included for the
convenience of the user; the mission objective was convection when it
was forecast in the target area and radiation when it was not. Because
of the length of the AMPR file names, only the unique portion of each
file name (the Julian day) is listed in the table.

Data Format: The AMPR data is in a binary native format. The "fixed
INS" AMPR dataset structure (version 1; v1) is detailed in document
"amprdata.format.v1" which resides in directory ampr.

Software: Fortran 77 program ampr_read.f was provided by the data
producer to read a binary AMPR data file.

Browse Products: The AMPR dataset includes two types of browse
products: a) calibrated brightness temperatures in GIF format and b)
flight tracks for the NASA-ER2 mission flights in GIF format.  The
browse files total approximately 26 MB in volume and may be displayed
with any GIF viewer.

a) Calibrated Brightness Temperature Images: Browse images in GIF
format were generated from data segments that were deemed noteworthy
by the AMPR instrument team. A group was created for each mission
flight of the ER-2 and they range in number from 22 to 27 per
flight. The naming convention for these image files is:

                amprbr93.XXX_toga_tb_brwsYY.gif

where XXX is the Julian day on which the flight took off and YY is the
sequence number of the image within that flight group.

b) NASA ER-2 Mission Flight Track Images: Each image consists of an
ER-2 mission flight track geo-located on a 2 degree x 2 degree grid.

The naming convention for these image files is:

                amprft93.XXX_toga_track.gif

where XXX is the Julian day on which the flight took off.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-05<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The CSU Station 1 surface radiation data set was produced by the
Atmospheric Sciences Division of CSU in support of the FIRE Phase II
Cirrus IFO conducted in Coffeyville, Kansas.  CSU Station 1 point data
were collected every 2 minutes for the period from Nov. 11, 1991 (day
315) to Dec. 8, 1991 (day 342) at the Parsons KG&E Power Plant
Parsons, Kansas (37 deg. 18 min. N and 95 deg.  07 min. W).  NOTE: The
2 minute values were instantaneous readings.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high-level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface-based instruments for in situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

INSTRUMENT INFORMATION

The AMMR radiometer package was flown onboard the DC-8 between 12 January
to 24 February 1994 under the direction of Dr. Jim Wang of NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center.

The AMMR measures thermal microwave emission (in degrees Kelvin of
brightness temperature) from surface and atmosphere. For TOGA COARE,
the AMMR (with frequencies between 10 and 100 GHz) was used for
measurements of hydrometeors associated with tropical convective
systems. Radiometers at 18, 21, 37 and 92 GHz are comparable to the
frequencies on the Special Sensor for Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) onboard
the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite. Where
aircraft flights coincided with SSM/I overpasses over the COARE
domain, comparisons between satellite and AMMR sensors at different
resolutions were proposed to study beam filling effect.

Instrument Geometry: The AMMR package is made up of AMMR-1 and
AMMR-2. AMMR-1 consiste of single-beam, microwave radiometers
operating at 18.7, 18.7, 21 and 37 GHz, all viewing through a nadir
port of the aircraft, with an incidence angle of 0 when the aircraft
was on level flight. The two channels at 18.7 GHz should see the same
scene and brightness.

AMMR-2 also consists of single-beam, microwave radiometers operating
at 10, 21, 37 and 92 GHz.  These radiometers were installed in the
left windows of the DC-8 aircraft and viewed the scene at an incidence
angle of 45 degrees in level flight.

Principles of Operation: The 37 and 92 GHz radiometers were
dual-polarized. Georgia Institute of Technology operated the 92 GHz
radiometer and is responsible for the calibration of the data. The 92
GHz data will be included in this AMMR dataset when they are
submitted to the GSFC DAAC.

The spatial resolution of the data is between 1.5 to 2 Km. The
temporal sampling is 1 scan per second.  Following are the key
components of these sensor assemblies and their characteristics:

DATA

General Characteristics: The AMMR instruments were operational for all
thirteen mission flights of the DC-8 during the TOGA COARE Campaign
yielding twenty six ASCII data files (13 each for AMMR-1 and
AMMR-2). The total data volume is 45 MB.

AMMR files are named Adddhhmm.AR1 (for AMMR-1) and Gdddhhmm.AR2 (for
AMMR-2) where ddd is the Julian day, hh is the hour, and mm is the
minute the instrument was turned on for the flight.


Data Format. There are 10 parameters in each file:

       Scan number
       Month
       Day
       Hour
       Minute
       Second
       Brightness temperatures in degrees Kelvin at
             18.7 GHz, 18.7 GHz, 21 GHz, and 37 GHz

Latitude, Longitude, altitude and aircraft attitude information are
not present in these quick-look data files, but may be obtained from
the DC-8 DADS dataset.


The AMMR data files are formatted as follows:

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The Colorado State radiometer data set was produced by the Department
of Atmospheric Sciences of CSU as part of the FIRE Phase II Cirrus
Intensive Field Observations (IFO) conducted in Coffeyville, Kansas.
The CSU PRT-6 data were collected during the period from Nov. 18, 1991
(day 322) to Dec. 7, 1991 (day 341) at the Parsons KG&E Power Plant,
Parsons, Kansas (37 deg. 18 min. N and 95 deg. 07 min.W).  The PRT-6
is an all-purpose chopped bolometer.  It was operated with a 2 degree
field of view pointing vertically upward.  The filter employed
narrowed the spectral band to ranges from about 885 to 945 inverse
centimeters (the infrared window region).  The PRT-6 was not run in
continuous mode.  When operating, data were sampled every 5 seconds.
Please note that there are temporal gaps in the data.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-10-10<br><pre>

The goal of the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment is to produce
monthly averages of longwave and shortwave radiation parameters on the
Earth at regional to global scales. Preflight mission analysis lead to
a three-spacecraft system to provide the geographic and temporal
sampling required to meet this goal. Three nearly identical sets of
instruments were built and launched on three separate
spacecraft. These instruments differ principally in the spacecraft
interface electronics and in the field-of-view limiters for the
nonscanner instruments required because of differences in the
spacecraft orbit altitudes.

The ERBS spacecraft was launched by Space Shuttle Challenger in
October 1984 and was the first spacecraft to carry ERBE instruments
into orbit. ERBS was designed and built by Ball Aerospace Systems
under contract to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and ERBS
was the first spacecraft dedicated to NASA science experiments to be
launched by the Space Shuttle. ERBS carries the Stratospheric Aerosols
and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) in addition to the ERBE
instruments. The Payload Operation and Control Center (POCC) at GSFC
directs operations of the ERBS spacecraft and the ERBE and SAGE II
instruments, employing both ground stations and the Tracking and Data
Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) network. Spacecraft and instrument
telemetry data are received at GSFC where the data are processed by
the Information Processing Division that provides ERBE and SAGE II
experiment data to the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC).

The second and third spacecraft launched with ERBE instruments are
Television Infrared Radiometer Orbiting Satellite (TIROS) N-class
spacecraft, which are part of the NOAA operational meteorological
satellite series. The NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 spacecraft were launched in
December 1984 and September 1986, respectively. The NOAA spacecraft
include other instruments, such as the Advanced Very High Resolution
Radiometer (AVHRR) and the High-Resolution Infrared Radiometer Sounder
(HIRS), which provide NOAA with data for near-real-time weather
forecasting. Both spacecraft are in nearly Sun-synchronous orbits. At
launch equator-crossing times for the NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 orbits were
1420 UT (ascending) and 1930 UT (descending), respectively, where UT
denotes universal time. The Satellite Operations and Control Center
(SOCC) at the National Environmental Satellite and Data Information
Service (NESDIS) operates the NOAA spacecraft. NOAA provides telemetry
data and generates ERBE data for LaRC.

From 1984 through 1994, total solar irradiance values were obtained
from the solar monitor on the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS)
nonscanner.

The individual total solar irradiance values represent orbital
averages of the instantaneous measurements which are corrected for the
angle between the instrument optical axis and the Sun and which are
normalized to the mean Earth/Sun distance. At least once every 2
weeks, the Sun is observed by the monitor for several 64-second
measurement intervals.  Each interval is separated into two 32-second
periods.  During the first period, the Sun drifts across the
9.2-degree unocculted field of view, and its radiation field is
measured. During the second period, a low-emittance shutter,
representative of a near-zero irradiance source, is cycled into the
field of view, and the low irradiance from the back of the shutter is
measured.  The resulting measurements from the two different periods
are used to define the irradiance, using the model that is described
in "Characteristics of the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment Solar
Monitors" by R. B. Lee III, B. R. Barkstrom, and R. D. Cess.
Typically, two to eight values of the irradiance are determined during
an orbit.  Considering that these irradiance values are derived
typically during a single orbit for a few minutes, the averaged
irradiance values represent an almost instantaneous level, and not a
daily average.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-19<br><pre>

The ABLE missions have been designed specifically to study the rate of
exchange of material between the Earth's surface and its atmospheric
boundary layer, and the processes by which gases and aerosols are
moved between the boundary layer and the 'free' troposphere.  These
expeditions are conducted in ecosystems of the world that are known to
exert a major influence on global atmospheric chemistry. In some
cases, these ecosystems are undergoing profound changes as a
consequence of natural processes and/or human impact.ABLE 3A is a
component of the NASA Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) sponsored
by the NASA Tropospheric Chemistry Program.

The Arctic Boundary Layer Expedition (ABLE 3A) was conducted in Arctic
and sub-Arctic regions of North America and Greenland during July and
August 1988. ABLE 3A was the first comprehensive investigation of the
sources, sinks, and distribution of trace gas and aerosol chemical
species in a northern high-latitude region during summer months.  The
ABLE 3A experimental design placed emphasis on the role of
biosphere-atmosphere interactions in determining the chemical
composition of the troposphere and on processes which influence the
tropospheric ozone budget.  The suite of chemical species measured
included the following gases: methane, carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, total "reactive" nitrogen gas, nitric acid, peroxyacetyl
nitrate, peroxypropionyl nitrate, ozone, and aerosol chemical
composition and size distribution. The instruments used included a
capacitive sensor, chilled mirror, Differential Absorption Lidar
(DIAL), electron capture detector-gas chromatograph, grab samples/gas
chromatograph, inertial navigation system, photoelectric cell,
resistance temperature detector, two photon/laser induced
fluorescence, and a tunable diode laser.

The ABLE 3A results indicate that human activities may have already
enhanced total "reactive" nitrogen inputs to the Arctic and Sub-Arctic
regions to the extent that the lifetime of ozone against photochemical
loss may have already doubled.

This data set consists of the aircraft measurements of chemical
species. There are also ABLE 3A data sets for a ground site
(GTE_A3A_TOWER), for isentropic back trajectories generated for the
program time frame (GTE_A3A_MET_TRAJ) and a data set for airborne flux
measurements of trace species (GTE_A3A_ELEC_FLUX).  These data sets
are also available from the Langley DAAC.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-29<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

A subset of the ISCCP Stage DX Cloud Product (Revised Algorithm) are
included for the FIRE Cirrus 1 region.

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-29<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

A subset of the ISCCP Stage DX Cloud Product (Revised Algorithm) are
included for the FIRE Cirrus 2 region.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high-level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface-based instruments for in situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

INSTRUMENT INFORMATION

The AMMS instrument, which was mounted on NASA's DC-8 aircraft for the
TOGA COARE Field Experiment, is a scanning radiometer that measures
brightness temperatures in degrees Kelvin. It was operational during
16 mission flights of the DC-8 between 5 January and 23 February 1993.

The AMMS was designed to profile atmospheric water vapor and was
mainly used for this purpose in the past. It is also sensitive to
cloud cover and precipitation. Because the weighting functions of its
four frequency channels peak at different altitudes, depending on
water vapor density and profile, AMMS has the potential of estimating
the height of frozen hydrometeors associated with a convective
storm. For TOGA COARE the sensor was combined with other radiometers
in the same aircraft to measure the radiometric response of convective
rainfall systems in the frequency range of 10-183 GHz.

AMMS is a 4-channel, mechanically scanned, imaging microwave
radiometer operating at 92, 183.3+/-2, 183.3+/-5, and 183.3+/-9
GHz. It has a 15-cm aperture giving an angular resolution of about 2
degrees at 92 GHz and 1 degree at 183 GHz. After every 6 scans, the
beam is directed to view heated (330 K) and cooled (250 K) external
calibration targets for 2 seconds each, resulting in a total frame
time of approximately 30 seconds (including slewing time). The
radiometric signals and the measured physical temperatures from these
calibration targets form the basis for the derivation of the scene
brightness temperatures. The calibration accuracy is on the order of 1
K in the 250-300 K brightness temperature range. The temperature
sensitivity (delta T) of the sensor has gradually deteriorated over
the past 10 years. For water vapor profiling, averaging of up to 50
radiometric samples is needed to meet the requirement of delta T of <=
1 K. The microwave signatures from precipitation are much stronger
than water vapor at the AMMS frequencies, and data from this sensor
will be sufficient to derive important information about the
hydrometeors.

The beam is scanned in 50 steps of 1.8 degrees from nominally 45
degrees to the right through nadir, and to 45 degrees to the left with
a total scan time of approximately 4 seconds. For TOGA COARE, only the
left half of the scan (25 steps, from nadir to the left of the
aircraft) is useful because of the geometry of nadir port in which it
is mounted in the aircraft.

DATA

One data product consisting of 16 ASCII files of calibrated brightness
temperatures in degrees Kelvin was produced by the AMMS instrument
during the TOGA COARE Field Experiment. Each file contains data from 1
flight. File size ranges from 2.8 to 4 MB. The total data volume is 55
MB. There are 10 parameters in each file. Latitude, longitude,
altitude and aircraft attitude information are not present in these
quick-look data files, but may be obtained from the DC-8 DADS dataset,
also available on FTP.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface based instruments for in situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

INSTRUMENT INFORMATION

The ESMR instrument, which was mounted on NASA's DC-8 aircraft for the
TOGA COARE Field Experiment, is a 19.35 GHz scanning radiometer that
measures brightness temperatures in degrees Kelvin. It was operational
during 13 mission flights of the DC-8 between 11 January and 26
February 1993 under the direction of Dr. Thomas Wilheit of Texas A & M
University.

The objective for the ESMR instrument in the TOGA COARE Campaign was to
provide observations to develop better radiative transfer models for
rainfall retrieval algorithms to be used in the development of the
TRMM research paradigm.

The ESMR radiometer is nadir-mounted in the aircraft and scans in a
plane perpendicular to the direction of flight with a swath of +/-50
degrees from nadir. Beam position (BP) 20 is at nadir during level
flight; BP 1 is 50 degrees to the left, and BP 39 is 50 degrees to the
right. The beam positions are distributed in equal divisions of the
sine of the scan angle.

When the pitch and roll of the plane are negligible, a simple
algorithm can be used to obtain the latitude and longitude at each BP.

If we define:

        - BP is the beam position (integer, 1-39)
        - sinBP is the sine of the scan angle of the BP
        - lat and lon are the aircraft position
        - ofsBP is the offset angle of the BP
        - hdg is the aircraft heading
        - alt is the aircraft altitude
        - latBP and lonBP are the latitude and longitude of the beam position

Then execute the following calculations:

        sinBP = (sin(50/57.2)*(BP-20)/19)
        ofsBP = 0.1 * (sinBP/sqrt(1-sinBP*sinBP))
        latBP = lat - ofsBP*sin(hdg)*alt/36000
        lonBP = lon + ofsBP*cos(hdg)*alt/(cos(lat)*36000)


DATA ORGANIZATION

One data product consisting of 13 binary files of calibrated
brightness temperatures in degrees Kelvin was produced by the ESMR
instrument during the TOGA COARE Campaign. Each file contains data
from 1 flight. The ESMR data totals appproximately 12 MB in volume and
has a typical file size of approximately .8 MB. The naming convention
for ESMR files is <julian day>.tbn.

The TbN data format is as follows

bytes           Type           variable


1-39            unsign 1 byte  Brightness Temp for each BP (add 100.)
40                     "       Hour
41                     "       Minute
42                     "       Seconds (integer part)
43                     "       Hundredths of seconds
44-45           signed 2-byte  Julian Day
46-47                   "      Latitude(integer part)
48-49                   "      1/10000ths of latitude
50-51                   "      Longitude (integer part)
52-53                   "      1/10000ths of longitude
54-55                   "      Altitude (tens of feet)
56-57                   "      Heading (tenths of degrees)
58-59                   "      Roll (tenths of degrees)
60-61                   "      Pitch (tenths of degrees)
62-64                   -      Empty

Note that the latitude and longitude fractions share the same sign; to
obtain either variable, simply sum the integer and fractional parts
without manipulating the signs. All of the integers are standard
MS-DOS format.


ESMR Browse Images: A series of GIF images which are 256 color
pictures of the data, made from screen shots of the data viewing
program. The GIF images are labeled with the Julian Day, hour and
minute that the data starts, in the form DDDHHMM.GIF.

The GIFs are 800x600, and can be viewed with any image viewing
application, on any platform. If you do transfer the files to another
platform, remember to transfer them in binary (8-bit) format.

There are GIF images for all of the high-priority convection legs and
days specified by Drs. Ed Zipser, Barry Nolan, and others at the
3-6 August TOGA COARE Conference in San Diego.

SOFTWARE

1) DOS Software: Read software in Turbo Pascal (RDTBNAV) was
submitted by the ESMR instrument team. The program reads a specified
record from an ESMR binary data file and displays it to the pc
screen. Program DISP_TB displays an ESMR image file to the pc screen.

Display software used by the PI in processing the data is also
available. It runs in a DOS environment and requires a Super VGA
videocard based on the Tseng chipset or a VESA standard compatible
videocard with appropriate drivers.

2) UNIX Software: Program esmr_read.c was created by the GSFC DAAC to
provide the functionality of the original Pascal read program to UNIX
users. Porting the ESMR dataset from a PC to the DAAC's Silicon
Graphics machines required a byte swap when loading 2-byte data values
into integers, an implementation-dependent feature that may not be
required on other systems. The program is self-documenting.

A validation file (ESMR.dat) displaying correct values from the first
ten records in data file 011.tbn is offered to assist UNIX users in
adapting program esmr_read.c to their environments. It resides with
the UNIX software.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-09-21<br><pre>

The European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts Data Set
contains twice daily observations beginning on Jan. 1, 1980.  Each
parameter on each standard pressure level is stored as a field of grid
point values on a 2.5 X 2.5 degree regular rectangular mesh in
latitude rows starting at the north and working southwards; within
each row values run from west to east starting at 177.5 deg W and
finishing at 180 deg E with 0 deg in the center of the row.  The data
sets include upper air grid point fields for six physical parameters
at each of seven standard pressure levels. Fields are initialized
analyses for 1200 UT each day on one data set, and for 0000 UT on a
second data set.  Pressure levels are 1000, 850, 700, 500, 300, 200,
and 100 hPa (note: 1 hPa = 1mb).

These data are available only through ECMWF. The EOSDIS DAAC node at
Goddard Space Flight Center provides access to metadata only.

Data are available on unlabeled nine track, odd parity magnetic tape
written at 1600 or 6250 bpi.  Since the 1200 UT data is a separate
data set from the 0000 UT data, separate requests must be made for
each, and the extracted data cannot be interspersed. The data and any
necessary software will be supplied, if so required, on magnetic tape
and a standard fee will be charged.  This fee is considerably less for
the period up to December 31, 1984 due to the support provided by WMO
to extract the data set for that period.  A separate request must be
made for data up to December 31, 1984 and from January 1, 1985
onwards. For magnetic tape requests, data will be delivered on
unlabeled odd parity, nine track magnetic tape written at 1600 or 6250
bpi. Each request will be delivered on a separate magnetic tape (or

data, the output format and the tape density.  A user can define the
output format, the time interval, area subsets based on regular
rectangular areas with edges along latitude and longitude lines, or

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-13<br><pre>

The Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) on Nimbus 7 mainly measures
albedos at 12 selected wavelengths in the UV spectrum for the purpose
of deriving atmospheric ozone.  In the spectral scan mode, however, it
measures solar irradiances and earth radiances from 160 to 400 nm in
0.2-nm steps, with a 1.1-nm half-width triangular bandpass.  Solar
measurements were made once a day (three scans), at the northern
terminator of one orbit.  Earth measurements were made once every 24
days for the entire day, in place of the step scan measurements for
ozone determination.

Both the Continuous Scan Solar Flux data (SUNC) and the Continuous
Scan Earth Radiance data (EARTH) were derived from the Raw Units Tapes
(RUT-S) and are organized into one file per Bartel (27-day) period.
Each file contains: 1) calibrated post-launch wavelengths for the 1200
samples, 2) solar irradiance (SUNC) or daytime Earth radiance (EARTH)
for each of 1200 wavelengths, and 96 photometer measurements at 343.3
nm, 3) daily mean irradiances, and 4) trailer record with quality
control information.  SUNC also contains orbital mean irradiances and
number of samples, and daily 5-nm average flux (centered at 162.5,
165.0, 167.5 nm, etc.)  There are a total of two 8mm Exabyte tapes,
one containing all the EARTH measurements and the other all the SUNC
measurements for the entire 8 year period. The original data were
written out in IBM binary format and copied without modification to
the Exabyte tapes at the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center
(DAAC).

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-05<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The CSU Station 2 surface radiation data set was collected every 2
minutes for the period from Nov. 13, 1991 through Dec. 8, 1991 at the
Tri-City Airport, Parsons, Kansas (37 deg. 20 min. N, 95 deg. 30 min.
30 sec. W.)  NOTE: the 2 minute values were instantaneous readings.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface-based instruments for in-situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

INSTRUMENT INFORMATION

The Visible and near Infrared Lidar (VIRL) measures the backscatter
cross-sections of cloud and aerosol particles at 1.064 and 2.036 um
and was used in TOGA COARE primarily to profile clouds. The 1.064 um
lidar return is split into signals that are parallel and perpendicular
to the outgoing laser radiation, thereby providing polarization
sensitive data principally for cloud phase detection. The 2 um
measurement was an experimental test of lidar performance and
scattering at that wavelength region.  The lidar can be pointed in the
nadir or zenith direction by rotating the telescope.  Therefore, it
can measure cloud base heights when flying under clouds and cloud tops
when flying over them. It can also provide vertical profiles of
backscatter cross-section that show extended structure into cirrus and
other thin clouds.

The principal application that was planned for the DC-8 lidar was the
study of radiative heating and cooling rates for tropical cirrus,
especially in the case of dense anvil cirrus. The integrated
attenuated backscatter cross-section, from optically thin to thick
clouds, when plotted against cloud base thermal brightness data, also
acquired from the DC-8, is typically asymptotic. This gives a measure
of effective backscatter-to-extinction ratio and leads to calculation
of cloud base emittance profiles.

The lidar also gathers data on boundary layer heights and aerosol
backscatter cross-sections. From the distribution of cloud base
heights in and around the marine boundary layer, an estimate of the
LCL (Lifting Condensation Level) is obtained. When combined with the
sea surface temperature this may provide a measure of the moisture
content. From the intensity and depolarization of the lidar return,
estimates of cloud density and phase discrimination are possible.

Principles of Operation: The VIRL system is based on a Nd:YAG laser to
produce the 1.064 um signal. The parallel and perpendicular polarized
components of the lidar return are stored in separate channels. An
Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) was used to convert the 1.064 um
output of the Nd:YAG laser to generate a pulse around 2 um. The system
employs incoherent signal detection. VIRL has a 12-bit digitizer that
resolves data that varies over 4 orders of magnitude. Linear
amplifiers are used which allow precise resolution of very small
signals. The basic pulse rate of the laser is 50 Hz, but data is
recorded as a sum of 10 shots at 5 Hz. The data system acquired
navigation data (DADS) from the DC-8 in real time and appended it to
each lidar return data record as it was written to 8 mm
tape. Navigation data is processed to account for aircraft banks,
rolls and pitches during turns and climbs. Appropriate altitude
corrections were made and were verified by comparing with the very
large lidar return from the ocean surface when the instrument was
pointing down. A cleaned dataset is available as 1 sec averages which
translates to about 200 m along the flight track. In the vertical
direction, the profiles have a 75-m resolution.

In order to calibrate the data, the 1.064 um return was initially
fitted to a molecular backscatter cross-section profile in a clean
region. A relative target calibration was used to obtain the
backscatter cross-section profiles at 2.036 um, and the calibration
ratio of the parallel and perpendicular channels. In addition to a
hard target (at NASA Ames), an experimental procedure to use the ocean
surface as a target was attempted. An effort is underway to use the
aerosol backscatter component from the perpendicular channel to
generate aerosol cross-sections at 1.064 um for "apparently" clean
cases in the upper troposphere. The effect of the Pinatubo volcanic
eruption was very prominent in zenith viewing data. The enhanced
aerosol backscatter in the stratosphere was very pronounced for the
TOGA COARE observations.

DATA ORGANIZATION

The VIRL data currently comprise two types of files:

a) ASCII data files which contain the cloud boundary information. They
have an approximate volume of 14 MB and file size ranges from 33 K to 1
MB.
b) Associated GIF Images of backscatter cross-section. They have an
approximate volume of 6 MB and a file sizes range from 70 K to 200 K.

ASCII data: In acb93025.f1b "acb" denotes ascii cloud boundary, 93
refers to 1993, 025 refers to the Julian Day when the DC8 flight
originated from Townsville, Australia, and f1b uniquely identifies
each flight segment from that sortie based on when the lidar was
turned on and off. The various parameters which are included in the
acb93XXX.FXX file are indicated by the headers of each column, as
shown in the sample below

IV indicates Lidar View (2=UP,1=Down)
DAY is the Julian DAY for that data point
HR MI SEC denote UTC hour, minute, and second
PLNHT is the Plane Height in km above sea-level
G indicates ground stroke and is not relevant for uplooking data
CTOP1, CBOT1, CTOP2, CBOT2, CTOP3, CBOT3 give the heights (km)
of the tops and bottoms of the first 3 cloud layers from the DC8.
RLAT and RLONG provide the decimal latitude and longitude in degrees.
PITCH and ROLL provide the aircraft pitch and roll in degrees.

Image file format: The image file 0260217a.gif displays a
cross-section image of the lidar data. The 026 refers to the JULIAN
DAY at the beginning of that image; 0217 denotes the UTC START TIME of
the image. The duration of the image is evident from the X-Axis which
gives the Elapsed Time in minutes. The START and END TIMES of each
"gif" image are present in the title at the top of the image. In this
case the image is for the entire flight line acb93025.f1b but for
longer flight lines the images are often broken up into shorter
sections. The letter "a" refers to attenuated aerosol backscatter and
is the prevalent type of gif image. In some cases the letter "t" is
used to denote total backscatter cross-section images, while the
number "1" or "2" is used to indicate that only channel 1 (1064 nm
Perpendicular) or channel 2 (1064 nm Parallel) data are displayed. In
any case the legend at the top of each image describes the data type,
location and the duration. It is a good idea to use the image in
conjunction with the cloud boundary file.  This is especially
important when there are thick clouds present at or near the plane
altitude. This makes identification of the second and third cloud
layer boundaries more difficult.

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-07-06<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

The development of parameterizations requires an understanding of the
processes that generate, maintain, and dissipate boundary layer
clouds.  This development is currently impeded by lack of
understanding of the transition from stratocumulus clouds to trade
cumulus clouds and the factors that control cloud type and amount in
the boundary layer.  ASTEX was designed to address key issues related
to stratocumulus to trade cumulus transition and mode selection.
ASTEX involved intensive measurements from several platforms operating
from June 1-28, 1992 in the area of the Azores and Madeira Islands.
The purpose was to study how the transition and mode selection are
effected by 1) cloud-top entrainment instability, 2) diurnal
decoupling and clearing due to solar absorption, 3) patchy drizzle and
a transition to horizontally inhomogeneous clouds through decoupling,
4) mesoscale variability in cloud thickness and associated mesoscale
circulations, and 5) episodic strong subsidence lowering the inversion
below the LCL.  Detailed descriptions of the scientific goals of ASTEX
are in the FIRE Phase II: Research plan (1989) and in the ASTEX
Operations Plan (1992).

The Cloud Lidar System (CLS) instrument was flown aboard the NASA ER-2
airplane.  This instrument was used to determine cloud altitudes.
Information pertaining to the number of cloud layers detected; the
heights of the boundaries for up to 5 cloud layers; geo-physical
location information; and time were recorded.

Four channels of data were recorded.  The first channel recorded wave
lengths at 532 nanometers in the parallel plane.  The second channel
recorded wave lengths of 532 nanometers in the perpendicular plane.
The third channel recorded wavelengths of 1064 nanometers total. The
forth channel was a linear amplifier which received the digitized
signal from one of the three previously mentioned CLS detectors.

The data are organized so that there is a single header record for the
file. This header record is followed by a series of pairs of records.
The first record of each pair contains the CLS calibrated data and the
second record of the pair contains the CLS analyzed data.

executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

These data were collected by the United Kingdom Meteorological Office
(UKMO) from the Meteorological Research Flight C-130 Aircraft.  This
data set is a 16 HZ time series data set.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-06-15<br><pre>

The Second Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE II) was
launched on October 5, 1984.  It measured the solar irradiance at
seven wavelengths (1.020, 0.940, 0.600, 0.453, 0.448 ,and 0.385
microns) during each sunrise and sunset encountered by the
satellite. The SAGE II instrument continues to function
perfectly. Each radiometric channel has a vertical field of view of
0.5 min., which provides atmospheric vertical resolution of
approximately 0.5 km altitude. With the satellite orbital period of 96
- 97 min., there are approximately 30 samplings per day (15 sunrises
and 15 sunsets). These events sweep over various latitude ranges of
approximately 130 degrees latitude in 2 to 3 weeks, and provide global
coverage from 80 S to 80 N latitude.

During each year of its mission, SAGE II produces approximately 10,000
profiles of aerosol extinction, ozone concentration, and nitrogen
dioxide concentration.  This particular catalog entry applies to the
ozone portion of the SAGE II products measured at 0.600 microns.  The
data presented in this data set give an excellent picture of the
global stratospheric ozone concentration and distribution from
late-October 1984 through December 1990.

The ozone mixing ratio data presented in this data set have been
averaged to form monthly averages.  Accompaning data includes the
standard deviation about the monthly mean, the mean day of year for
the data averaged, and the standard deviation of the measurement times
about the mean day.  The conversion of the standard ozone
concentration profile to a mixing ratio profile is based on background
density data supplied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) through the National Meteorological Center
(NMC).  These data are self-contained as a Level 3 SAGE II product,
and they need not be used with other data sets to be useful to the
investigator.

The complete SAGE II data set can be used for investigation of the
spatial and temporal variation of the three species caused by seasonal
and short-term meteorological variations, atmospheric chemistry and
microphysics, and transient phenomena, such as volcanic
eruptions. These data can also be used for the study of trends,
atmospheric dynamics and transport, and potential climate effects.
The ozone concentration obtained from the SAGE II measurements in this
data set and, also, the prior SAGE I ozone measurements in a closely
related data set, has been used to estimate the amount of world-wide
ozone depletion that may have occurred since 1979.  These trend
analyses are ongoing.

     The radar altimeter is a short pulse, nadir viewing radar
designed to mesure precisely the distance from the satelite to
the Earth surface.  The instrument can also measure the shape of
the returned pulse and the backscattering cross section.  The
latter two measurements permit inference of significant wave
height and wind speed.  The significant wave height can be
inferred from the slope of the leading edge of the returned pulse
and the wind speed can be inferred from the rqdar cross section.
Higher waves tend to decrease the slope of the leading edge of
the pulse and also the backscattering, thus leading to the
inference of the presence of higher winds.  The major component
of information derived from a nadir altimeter pertains to the
geoid and small-scale anomalies. These anomolies may be caused by
sea mounts, trenches, ocean currents, and fronts.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-06-11<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

The Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS) has produced a
satellite-based series of images as part of ASTEX.  This product is
based on observations by the geostationary METEOSAT and the AVHRR
aboard the NOAA-11 and -12 polar orbiters.

These data are METEOSAT and NOAA observations to give cloud
classification data.  The file naming convention is:

              cxDDMMYYsxx.fis_tmp

where DDMMYY is the date and xx = "slot number"

Mean time (UT) is obtained from the slot number over the ASTEX region
by the formula:

                  UT = (xx/2) - 0.17


These files are: I1 pixels, 188 pixels/row, 163 rows.  Each pixel has
a spatial resolution of 0.08 degrees.  For cloud classification, the
rule is the following:

    latitude = 39.99- ((line-1)*0.08) longitude=-29.97+((point-1)*0.08)
    (longitude west is <0).

This gives you the latitude and longitude of any pixel in the file.

The cloud type (1-15) is coded on the four Most Significant Bits.
This code is:

                 1        -clear
                 2,3      -cloud edges
                 4        -thin cirrus
                 5,6      -thick cirrus
                 7        -perturbation
                 8,9,10   -low cumuliform
                 11,12    -low stratiform
                 13,14,15 -medium

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-22<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve data
products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general circulation
models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to improve the basic
understanding of the interaction of physical processes in determining life
cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems and the radiative
properties of these clouds during their life cycles and (2) to investigate
the interrelationships between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and
higher space and time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO centered in Wisconsin (October 13 - November 2,
1986); a marine stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of
California (June 29 - July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in
southeastern Kansas (November 13 - December 7, 1991); and a second
marine stratocumulus IFO in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 -
June 28, 1992).  Each mission combined coordinated satellite,
airborne, and surface observations with modeling studies to
investigate the cloud properties and physical processes of the cloud
systems.

This data set contains cloud top height and ground height calculations
from the NASA ER-2 Cloud Lidar System (CLS).  These data were
collected during the FIRE Marine Stratocumulus experiment in July
1987; the parameters collected included time, position, and plane
height.  Undetected cloud tops and ground heights are signified by
values of -9.9 after decoding.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-04<br><pre>

The Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement (SAM) II experiment flew aboard
the Nimbus 7 spacecraft and provided vertical profiles of aerosol
extinction in both the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions.  The SAM
II data coverage began on October 29, 1978 and extended through
December 18, 1993, until SAM II was no longer able to acquire the
sun.  The data coverage for the Antarctic region extends through
December 18, 1993, and has one data gap for the period of time from
mid-January through the end of October 1993.  The data coverage for
the Arctic region extends through January 7, 1991, and contains data
gaps beginning in 1988 that increase in size each year due to an
orbit degradation associated with the Nimbus-7 spacecraft.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface based instruments for in situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

GENERAL INFORMATION

The DADS dataset contains DC-8 aircraft house-keeping data for flights
that took place in the Intensive Observing Period of TOGA-COARE.
The DC-8 DADS records and transfers over 50 parameters to experiment
computers in ASCII-format at 1-second intervals. The data transmission
is in one direction only to protect the main system from defective
experimental equipment or shorting of output lines.  DADS data are
normally generated and recorded from soon after takeoff until shortly
after landing.

DATA INFORMATION

The DADS dataset, stored at the NASA DAAC on the anonymous FTP site.  It
is 60 MB in volume with a typical file size of 3 MB for the compressed
data from one flight, and a typical file size of 10 MB for the 1-second
ascii data from one flight, when uncompressed.

In the main directory ./ the files are:
   README          : similar to this file
   flightfmt       : Formats of 10-second flight navigation data files (text)
   DADSparams.ps.Z : Description of the DADS parameters (PostScript)
   DADSformat.ps.Z : Format of the 1-second ASCII data files (PostScript)

In a sub-directory ./9301XX the files are:
   dc8_data.asc.Z  : The full DADS ASCII 9600/19.2K baud serial dataset
   9301XX.chk      : Data analysis report for file dc8_data.asc.
   md_log          : The in-flight Mission Director's comment log.
   9301XX.gif      : A representative NOAA APT weather picture, captured during
                     or before each flight (Townsville local flights only).
   dc8_data.bfl    : 10-second flight data file for use by NASA Ames Airborne
                     Science Program track-mapping software on PCs.
   dc8_data.flt    : 10-second flight data file for use by NASA Ames Airborne
                     Science Program track-mapping software on UNIX systems.
   map1.ps.Z       : PostScript track plot of the entire flight.
   map2.ps.Z       : Same as map1.ps, with wind barbs.
   map3.ps.Z,      : More track plots, showing any data lines or areas of
   map4.ps.Z...      interest at a smaller scale and higher map resolution.
                     Number of these varies for each flight.
   plots.ps.Z      : PostScript plots of various DADS parameters vs. UT.


The DADS 1-second data files: The 1-second data, contained in the
dc8_data.asc files are written in an ascii compression format that
requires interpretation.  A table describing the format of the data
files is in PostScript file DADSformat.ps.  Descriptions of data
parameters are contained in PostScript file DADSparams.ps. Both of
these files reside in file f1_dat.tar.

File coord_flt_legs: This file, compiled by Ed Zipser, contains a list
of DC-8 legs that were near-simultaneous in coverage with the ER-2,
turboprops or both.

Read and Display Software: The DAAC distributes the following software
with the DADS data:

- extdads1.f: Fortran77 program extracts 19 selected data parameters
from the file dc8_data.asc (1-second DADS data) and outputs them in
character format to file dads1.
- extdads2.f: Fortran77 program converts the values in dads1. to their
proper units and outputs them as reals to file dads.
- extmach1.f: Fortran77 program extracts a (different) group of data
parameters from file dc8_data.asc and outputs them in character format
to file mach1.
- extmach2.f: Fortran77 program converts the values in mach1. to their
proper units and outputs them as reals to file mach..

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-12<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

Both all-sky and overhead cloud imaging systems were deployed in
support of the FIRE Phase II IFO experiment conducted in Coffeyville,
Kansas, from Nov. 12 through Dec. 9, 1991.  The systems were
positioned at the Coffeyville Municipal Airport Site A.  The imaging
systems were installed on an elevated platform to allow an
unobstructed view of the hemisphere to within 10 deg. of the horizon.
The elevated position prevented local site activity and obstructions
from interfering with the camera's view and provided a small measure
of physical security for the systems.  Surface heaters were affixed to
the underside of the acrylic mirrors to aid in the removal of
condensation such as frost or snow which could be expected during
winter conditions.  The surface temperatures of each mirror surface
were maintained between 10 deg. C. and 20 deg. C.  by controlling the
heater voltage with a simple variable AC power supply.  The mirrors
were cleaned by hand once a week as a prudent operational procedure.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>

The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget(Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly on a mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10).
Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument
package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.

The WFOV (wide-field-of-view) NF (numerical filter) S-10 contains
inverted daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and
longwave radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month.
This data set is produced for each of the satellites (ERBS, NOAA-9,
and NOAA-10) and the combination of satellites.

 The values for this data set are derived using the numerical filter
technique (Smith et al. 1986). As described in the Earth Radiant
Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Nonscanner S-10/S-10N User's Guide,
the data set contains a 30 byte header record, 67 scale factors which
are used to scale the data in the first record, and 26 scale factors
which are used to scale the data in the second record. The data set
also contains two records for each processed region.  The first record
is of fixed length (990 words) containing averaged data and the second
record is of variable length containing individual hour box estimates.
The length of the second record, in words, is calculated by
multiplying the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by the
number of values stored for each hour box (38 for the nonscanner).

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-10-04<br><pre>

The data are accessible via telnet daac.gsfc.nasa.gov
(192.107.190.139), login:daacims, password:gsfcdaac

Correlative gridded data from NOAA's National Meteorological Center
(NMC) are included as supplementary data products to the UARS Project.
The main use of the correlative data from the NMC run is to provide an
independent analysis for comparison with data from the UARS
instruments.

NMC geopotential height and atmospheric temperature data are derived
from two analysis systems: 1) tropospheric fields from 1000 to 100 mb,
and 2) stratospheric analyses from 70 to 0.4 mb.  The tropospheric
fields are the 1200 GMT gridded fields which are part of the Global
Daily Assimilation System (GDAS), where data from radiosondes,
aircraft, satellites, ships, bouys, or any other conventional means
are assimilated and merged into meteorological fields (heights,
temperature, winds).  The stratospheric analyses are 1200 GMT
operational analyses at the 70 - 0.4 mb pressure levels produced from
satellite temperature retrievals and RAOBS via a modified Cressman
analysis.  Tropospheric temperature analyses use combined NOAA-10 and
NOAA-11 data.  Moisture (northern hemisphere only) and Winds data are
obtained from the NMC GDAS.

Correlative NMC gridded data products consists of four subtypes per
day containing the following parameters:

1) HEIGHT     geopotential height, m
2) MOISTURE   moisture, %
3) TEMP       atmospheric temperature, degrees K
4) WINDS      wind components, u and v (meridional and zonal), m/s

The gridded fields are on the standard 65x65 NMC polar stereographic
grid oriented 80W (grid increment 381 km at 60N), and 100E (grid
increment 381 km at 60S); Pole at (33,33).  The NMC uses 18 standard
pressure levels for data at 1000, 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200,
150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.4 millibars.

Height and temperature data are produced at 18 pressure levels from
1000 mb to 0.4 mb.  Moisture data are only produced in the northern
hemisphere for the 6 lowest altitude pressure levels.  Wind data are
produced for the 12 lowest altitude levels in the northern hemisphere,
and at the 4 levels 1000, 500, 300, and 250 mb in the southern
hemisphere.

There are four data files representing each subtype per day.  Included
in the NMC correlative data set will be a geographical data richness
file.  This file is used by the NMC access routines, and indicates the
radiosonde coverage for each point on the NMC grid.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-04-02<br><pre>
Since 1985 regular ozone soundings have been performed at Georg Forster
Station (70#46'S, 11#41'E). In the beginning of 1992, this ozone sounding
program was moved to Neumayer (70#39'S, 8#15'W), which is located at the
same latitude 750 km further west. The results of both stations can be
regarded as one timeseries, now covering a whole decade with only minor
interruptions.

Vertical atmospheric soundings are performed about weekly. They include profile
measurements of ozone partial pressure, air pressure, temperature, relative
humidity and wind vector. Usually the profiles start at ground level and end
between 15 and 37 km.

The data obtained at Georg-Forster Station include mainly the mean pressure
levels while the data from Neumayer have a mean height resolution of about
50 meter.

At AWI the ozone soundings of both stations are archived in a relational
database (SYBASE). Up to now only the data from Neumayer Station are available
online on WWW.

Actual soundings normally reach the database once a year.

The data can be retrieved with Web and are free of charge. The address
is: <A HREF=http://www.awi-bremerhaven.de/MET/Neumayer/ozone.html>http://www.awi-bremerhaven.de/MET/Neumayer/ozone.html</A>.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>
The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget(Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly ona mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10).
Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument
package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.  MFOV (medium-field-of-view) data from the satellites are
not processed and therefore not archived.

The WFOV (wide-field-of-view) SF (shape factor) S-10N contains inverted
daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and longwave
radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month. This data
set consists of nonscanner data processed without scene identification
information from the scanner and therefore used the "Time/Space
Averaging Deadscanner Option" algorithm as described in the Earth
Radiant Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Nonscanner S-10/S-10N User's
Guide. This data set is produced for each of the satellites (ERBS,
NOAA-9, and NOAA-10) and the combination of satellites that are
operational during the month.  The values for this data set are
derived using the shape factor technique (Smith et al. 1986).  The data
contains two records for each region.  The first record is of fixed
length (990 words) and contains averaged data.  The second record is
of variable length and contains individual hour box estimates.  The
length of the second record, in words, is calculated by multiplying
the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by the number of
values stored for each hour box (38 for the nonscanner).

The National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) is one of the national
environmental data centers operated by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  NODC's primary mission is to
acquire, process, quality control, archive and distribute all types of
oceanographic data.

The NODC holds physical, chemical, and biological oceanographic data
collected by the U.S. Federal agencies, state and local government
agencies, universities and research institutions, and private
industry.  A large percentage of the oceanographic data held by NODC
is of foreign origin, acquired through direct bilateral exchanges with
other countries and through the facilities of the World Data Center A
(WDC-A) for Oceanography (operated by NODC).

The NODC provides data management support for major ocean science
projects such as TOGA (Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere), WOCE (World
Ocean Circulation Experiment), and JGOFS (Joint Global Ocean Flux
Study).  NODC also manages the NOAA Library and Information Network.

NODC provides online access to a limited amount of NODC oceanographic
data and information through its NODC Online service available through
the NODC WWW Home Page.  This service provides access to the following
data:

. Global Temperature-Salinity Pilot Project (GTSPP)

. the NOAA Marine Environmental Buoy Information Database, and

. the NOAA CoastWatch Archive and Access System (NCAAS).

The NODC Home Page on the World Wide Web (WWW) can be found at:

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>

The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget(Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly ona mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10).
Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument
package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.  MFOV (medium-field-of-view) data from the satellites are
not processed and therefore not archived.

The WFOV (wide-field-of-view) NF (numerical filter) S-10N contains
inverted daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and
longwave radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one
month. This data set consists of nonscanner data processed without
scene identification information from the scanner and therefore used
the "Time/Space Averaging Deadscanner Option" algorithm as described
in the Earth Radiant Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Nonscanner
S-10/S-10N User's Guide. This data set is produced for each of the
satellites (ERBS, NOAA-9, and NOAA-10) and the combination of
satellites that are operational during the month. The values for this
data set are derived using the numerical filter algorithm (Smith et
al. 1986). The data contains two records for each region.  The first
record is of fixed length (990 words) and contains averaged data.  The
second record is of variable length containing individual hour box
estimates.  The length of the second record, in words, is calculated
by multiplying the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by
the number of values stored for each hour box (38 for the nonscanner).

The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research
Satellite (UARS) measured the chemical composition of the stratosphere
and mesosphere, primarily to investigate ozone chemistry and the
relationship between chlorine monoxide and ozone destruction.  MLS
measured thermal emissions of ozone (O3), water vapor (H2O), and
chlorine monoxide (ClO) in the microwave spectral region at
frequencies of 63, 183, 205 GHz.

The instrument included the main sensor, spectrometer, and power
supply. The sensor consisted of a three-mirror antenna system, three
radiometers (63, 183, and 205 GHz), the multiplexing optics, and the
calibration system. Vertical resolution is about 4 km for chemical
species profiles.  Horizontal (cross-track) resolution is 10 to 30 km.
MLS viewed the Earth limb perpendicular to the spacecraft orbital
velocity vector, and scanned from ground to 100 km every UARS minute
(65.536 seconds).

A switching mirror inside the radiometer box selects either the
atmospheric signal from the antenna system, the calibration from an
internal source, or a zero-reference space view.  The signals from the
switching mirror are then spatially separated into various spectral
bands by microwave optics.  The spectrometer consists of filter banks
that separate the signal from each band into 15 channels.  The
resolution of individual channels varies from 128 MHz on the edge to 2
MHz near the center of the spectral line being measured.  This
resolution is matched to the characteristics of the atmospheric
emission lines over the altitude range covered.

The MLS Level 3A data products consist of profiles that have been
interpolated both vertically and horizontally from the original
profiles to standard surfaces and locations defined by the UARS
project for all limb-viewing instruments.  The Level 3A format is
common to all UARS instruments to allow for intercomparison.  The MLS
Level 3A data products consist of two product types: 1) 3AT -
Time-ordered Level 3A MLS data, 2) 3AL - Latitude-ordered Level 3A MLS
data.  Associated with each Level 3A product is a parameter file (3TP
with 3AT files and 3LP with 3AL files), containing additional
information on MLS operations for each profile.

Level 3AT/TP data products consist of time-ordered profiles and are
spaced at intervals of 1 UARS minute, or approximately 495 km along
the tangent track.  Level 3AL/LP data products consist of profiles at
the intersection of the tangent track spaced at intervals of 4 degrees
latitude.

The MLS Level 3AT and 3AL data consist of five products per day.  Each
data product (file) is one MLS species per day.  The following species
are measured:

1) O3_183 - ozone concentrations (ppmv) at 183 GHz,
2) O3_205 - ozone concentrations (ppmv) at 205 GHz,
3) ClO - chlorine monoxide concentrations (ppmv),
4) H2O - water vapor concentrations (ppmv), and
5) TEMP - atmospheric temperature (degrees K).

The horizontal resolution is 495-km along-track for the Level 3AT/TP
files, and 4 degrees latitude for Level 3AL/LP files.  The UARS
standard data array is the common data structure used for all Level 3
data subtypes.  For MLS the index into the data array corresponds to
standard pressure levels given in millibars, with each level at
approximately 2.5 km increments.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-26<br><pre>

This product consists of three ocean parameters, oceanic wind speed, columnar
water vapor and columnar liquid water.  The products are derived from the
Nimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and were produced by
F. Wentz (Remote Sensing Systems). The data cover a six year period from 1979
to 1984. The data are global and were derived from nighttime passes to reduce
daytime calibration errors. The data are presented by swath and data exists for
13 cells across the swath, resulting in data records that correspond to cells
that are approximately 60 x 60 km on the Earth's surface. Observations within
100km of land are excluded and there is an ice flag. The products were produced
from three of the 10 SMMR channels which closely correspond to SSM/I channels,
using the same algorithm as is used to produce products from SSM/I data
(PO.DAAC data set #33 and 34).  Consequently the SMMR derived data can be used
in conjunction with SSM/I derived data to achieve a longer time series. The
data set is approximately 450Mb in size and is available in unlabeled format on
magnetic tape or via FTP. There is a users manual for this data set.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

Canada and the United States carried out an atmospheric research
program called the Eulerian Model Evaluation Field Study (EMEFS) from
June 1, 1988 to May 31, 1990 under the coordination and management of
a bi-lateral, multi-agency Project Management Group (PMG).

The objective of the program was to collect daily air and
precipitation chemistry data for use in evaluating two Eulerian
long-range transport models: the Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM)
developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the
Atmospheric Deposition and Oxidants Model (ADOM) developed jointly by
Environment Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy,
the German Umweltbundesamt, and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)
(<A HREF=http://www.epri.com/>http://www.epri.com/</A>)


Data collected have been and continue to be used to evaluate estimates of
sulfate (SO4-) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in air and
precipitation.

The EMEFS surface network consisted of approximately 130 sites in five
networks sponsored by different governmental and non-governmental
agencies.  Site selection was coordinated by the agencies to establish
a regionally representative network.

The Acid Model Operational Diagnostic Evaluation Study (Acid MODES),
funded by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is one of five
EMEFS surface networks consisting of 59 EMEFS sites including
variability (VAR) and gradient (GRAD) special study sub-networks.  The
Acid MODES variability sub-network was a four-site cluster of sites
used to evaluate spatial concentration variability on the 80 - 100 km
grid scale of the models being evaluated.  The gradient sub-network
similarly provided a higher spatial network resolution in an area
where sharp spatial concentration gradients were observed in previous
studies.

Routine air quality data include:

precipitation: sulfate (SO4), nitrate (NO3), Chlorine (Cl), ammonium
(NH4), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S(IV)),
and depth.

Aerosol Particles: mass, sulfate (SO4), nitrate (NO3), and ammonium (NH4).

Gaseous: nitric acid (HNO3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and ozone (O3).

Meteorological Data include 3-hour average measurements of wind speed,
wind direction, temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation.

elicited the most interest at the Science Working Group Meeting in
March 1994. The files are grouped by flight and reside in directories
labeled with the dates on which the data was acquired.

To request the complete ARMAR binary dataset, which is available on
8500 density 8mm tape, contact the DAAC User Services Office.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface based instruments for in situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.


INSTRUMENT INFORMATION

Mission and Objectives: ARMAR was developed by NASA/JPL for the
purpose of supporting future spaceborne rain radar systems, including
the radar for the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM) to be flown
in the late 1990s. It flies on the NASA Ames DC-8 aircraft and is
operated by JPL. Its primary goal in TOGA COARE was to measure the
three-dimensional reflectivity of rainfall.

Instrument Geometry: ARMAR operates with the TRMM frequency and
geometry, measuring reflectivity at 13.8 GHz in a cross-track scan
+/-20 degrees from nadir along the flight track of the
aircraft. Nadir-looking, non-scanning measurements can also be
acquired.

Principles of Operation: ARMAR is a pulse compression radar. The
digital controller causes the chirp generator to produce chirps with
the selected length, spacing, and start frequency. In normal
operation, the waveform is a linear, frequency modulated upsweep chirp
with 4 MHz bandwidth and amplitude weighting for range sidelobe
suppression. The chirps are up-converted to 13.8 GHz and amplified by a
high power traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA). The amplified chirp
is then sent to the antenna system. A small amount of power is sent
directly to the receiver through a calibration loop with 84.5 dB
attenuation. The TWTA is operated in the non-saturated mode to
maintain the desired chirp amplitude characteristics. The antenna
system consists of a dual, linearly polarized scalar feed horn which
illuminates a precision offset parabolic reflector. The signal is
focused by the parabolic reflector and reflected by a flat,
mechanically scanned elliptical reflector which scans the beam +/-10
degrees in the crosstrack direction. The reflector can also be pointed
or scanned up to +/-10 degrees in the along track direction, if
desired. Both transmit and receive polarizations can be varied on a
pulse to pulse basis, allowing a combination of like- and/or
cross-polarization data to be collected.

The signal reflected from the rain is collected by the antenna and
then amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA). Following the LNA, the
received signal is down-converted to the 70 MHz intermediate frequency
(IF). Here, the signal is split into radar and radiometer signals. The
radar signal is passed through a programmable attenuator before IF
amplifiers and filters. In the final stage, the signal is
down-converted to baseband (offset video) where it is digitized by a
12-bit, analog/digital converter (ADC) at a rate of 10 MHz and
recorded. The radiometer signal is acquired during a short time within
each interpulse period after return from the transmitted pulse has
reached zero. This signal is integrated in analog circuitry, sampled
every 10 ms, averaged, and recorded.

DATA INFORMATION

The ARMAR dataset is level 1B (calibrated and earth located). The
ARMAR data have an approximate volume of 4 GB and a typical file size
of up to 10 MB. The ARMAR file naming convention reflects the julian
day and the time of the measurements and are of the format
"ddhhmm.ARM."

Data Format: The ARMAR files are being archived in their native binary
format and will eventually be superseded by HDF formatted
files. Software is provided to convert the ARMAR data to NCAR's DORADE
format. ARMAR files in DORADE format will contain single polarization,
doppler data.

                           Table 2
         Interpretation of "ahd.dat_type" from Table 1

dat_type:  meaning:

1         Single polarization, no doppler:  read nbin samples of dBZ into
          array z1.
2         Dual polarization, no doppler: read nbin samples into z1, then
          nbin samples into z2.
3         Single polarization doppler: read nbin dBZ values into z1, nbin
          m/s values into velocity array v1, then nbin m/s samples into
          doppler width array w1.
4 or 5    Dual pol. doppler: read nbin samples each into z1, v1, w1, z2,
          v2, and w2.  Polarizations are given in "ahd.p1" and "ahd.p2".
          Type 5 normally implies cross-pol data for z2.  Type 4 normally
          implies HH/VV polarizations.
8         Single pol. noise floor: read nbin samples of mean noise into n1
          array, and nbin samples of noise variance into nv1.
9         Dual pol noise floor: read nbin samples each into n1, nv1, n2,
          nv2.  These pol's should be paired with subsequent type 2, 4, or
          5 dual polarized radar data.

note: z1, z2, v1, v2, w1, w2, n1, n2, nv1, nv2 should all be allocated as 400
integer arrays.

Documentation: Two documents are available to assist users in reading
and understanding ARMAR data: The "Quick Reference Guide", included
with this distribution (ascii file "quickref.txt"), and the more
comprehensive "User's Guide", available in this directory in file
"user.ps" (see Section 8.1). The Quick Reference Guide describes the
JPL internal format, how to read it, and describes software that is
available to assist the user. The User's Guide provides a description
of the hardware and its operating modes, data collection, processing,
and calibration, and data quality assessment.

Browse Products: Color Post-Script images of selected flight segments
reside in directory armar/armar_images. Images show nadir reflectivity
as a function of height along with brightness temperature as a
function of cross-track position. Each image represents about 10
minutes of data. The file names follow the dddhhmm.ps convention
indicating the day (ddd) and approximate start time (hhmm) of the
plot. Images can be viewed using any post-script viewer (i.e.,
pageview, ghostview, etc.).  No doppler or cross-polarized data are
plotted.

Software: The DAAC distributes read and conversion software that was
provided by the data producers at JPL: - "read_arm.c" Code to read
ARMAR data and display it to the terminal - "arm2dor.c" Code to
convert ARMAR data from its native binary format to
DORADE format

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-08<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
Environmental Technology Laboratory (ETL) Doppler radar was used
during the Fire Cirrus II experiment in Coffeyville, Kansas to
document the structural, kinematic, microphysical and turbulent
properties of climatically important cirrus cloud systems.  Data were
collected from November 13, 1991 through November 29, 1991.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-15<br><pre>

DATASET_COMMENTS:

The NASA Water Vapor Project data set (NVAP) is a total column
(integrated) water vapor data set comprised of a combination of
radiosonde observations, Television and Infrared Operational Satellite
(TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), and Special Sensor
Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data sets.  This is 5-year total and layered
(1988-1992) global water vapor data set.  The global layered water
vapor data set is created by slicing the total water vapor data set
using layered information that TOVS and radiosonde data provides.  As
a companion data set for analysis, STC-METSAT also prepared a global
(over oceans only), integrated cloud liquid water data set (since the
best global climate models now contain liquid water as an explicit
variable). STC-METSAT developed methods to process the data at a daily
time scale and 1o x 1o spatial resolution.  This work has become an
internationally accepted contribution to the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP).

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-01<br><pre>

The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) version 7 Daily Gridded
Data consist of daily, global coverage of total ozone integrated over
the depth of the atmosphere and bulk reflectivity resulting from the
combined effects of the surface, clouds and tropospheric aerosols. The
temporal coverage of the data is from November 1978 to May 1993
(Nimbus-7 TOMS), and from August 1991 to December 1994 (Meteor-3 TOMS).
These data are archived at the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center
(DAAC).  Two new TOMS instruments were launched in July 1996 (Earth Probe
TOMS) and August 1996 (ADEOS TOMS).  Data from these instruments will be
archived at the Goddard DAAC when they become available.

This product supersedes both the version 6 GRIDTOMS data produced by
the Ozone Processing Team (OPT) at Goddard Space Flight Center and
archived at the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC), as well as
the derivative version 6 TOMS DAYGRIDS data set archived at the Goddard
DAAC.

The total ozone and reflectivity are mapped to a global grid of size
180 x 288 with a lat-long resolution of 1.00 x 1.25 degrees. These
data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) and are much
more easily visualized than the original GRIDTOMS data. HDF was
developed by the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA)
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

TOMS is the only source of high resolution global information about
the total ozone content of the atmosphere. As such, the data set is
important in studies involving upper air dynamics and chemistry on
both short (interannual) and long (decadal) time scales. The TOMS
instrument and its successors are the primary means by which regional
(e.g., polar) and global ozone patterns have been monitored on a
daily basis since 1978.

These data may be downloaded via anonymous ftp or ordered on media
from the Goddard DAAC.  To access the data through the anonymous ftp
server:

  1. ftp daac.gsfc.nasa.gov <A HREF=ftp://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov>ftp://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>

  2. login = anonymous, password = your e-mail address
  3. cd /data/toms

There is a README file describing how to access the data from the
files. The data files are in subdirectories by satellite, year,
and month (ex. /data/toms/nimbus7/1990/02). User Guides in Adobe
Acrobat format can be found in the documentation directory. Simple
read software are located in the software directory.

The DAAC maintains an online Web-based browser for previewing the
data and placing orders. The URL for the TOMS browser is at
<A HREF=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/BRS_SRVR/tomsbrs_main.html>http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/BRS_SRVR/tomsbrs_main.html</A>.


One can also place an order for the TOMS data by visiting the DAAC
Home Page at <A HREF=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov>http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>.  To access the DAAC Web

Search and Order page first click on the "Data" icon, then click on
the "Archives" icon, and then choose the "TOMS" link.  The data can
be ordered on 8mm tape (8200 and 8500 format), 4mm tape (60m and 90m),
9-track 6250 bpi, or ftp.

For those without Web access the data can also be ordered through the
DAAC online Information Management System (IMS).  Simply telnet to
daac.gsfc.nasa.gov (username = daacims, password = gsfcdaac).
("telnet://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov")

The TOMS version 7 data are also available on CD-ROMs.  First goto the
DAAC Home Page at <A HREF=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov>http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>, then click on the "Data"

icon, and then choose the "CD-ROM" link.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>

The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget(Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly on a mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10).
Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument
package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.

The MFOV (medium-field-of-view) SF (shape factor) S-10 contains inverted
daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and longwave
radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month.  This data
set is produced for each of the satellites (ERBS and NOAA-9) and the
combination of satellites which are operational during the data month.
The values for this data set are derived using the shape factor
technique(Smith et al. 1986).  As described in the Earth Radiant
Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Nonscanner S-10/S-10N User's Guide,
the data contains a 30 byte header, 67 scale factors which are used to
scale the data in the first record, and 26 scale factors which are
used to scale the data in the second record.  The data set also
contains two records for each processed region.  The first record is
of fixed length (990 words) and contains averaged data.  The second
record is of variable length and contains individual hour box
estimates.  The length of the second record, in words, is calculated
by multiplying the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by
the number of values stored for each hour box (38 for the nonscanner).

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-01<br><pre>

The GSFC Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) has available four
CD-ROM sets containing Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data
from the Nimbus-7 and Meteor-3 missions. All of the CD-ROMs were
produced by the Ozone Processing Team (OPT) at NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center, Code 916.

1) Nimbus-7 TOMS Ozone CD-ROM set:
This is a 2 disk set containing the Nimbus-7 TOMS Ozone data from
November 1978 to May 1993. The data are globally averaged into grid cells
1 degre in latitude by 1.25 degrees in longitude. The first disk contains
daily and monthly gridded data for the period November 1978 through 1987.
Data files are in ASCII format. A document subdirectory contains the
Nimbus-7 TOMS User's guide in Adobe Acrobat format. A software directory
contains C, Fortran, and IDL programs to read the ozone data files, and
freeware packages to view the GIF and Adobe files for both PC and Macintosh
machines.  The second disk contains similar data for 1988 through May 1993,
as well as daily and monthly zonal means, TOMS "overpass" data for 371
individual ground locations, and daily GIF images.

2) Nimbus-7 TOMS Reflectivity CD-ROM set:
This is a 2 disk set containing the Nimbus-7 TOMS Reflectivity data from
November 1978 to May 1993. The data are globally averaged into grid cells
1 degre in latitude by 1.25 degrees in longitude. The first disk contains
daily and monthly gridded data for the period November 1978 through 1987.
Data files are in ASCII format. A document subdirectory contains the
Nimbus-7 TOMS User's guide in Adobe Acrobat format. The second CD-ROM
contains similar data for 1988 through May 1993, as well as daily and monthly
zonal means, TOMS "overpass" data for 371 individual ground locations, and
daily GIF images.

3) The Nimbus-7 TOMS UV-Erythemal Exposure CD-ROM
This CD-ROM contains data representing the relative daily areal exposures
of ultraviolet (UV) radiation effective in causing skin irritation. The data
are derived from the version 7 Nimbus-7 TOMS data for the period from
November 1978 to March 1993. The data are averaged into grid cells 1 degree
in latitude by 1.25 degrees in longitude, and between 65 north and 65 south
latitude. The CD-ROM contains erythemally weighted daily UV exposures at
the Earth's surface and a readme file. Data files are in ASCII format.

4) The Meteor-3 TOMS Ozone and Reflectivity CD-ROM
This CD-ROM contains the version 7 TOMS total ozone and reflectivity data
from from August 1991 to November 1994. The measurements have been averaged
into daily grid cells 1 degree in latitude by 1.25 degrees in longitude.
The CD-ROM contains daily gridded ozone and reflectivity data, zonal means,
"overpass" data for 371 individual ground locations, and ozone GIF images.
The data files are in ASCII format. A document subdirectory contains the
Meteor-3 TOMS User's guide in Adobe Acrobat format. A software directory
contains C, Fortran, and IDL programs to read the ozone data files, and

The Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) on NASA's Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite (UARS) measures the type, amount, energy, and
distribution of charged particles injected into the Earth's
thermosphere, mesosphere, and stratosphere.

DESCRIPTION:

PEM consists of four instruments: the Atmospheric X-Ray Imaging
Spectrometer (AXIS), the High Energy Particle Spectrometer (HEPS), the
Medium Energy Spectrometer (MEPS), and the Vector Magnetometer (VMAG).
AXIS produces global images of brehmstrahlung X-rays produced by
energetic electrons incident upon the atmosphere in the 3 to 100 keV
range.  The instrument is made up of 16 silicon detector modules that
view the Earth limb-to-limb.  The HEPS and MEPS instruments provide
in-situ measurements of precipitating electrons and protons.  HEPS
measures electrons in 32 logarithmic steps from 30 keV to 5000 keV,
and protons are measured in 32 logarithmic steps from 0.10 MeV to 150
MeV.  The MEPS instrument measures the local particle population in
the energy range from 1 eV to 32000 eV, generating a 31 point
logarithmic energy spectra every 2 seconds. MEPS consisted of five
analyzer heads that determined the electron and ion population.
Finally, the VMAG instrument observes the local magnetic field using a
3-axis fluxgate magnetometer.

The PEM instruments are distributed across the UARS spacecraft.  Two
HEPS (HEPS1 and HEPS2), one MEPS (ZMEPS), and the VMAG instrument are
located on a zenith looking boom, called the Zenith Energetic Particle
System (ZEPS).  An Earth pointing boom, the Nadir Energetic Particle
System (NEPS), contains one HEPS (HEPS3) and one MEPS (NMEPS).  The
AXIS instrument is mounted separately on the forward part of the UARS
platform.

DATA PRODUCTS:

PEM_L3AT_DAILY
--------------

The PEM level 3AT data are time-ordered profiles spaced at intervals
of 1 UARS minute (65.536 seconds), or approximately 495 km along the
tangent track.  The level 3AT format is common to all UARS instruments
to allow for intercomparison.  The PEM level 3AT data consist of 18
granules per day.  A data granule is defined as one PEM subtype per
day.  The following subtypes are available:

 1. EDEP3AT_ELEC - electron energy deposition
 2. EDEP3AT_P01  - x-ray pixel 01 energy deposition
 3. EDEP3AT_P02  - x-ray pixel 02 energy deposition
 4. EDEP3AT_P03  - x-ray pixel 03 energy deposition
 5. EDEP3AT_P04  - x-ray pixel 04 energy deposition
 6. EDEP3AT_P05  - x-ray pixel 05 energy deposition
 7. EDEP3AT_P06  - x-ray pixel 06 energy deposition

Units for energy deposition rate are in [erg/cm**3/sec].  The
horizontal resolution of the level 3AT data product is about 495 km
along the tangent track.  The vertical resolution for the level 3AT
PEM profiles is defined by the UARS altitude levels (in km) given by:

Z(i) = 5 * i,                i <= 12
Z(i) = 60 + (i - 12) * 3,    13 <= i <= 32
Z(i) = 120 + (i - 32) * 10,  33 <= i <= 50

The electron and proton energy deposition level 3AT data are produced
from the level 2 HEPS and MEPS data, and gridded to the 65.535 second
level 3AT format.  Data is only produced at times when there are
simultaneous HEPS and MEPS measurements.  For higher resolution there
is the special PEM level 3TP data product.

PEM_L3TP_DAILY
--------------

The PEM level 3TP data are a special data product, and should not be
confused with the level 3TP parameter files produced for the UARS MLS,
HALOE, ISAMS, and WINDII.  The PEM 3TP data provide a higher temporal
resolution than the level 3AT data, and contain the HEPS and MEPS data
in separate files.  The HEPS data are at 65.536 second resolution, and
the MEPS data are at 2.048 second resolution.  The PEM level 3TP data
consist of 4 granules per day:

1. HEPS_ELEC_ED - HEPS electron energy deposition
2. HEPS_PROT_ED - HEPS proton energy deposition
3. MEPS_ELEC_ED - MEPS electron energy deposition
4. MEPS_PROT_ED - MEPS proton energy deposition

Vertical resolution and data units are the same as for the level 3AT data.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-06-15<br><pre>

This entry describes two similar data products containing extinction
profiles of stratospheric aerosols.  They are derived from
observations made by the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment
(SAGE I and SAGE II) onboard the Application Explorer Mission II
(AEM-2) satellite and the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS),
respectively.

The aerosol profiles are inverted from solar irradiances measured
during solar occultation (at 1000 and 450 nm by SAGE I, and 1020, 525,
453, and 385 nm by SAGE II).  There are 15 sunrise and sunset events
per day, with each event sweeping over various latitude ranges (from
approximately 80 deg N. to 80 deg S.) and separated by 24 deg
longitude. The vertical aerosol profiles cover from cloud top (>10 km)
to 40 km at 1-km resolution, and the uncertainty in the value is
typically 10% below an altitude of 25 km.

Except for the first year of each launch, each tape contains data from
December of one year to November of the following year.  All tapes are
written in the CDC 60-bit format.  This data set covers SAGE I data
from February 1979 to November 1981, and SAGE II data from October
1984 to the present.

SAGE I and SAGE II aerosol profiles are also available in Common Data
Format (CDF) through the NASA Climate Data System (NCDS) at the
Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).

SAGE I and SAGE II aerosol profiles are also in CDF on the Greenhouse
Effect detection Experiment (GEDEX) CD-ROM along with other SAGE I and
SAGE II profiles and other related satellite measurements.

Closely related to this data set is the Nimbus 7 Stratospheric Aerosol
Measurement II (SAM II) Beta-Aerosol Number Density Archive Data Tape
(BANAT).  Aerosol profiles at 1000 nm are available from November 1978
to the present from the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC).

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-06-16<br><pre>

The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) is a payload
installed aboard the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) that was
launched on October 5, 1984, from NASA Space Shuttle Flight 41-G.  The
SAGE II instrument is a multi-channel spectral radiometer that
measures the attenuation of solar radiation at seven wavelengths as
they pass through the Earth's atmosphere during the spacecraft's
sunrise and sunset events.  In one day's time the ERBS spacecraft
encounters approximately fifteen sunrise and fifteen sunset events.
The SAGE II instrument captures solar radiation data for each event.
The data span a vertical distance from about 140 kilometers to the
horizon or a cloud top.  The ground-track slew distance during data
capture varies directly with the duration of the event.  Event
duration will vary with the beta angle of the event; the larger the
absolute beta angle, the longer the event will be.

The aerosol extinction data provides altitude profiles at 1020, 525,
453, and 385 nm.  The vertical resolution of the aerosol profiles is
one kilometer and their estimated uncertainty is about +-10%.  Error
estimates of the values in each altitude level are included in this
data set.  Aerosol profiles above 45 kilometers are currently not
provided and contain "fill" data.

The data are available in the SAGE II native format.  This data set is
archived at the EOSDIS Langley DAAC in Hampton, Virginia.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-11-15<br><pre>

This data set contains level 2 automatic gain control data, sea surface height,
satellite height (with respect to the reference ellipsoid) and wind speed data
from the Seasat altimeter. In addition to its main parameters, this data set
contains corrections for the influences of wet and dry atmospheric path,
ionosphere and tides.  The orbit has a vertical error of about 1 meter at
characteristic periods of 100 minutes (1 revolution).  The altimeter error is
about 10 cm, decommutated over points separated in time by 1 second.
Corrections for altimeter bias and electromagnetic bias are not included and
orbit corrections must be performed by the user. SEASAT was launched on  June
28, 1978, carrying a five sensor payload,  and operated successfully until a
power failure brought transmission to a stop on October 10, 1978.  Its height
and inclination were 791 km and 108.0 deg., respectively.  The data volume is
20.3 GB and the smallest order is approximately 140 MB

The objective of the altimeter (ALT) was to determine ocean topography  with a
height measurement precision of 10 cm.  Altitude was determined by   measuring
the time required for a pulse to be transmitted, reflected from the ocean
surface and received by the altimeter.  The ALT carrier frequency was 13.5  GHz
and operated in chirp pulse mode with a 3.2 micro-sec uncompressed pulse  width
and 3.125 nanosecond compressed pulse width.  The pulse limited   footprint
diameter was 1.2 km for calm seas and up to 12 km in rough seas.

Related data sets: SEASAT ALT (levels 1a, 1b)
SMMR (levels 1a, 1b, 2),
SASS (levels 1a, 1b, 2) and
VIRR (level 1a)

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>
    As part of an overall impact project, including studies of the
invertebrates and rare plant species, vegetation recording was conducted
adjacent to the construction sites for the coastal platform (sea-cliffs)
and the terminal area (chalk grassland).

     i) Sixty-eight marked quadrats were recorded on the sea-cliffs in each
year, half of these adjacent to the coastal platform, and half at sites
beyond its predicted influence.

    ii) Forty-eight marked quadrats were recorded in each year on eight
transects (each of six quadrats) arranged along the escarpment such that
36 were liable to be influenced by the construction works, whilst 12 were
though to be beyond such influence.

    The cliff quadrats were marked using metal pegs, whilst those on the
downland used wooden pegs.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-15<br><pre>

DATASET_COMMENTS:

The NASA Water Vapor Project data set (NVAP) is a total column
(integrated) water vapor data set comprised of a combination of
radiosonde observations, Television and Infrared Operational Satellite
(TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), and Special Sensor
Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data sets.  This is 5-year total and layered
(1988-1992) global water vapor data set.  The global layered water
vapor data set is created by slicing the total water vapor data set
using layered information that TOVS and radiosonde data provides.  As
a companion data set for analysis, STC-METSAT also prepared a global
(over oceans only), integrated cloud liquid water data set (since the
best global climate models now contain liquid water as an explicit
variable). STC-METSAT developed methods to process the data at a daily
time scale and 1o x 1o spatial resolution.  This work has become an
internationally accepted contribution to the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP).

     The most straightforward way to measure temperature versus
depth in the ocean is to lower a thermometer a known distance and
take the temperature.  So-called 'protected reversing thermometers'
have been developed for just that purpose, and are routinely
accurate to 0.02 degrees C.  One disadvantage of this method is
that temperatures can only obtained for a few depths.

     The great advantage of the 'bathythermograph' is that,
although less accurate than the reversing thermometer, it gives a
continuous trace of temperature against depth.  A liquid-in-metal
thermometer causes a metal point to move in one direction over a
smoked glass slide which is itself moved at right angles to this
direction by a pressure sensitive bellows.  The instrument is
lowered to its permitted depth (generally 60, 140 or 270 m) and
then brought back up.  Since pressure is directly related to depth,
the line scratched on the smoked glass forms a graph of temperature
against depth.  It is read against a calibration grid to a typical
accuracy of 0.2 degrees C and 2 meters.

     In wide use now is the expendable bathythermograph (XBT) which
uses a thermistor as temperature sensitive element.  The thermistor
is in a small streamlined weighted casing which is simply dropped
over the ship's side.  It is connected by a fine wire, on special
free-unwinding spools, to a recorder on the ship which traces the
temperature of the water in a graphical plot against depth.  The
depth is not sensed directly but estimated from the time elapsed
since release, using the known rate of sink of the thermistor
casing.  This casing is relatively inexpensive and is not
recovered.  These XBTs are available for depth ranges from 200 to
1800 meters, and can be used from ships underway or from circling
aircraft.  They can also be dropped from aircraft in a small buoy
which contains a radio transmitter to send temperature/depth
information to the aircraft while it continues its flight.

     The temperature range and depths of several commercial
bathythermographs are given below:

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>
The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget(Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly on a mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10).
Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument
package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.

The WFOV (wide-field-of-view) SF (shape factor) S-10 contains inverted
daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and longwave
radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month.  This data
set is produced for each of the satellites (ERBS, NOAA-9, and NOAA-10)
and the combination of satellites.

The values for this data set are derived using the shape factor
technique (Smith et al. 1986). As described in the Earth Radiant
Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Nonscanner S-10/S-10N User's Guide,
the data set contains a 30 byte header record, 67 scale factors which
are used to scale the data in the first record, and 26 scale factors
which are used to scale the data in the second record.  The data set
also contains two records for each processed region.  The first record
is of fixed length (990 words) and contains averaged data.  The second
record is of variable length containing individual hour box estimates.
The length of the second record, in words, is calculated by
multiplying the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by the
number of values stored for each hour box (38 for the nonscanner).

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-03-13<br><pre>

The data product consists of global sea surface temperature (SST) from
January 1987 to December 1993.  The product, derived from the five-channel
AVHRR instruments onboard the NOAA 7/9/11 polar orbiting satellites, form
a high-quality data set suitable for global studies.  The product is
improved over previously available satellite derived SST data (JPL PO.DAAC
Product 016) in that the data have been produced using improved
data-processing including incorporation of new cloud-detection algorithms
developed by the University of Miami, inter-calibration among the
satellites, and quality analysis procedures implemented through the AVHRR
Pathfinder Ocean group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  In addition the
data are more complete because they are derived from the original AVHRR
data rather than from a subset as provided by NOAA for operational
purposes.

Oceans Pathfinder data sets are available within the following six
broad categories of products:
050 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder global equal-angle all SST v1 (NOAA, NASA)
051 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder global equal-angle best SST v1 (NOAA, NASA)
053 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder 0.5 deg spatial resolution global SST v1
(NOAA, NASA)
070 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder global equal-angle all SST v3 (NOAA, NASA)
071 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder global equal-angle best SST v3 (NOAA, NASA)
073 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder global 0.5-deg.resolution SST v3 (NOAA, NASA)

The data from which the products have been made consists of a set of
daily global images where the image size is 4096 x 2048 pixels with a
spatial resolution of aproximately 9 km at the equator.  The
equal-angle grid has the same number of SST values in both latitude
and longitude for the entire globe.  The 'all SST' product contains
all available values and the associated statistics whereas the 'best
SST' product is where the value per pixel is not averaged but is
selected as being the best based on algorithm analysis of surrounding
values.  Options within products include daily averaged and monthly
averaged day and night data. Data are also available with a nominal 9
km, 18 km and 54 km resolution.  The primary data format is HDF
although some data is available in raw binary.  The best SST product
is available via ftp from <A HREF=ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub>ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub</A>. The data

can also be provided on tape. Version 1 products without a version
number have been processed with yearly coefficients and cover the
period 1987 to mid 1991.  Version 3 of this product involves
reprocessing with monthly rather than yearly coefficients and covers
the period 1990 - 1993.

Researchers can also easily extract regional subsets from the
global best SST files via the WWW (<A HREF=http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/sst>http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/sst</A>)

using an on-line subsetting routine.

For most purposes, the best SST product is probably the
most useful Pathfinder SST product.  An equal-area product is
also available by special request because file sizes are very large
(100 MB/ascending global image).  Please contact the JPL DAAC for
information on this product.  For a longer SST time series, please see
Product 016.

The AVHRR Pathfinder Oceans Matchup Database is a unique "by-product"
of the Pathfinder SST data set development.  The matchup database is a
multi-year, multi-satellite database of approximately co-temporal,
co-located in-situ SST (moored and drifting buoys are included) and
AVHRR GAC measurements.  These records, called "matchups", can be used
to develop and test algorithms for the estimation of sea surface
temperature using AVHRR data and for validation exercises.  A complete
description of the AVHRR Pathfinder Oceans Matchup Database can be
found on the WWW (<A HREF=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/~gui/matchups.html>http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/~gui/matchups.html</A>).


The Matchup files themselves are also available from PO.DAAC as the
following product: 069 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder SST and buoy match-up
data (Podesta et al.). Data validation information is available from
<A HREF=http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/~lizsmith>http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/~lizsmith</A>.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-06-19<br><pre>

The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment I (SAGE I) instrument was
launched on board the Applications Explorer Mission-2 (AEM-2)
satellite, which was dedicated to the SAGE I mission.  SAGE I provided
global data collection of aerosol vertical extinction profiles, ozone
vertical concentration profiles, and nitrogen dioxide vertical
concentration profiles.  The SAGE I instrument was a Sun photometer
that measured the attenuation of solar radiation in four spectral
regions through the Earth's atmosphere during spacecraft sunrise and
sunset.  The solar radiance data were combined with spacecraft
ephemeris and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
meteorological data and then numerically inverted to yield altitude
profiles of aerosol extinction at wavelengths of 1000 and 450 nm and
altitude profiles of ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentration.

The SAGE I aerosol data were validated by comparison with correlative
lidar and dustsonde in situ measurements.  These data are currently
archived at the the EOSDIS Langley DAAC in Hampton, Virginia.  These
data are archived in the SAGE I native format.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-12-30<br><pre>

A special set of analysis products for the Atlantic Stratocumulus
Transition Experiment (ASTEX) region during June 1-28, 1992 was
prepared by Ernst Klinker and Tony Hollingsworth of the European
Centre for Medium-range Forecasting (ECMWF), and reformatted by Chris
Bretherton of Univ. of Washington.  These analyses, or more correctly
initializations and very short range forecasts using the ECMWF T213L30
operational model, incorporate routine observations from the global
network and special soundings from ASTEX that were sent to ECMWF
during ASTEX via the GTS telecommunication system.  About 650 special
soundings were incorporated, including nearly all soundings from Santa
Maria, Porto Santo, and the French ship Le Suroit, most of the
soundings taken on the Valdivia and Malcolm Baldridge, and almost none
of the soundings from the Oceanus.  Surface reports from the research
ships were also incorporated into the analyses after the first week of
the experiment.  Aircraft soundings were not included in the analyses.
ECMWF has requested that anyone making use of this data set
acknowledge them, and that those investigators publishing research
that makes more than casual use of this data set contact Ernst Klinker
or Tony Hollingsworth.

The data have been decoded by Chris Bretherton into ASCII files, one
for each horizontal field at a given level and base time.  All data
have the same horizontal resolution of 1.25 degrees in latitude and
longitude and correspond to base (initialization) times of 00, 06, 12,
or 18Z.  Different fields have different lat/lon ranges and sets of
available vertical levels, as tabulated below.  Also, some fields are
instantaneous (I) while others are accumulated (A) over the first 6
hours of a forecast initialized at the base time.  This is tabulated
in the 'time range' column below.  Instantaneous fields are best
compared with data at the base time, while accumulated fields are best
compared with data three hours after the base time.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>
The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget (Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly on a mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite, (Earth
Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and
NOAA-10).  Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner
instrument package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.

The MFOV (medium-field-of-view) NF (numerical filter) S-10 contains
inverted daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and
longwave radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month.
This data set is produced for each of the satellites (ERBS and NOAA-9)
and the combination of satellites.  The values for this data set are
derived using the numerical filter technique (Smith et al. 1986).  As
described in the Earth Radiant Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9,
Nonscanner S-10/S-10N User's Guide, the data contains a 30 byte header
record, 67 scale factors which are used to scale the data in record
one, and 26 scale factors which are used to scale the data in record
two.  The data set also contains two records for each processed
region.  The first record is of fixed length (990 words) and contains
averaged data.  The second record is of variable length and contains
individual hour box estimates.  The length of the second record, in
words, is calculated by multiplying the number of boxes (978th word of
record one) by the number of values stored for each hour box (38 for
the nonscanner).

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13
- December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The Belfort Laser Ceilometer was operated during FIRE ASTEX on Porto
Santo, Madeira.  It utilized a 20 watt near-infrared Gallium-Arsenide
laser operating at a wavelength of 0.91 microns to detect cloud base
height.  It employed 1024 range gates which yield a vertical
resolution of 25 feet up to a maximum range of 25,600 feet.  The
fields of view of the transmitter and receiver are approximately 1
degree.

The ceilometer used a measured "noise level" to determine a "count"
(-1,0,1) which is then summed for each gate.  This "histogram" is the
basic output from which the cloud base height is estimated.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-08-08<br><pre>

Vertically integrated water vapor and cloud liquid water data products
(designated as version 1) were derived over the oceans from
measurements of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager on the DMSP F-8
satellite.  The products are limited to water surfaces since ocean
surface emissivities are low at microwave frequencies which provide a
sufficiently cold background in which to sense water vapor and liquid
water.  Over land and ice surfaces; however, the retrieval of these
quantities is more difficult because of the large and highly variable
surface emissivities.

These products were generated using the physical retrieval method of
Greenwald et al., (1993).  Briefly, the method consists of an
inversion of a simple physical model at two frequencies (19.35 and 37
GHz) to yield the integrated water vapor and cloud liquid water
simultaneously.  The data are made up of monthly mean quantities on 1
degree by 1 degree grids from July 1987 to December 1991.  All
products are in units of kg per meter squared (or, equivalently
millimeters).
The uncertainties in the cloud liquid water observations are estimated
to range typically from about 25% to 40% depending on the surface and
atmospheric conditions and on the amount of liquid water (Greenwald et
al., 1993).  A limited comparison to ground-based microwave radiometer
measurements over the North Sea and at San Nicolas Island off the
coast of California revealed rms differences of 0.036-0.046 mm. The
water vapor observations, when compared to a limited set of radiosonde
measurements, have estimated uncertainties of 5.9 mm for water vapor
above about 30 mm and 1.9 mm for water vapor below 30 mm (Greenwald et
al., 1993).

The cloud liquid water data set was added to include only those
situations where water clouds were present within the instrument's
FOV.  Thus, these data sets provide the "true" cloud liquid water
since FOV's mostly free of water clouds are excluded from the monthly
average.  A threshold of 0.025 mm in the liquid water retrievals was
used to distinguish between clear and cloudy FOV's.  A more thorough
discussion of this topic is presented by Lin and Rossow (1994).

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13
- December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The CSU wind profiler is a five beam wind profiler with high and low
modes of operation.  The wind profiler is a clear air doppler radar
and operates at a frequency of 404.37 MHz.  It operated with a height
resolution of 250m and measured radial velocities up to about 15km.

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

SOFIA (Surface of the Ocean, Fluxes and Interaction with the
Atmosphere) is a research program carried out by French groups from
the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement (CRPE),
Laboratoire l'Aerologie (LA)-Toulouse, Centre de Meteorologie Marine
(CMM)-Brest, Institut Francais de Rechercher sur la Mer
(IFREMER)-Brest, Service d'Aeronomie-Paris, and Laboratoire de
Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)-Palaiseau with cooperation from Centre
National de Recherche Meteorologique (CNRM)-Toulouse.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.

This data set contains the radiation and pressure measurements
collected on Le Suroit during Astex.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-04<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

A special set of analysis products for the Atlantic Stratocumulus
Transition Experiment (ASTEX) region during June 1-28, 1992 was
prepared by Ernst Klinker and Tony Hollingsworth of the European
Centre for Medium-range Forecasting (ECMWF), and reformatted by Chris
Bretherton of Univ. of Washington.  These analyses, or more correctly
initializations and very short range forecasts using the ECMWF T213L30
operational model, incorporate routine observations from the global
network and special soundings from ASTEX that were sent to ECMWF
during ASTEX via the GTS telecommunication system.  About 650 special
soundings were incorporated, including nearly all soundings from Santa
Maria, Porto Santo, and the French ship Le Suroit, most of the
soundings taken on the Valdivia and Malcolm Baldridge, and almost none
of the soundings from the Oceanus.  Surface reports from the research
ships were also incorporated into the analyses after the first week of
the experiment.  Aircraft soundings were not included in the analyses.
ECMWF has requested that anyone making use of this data set
acknowledge them, and that those investigators publishing research
that makes more than casual use of this data set contact Ernst Klinker
or Tony Hollingsworth.

The data have been decoded by Chris Bretherton into ASCII files, one
for each horizontal field at a given level and base time.  All data
have the same horizontal resolution of 1.25 degrees in latitude and
longitude and correspond to base (initialization) times of 00, 06, 12,
or 18Z.  Different fields have different lat/lon ranges and sets of
available vertical levels, as tabulated below.  Also, some fields are
instantaneous (I) while others are accumulated (A) over the first 6
hours of a forecast initialized at the base time.  This is tabulated
in the 'time range' column below.  Instantaneous fields are best
compared with data at the base time, while accumulated fields are best
compared with data three hours after the base time.

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-07-13<br><pre>

This Seasat data set contains Level 1b altimeter data.  The parameters are the
satellite height above the sea surface (from the altimeter), sigma-naught, and
the satellite height with respect to the reference ellipsoid from orbit
determination. The data set volume is approximately 3.5 GB and the smallest
order is approximately 140 MB.

SEASAT was launched on June 28, 1978, carrying a five sensor payload,   and
operated successfully until a power failure brought transmission to a stop on
October 10, 1978.  Its height and inclination were 791 km and 108.0 deg.,
respectively.

The objective of the altimeter (ALT) was to determine ocean topography  with a
height measurement precision of 10 cm.  Altitude was determined by   measuring
the time required for a pulse to be transmitted, reflected from the ocean
surface and received by the altimeter.  The ALT carrier frequency was 13.5  GHz
and operated in chirp pulse mode with a 3.2 micro-sec uncompressed pulse  width
and 3.125 nano-sec compressed pulse width.  The pulse limited  footprint
diameter was 1.2 km for calm seas and 12 km for rough seas.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-07-13<br><pre>

This data set contains Level 1a engineering parameters from the Seasat
altimeter.  Parameters include satellite height, waveform data, wave height
and automatic gain control. These primary parameters were telemetered to  the
ground processing system at a 10/second rate and are uncorrected for
environmental effects. The objective of the altimeter (ALT) was to determine
ocean topography with a height measurement precision of 10 cm.  Altitude  was
determined by measuring the time required for a pulse to be  transmitted,
reflected from the ocean surface and received by the altimeter.

The altimeter carrier frequency was 13.5 GHz and operated in chirp pulse
mode with a 3.2 micro-sec uncompressed pulse width and 3.125
nanosecond compressed pulse width.  The pulse limited footprint diameter
was 1.2 km for calm seas and up to 12 km for rough seas.  The data volume
for this product is approximately 20.3 GB and the smallest order available
from the archive is approximately 140 MB, which is equivalent to a day.

SEASAT was launched on June 28, 1978, carrying a five sensor payload,   and
operated successfully until a power failure brought transmission to a stop on
October 10, 1978.  Its height and inclination were 791 km and 108.0 deg.,
respectively.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

SOFIA (Surface of the Ocean, Fluxes and Interaction with the
Atmosphere) is a research program carried out by French groups from
the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement (CRPE),
Laboratoire l'Aerologie (LA)-Toulouse, Centre de Meteorologie Marine
(CMM)-Brest, Institut Francais de Rechercher sur la Mer
(IFREMER)-Brest, Service d'Aeronomie-Paris, and Laboratoire de
Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)-Palaiseau with cooperation from Centre
National de Recherche Meteorologique (CNRM)-Toulouse.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-27<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

This data set contains sounding measurements taken in Funchal,
Madeiras during June, 1987-1992.  Six files contain 00Z data and five
files contain 12Z data.

combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical

The University of North Dakota owns and operates a Cessna Citation II
aircraft (N77ND) for the purpose of atmospheric research.  This
aircraft type has a number of design and performance characteristics
which make it an ideal platform for a wide range of atmospheric
studies.  A series of structural modifications have been made to the
basic airplane.  These include the following: pylons under the wing
tips for a variety of probes in the undisturbed air flow away from the
fuselage; a nose boom for wind measurement; a heated radome to prevent
ice accumulation on the nose area; special mounts for upward and
downward looking radiometers; side-facing camera mounts for time-lapse
cameras; optically-flat glass windows for photography; and an air
inlet port for air sampling inside the pressurized cabin.  The
research instrumentation available on the Citation for the second
Cirrus IFO is described below.

The basic instrumentation package measured temperature, dew point
temperature, pressure, wind and cloud microphysical characteristics
along with aircraft position, altitude and performance parameters. The
three-dimensional wind field is derived from measurements of
acceleration, pitch, roll and yaw combined with angles of attack and
sideslip and indicated airspeed. The aircraft parameters were supplied
by an LTN-76 inertial navigation system and a Global Positioning
System (GPS).  Turbulence intensity can be derived from differential
pressure transducers and INS accelerometer outputs.

Cloud microphysics were sampled with PMS 1D-P, 2D-C, 1D-C and FSSP
probes, and a continuous formvar replicator from DRI.  A number of gas
and aerosol sampling instruments were available.  These included fast
response O3 and NO2 monitors and a condensation nuclei counter.

A forward-looking video camera was used to provide a visual record of
flight conditions.  The data were sampled at various rates from 1 to
24 sec-1.  The sampling is controlled by the on-board computer system
which also displayed the data in real time in graphic and alphanumeric
formats while recording them on magnetic tape.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-07-25<br><pre>

There are three data sets in this product all of which contain SSM/I derived
winds over the oceans.  The data is produced by Robert Atlas and Joseph
Ardizzone (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center). A 2D variational analysis method
(VAM) was used to combine information from ECMWF surface wind analyses, SSM/I
wind speeds (from Frank Wentz, Remote Sensing Systems), ship and buoy winds,
and 1000-mbar rawinsondes to produce new surface wind analyses between -78 and
78 degrees latitude. Level 2.5 data sets contain SSM/I wind speeds at SMM/I
locations at 6 hour intervals with wind directions assigned from the VAM
analysis.Data sets designated as level 3.0 contain gridded surface winds
produced by the VAM at 6 hour intervals.  Finally, the level 2.5 data is binned
to grid points over 5 and 30 day periods. This is designated as the level 3.5
product.

SSM/I wind speeds have been assimilated every 6 hours for the period July 1987
to June 1990. Extensions will be made as SSM/I data becomes available. All data
sets contain U and V components of the wind in m/s. Gridded data (level 3.0 and
3.5) is represented on a 2 degree latitude by 2.5 degree longitude grid and is
configured as follows:

           rdata(i,j)

            i = 1,2,...,144 ==> lon = -180.0,-177.5,...,177.5
            j = 1,2,...,91  ==> lat = -90.0,-88.0,...,90.0

Data is available via anonymous FTP (binary mode) to podaac.jpl.nasa.gov
(137.78.32.15) or on tape in the Iris Data Format (IDF). IDF makes use of IEEE
2-byte integers and should be easily read on machines adhering to IEEE
standards. Documentation and software are available online. The data sets are
segmented by month. Level 3.0 data occupies approximately 6.3MB per month. Level
binned data is approximately 0.1MB in size for both 5 and 30 day files.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-08-15<br><pre>

The Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement (SAM) II experiment flew aboard
the Nimbus-7 spacecraft and provided vertical profiles of aerosol
extinction in both the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions.  The SAM II
data coverage began on October 29, 1978 and extended through December
18, 1993 until SAM II was no longer able to acquire the Sun.  The data
coverage for the Arctic region extends through January 7, 1991, and
contains data gaps beginning in 1988 that increase in size each year.
The data coverage for the Antarctic region is continuous through
December 18, 1993 except for a time period from mid-January 1993
through October 1993.  The data gaps for both the Arctic and Antarctic
regions are due to an orbit degradation associated with the Nimbus-7
spacecraft.

The SAM II CD-ROM contains over 14 years of polar Arctic and Antarctic
aerosol profiles obtained with the SAM II satellite experiment.  For
each measurement event, vertical profiles of extinction km-1,
extinction ratio, and National Meteorological Center (NMC)
temperatures and pressures are provided as a function of altitude.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-26<br><pre>

The Prabhakara SMMR Atmospheric Liquid Water files were generated by
Dr. Prabhakara Cuddapah at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)
using SMMR Antenna Temperatures.  A discussion of the SMMR Antenna
Temperatures is available from the Langley Distributed Active Archive
Center (DAAC).  Each ALW file contains one month of 3 degree by 5 degree
gridded mean liquid water.  Each element of data is in units of mg/cm2.
The data spans the period from February 1979 to May 1984.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-11-21<br><pre>
Data from the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), NOAA-9, and NOAA-10
Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) raw and processed  data (RAT and PAT)
are used to produce time-space averaged estimates  of longwave, shortwave, and
net radiant exitance at the top of the  atmosphere and albedo.

The regional, zonal, and global average product (S-4, S-4G) contains  averages
of radiant exitance and albedo for scanner and nonscanner data. It is available
as a combination of all operational spacecraft (ERBS,  NOAA-9, and NOAA-10) for
the scanner data and the wide field-of-view (WFOV)  data. It is available as a
combination of the ERBE and NOAA-9  spacecraft for the medium field-of-view
(MFOV) data. The S-4 data is a  multifile product which has seven files of
scanner data; scanner data  are of 2.5-degree resolution and each region is
nested to 5 and 10  degrees. The S-4 contains five files of MFOV numerical
filter and five  files of WFOV numerical filter data. Numerical filter data are
of 5-degree resolution and each region is nested to 10 degrees. Also on the S-4
are three files of MFOV shape factor and three files of WFOV  shape factor
data, which are of 10-degree resolution. Monthly (day), monthly (hour), daily,
and monthly hourly averages are determined for  each region.

The S-4G contains the same data as the S_4 product. The difference is  the
arrangement of the data; the S-4G is arranged by radiant exitance values while
the S-4 is arranged by region.

A separate scanner data set (S-9) contains inverted daily, monthly  hourly, and
monthly averages of longwave and shortwave radiant  exitance at the top of the
atmosphere and albedo.  The parameters  are spatially averaged  for 2.5-degree
regions.  Statistical information and scene information (i.e., cloud condition)
are included. Similar  parameters are determined for those scanner measurements
that were  identified as viewing clear sky areas.
A nonscanner data set (S-10) also contains inverted daily, monthly hourly, and
monthly averages of longwave and shortwave radiant exitance at the top of the
atmosphere and albedo.  The parameters are derived by the shape factor (SF)
technique and the numerical filter technique (NF).  The SF data are collected
into 10-degree regions and the NF data into 5-degree regions. Similar to the
scanner data sets, there are also statistical information and scene information
(i.e., cloud condition).  There are, however, no parameters calculated for
clear sky areas.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>
    The pressure, temperature and potential vorticity (PV) fields are used for
    European stratospheric ozone research projects, such as EASOE and SESAME
    as well as other EU funded projects.

    The PV, pressure and  temp. on the different isentropic levels are
    calculated from the ECMWF T213 initialized analysis extracted at a 1.125
    degree lat-lon grid.

    The trajectories are 10 day backward analyses ending at
    a large number of stations and grid points in Europe,
    Asia and the Arctic.  The trajectory data contain information
    on the geographical position, temperature and PV along
    the trajectory. The time step is 2 hours.

    For both the fields and trajectories there are data for
    12 UT every day from early November through April starting Nov. 1991.

    The PV and temperature on the different isentropic levels are calculated
    from the ECMWF T213 initialized analysis extracted as a 1.25 degree
    lat-lon grid.

    PV is calculated using a centered difference scheme except between the two
    upper levels (10 and 30hPa) of the ECMWF model. There are substantial
    errors on PV. This is primarily due to the coarse vertical interpolations
    and unreal small-scale structures in

    The only difference is that the trajectory calculation is done in a 1.5
    degree distance grid, so the difference between them is small.

    The data are, however, only available in a 2.5 degree distance grid at
    NILU, but PV is calculated for every station using the finer grid and are
    available in the directory:

    /nadir/data/ecmwf/pvatstat/YYYY/MM

    The isentropic data are organised into year(YYYY) and month(MM) in the
    subdirectories:

    /nadir/data/ecmwf/isentrop/YYYY/MM

    The data are stored in files with names:
    atYYMMDD.HHH

    where YYMMDD gives the date of the analyses and HHH is the forecast hour.

    HHH equals 000 for the 12 UT analysis. HHH equals 12, 36 and 60 hoursfor
    the forecast based on on the 0UT analyses, while HHH equals 24, 48, 72,
    96, 120 and 192 for the forecast based on the 12 UT analyses.

    Thus, at951128.012 is the 12 hour forecast from 0 UT analysis on November
    28, 1995, which is valid at 12 UT on November 28, 1995. The forecast in
    at951127.24 is also valid at this time, but since it is a longer forecast,
    it should not be used. However, the forecasts based on the 0 UT analyses,
    will arrive later at NILU (at about 6 UT).

    Note, that on the first day of a month you have to go to the directory of
    the previous month, to get the forecast based on the 12 UT analysis.

DATASET_COMMENTS:

The NASA Water Vapor Project data set (NVAP) is a total column
(integrated) water vapor data set comprised of a combination of
radiosonde observations, Television and Infrared Operational Satellite
(TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), and Special Sensor
Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data sets.  This is 5-year total and layered
(1988-1992) global water vapor data set.  The global layered water
vapor data set is created by slicing the total water vapor data set
using layered information that TOVS and radiosonde data provides.  As
a companion data set for analysis, STC-METSAT also prepared a global
(over oceans only), integrated cloud liquid water data set (since the
best global climate models now contain liquid water as an explicit
variable). STC-METSAT developed methods to process the data at a daily
time scale and 1o x 1o spatial resolution.  This work has become an
internationally accepted contribution to the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP).

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-02-08<br><pre>

This oceans data product consists of wind speeds calculated over water areas
(plus coastal, sea ice, and possible sea ice areas) using the algorithms
developed by F. Wentz (Remote Sensing Systems, 1989, 1992).  The data were
derived from the SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) instrument on the
DMSP F-8 (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) satellite and were
produced by the Marshall Space Flight Center.  The product consists of one
degree by one degree global gridded data and cover the time period 1 August
1987 to 31 December 1988.  Within this product data consists of 5-day
averages and monthly averaged data.  PODAAC Product 054 contains the same
data only in swath format.  Wentz cautions that wind speed values over fresh
water lakes are suspect as are values within 50-100 km of the coast; these
values have not been flagged.  Values over coastal, possible sea ice, and sea
ice areas are flagged because of the questionable validity of the algorithm
over these areas.  For locations or pixels where the algorithm did not
converge, ocean wind speed values are not calculated. Cloud/rain liquid water
values exceeding 18 mg/cm2 indicate the presence of rain; marine wind speeds
are flagged because the accuracy of the wind speed estimate quickly degrade
above this value and the algorithm developer recommends these wind speeds not
be used.  In Revision 1 of the geophysical tapes user's manual, Wentz
includes a correction for the cloud/rain liquid water; this correction has
been applied to the Pathfinder data.  The corrected value of 18 mg/cm2
corresponds to the value of 25 mg/cm2 shown in the 1989 version of the user
manual.  The data are in HDF.  Browse products are included and are
permanently staged on the FTP site (ftp podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub) in
subdirectory product057.

Data Set Vol:  30.7 MB
Smallest order:  Individual global image 0.2 KB.
Standard product: HDF data via FTP.
Formats:  HDF data via FTP from ftp podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub.
   HDF data in UNIX TAR on 8- (or 4-mm) tapes.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-15<br><pre>

DATASET_COMMENTS:

The NASA Water Vapor Project data set (NVAP) is a total column
(integrated) water vapor data set comprised of a combination of
radiosonde observations, Television and Infrared Operational Satellite
(TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), and Special Sensor
Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data sets.  This is 5-year total and layered
(1988-1992) global water vapor data set.  The global layered water
vapor data set is created by slicing the total water vapor data set
using layered information that TOVS and radiosonde data provides.  As
a companion data set for analysis, STC-METSAT also prepared a global
(over oceans only), integrated cloud liquid water data set (since the
best global climate models now contain liquid water as an explicit
variable). STC-METSAT developed methods to process the data at a daily
time scale and 1o x 1o spatial resolution.  This work has become an
internationally accepted contribution to the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP).

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The University of North Dakota owns and operates a Cessna Citation II
aircraft (N77ND) for the purpose of atmospheric research.  This
aircraft type has a number of design and performance characteristics
which make it an ideal platform for a wide range of atmospheric
studies.  A series of structural modifications have been made to the
basic airplane.  These include the following: pylons under the wing
tips for a variety of probes in the undisturbed air flow away from the
fuselage; a nose boom for wind measurement; a heated radome to prevent
ice accumulation on the nose area; special mounts for upward and
downward looking radiometers; side-facing camera mounts for time-lapse
cameras; optically-flat glass windows for photography; and an air
inlet port for air sampling inside the pressurized cabin.  The
research instrumentation available on the Citation for the second
Cirrus IFO is described below.

The basic instrumentation package measured temperature, dew point
temperature, pressure, wind and cloud microphysical characteristics
along with aircraft position, altitude and performance parameters. The
three-dimensional wind field is derived from measurements of
acceleration, pitch, roll and yaw combined with angles of attack and
sideslip and indicated airspeed. The aircraft parameters were supplied
by an LTN-76 inertial navigation system and a Global Positioning
System (GPS).  Turbulence intensity can be derived from differential
pressure transducers and INS accelerometer outputs.

Cloud microphysical measurements were made with an array of Particle
Measuring Systems probes (FSSP, 1D-C,2D-C,1D-P) mounted on the
wing-tip pylons. These probes measure concentrations and sizes of
particles from one micrometer to several millimeters in diameter.  In
addition there were probes to measure both liquid water content and
icing rate. Several gas and aerosol sampling instruments were
available.  These include fast response O3 and NO2 monitors, and a
condensation nuclei counter.

A forward or side-looking video camera was also used to provide a
visual record of flight conditions. The data were sampled at various
rate from 1 to 24 sec-1. The sampling is controlled by the on-board
computer system which also displayed the data in real time in graphic
and alphanumeric formats while recording them on magnetic tape.

Cirrus IFO-I was conducted from October 13 to November 2, 1986 in
central Wisconsin.  The NCAR Sabreliner aircraft measured radiation
and microphysical properties of the cloud layers, in addition to
temperature, moisture, and air motions.

improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

SOFIA (Surface of the Ocean, Fluxes and Interaction with the
Atmosphere) is a research program carried out by French groups from
the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement (CRPE),
Laboratoire l'Aerologie (LA)-Toulouse, Centre de Meteorologie Marine
(CMM)-Brest, Institut Francais de Rechercher sur la Mer
(IFREMER)-Brest, Service d'Aeronomie-Paris, and Laboratoire de
Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)-Palaiseau with cooperation from Centre
National de Recherche Meteorologique (CNRM)-Toulouse.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.

The parameters of this dataset were derived from spectral ambient
noise at 19 kHz.  Underwater sound was measured by a hydrophone
hanging to a small buoy, at a few kilometers from the ship Le Suroit
during June 1992.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The University of North Dakota owns and operates a Cessna Citation II
aircraft (N77ND) for the purpose of atmospheric research.  This
aircraft type has a number of design and performance characteristics
which make it an ideal platform for a wide range of atmospheric
studies.  A series of structural modifications have been made to the
basic airplane.  These include the following: pylons under the wing
tips for a variety of probes in the undisturbed air flow away from the
fuselage; a nose boom for wind measurement; a heated radome to prevent
ice accumulation on the nose area; special mounts for upward and
downward looking radiometers; side-facing camera mounts for time-lapse
cameras; optically-flat glass windows for photography; and an air
inlet port for air sampling inside the pressurized cabin.  The
research instrumentation available on the Citation for the second
Cirrus IFO is described below.

The basic instrumentation package measured temperature, dew point
temperature, pressure, wind and cloud microphysical characteristics
along with aircraft position, altitude and performance parameters. The
three-dimensional wind field is derived from measurements of
acceleration, pitch, roll and yaw combined with angles of attack and
sideslip and indicated airspeed. The aircraft parameters were supplied
by an LTN-76 inertial navigation system and a Global Positioning
System (GPS).  Turbulence intensity can be derived from differential
pressure transducers and INS accelerometer outputs.

Cloud microphysical measurements were made with an array of Particle
Measuring Systems probes (FSSP, 1D-C,2D-C,1D-P) mounted on the
wing-tip pylons. These probes measure concentrations and sizes of
particles from one micrometer to several millimeters in diameter.  In
addition there were probes to measure both liquid water content and
icing rate. Several gas and aerosol sampling instruments were
available.  These include fast response O3 and NO2 monitors, and a
condensation nuclei counter.

A forward or side-looking video camera was also used to provide a
visual record of flight conditions. The data were sampled at various
rate from 1 to 24 sec-1. The sampling is controlled by the on-board
computer system which also displayed the data in real time in graphic
and alphanumeric formats while recording them on magnetic tape.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

    The database is a computerised inventory of sites of international
importance for nature conservation in the European Union (EU) and Finland
(data for other countries are in preparation).

    It represents the most comprehensive European source of such information.
Records identify the location and extent of over 7000 sites, with descriptions
of important habitats, and bilogical species, rationale for notification and
protection status.

    The inventory forms a layer of the European Union CORINE (Co-ordinated
Environmental Information in the European Community) geographical information
system (GIS) on the state of the environment of the EU, co-ordinated by the
European Environment Agency.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-07-25<br><pre>

The AVHRR MCSST and CZCS phytoplankton pigment concentration data set
contains monthly averaged sea-surface temperatures (day and night)
derived from NOAA satellite AVHRR which are temporally and spatially
coregistered with phytoplankton pigment concentration data acquired
from the CZCS instrument on Nimbus-7. Since the CZCS sensed upwelling
radiance at visible frequencies only, only daytime phytoplankton
pigment data is available. The CZCS data cover 1978-1986 and AVHRR
data cover the period from 1981-1986, giving 5 years of coregistered
data.  The data has a resolution of approximately 18 km by 18 km at
the equator and is presented on an equal angle grid. DN values can be
used to derive the actual SST in degrees Celsius and the phytoplankton
content in milligrams per cubic meter. The MCSST SST data was derived
from the University of Miami weekly analysis and the CZCS data was
acquired from NASA Goddard.  For both the phytoplankton and SST, data
are presented as global and regional images.  Three sets of global and
regional data are provided: valid images where all data are measured
values, interpolated images where missing values are interpolated, and
flag images which provide metadata (land, ice or the number of values
used to compute the average value). Selected reduced resolution global
browse images have also been included.  The data is in HDF format and
comes with a copy of NCSA IMAGE S/W for display of the images.  The
data is provided as a set of 5 CD-ROMs together with a user manual. A
second set of CD-ROMs will be issued in mid 1994 that will contain
monthly MCSST data for 1987-1992.

The primary objective of the AVHRR instrument is to provide cloud top and sea
surface temperatures through passively measured visible, near infrared and
infrared spectral radiation bands.  Measurements made by the sensor have a 10
bit precision and the data itself is available as a Level 1b data product from
National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Services, Satellite and
Data Services Division (NESDIS/SDSD) in Suitland, Maryland.

The CZCS was a passive scanning radiometer that sensed visible emitted
upwelling radiance from the sea surface at 5 visible frequencies (433 nm, 520
nm, 550 nm, 670 nm and 750 nm) and one infrared frequency.  It was one of eight
instruments aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite (height: 950km, inclination: 99.3
degrees, CZCS scan: 40 degrees on each side of nadir). After critical
atmospheric corrections are applied, the radiances measure the concentration of
chlorophyll pigments in the surface waters, and by empirical correlation, one
can derive ocean productivity. CZCS products are available from NASA GSFC.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13
- December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The surface radiation and meteorological data collection employed data
loggers from Campbell Scientific Inc.  The Campbell Model 207 unit
measured temperature and relative humidity using two sensors combined
into one probe.  Wind speed and direction were monitored using a
propeller anemometer manufactured by R.M. Young.  Irradiance (solar
total and near infrared) were measured using an Eppley Pyranometer and
infrared irradiance and dome and sink temperatures were measured using
an Epply Pyrgeometer.

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

The development of parameterizations requires an understanding of the
processes that generate, maintain, and dissipate boundary layer
clouds. This development is currently impeded by lack of understanding
of the transition from stratocumulus clouds to trade cumulus clouds
and the factors that control cloud type and amount in the boundary
layer.  The Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition EXperiment (ASTEX) was
designed to address key issues related to stratocumulus to trade
cumulus transition and mode selection.  ASTEX involved intensive
measurements from several platforms operating from 1-28 June 1992 in
the area of the Azores and Madeira Islands.  The purpose was to study
how the transition and mode selection are effected by 1) cloud-top
entrainment instability, 2) diurnal decoupling and clearing due to
solar absorption, 3) patchy drizzle and a transition to horizontally
inhomogeneous clouds through decoupling, 4) mesoscale variability in
cloud thickness and associated mesoscale circulations, and 5) episodic
strong subsidence lowering the inversion below the LCL.  Detailed
descriptions of the scientific goals of ASTEX are in the FIRE Phase
II: Research plan (1989) and in the ASTEX Operations Plan (1992).

This ASCII formatted data set includes data collected aboard the
University of Washington's Corsair 131A airplane.  The cloud
microphysics probe (PVM-100A) was used to gather data on cloud liquid
water content, particle surface area, and effective droplet radius.
Please refer to the reference authored by H. Gerber to obtain
information on how the raw data were reduced to produce this data set.

Correlative assimilation data from the U.K. Meteorological Office
(UKMO) are included as supplementary data products to the UARS
Project.  The main use of the correlative assimilation data is to
provide an independent analysis for comparison with data from the UARS
instruments.  The analysed fields will be used as the basis for
diagnostic studies of the circulation of the middle atmosphere.

The numerical model used in the assimilation system is a global
primitive equation model, with a split-explicit time integration
scheme.  It incorporates a comprehensive range of physical
parameterization schemes.  It uses a hybrid vertical coordinate
system, with terrain-following model levels at low levels, gradually
changing to pressure levels in the stratosphere.  The input to the
assimilation system are from the World Weather Watch network of
surface and upper air observations and satellite data.

The UKMO correlative assimilation data products consists of one data
file per day containing the following parameters:

1) TEMP       atmospheric temperature, degrees K
2) HEIGHT     geopotential height, m
3) ZONWIN_P   westerly (zonal) wind component, m/s
4) MERWIN_P   southerly (meridional) wind component, m/s
5) OMEGA      vertical velocity, Pa/s

NOTE: Vertical velocity is available in files dated 26 August 1992
onwards.

Data coverage is global for the UKMO correlative assimilation data
products.  The horizontal resolution is 2.5 degrees latitude by 3.75
degrees longitude, using a staggered grid system.  For parameters
other than wind components, each horizontal field consists of 73 rows
of 96 points, starting at 90N, 0E.  The wind data are staggered by
half a grid, starting at 88.75N, 1.875E (with 72 rows).

The fields have been placed at the UARS standard pressure levels,
where the pressure levels are defined by P(i) = 1000*10**(-i/6),
i=0,1,2,...  , where i is the index into the data array.  Vertical
coverage for the UKMO correlative assimilation data is from 1000 mb to
0.316 mb.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-10-28<br><pre>

The NOAA/NASA Pathfinder Program SSM/I Level 3 EASE-Grid ocean products
are three data sets, marine wind speed, columnar water vapor, and cloud
liquid water, calculated using algorithms developed by Remote Sensing
Systems (Wentz, 1989).  These algorithms were modified by researchers at
the National Snow and Ice Data Center to operate with the NOAA/NASA
Pathfinder Program SSM/I Level 3 EASE-Grid Brightness Temperatures in the
equal-area, global projection.

There are three Ocean Product files per day in this data set. Coverage is
global and spans the Pathfinder SSM/I Benchmark period, from 1 August 1987
through 30 November 1988.  Resolution is 25 km for all channels.

The files are in HDF (Hierarchical Data Format), a self describing format.
For more information about HDF see <A HREF=http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu>http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu</A>.


They can be received through the JPL DAAC on tape or via anonymous ftp
from <A HREF=ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub>ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub</A>.  This data product is JPL product 078.

People interested in SSM/I data should also look at the other SSM/I data
available as there is coverage for longer time spans although not in the
EASE-Grid data format.  SSM/I data products are listed via
<A HREF=http://podaac-www.jpl.nasa.gov/SSMR_Products.shtml>http://podaac-www.jpl.nasa.gov/SSMR_Products.shtml</A>.

<A HREF=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/>http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/</A>.


The Pathfinder Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Land
(PAL) Level 3 CD-ROM contains 1986, subsetted, 8-km resolution, global
10-day composites, in the Interrupted Goode Homolosine
projection. Data include Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI), AVHRR Channel-1 and -2 reflectances, from which the NDVI was
derived, and Channel-4 and -5 brightness temperatures. These data were
produced using improved algorithms, for navigation and calibration,
applied to the NOAA-9 Global Area Coverage (GAC) data. The Channel-1
and -2 reflectances and the derived NDVI have been normalized for
solar zenith angle dependence and corrected with a revised Rayleigh
scattering and ozone absorption algorithm. The CD-ROM also includes
software for data decompression and interactive display and analysis
for PC, MAC, and UNIX computers; ancillary files for geolocation; and
detailed instructions and documentation.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

A special set of analysis products for the Atlantic Stratocumulus
Transition Experiment (ASTEX) region during June 1-28, 1992 was
prepared by Ernst Klinker and Tony Hollingsworth of the European
Centre for Medium-range Forecasting (ECMWF), and reformatted by Chris
Bretherton of Univ. of Washington.  These analyses, or more correctly
initializations and very short range forecasts using the ECMWF T213L30
operational model, incorporate routine observations from the global
network and special soundings from ASTEX that were sent to ECMWF
during ASTEX via the GTS telecommunication system.  About 650 special
soundings were incorporated, including nearly all soundings from Santa
Maria, Porto Santo, and the French ship Le Suroit, most of the
soundings taken on the Valdivia and Malcolm Baldridge, and almost none
of the soundings from the Oceanus.  Surface reports from the research
ships were also incorporated into the analyses after the first week of
the experiment.  Aircraft soundings were not included in the analyses.
ECMWF has requested that anyone making use of this data set
acknowledge them, and that those investigators publishing research
that makes more than casual use of this data set contact Ernst Klinker
or Tony Hollingsworth.

The data have been decoded by Chris Bretherton into ASCII files, one
for each horizontal field at a given level and base time.  All data
have the same horizontal resolution of 1.25 degrees in latitude and
longitude and correspond to base (initialization) times of 00, 06, 12,
or 18Z.  Different fields have different lat/lon ranges and sets of
available vertical levels, as tabulated below.  Also, some fields are
instantaneous (I) while others are accumulated (A) over the first 6
hours of a forecast initialized at the base time.  This is tabulated
in the 'time range' column below.  Instantaneous fields are best
compared with data at the base time, while accumulated fields are best
compared with data three hours after the base time.

The ECMWF field abbreviation, ID#, field description and units are
taken directly from ECMWF Code Table 2, in case you ever need to
consult with ECMWF about this data set.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-26<br><pre>

This data set includes geolocated, derived observations of: sea
surface temperature, rain rate, wind 'friction velocity', wind speed
(19.5 m above the sea surface), column-integrated water vapor and
atmospheric liquid water, all at or above the ocean surface only. The
wind variables have magnitude but not direction due to instrument
limitations. The dataset also contains the lower level calibrated
'antenna temperatures' at each SMMR frequency-polarization
combination, the derived 'brightness temperatures' with antenna
pattern correction, sun angle, calibration and performance
statistics. The SMMR is a passive microwave radiometer measuring dual
polarized (H and V) microwave radiation from the earth's surface and
atmosphere in 5 frequencies: 6.63, 10.69, 18.0, 21.0 and 37.0
GHz. SMMR swath width is 600 km. Global coverage was achieved within
the orbital extremes: +77/-72 deg. latitude from July 7 - August 17,
1978. From July 7 to August 26, 1978, the ground track was repeated
every 17 days. From August 27 to October 10, 1978, the ground track
repeated once every 3 days. The measurement temporal resolution is
10/second. This data set contains Level 2.0 geophysical parameters
corrected for environmental effects as well as lower level antenna and
brightness temperatures.The data set volume is approximately 2.9 GB.

SEASAT was launched on June 28, 1978, carrying a five  sensor payload,
and operated successfully until a power  failure brought transmission
to a stop on October 10, 1978.  Its height and inclination were 791 km
and 108.0 deg., respectively.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-12-30<br><pre>
The International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP)
Initiative I data sets should provide modelers with many of the fields
required to prescribe boundary conditions, and to initialize and force
a wide range of land-biosphere-atmosphere models.  All of the data
have been processed to the same spatial resolution (1 deg. x 1 deg.),
using the same land/sea mask and steps have been taken to ensure
spatial and temporal continuity of the data.  The data sets cover the
period 1987-1988 at 1-month time resolution for most of the
seasonally varying quantities and at 6-hourly resolution for the
near-surface meteorological and radiative forcings.

The data sets on this CD set are organized into the five groups listed below.
1. Vegetation
2. Hydrology and Soils
3. Snow, Ice, and Oceans
4. Radiation and Clouds
5. Near-Surface Meteorology

The data within each of these areas were acquired from a variety of
sources including model output, satellites, and ground
measurements. The individual data sets were provided in a variety of
forms. In some cases, this required the data publication team to
regrid and reformat data sets and in others to produce monthly
averages from finer resolution data. The specific handling for each
data set is detailed in the documentation. The regridded, reformatted,
integrated, and peer reviewed data sets are published on this
five-volume CD collection.

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-12-29<br><pre>

This data product contains Level 2.0 sigma-naught from the Seasat
scatterometer corrected for atmospheric and oceanic attenuation.  It also
contains windspeed and 4 possible directions ('ambiguities') derived from the
backscatter coefficient. For wind speed of 4-26 m/s,  the error was +/- 2 m/s
or 10%, whichever was greater.  For winds  above 20 m/s in non-heavy rain
areas, the mean error was  +/- 2.4 m/s.  The mean error for wind direction was
+/- 20 degrees. The product is the Geophysical Data Record (GDR).  The
measurement temporal resolution is 1.89 seconds.  The data set volume is
approximately 5.7 GB
k
SEASAT was launched on June 28, 1978, carrying a five sensor payload, and
operated successfully until a power failure brought transmission to a stop on
October 10, 1978.  Its height and inclination were 791 km and 108.0 deg.,
respectively.

The microwave scatterometer (SASS) on the SEASAT-A satellite had the goal of
determining the surface vector wind stress over the oceans and the neutral
stability wind vector at a 19.5 m reference height.  The physical basis for the
measurement technique is the Bragg scattering of microwaves from centimeter
length capillary ocean waves created by the surface wind.  The strength of the
radar backscatter is proportional to the capillary wave amplitude, which is in
equilibrium with the wind friction speed.  SASS cut two 500 km swaths 400 km
apart along the ground track on either side of nadir.  In addition, there was a
central swath 140km wide, centering on nadir.  SASS had a 50 km resolution cell
and 100 km spacing between cells.  The FOV was +/- 0.25 degrees 'cross cone'.
Pulse duration was 4.8 milliseconds, and the data stream was updated every
1.89 seconds.

Global coverage was achieved within the extremes +/-79 deg. latitude. From July
7 - August 17, 1978 the ground track equatorial spacing was 165 km. From August
18 - October 10, 1978 (the date that SEASAT terminally mal- functioned) the
ground track equatorial spacing was 900 km.  From July 7 to August 26, 1978,
the ground track was repeated every 17 days.  From August 27 to October 10,
1978, the ground track repeated once every 3 days.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-05<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The CSU sonde data were generated in support of the FIRE Phase II Cirrus
observation field experiment held in Coffeyville, Kansas during the period
from 13 Nov. to 06 Dec. 1991 at the Parsons KG&E Power Plant.  The data
were collected at 37 deg. 18 min. N and 95 deg. 07 min. W, with a vertical
resolution usually of roughly 5-10 m.  They were provided to allow a
calculation of an approximate location of the sonde.

The Colorado State University surface radiation data set was collected
from the radiometric ground station on San Nicolas Island, California.
These data were collected during the FIRE marine stratocumulus IFO.
The data consists of ten minute averages of wind speed, wind
direction, air temperature, relative humidity and shortwave (.3 - 2.8
microns), near IR (.7 - 2.8 microns), and longwave (4 - 50 microns)
radiation.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-04-20<br><pre>

Color-shaded and contoured images of global gridded instrumental data
have been produced as a computer-based atlas and is available via
INTERNET (FTP) and as a CD-ROM. The data consists of images depicting
anomaly maps of surface temperature, sea level pressure, 500-mb
geopotential heights, and percentages of reference period
precipitation. Monthly, seasonal, and annual composites are available,
in either cylindrical, equidistant, or northern and southern
hemisphere polar projections. Temperature maps are from 1854 to 1991,
precipitation maps from 1851 to 1989, sea level pressure maps from
1899 to 1991 and 500 mb height maps from 1946 to 1991. Documentation
is available as README files at the FTP site and on the CD-ROM
(Bradley, et al. 1994).

The data consists of the following:

Temperature Data
----------------
The temperature data are distributed on a 5 degree latitude by 5
degree longitude grid with 2592 (36 by 72) points in the grid. The
data are in the form of monthly, seasonal, and annual anomalies to
0.01 degrees C, expressed as departures from a 1950-1979 reference
period mean. The data are derived from the following:

1) land-based monthly station surface air temperatures from January 1854
through December 1991 (Jones, et al. 1991).

2) the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) gridded (2 lat by 2
long) monthly sea surface temperatures from January 1854 through December 1986
(Woddruff et al. 1987).

3) the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) gridded (1 lat by 1 long)
monthly sea surface temperature dataset with data from January 1987
through December 1991 (Bottomley et al. 1990).

Precipitation Data
------------------
The precipitation data are distributed on a 4 lat by 5 long grid. There are
2736 (38 by 72) points in the grid. The data are in the form of seasonal and
annual percentages of the reference period (1951-1970) mean precipitation
interpolated onto the grid. The orginal source is monthly station precipitation
records (1851-1989) from Eischeid et al. (1991).

Sea Level Pressure Data
-----------------------
The sea level pressure data are distributed on a 5 lat by 5 long grid. There
are 2520 (35 by 72) points in the grid. The data are in the form of monthly,
seasonal, and annual anomalies to 0.1 mb. The anomalies are calculated as
departures from a 1951-1980 reference period mean for the Northern Hemisphere
and a 1974-1989 reference period mean for the Southern Hemisphere. There is no
sea level pressure data between 15 North and 10 South. The original source is
from NCAR (Jenne 1975) for the periods 1899-1991 and 1973-1989.

500 mb Geopotential Height Data
-------------------------------
The 500-mb height data are distributed on a 5 lat by 5 long grid. There are
2520 (35 by 72) points in the grid. The data are in the form of monthly,
seasonal, and annual anomalies to 1 m. The anomalies are calculated as
departures from a 1951-1980 reference period mean for the Northern Hemisphere
and a 1974-1989 reference period mean for the Southern Hemisphere. There are no
height data between 15 North and 10 South. The original source of the data are
as follows:

1) National Meteorological Center (NMC) Northern Hemisphere octagonal grid data
(Jenne 1975) from a compact disc (CD-ROM) produced jointly by the University of
Washington and NCAR. The data is from January 1946 through June 1989.

2) files of Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere gridded 500-mb heights
(5 lat by 5 long) from NCAR. The files contain data from April 1973 through
December 1991.

All of the data described have been produced as Graphic Interchange
Format (GIF) image files (1024 x 822 pixels, 256 color). Shareware for
viewing the GIF images (PC, MAC or X-window workstations) are also available
at the FTP site. All of the maps were produced using NCAR Graphics Version 3.00.

ACCESS
------
The images are stored at CDIAC and are available via FTP over the
Internet from <A HREF=ftp://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov>ftp://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov</A> (or 128.219.24.36). The procedures

are as follows:

ftp <A HREF=ftp://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov>ftp://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov</A>

login: anonymous
password: <your email address>
cd pub/images

Subdirctories in pub/images are pub/images/ce for cylindrical
equidistant projections; pub/images/loci for data location maps; and
pub/images/polar for polar projections. Each subdirectory also has
/annual, /monthly, and /seasonal subdirectories. The GIF images are
named xxyyyy.gif where

xx is
     05 in the annual directory
     01-04 in the seasonal directory
     01-12 in the monthly directory

yyyy
     is 1851-1991

To retrieve an image, first type the FTP command 'binary' or 'image'
(depending upon your installation). Use the FTP command 'get' or
'mget' to retrieve the images. Type 'quit' to logout.

The Atlas is also available as a CD-ROM for $30.00. The CD-ROM
contains the image and documentation files and shareware for viewing
the GIF images. Software is for PC, MAC or X-Window workstations.
The CD-ROM is available from Frank Keimig, Department of Geology and
Geography, University of Massachussetts, Amherst, MA  01375 (email:

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-10-04<br><pre>

The data are accessible via telnet daac.gsfc.nasa.gov
(192.107.190.139), login:daacims, password:gsfcdaac

The High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) on NASA's Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite (UARS) measures winds and other parameters in the
mesosphere and lower thermosphere by primarily observing the Doppler
shift of emitted light, and in the stratosphere by observing the
Doppler shift of atmospheric absorption features.

The HRDI instrument views the atmosphere in two different directions,
and obtains the horizontal wind vector by combing information from the
observations.  Measurements are made with a triple-etalon,
high-precision Fabry-Perot interferometer, viewing the atmosphere
through a two-axis gimbaled telescope.

The HRDI Level 3A data products consist of profiles that have been
interpolated both vertically and horizontally from the original
profiles to standard surfaces and locations defined by the UARS
project for all limb-viewing instruments. The Level 3A format is
common to all UARS instruments to allow for intercomparison.

The HRDI Level 3A data products consist of two types: Level 3AT and
3AL, both at standard pressure and altitude surfaces.  Level 3AT files
are time-ordered profiles and spaced at intervals of 65.536 seconds,
or approximately 495 km along the tangent track.  Level 3AL files are
profiles at the intersection of the tangent track spaced at intervals
of 4 degrees latitude.

There are 4 subtypes or parameters for each Level 3AT and 3AL data
product, for a total of 8 products per day.  HRDI measurements are
made on altitude (A), and pressure (P) surfaces for each Level 3AT and
3AL type.  The following parameters are measured:

1. MERWIN_A - meridional winds (m/s) on altitude surfaces
2. MERWIN_P - meridional winds (m/s) on pressure surfaces
3. ZONWIN_A - zonal winds (m/s) on altitude surfaces
4. ZONWIN_P - zonal winds (m/s) on pressure surfaces

The horizontal resolution is 495 km along-track for the Level 3AT
files, and 4 degrees latitude for Level 3AL files. The vertical
resolution for the UARS profiles on UARS Pressure Surfaces is defined
as:

P(i) =  1000*10^(-i/6) millibars, for i = 0,1,2,...

which gives approximately 2.5 km increments between pressure
surfaces. Here "i" is the index of the data array.  The UARS altitude
surfaces are defined as:

z(i) = 5*i             km, for i<=12
z(i) = 60 + (i-12)*3   km, for 13 <= i <= 32
z(i) = 120 + (i-32)*5  km, for 33 <= i <= 88

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (July 1 - July 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

Cirrus IFO-II was conducted from November 9 to December 8, 1991 in
Coffeyville, Kansas.  The NCAR Sabreliner aircraft measured radiation
and microphysical properties of the cloud layers, in addition to
temperature, moisture, and air motions.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-26<br><pre>

The SMMR Prabhakara integrated atmospheric water vapor files were
generated by Dr. Prabhakara Cuddapah at the Goddard Space Flight
Center (GSFC) using SMMR Antenna Temperatures.  A discussion of the
SMMR Antenna Temperatures is available from the Langley Research
Center Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).  Each IWV file
contains one month of 3 degree by 5 degree gridded mean water vapor.
A scale factor of 0.1 must be applied to convert the data into units
of g/cm2. The data spans the period from October 1979 to September 1983.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

A special set of analysis products for the Atlantic Stratocumulus
Transition Experiment (ASTEX) region during June 1-28, 1992 was
prepared by Ernst Klinker and Tony Hollingsworth of the European
Centre for Medium-range Forecasting (ECMWF), and reformatted by Chris
Bretherton of Univ. of Washington.  These analyses, or more correctly
initializations and very short range forecasts using the ECMWF T213L30
operational model, incorporate routine observations from the global
network and special soundings from ASTEX that were sent to ECMWF
during ASTEX via the GTS telecommunication system.  About 650 special
soundings were incorporated, including nearly all soundings from Santa
Maria, Porto Santo, and the French ship Le Suroit, most of the
soundings taken on the Valdivia and Malcolm Baldridge, and almost none
of the soundings from the Oceanus.  Surface reports from the research
ships were also incorporated into the analyses after the first week of
the experiment.  Aircraft soundings were not included in the analyses.
ECMWF has requested that anyone making use of this data set
acknowledge them, and that those investigators publishing research
that makes more than casual use of this data set contact Ernst Klinker
or Tony Hollingsworth.

The data have been decoded by Chris Bretherton into ASCII files, one
for each horizontal field at a given level and base time.  All data
have the same horizontal resolution of 1.25 degrees in latitude and
longitude and correspond to base (initialization) times of 00, 06, 12,
or 18Z.  Different fields have different lat/lon ranges and sets of
available vertical levels, as tabulated below.  Also, some fields are
instantaneous (I) while others are accumulated (A) over the first 6
hours of a forecast initialized at the base time.  This is tabulated
in the 'time range' column below.  Instantaneous fields are best
compared with data at the base time, while accumulated fields are best
compared with data three hours after the base time.

Data Set Name ECMWF ECMWF Time Field      Units
  field  ID# range
  abbrev.
----------- ------ ----- ----- -----                      -----

SURFACE  SP 134     I       Surface pressure           Pa
  ST 139     I       [Sea] surface temperature  K

(lat/lon range: 85W to 15E, 70N to 10N; at surface pressure)

The ECMWF field abbreviation, ID#, field description and units are
taken directly from ECMWF Code Table 2, in case you ever need to
consult with ECMWF about this data set.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>

The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget(Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly on a mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10).
Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument
package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.

The WFOV (wide-field-of-view) NF (numerical filter) S-10 contains
inverted daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and
longwave radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month.
This data set is produced for each of the satellites (ERBS, NOAA-9,
and NOAA-10) and the combination of satellites.

 The values for this data set are derived using the numerical filter
technique (Smith et al. 1986). As described in the Earth Radiant
Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Nonscanner S-10/S-10N User's Guide,
the data set contains a 30 byte header record, 67 scale factors which
are used to scale the data in the first record, and 26 scale factors
which are used to scale the data in the second record. The data set
also contains two records for each processed region.  The first record
is of fixed length (990 words) containing averaged data and the second
record is of variable length containing individual hour box estimates.
The length of the second record, in words, is calculated by
multiplying the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by the
number of values stored for each hour box (38 for the nonscanner).

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-01<br><pre>

The GSFC Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) has available four
CD-ROM sets containing Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data
from the Nimbus-7 and Meteor-3 missions. All of the CD-ROMs were
produced by the Ozone Processing Team (OPT) at NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center, Code 916.

1) Nimbus-7 TOMS Ozone CD-ROM set:
This is a 2 disk set containing the Nimbus-7 TOMS Ozone data from
November 1978 to May 1993. The data are globally averaged into grid cells
1 degre in latitude by 1.25 degrees in longitude. The first disk contains
daily and monthly gridded data for the period November 1978 through 1987.
Data files are in ASCII format. A document subdirectory contains the
Nimbus-7 TOMS User's guide in Adobe Acrobat format. A software directory
contains C, Fortran, and IDL programs to read the ozone data files, and
freeware packages to view the GIF and Adobe files for both PC and Macintosh
machines.  The second disk contains similar data for 1988 through May 1993,
as well as daily and monthly zonal means, TOMS "overpass" data for 371
individual ground locations, and daily GIF images.

2) Nimbus-7 TOMS Reflectivity CD-ROM set:
This is a 2 disk set containing the Nimbus-7 TOMS Reflectivity data from
November 1978 to May 1993. The data are globally averaged into grid cells
1 degre in latitude by 1.25 degrees in longitude. The first disk contains
daily and monthly gridded data for the period November 1978 through 1987.
Data files are in ASCII format. A document subdirectory contains the
Nimbus-7 TOMS User's guide in Adobe Acrobat format. The second CD-ROM
contains similar data for 1988 through May 1993, as well as daily and monthly
zonal means, TOMS "overpass" data for 371 individual ground locations, and
daily GIF images.

3) The Nimbus-7 TOMS UV-Erythemal Exposure CD-ROM
This CD-ROM contains data representing the relative daily areal exposures
of ultraviolet (UV) radiation effective in causing skin irritation. The data
are derived from the version 7 Nimbus-7 TOMS data for the period from
November 1978 to March 1993. The data are averaged into grid cells 1 degree
in latitude by 1.25 degrees in longitude, and between 65 north and 65 south
latitude. The CD-ROM contains erythemally weighted daily UV exposures at
the Earth's surface and a readme file. Data files are in ASCII format.

4) The Meteor-3 TOMS Ozone and Reflectivity CD-ROM
This CD-ROM contains the version 7 TOMS total ozone and reflectivity data
from from August 1991 to November 1994. The measurements have been averaged
into daily grid cells 1 degree in latitude by 1.25 degrees in longitude.
The CD-ROM contains daily gridded ozone and reflectivity data, zonal means,
"overpass" data for 371 individual ground locations, and ozone GIF images.
The data files are in ASCII format. A document subdirectory contains the
Meteor-3 TOMS User's guide in Adobe Acrobat format. A software directory
contains C, Fortran, and IDL programs to read the ozone data files, and
freeware packages to view the GIF and Adobe files on a PC or Macintosh.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-05<br><pre>

This product is one of several products containing SSM/I derived winds
over the oceans produced by Robert Atlas and Joseph Ardizzone (NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center) in collaboration with Ross N. Hoffman
(Atmospheric and Environmental Research - AER). A 2D variational
analysis method (VAM) was used to combine information from ECMWF 10m
surface wind analyses, SSM/I wind speeds (from Frank Wentz, Remote
Sensing Systems), and ship and buoy winds to produce new surface wind
analyses between -78 and 78 degrees latitude. Data sets designated as
level 3.0 contain gridded surface winds produced by the VAM.  Level
2.5 data sets contain SSM/I wind speeds with wind directions assigned
from the VAM analysis. Finally, the level 2.5 data is binned to grid
points over 5 and 30 day periods. This is designated as the level 3.5
product.

SSM/I wind speeds have been assimilated every 6 hours for the period
July 1987 to December 1994. Please note that all products were arrived
at using Wentz version-2 SSM/I. Extensions will be made as SSM/I data
becomes available. All data sets contain U and V components of the
wind in m/s. Gridded data (level 3.0 and 3.5) is represented on a 2
degree latitude by 2.5 degree longitude grid and is configured as
follows:

           rdata(i,j)

            i = 1,2,...,144 ==> lon = -180.0,-177.5,...,177.5
            j = 1,2,...,91  ==> lat = -90.0,-88.0,...,90.0

Data is available via anonymous FTP to <A HREF=ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov>ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov</A>

(137.78.96.30) or on tape in IDF (Iris Data Format) or HDF
(Hierarchical Data Format).  IDF makes use of IEEE 2-byte integers and
should be easily read on machines adhering to IEEE standards. HDF is
portable across all platforms and is rapidly becoming an industry
standard. Documentation and software are available on line. The data
sets are segmented by month. Level 3.0 data occupies ~6.3MB per
month. Level 2.5 constitutes the largest volume at ~25MB per month.
Level 3.5 binned data is ~.1MB in size.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-09-14<br><pre>

DATA ACCESS

The TOGA COARE International Project Office is in charge of
distributing all information related to TOGA COARE.  The FTP address
for the TCIPO is <A HREF=ftp://tcdm.coare.ucar.edu/>ftp://tcdm.coare.ucar.edu/</A>; the URL for the TCIPO

is <A HREF=http://www.coare.ucar.edu/>http://www.coare.ucar.edu/</A>.  Essential TOGA COARE information can

also be obtained from the University of Delaware's CDIU at
<A HREF=http://diu.cms.udel.edu/coare/>http://diu.cms.udel.edu/coare/</A>.


The RAMS data are not yet available from the NASA GSFC/DAAC.  To
obtain the data, contact Dr. Francisco Valero at SCRIPPS.

BACKGROUND

TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that
investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction
between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the
western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place
from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the
deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land
based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped
with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of
surface based instruments for in situ observations.

The NASA component of TOGA COARE, while contributing directly to
overall COARE objectives, emphasized scientific objectives associated
with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NASA's cloud
and radiation program.

INSTRUMENTATION

The Radiation Measurement System (RAMS) consists of multiple sensors:

1. Broad spectral bandpass hemispherical field of view solar
radiometers (BBHSR) consisting of electrically calibrated pyroelectric
detectors with optical chopping and null-balanced operation.

2. Narrow spectral bandpass, narrow field of view multiple spectral
channels infrared radiance radiometers (NFOVR), consisting of a liquid
nitrogen cooled reference black body and electrically calibrated
pyroelectric direction system.

3. Broadband hemispherical field-of-view multiple spectral channels
infrared flux radiometer (HFOVR), which is similar to the BBHSR with
the exception of a long pass interference filter using the field of
view inversion method.

4. Total direct diffuse multiple spectral channels radiometer (TDDR)

DATASET_COMMENTS:

The NASA Water Vapor Project data set (NVAP) is a total column
(integrated) water vapor data set comprised of a combination of
radiosonde observations, Television and Infrared Operational Satellite
(TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), and Special Sensor
Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data sets.  This is 5-year total and layered
(1988-1992) global water vapor data set.  The global layered water
vapor data set is created by slicing the total water vapor data set
using layered information that TOVS and radiosonde data provides.  As
a companion data set for analysis, STC-METSAT also prepared a global
(over oceans only), integrated cloud liquid water data set (since the
best global climate models now contain liquid water as an explicit
variable). STC-METSAT developed methods to process the data at a daily
time scale and 1o x 1o spatial resolution.  This work has become an
internationally accepted contribution to the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP).

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

SOFIA (Surface of the Ocean, Fluxes and Interaction with the
Atmosphere) is a research program carried out by French groups from
the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement (CRPE),
Laboratoire l'Aerologie (LA)-Toulouse, Centre de Meteorologie Marine
(CMM)-Brest, Institut Francais de Rechercher sur la Mer
(IFREMER)-Brest, Service d'Aeronomie-Paris, and Laboratoire de
Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)-Palaiseau with cooperation from Centre
National de Recherche Meteorologique (CNRM)-Toulouse.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.

Five drifting buoys (CMM) with bathymetric chains (100 m) provided
surface measurements of sea surface temperature, pressure and wind.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>
The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget (Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly on a mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite, (Earth
Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and
NOAA-10).  Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner
instrument package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.

The MFOV (medium-field-of-view) NF (numerical filter) S-10 contains
inverted daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and
longwave radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month.
This data set is produced for each of the satellites (ERBS and NOAA-9)
and the combination of satellites.  The values for this data set are
derived using the numerical filter technique (Smith et al. 1986).  As
described in the Earth Radiant Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9,
Nonscanner S-10/S-10N User's Guide, the data contains a 30 byte header
record, 67 scale factors which are used to scale the data in record
one, and 26 scale factors which are used to scale the data in record
two.  The data set also contains two records for each processed
region.  The first record is of fixed length (990 words) and contains
averaged data.  The second record is of variable length and contains
individual hour box estimates.  The length of the second record, in
words, is calculated by multiplying the number of boxes (978th word of
record one) by the number of values stored for each hour box (38 for
the nonscanner).

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The GSFC Raman Lidar water vapor mixing ratio (wvmr) data with
altitudes and times were collected for the period from 13 Nov 1991 to
07 Dec 1991.  Data were collected at night and consists of a series of
one minute profiles.  Data are summed for one minute in the detectors
and saved to a file.  For the 10 minute averaged data, the data are
summed for 10 minutes before the calculations are performed.  Each
profile has a 75 meter resolution from 0.4135 to 10.299 kilometers.
Zero (0) km means sea level.  The site altitude is 0.229 km and the
first data point is at 0.1845 km above ground level.

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-06-15<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

This data set was collected from the Colorado State University
tethered platform.  The balloon was flown during the FIRE Marine
Stratocumulus IFO on San Nicolas Island.  The data set has been
interpolated to the times of the cloud microphysics data, which has a
five second interval between points.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

SOFIA (Surface of the Ocean, Fluxes and Interaction with the
Atmosphere) is a research program carried out by French groups from
the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement (CRPE),
Laboratoire l'Aerologie (LA)-Toulouse, Centre de Meteorologie Marine
(CMM)-Brest, Institut Francais de Rechercher sur la Mer
(IFREMER)-Brest, Service d'Aeronomie-Paris, and Laboratoire de
Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)-Palaiseau with cooperation from Centre
National de Recherche Meteorologique (CNRM)-Toulouse.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.

Data were collected using a DRAKKAR, an upward pointing, two channel
microwave radiometer.  Its channels are 23.8 and 36.5 GHz, and the
antenna aperture is about 15 degrees.  It was developed at CRPE based
upon the the ATSR/M (ERS-1/MWR) design.  Its basic sampling was 0.5
seconds during ASTEX.  Calibration was performed prior to the campaign
and verified using a cold load on June 12, 1995, and verified again
after return to France.

eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The Doppler lidar data set includes wind profiles derived by the VAD
method for the FIRE-II top 5 priority days (21,25,28,30 of Nov. 1991,
and Dec. 5, 1991).  Vertical profiles of the horizontal wind speed and
direction were acquired by the lidar using a classical method commonly
referred to as the VAD technique, where VAD stands for Velocity
Azimuth Display.

The Doppler lidar experiment objective was to obtain lidar
measurements of relative backscatter signal intensity and radial
velocity from cirrus clouds to study their microphysical and radiative
properties.  This data set provides vertical profiles (approx. 1.5 -
20.0 km agl).

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-03-13<br><pre>

The data product consists of global sea surface temperature (SST) from
January 1987 to December 1993.  The product, derived from the five-channel
AVHRR instruments onboard the NOAA 7/9/11 polar orbiting satellites, form
a high-quality data set suitable for global studies.  The product is
improved over previously available satellite derived SST data (JPL PO.DAAC
Product 016) in that the data have been produced using improved
data-processing including incorporation of new cloud-detection algorithms
developed by the University of Miami, inter-calibration among the
satellites, and quality analysis procedures implemented through the AVHRR
Pathfinder Ocean group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  In addition the
data are more complete because they are derived from the original AVHRR
data rather than from a subset as provided by NOAA for operational
purposes.

Oceans Pathfinder data sets are available within the following six
broad categories of products:
050 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder global equal-angle all SST v1 (NOAA, NASA)
051 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder global equal-angle best SST v1 (NOAA, NASA)
053 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder 0.5 deg spatial resolution global SST v1
(NOAA, NASA)
070 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder global equal-angle all SST v3 (NOAA, NASA)
071 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder global equal-angle best SST v3 (NOAA, NASA)
073 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder global 0.5-deg.resolution SST v3 (NOAA, NASA)

The data from which the products have been made consists of a set of
daily global images where the image size is 4096 x 2048 pixels with a
spatial resolution of aproximately 9 km at the equator.  The
equal-angle grid has the same number of SST values in both latitude
and longitude for the entire globe.  The 'all SST' product contains
all available values and the associated statistics whereas the 'best
SST' product is where the value per pixel is not averaged but is
selected as being the best based on algorithm analysis of surrounding
values.  Options within products include daily averaged and monthly
averaged day and night data. Data are also available with a nominal 9
km, 18 km and 54 km resolution.  The primary data format is HDF
although some data is available in raw binary.  The best SST product
is available via ftp from <A HREF=ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub>ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub</A>. The data

can also be provided on tape. Version 1 products without a version
number have been processed with yearly coefficients and cover the
period 1987 to mid 1991.  Version 3 of this product involves
reprocessing with monthly rather than yearly coefficients and covers
the period 1990 - 1993.

Researchers can also easily extract regional subsets from the
global best SST files via the WWW (<A HREF=http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/sst>http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/sst</A>)

using an on-line subsetting routine.

For most purposes, the best SST product is probably the
most useful Pathfinder SST product.  An equal-area product is
also available by special request because file sizes are very large
(100 MB/ascending global image).  Please contact the JPL DAAC for
information on this product.  For a longer SST time series, please see
Product 016.

The AVHRR Pathfinder Oceans Matchup Database is a unique "by-product"
of the Pathfinder SST data set development.  The matchup database is a
multi-year, multi-satellite database of approximately co-temporal,
co-located in-situ SST (moored and drifting buoys are included) and
AVHRR GAC measurements.  These records, called "matchups", can be used
to develop and test algorithms for the estimation of sea surface
temperature using AVHRR data and for validation exercises.  A complete
description of the AVHRR Pathfinder Oceans Matchup Database can be
found on the WWW (<A HREF=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/~gui/matchups.html>http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/~gui/matchups.html</A>).


The Matchup files themselves are also available from PO.DAAC as the
following product: 069 AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder SST and buoy match-up
data (Podesta et al.). Data validation information is available from
<A HREF=http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/~lizsmith>http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/~lizsmith</A>.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-08-03<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

Radiosonde data were collected during the FIRE ASTEX for time period
June 1, 1992 through June 29, 1992 from Porto Santo.  There are 3 sets
of interpolated sounding data.  They are 5-second, 20-meter, and
2-millibar.

Each file contains a 5-line header. The first line is the site name
(up to 16 characters), the next line is the latitude and longitude at
the time of launch, the third contains the date-time group at launch
in YYMMDDHHMM format.  Lines 4 and 5 describe the data to follow,
which comprise no more that 1500 additional lines.  The data are:
minutes, seconds past launch, ascent rate, height, pressure,
temperature, relative humidity, dew point, mixing ratio and wind speed
and direction.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>
The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget(Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly ona mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10).
Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument
package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.  MFOV (medium-field-of-view) data from the satellites are
not processed and therefore not archived.

The WFOV (wide-field-of-view) SF (shape factor) S-10N contains inverted
daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and longwave
radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month. This data
set consists of nonscanner data processed without scene identification
information from the scanner and therefore used the "Time/Space
Averaging Deadscanner Option" algorithm as described in the Earth
Radiant Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Nonscanner S-10/S-10N User's
Guide. This data set is produced for each of the satellites (ERBS,
NOAA-9, and NOAA-10) and the combination of satellites that are
operational during the month.  The values for this data set are
derived using the shape factor technique (Smith et al. 1986).  The data
contains two records for each region.  The first record is of fixed
length (990 words) and contains averaged data.  The second record is
of variable length and contains individual hour box estimates.  The
length of the second record, in words, is calculated by multiplying
the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by the number of
values stored for each hour box (38 for the nonscanner).

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

SOFIA (Surface of the Ocean, Fluxes and Interaction with the
Atmosphere) is a research program carried out by French groups from
the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement (CRPE),
Laboratoire l'Aerologie (LA)-Toulouse, Centre de Meteorologie Marine
(CMM)-Brest, Institut Francais de Rechercher sur la Mer
(IFREMER)-Brest, Service d'Aeronomie-Paris, and Laboratoire de
Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)-Palaiseau with cooperation from Centre
National de Recherche Meteorologique (CNRM)-Toulouse.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.

The FOKKER F27 aircraft with flux measurement package and the airborne
Lidar Leandre was used during ASTEX.  The FOKKER 27 ARAT capabilities
were as follows:

* Turbulence measurements of wind, temperature and moisture.  Fast
response sensors located on a nose boom 5m long, which measured

    - attack and sideslip angles by mobile vanes and by a five hole probe
      (Rosemound 858).
    - true airspeed by a Pitot probe
    - temperature by a fast response "INSU" probe
    - humidity by a Lyman-alpha humidity meter

* Mean state sensors

    - Rosemount temperature probe
    - Reverse-flow temperature probe
    - General Eastern dew point sensor

* Aerosols and cloud microphysics

    - 1-D drop size measurements from 0-6000 microns by four
Knollenberg sensors
    - 2-D sensor OAP 2DC for drop sizes between 25 and 800 microns

* Liquid water content

    - Johnson-Williams sensors

* Radiative measurements, up- and downward

    - Longwave (14-40 microns) Eppley radiometers
    - Shortwave (0.2-2.8 microns) Eppley radiometers
    - Radiances (7.8-14 microns) Barnes PRT5 radiometers

* Chemical measurements(isokinetic veins)

* Pointint backscatter lidar (Leandre)

* Directional reflectances meausrements (POLDER- Polarized Direct
Reflectance)

DATASET_COMMENTS:

The NASA Water Vapor Project data set (NVAP) is a total column
(integrated) water vapor data set comprised of a combination of
radiosonde observations, Television and Infrared Operational Satellite
(TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), and Special Sensor
Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data sets.  This is 5-year total and layered
(1988-1992) global water vapor data set.  The global layered water
vapor data set is created by slicing the total water vapor data set
using layered information that TOVS and radiosonde data provides.  As
a companion data set for analysis, STC-METSAT also prepared a global
(over oceans only), integrated cloud liquid water data set (since the
best global climate models now contain liquid water as an explicit
variable). STC-METSAT developed methods to process the data at a daily
time scale and 1o x 1o spatial resolution.  This work has become an
internationally accepted contribution to the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP).

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-05<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The Colorado State University (CSU) wind profiler data set was
produced by the Department of Atmospheric Sciences of CSU as part of
the FIRE Phase II Cirrus Intensive Field Observations (IFO) conducted
in Coffeyville, Kansas.  The CSU wind profiler data were collected
during the period from Nov. 12, 1991 to Dec. 7, 1991 at the Parsons
KG&E Power Plant, Parsons, Kansas (37 deg. 18 min. N and 95 deg. 07
min. W).

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-21<br><pre>

The Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS) on NASA's
Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) measured the global
temperature and composition profiles in the stratosphere and
mesosphere.  The main objectives are to obtain atmospheric temperature
measurements as a function of pressure, to study water vapor
variability in the middle atmosphere, and to measure the distribution
of oxides of nitrogen in order to study their origins and how they
affect ozone concentrations in the stratosphere.

The ISAMS instrument is an infrared radiometer that observes thermal
emission from the Earth's limb.  Measurements are in the 4 to 17
micron range using gas correlation spectroscopy and solid-state
detectors cooled to 80 degrees Kelvin by closed cycle refrigerators.
Observations are made on either side of the spacecraft (although on
the -Y side only when the satellite is shielded from the sun by the
earth), approximately normal to the direction of flight.  ISAMS has a
total of 32 detector elements.  The detectors are grouped into
4-element arrays at the end of one of 8 optical paths.  Each path
passes through a different pressure modulator cell: CO2 (two), CO,
CH4, NO, N2O, NO2, and H2O.  The two CO2 cells each contain filter
wheels with 4 selections, allowing for a total of 14 spectral
channels.  These are multiplied by the two signal channels (wide-band,
and pressure-modulated) for a total of 28 radiance channels, of which
16 may be sampled in any measurement period.

Each detector element is rectangular with a nominal width:height ratio
of 7:1, giving a field of view (FOV) of angular dimensions 0.35 deg x
0.05 deg, corresponding to approximately 16.6 km x 2.36 km at the
tangent point.  The eight 4-element arrays are arranged so that ISAMS
can view +35 to -35 degrees relative to the boresight, which
corresponds to a vertical range of about 35 km between the outermost
detectors.  To increase vertical coverage, the ISAMS mirror can be
scanned in elevation.

The ISAMS Level 3A data products consist of profiles that have been
inter- polated both vertically and horizontally from the original
profiles to standard surfaces and locations defined by the UARS
project for all limb-viewing instruments.  The Level 3A format is
common to all UARS instruments to allow for intercomparison.  The
ISAMS Level 3A data products consist of two product types: 1)
ISAMS_L3AT_DAILY = time-ordered daily data, and 2) ISAMS_L3AL_DAILY =
latitude-ordered daily data.  Associated with each Level 3A product is
a parameter file (3TP with 3AT files and 3LP with 3AL files),
containing information on ISAMS viewing side and other relevant
details.

Level 3AT/3TP data products consist of time-ordered profiles and are
spaced at intervals of 1 UARS minute, or approximately 495 km along
the tangent track.  Level 3AL/3LP data products consist of profiles at
the intersection of the tangent track spaced at intervals of 4 degrees
latitude.

The ISAMS Level 3AT and 3AL data products consist of 10 data files per
day, and 12 corresponding parameter files (one parameter file for each
data file).  The following species are measured: 1) AERO12P1 - aerosol
at 12.1 microns, 2) AERO6P23 - aerosol at 6.23 microns, 3) CH4 -
methane, 4) CO - carbon monoxide, 5) H2O - water vapor, 6) N2O -
nitrous oxide, 7) N2O5 - nitrogen pentoxide, 8) NO2 - nitrogen
dioxide, 9) O3 - ozone, and 10) TEMP - atmospheric temperature.
Measurement units are in parts per million by volume (ppmv) for
chemical species, and degrees Kelvin for atmospheric temperature.

The horizontal resolution is 495 km along track for the Level 3AT/TP
files, and 4 degrees latitude for level 3AL/LP files.  The UARS
standard data array is the common data structure used for all Level 3
data subtypes.  For ISAMS the index into the data array corresponds to
standard pressure levels given in millibars, with each level at
approximately 2.5 km increments.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-16<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improved the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The Langley Research Center (LARC) Cloud Lidar is a dual-channel
polarization sensitive lidar using a frequency doubled Nd: YAG laser
as a linearly polarized transmitter and an eight inch Cassegrainian
telescope as a receiver.  Backscattered laser light collected by the
receiver is collimated, directed through a half wave plate, and then
passed through polarizing optics which decompose the signal into two
components, one parallel and the other perpendicular to the
polarization plane of the transmitted beam.  Separate amplification
and digitization paths are employed for each component, resulting in
two arrays of back scatter data for each measured laser pulse. The
LARC Cloud Lidar is designed for optimum cloud monitoring operations
at altitudes between 3 km and 18 km.  To prevent saturation of the
detectors at lower altitudes, a gating circuit is used to delay the
activation of the first dynode in the Photomultiplier (PMT).  The PMT
is brought to full sensitivity only after this delay time has elapsed.

Radiosonde data were collected during the FIRE ASTEX for time period
June 3, 1992 through June 23, 1992 from the Oceanus (ship).  There are
3 sets of interpolated sounding data.  They are 5-second, 20-meter,
and 2-millibar.

Each file contains a 5-line header. The first line is the site name
(up to 16 characters), the next line is the latitude and longitude at
the time of launch, the third contains the date-time group at launch
in YYMMDDHHMM format.  Lines 4 and 5 describe the data to follow,
which comprise no more that 1500 additional lines.  The data are:
minutes, seconds past launch, ascent rate, height, pressure,
temperature, relative humidity, dewpoint, mixing ratio and wind speed
and direction.

The Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES) on NASA's Upper
Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) measured the chemical composition
of the stratosphere and mesosphere, and also investigated the
depletion of stratospheric ozone and ozone chemistry.

The CLAES instrument measured the thermal emission spectra from the
Earth's limb perpendicular to the spacecraft velocity vector.  The
characteristic vibration-rotation line spectra of atmospheric chemical
species was measured simultaneously at 20 different limb altitudes in
the 10 to 60 km range, with 2.5 km vertical resolution.  An iterative
relaxation algorithm inverted the measured radiance to yield profiles
of temperature and concentrations of O3, H2O, CH4, N2O, NO, NO2, N2O5,
HNO3, ClONO2, HCl, CF2Cl2 (CFC-12), CFCl3 (CFC-11), and aerosol
absorbtion coefficients.  The CLAES instrument consisted of a
solid-etalon Fabry-Perot spectrometer cooled to 18K by a neon and
carbon dioxide cryostat designed for an 18-month lifetime (the
cryostat lasted 20 months before being exhausted).  The etalon
detectors had central wavelengths of 2843, 1897, 1605, 1257, 925, 879,
840, 792, and 780 cm^-1 (3.5 to 12.7 micron coverage)

The CLAES level 3A data products consist of profiles that have been
interpolated both vertically and horizontally from the original
profiles to standard surfaces and locations defined by the UARS
project for all limb-viewing instruments.  The level 3A format is
common to all UARS instruments to allow for intercomparison.  The
CLAES level 3A data products consist of two product classes; 3AT
time-ordered level 3A data, and 3AL latitude-ordered level 3A data.

The level 3AT data products consist of time-ordered profiles, and are
spaced at intervals of 1 UARS minute (65.536 seconds), or about
495 km along the tangent track.  Level 3AL data products consist of
profiles at the intersection of the tangent track spaced at intervals
of 4 degrees latitude (e.g. 80, 76, 72, ..., -72, -76, -80).

The CLAES level 3AT and 3AL data consist of 17 granules per day each.
A data granule is one CLAES species or subtype per day.  The following
subtypes are available: 1) AERO780 - aerosol extinction at 780 cm-1,
2) AERO790 - aerosol extinction at 790 cm-1, 3) AERO880 - aerosol
extinction at 880 cm-1, 4) AERO925 aerosol extinction at 925 cm-1, 5)
AERO1257 - aerosol extinction at 1257 cm-1, 6) AERO1605 - aerosol
extinction at 1605 cm-1, 7) AERO1897 - aerosol extinction at 1897
cm-1, 8) CH4 - methane, 9) CF2CL2 - CFC 12, 10) CLONO2 - chlorine
nitrate, 11) H2O - water vapor, 12) HNO3 - nitric acid, 13) NO2 -
nitrogen dioxide, 14) NO - nitric oxide, 15) NO2 - nitrous oxide, 16)
O3B9 - ozone at 780 cm-1 (filter 9), 17) TEMP - atmospheric
temperature.  Aerosol extinction coefficients are measured in units of
1/km, chemical species are given in parts per million by volume
(ppmv), and temperature is in units of degrees Kelvin.  The quality of
CFCL3 (CFC 11), HCL, N2O5 and O3 (filter 8) data were too low to be
included as part of the current version of the CLAES level 3A data
set.

The horizontal resolution is 495-km along-track for the level 3AT
files, and 4 degrees latitude for the level 3AL files.  The vertical
resolution for the CLAES profiles is defined by the UARS pressure
levels (in mbars) given by:

   P(i) =  1000 * 10**(-i/6) for i = 0, 1, 2, ...

which gives approximately 2.5 km increments between pressure surfaces.

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

SOFIA (Surface of the Ocean, Fluxes and Interaction with the
Atmosphere) is a research program carried out by French groups from
the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement (CRPE),
Laboratoire l'Aerologie (LA)-Toulouse, Centre de Meteorologie Marine
(CMM)-Brest, Institut Francais de Rechercher sur la Mer
(IFREMER)-Brest, Service d'Aeronomie-Paris, and Laboratoire de
Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)-Palaiseau with cooperation from Centre
National de Recherche Meteorologique (CNRM)-Toulouse.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.


The FOKKER F27 aircraft with flux measurement package and the airborne
Lidar Leandre was used during ASTEX.  The FOKKER 27 ARAT capabilities
were as follows:

* Turbulence measurements of wind, temperature and moisture.  Fast
response sensors located on a nose boom 5m long, which measured

    - attack and sideslip angles by mobile vanes and by a five hole probe
      (Rosemound 858).
    - true airspeed by a Pitot probe
    - temperature by a fast response "INSU" probe
    - humidity by a Lyman-alpha humidity meter

* Mean state sensors

    - Rosemount temperature probe
    - Reverse-flow temperature probe
    - General Eastern dew point sensor

* Aerosols and cloud microphysics

    - 1-D drop size measurements from 0-6000 microns by four
Knollenberg sensors
    - 2-D sensor OAP 2DC for drop sizes between 25 and 800 microns

* Liquid water content

    - Johnson-Williams sensors

* Radiative measurements, up- and downward

    - Longwave (14-40 microns) Eppley radiometers
    - Shortwave (0.2-2.8 microns) Eppley radiometers
    - Radiances (7.8-14 microns) Barnes PRT5 radiometers

* Chemical measurements(isokinetic veins)

* Pointint backscatter lidar (Leandre)

* Directional reflectances meausrements (POLDER- Polarized Direct
Reflectance)

Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>

The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget(Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly on a mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10).
Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument
package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.

The MFOV (medium-field-of-view) SF (shape factor) S-10 contains inverted
daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and longwave
radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month.  This data
set is produced for each of the satellites (ERBS and NOAA-9) and the
combination of satellites which are operational during the data month.
The values for this data set are derived using the shape factor
technique(Smith et al. 1986).  As described in the Earth Radiant
Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Nonscanner S-10/S-10N User's Guide,
the data contains a 30 byte header, 67 scale factors which are used to
scale the data in the first record, and 26 scale factors which are
used to scale the data in the second record.  The data set also
contains two records for each processed region.  The first record is
of fixed length (990 words) and contains averaged data.  The second
record is of variable length and contains individual hour box
estimates.  The length of the second record, in words, is calculated
by multiplying the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by
the number of values stored for each hour box (38 for the nonscanner).

<A HREF=http://haloedata.larc.nasa.gov/home.html>http://haloedata.larc.nasa.gov/home.html</A>.

The Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) on NASA's Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite (UARS) investigates upper atmosphere chemistry,
dynamics and radiative processes, particlarly stratospheric ozone
destruction and chlorofluromethane impact on ozone.

HALOE is a solar occultation experiment designed to monitor the
vertical distribution of HCl, HF, CH4, and NO by gas filter
correlation radiometry and H2O, NO2, O3, and CO2 by broadband filter
radiometry.  The HALOE instrument typically views 15 sunrise and
sunset events each day, scanning the solar disk from limb to limb
during each event.  The latitude/longitude location of the HALOE data
varies with the spacecraft-Earth-Sun position.  For a given day, the
locations tend to be in two distinct latitude bands and to sweep
across the full longitude range.  Coverage across the full range of
latitudes is achieved on a time period ranging from about two to six
weeks depending on the time of year.  The latitude coverage extends
from 80 degrees north to 80 degrees south.

The HALOE level 3AT data consist of 13 granules per day.  A data
granule is one HALOE species or subtype per day.  The following
subtypes are available: 1) AEXTCH4 - aerosol extinction at 3.46 um
(CH4 gas filter), 2) AEXTCO2 - aerosol extinction at 2.80 um (CO2 gas
filter), 3) AEXTHCL - aerosol extinction at 3.40 um (HCL gas filter),
4) AEXTHF - aerosol extinction at 2.45 um (HF gas filter), 5) AEXTNO -
aerosol extinction at 5.26 um (NO gas filter), 6) CH4 - methane, 7)
H2O - water vapor, 8) HCL - hydrogen chloride, 9) HF - hydrogen
fluoride, 10) NO - nitric oxide, 11) NO2 - nitrogen dioxide, 12) O3 -
ozone, and 13) TEMP - atmospheric temperature.  Aerosol extinction
coefficients are measured in units of 1/km, chemical species are given
in parts per million by volume (ppmv), and temperature is in units of
degrees Kelvin.

Each of the 13 HALOE granules is accompanied by 2 additional parameter
files, designated as level 3TP.  The first parameter file, subtype
LAT, contains the latitude values for each pressure level of each
event for the day.  The second parameter file, subtype LON, contains
the longitude values.  The level 3AT files only contain the
latitude/longitude location corresponding to the 30 km retrieval
point.

The HALOE level 3AT data product consist of profiles that have been
interpolated both vertically and horizontally from the original
profiles to standard surfaces and locations defined by the UARS
project for all limb-viewing instruments.  The level 3AT format is
common to all UARS instruments to allow for intercomparison.  The
level 3AT data product consists of time-ordered profiles, and are
spaced at intervals of 1 UARS minute (65.536 seconds), or about 495 km
along the tangent track (horizontal resolution).  The vertical
resolution for the level 3AT HALOE profiles is defined by the UARS
pressure levels (in mbars) given by:

   P(i) =  1000 * 10**(-i/6) for i = 0, 1, 2, ...

which gives approximately 2.5 km increments between pressure surfaces.

The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget(Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly ona mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10).
Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument
package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.  MFOV (medium-field-of-view) data from the satellites are
not processed and therefore not archived.

The WFOV (wide-field-of-view) NF (numerical filter) S-10N contains
inverted daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and
longwave radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one
month. This data set consists of nonscanner data processed without
scene identification information from the scanner and therefore used
the "Time/Space Averaging Deadscanner Option" algorithm as described
in the Earth Radiant Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Nonscanner
S-10/S-10N User's Guide. This data set is produced for each of the
satellites (ERBS, NOAA-9, and NOAA-10) and the combination of
satellites that are operational during the month. The values for this
data set are derived using the numerical filter algorithm (Smith et
al. 1986). The data contains two records for each region.  The first
record is of fixed length (990 words) and contains averaged data.  The
second record is of variable length containing individual hour box
estimates.  The length of the second record, in words, is calculated
by multiplying the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by
the number of values stored for each hour box (38 for the nonscanner).

<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-27<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

The ASTEX/MAGE experiment is a multinational effort to improve our
capability for studying cloud-chemistry interactions and the air/sea
fluxes that affect them.  The primary purpose of ASTEX (with which
MAGE collaborated) was to study the factors influencing the formation
and dissipation of marine clouds.  The specific goals of the MAGE
atmospheric chemistry experiment in ASTEX included:

- Develop and test a Lagrangian strategy for studying chemical and
meteorological evolution in a tagged airmass, using ships, balloons,
and aircraft.

- Develop and test new techniques for estimating trace-gas and aerosol
fluxes across the air/sea interface by comparison with traditional
approaches.

- Evaluate the impact of marine and continental aerosols on the
formation and dissipation of stratocumulus clouds.

- Compare the impacts of natural and anthropogenic sulphur, halogens,
and hydrocarbons on marine aerosol chemistry.

- Gain experience with multi-national and multi-agency field
experiments as a means for addressing global tropospheric chemistry
issues.

Data were derived directly from ion chromatograms recorded from
samples collected on the ship and stored in liquid nitrogen for later
analysis.  Concentrations were calculated from the standard
concentration and the peak height ratio of the standard and ambient
isotopomers in the ion chromatograms.  Uncertainties were estimated
from a propagation of errors calculation which considers estimated
error in the standard concentration and signal-to-noise derived error.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

A special set of analysis products for the Atlantic Stratocumulus
Transition Experiment (ASTEX) region during June 1-28, 1992 was
prepared by Ernst Klinker and Tony Hollingsworth of the European
Centre for Medium-range Forecasting (ECMWF), and reformatted by Chris
Bretherton of Univ. of Washington.  These analyses, or more correctly
initializations and very short range forecasts using the ECMWF T213L30
operational model, incorporate routine observations from the global
network and special soundings from ASTEX that were sent to ECMWF
during ASTEX via the GTS telecommunication system.  About 650 special
soundings were incorporated, including nearly all soundings from Santa
Maria, Porto Santo, and the French ship Le Suroit, most of the
soundings taken on the Valdivia and Malcolm Baldridge, and almost none
of the soundings from the Oceanus.  Surface reports from the research
ships were also incorporated into the analyses after the first week of
the experiment.  Aircraft soundings were not included in the analyses.
ECMWF has requested that anyone making use of this data set
acknowledge them, and that those investigators publishing research
that makes more than casual use of this data set contact Ernst Klinker
or Tony Hollingsworth.

The data have been decoded by Chris Bretherton into ASCII files, one
for each horizontal field at a given level and base time.  All data
have the same horizontal resolution of 1.25 degrees in latitude and
longitude and correspond to base (initialization) times of 00, 06, 12,
or 18Z.  Different fields have different lat/lon ranges and sets of
available vertical levels, as tabulated below.  Also, some fields are
instantaneous (I) while others are accumulated (A) over the first 6
hours of a forecast initialized at the base time.  This is tabulated
in the 'time range' column below.  Instantaneous fields are best
compared with data at the base time, while accumulated fields are best
compared with data three hours after the base time.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

The ASTEX/MAGE experiment is a multinational effort to improve our
capability for studying cloud-chemistry interactions and the air/sea
fluxes that affect them.  The primary purpose of ASTEX (with which
MAGE collaborated) was to study the factors influencing the formation
and dissipation of marine clouds.

The specific goals of the MAGE atmospheric chemistry experiment in
ASTEX included:

- Develop and test a Lagrangian strategy for studying chemical and
meteorological evolution in a tagged airmass, using ships, balloons,
and aircraft.

- Develop and test new techniques for estimating trace-gas and aerosol
fluxes across the air/sea interface by comparison with traditional
approaches.

- Evaluate the impact of marine and continental aerosols on the
formation and dissipation of stratocumulus clouds.

- Compare the impacts of natural and anthropogenic sulphur, halogens,
and hydrocarbons on marine aerosol chemistry.

- Gain experience with multi-national and multi-agency field
experiments as a means for addressing global tropospheric chemistry
issues.

The North Carolina State University tetroons were launched from the
ship Oceanus in support of the FIRE-ASTEX observational program,
conducted in the eastern North Atlantic during the month of June 1992.
Special constant density balloons were launched and then tracked for
48 hours -- with the idea that they were tracking a single parcel of
air.  The parameter #sats gives the number of GPS satellites available
for positioning.  Four satellites are necessary to determine altitude,
otherwise the last available altitude from four satellites is assumed
to remain constant, so that the horizontal location can be
triangulated from three satellites.  An altitude is always given in
the file, so care should be taken as to its use.

Each tetroon attempted to fix its location once every 5 minutes of
operation.  Each tetroon was given an offset in transmission time
during the 5 minute period in which to transmit its location in order
to allow all tetroons to broadcast on the same frequency.  The time at
which a position fix was made and the relevant location information is
provided for each tetroon.  In the event no fix was possible due to
the satellite constellation configuration, number or signal strength,
no position was transmitted.  Each position was retransmitted at 1/2
hour increments for seven hours to attempt to obtain the maximum
amount of data, even for periods when aircraft were not in the area of
transmission.

in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

The ASTEX/MAGE experiment is a multinational effort to improve our
capability for studying cloud-chemistry interactions and the air/sea
fluxes that affect them.  The primary purpose of ASTEX (with which
MAGE collaborated) was to study the factors influencing the formation
and dissipation of marine clouds.  The specific goals of the MAGE
atmospheric chemistry experiment in ASTEX included:

- Develop and test a Lagrangian strategy for studying chemical and
meteorological evolution in a tagged airmass, using ships, balloons,
and aircraft.

- Develop and test new techniques for estimating trace-gas and aerosol
fluxes across the air/sea interface by comparison with traditional
approaches.

- Evaluate the impact of marine and continental aerosols on the
formation and dissipation of stratocumulus clouds.

- Compare the impacts of natural and anthropogenic sulphur, halogens,
and hydrocarbons on marine aerosol chemistry.

- Gain experience with multi-national and multi-agency field
experiments as a means for addressing global tropospheric chemistry
issues.

Data were derived directly from ion chromatograms recorded fr the ship
and stored in liquid nitrogen for later analysis.  Concentrations were
calculated from the standard concentrations and the peak height ratio
of the standard and ambient isotopomers in the ion chromatograms.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-21<br><pre>
The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite
system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget(Barkstrom and
Smith 1986).  The ERBE instruments fly on a mid-inclination National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation
Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10).
Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument
package.

The nonscanner instrument package contains four Earth-viewing channels
and a solar monitor (Luther et al. 1986).  The Earth-viewing channels
have two spatial resolutions: a horizon-to-horizon view of the Earth,
and a field-of-view limited to about 1000 km in diameter.  The former
are called the wide field-of-view (WFOV) and the latter the medium
field-of-view (MFOV) channels.  The solar monitor is a direct
descendant of the Solar Maximum Mission's Active Cavity Radiometer
Irradiance Monitor detector.  Due to the concern for spectral flatness
and high accuracy, all five of the channels are active cavity
radiometers.

The WFOV (wide-field-of-view) SF (shape factor) S-10 contains inverted
daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and longwave
radiant fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere for one month.  This data
set is produced for each of the satellites (ERBS, NOAA-9, and NOAA-10)
and the combination of satellites.

The values for this data set are derived using the shape factor
technique (Smith et al. 1986). As described in the Earth Radiant
Fluxes and Albedo, Scanner S-9, Nonscanner S-10/S-10N User's Guide,
the data set contains a 30 byte header record, 67 scale factors which
are used to scale the data in the first record, and 26 scale factors
which are used to scale the data in the second record.  The data set
also contains two records for each processed region.  The first record
is of fixed length (990 words) and contains averaged data.  The second
record is of variable length containing individual hour box estimates.
The length of the second record, in words, is calculated by
multiplying the number of hour boxes (978th word of record one) by the
number of values stored for each hour box (38 for the nonscanner).

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud

13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-27<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

The ASTEX/MAGE experiment is a multinational effort to improve our
capability for studying cloud-chemistry interactions and the air/sea
fluxes that affect them.  The primary purpose of ASTEX (with which
MAGE collaborated) was to study the factors influencing the formation
and dissipation of marine clouds.  The specific goals of the MAGE
atmospheric chemistry experiment in ASTEX included:

- Develop and test a Lagrangian strategy for studying chemical and
meteorological evolution in a tagged airmass, using ships, balloons,
and aircraft.

- Develop and test new techniques for estimating trace-gas and aerosol
fluxes across the air/sea interface by comparison with traditional
approaches.

- Evaluate the impact of marine and continental aerosols on the
formation and dissipation of stratocumulus clouds.

- Compare the impacts of natural and anthropogenic sulphur, halogens,
and hydrocarbons on marine aerosol chemistry.

- Gain experience with multi-national and multi-agency field
experiments as a means for addressing global tropospheric chemistry
issues.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

SOFIA (Surface of the Ocean, Fluxes and Interaction with the
Atmosphere) is a research program carried out by French groups from
the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement (CRPE),
Laboratoire l'Aerologie (LA)-Toulouse, Centre de Meteorologie Marine
(CMM)-Brest, Institut Francais de Rechercher sur la Mer
(IFREMER)-Brest, Service d'Aeronomie-Paris, and Laboratoire de
Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)-Palaiseau with cooperation from Centre
National de Recherche Meteorologique (CNRM)-Toulouse.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.

The data provided were collected via a trailing thermistor with bucket
measurements.  The thermistor data have been calibrated but not
quality controlled.

Radiosonde data were collected during the FIRE ASTEX for time period
June 1, 1992 through June 28, 1992 from the Santa Maria.  There are 3
sets of interpolated sounding data.  They are 5-second, 20-meter, and
2-millibar.

Each file contains a 5-line header. The first line is the site name
(up to 16 characters), the next line is the latitude and longitude at
the time of launch, the third contains the date-time group at launch
in YYMMDDHHMM format.  Lines 4 and 5 describe the data to follow,
which comprise no more that 1500 additional lines.  The data are:
minutes, seconds past launch, ascent rate, height, pressure,
temperature, relative humidity, dew point, mixing ratio and wind speed
and direction.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-16<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The NOAA wind profiles were collected during the period from Nov.  13,
1991 to Dec. 7 1991.  The original data were stored in the Enhanced
Binary Universal Form (EBUF) format.  These data files have been
reformatted and are provided (in ASCII format) by the Langley DAAC.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

SPECTRE/SIRIS high spectral resolution observations were obtained at
Coffeyville, Kansas in November - December 1991. The SIRIS instrument
has been previously flown for balloon-borne studies of stratospheric
chemistry relevant to the ozone cycles.  It is a modified version of a
Bomem continuously scanning Fourier transform spectrometer, operating
in emission mode.  The following instrument parameters were applicable
for the Coffeyville SPECTRE campaign.  The field-of-view, 0.5 degrees
full width at half-maximum, was directed towards the zenith, except
for a day when limb were recorded.  The highest emission-mode spectral
resolution recorded during SPECTRE was taken by SIRIS 0.06 cm-1,
apodized. Scan times varied from one to a few minutes, depending on
the resolution. The instrument was run at ambient temperature, with
the Si:Ga detectors at liquid helium (LHe) temperature.  Data are
limited by photon noise from the emission from the instrument and from
the atmosphere itself.  Therefore data were recorded with two
different width bandpasses: 1) narrow bandpass cooled filters in
channels 1-4, which reduces the background noise, yielding higher
signal-to-noise; and 2) wide band in channel 5 for more complete
spectral coverage.

It was the goal of SPECTRE to acquire clear-sky radiance spectra under
a variety of temperature and water vapor conditions.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-12-29<br><pre>

This Seasat scatterometer product contains the Level 1b sigma-naught and
backscatter  measurements derived from the Sensor Data Record and corrected for
atmospheric  attenuation. The measurement temporal resolution is 1.89 seconds.

SEASAT was launched on June 28, 1978, carrying a five sensor payload,  and
operated successfully until a power failure brought transmission to a stop on
October 10, 1978.  Its height and inclination were 791 km and 108.0 deg.,
respectively.  The data set volume is 45.3 GB and the smallest  order available
from the JPL DAAC is approximately 140 MB

The microwave radar scatterometer (SASS) on the SEASAT-A satellite had  the
goal of determining the surface vector wind stress over the oceans and the
neutral stability wind vector at a 19.5 m reference height.  The physical basis
for the measurement technique is the Bragg scattering of microwaves from
centimeter length capillary ocean waves created by the surface wind.  The
strength of the radar backscatter is proportional to the capillary wave
amplitude, which is in equilibrium with the wind friction speed.

SASS cut two 500 km swaths 400 km apart along the ground track on  either side
of nadir.  In addition, there was a central swath 140km wide,  centering on
nadir.  SASS had a 50 km resolution cell and 100 km spacing  between cells. The
FOV was +/- 0.25 degrees 'cross cone'.  Pulse duration  was 4.8 milliseconds,
and the data stream was updated every 1.89 seconds.

Global coverage was achieved within the extremes +/-79 deg. latitude. From July
7 - August 17, 1978 the ground track equatorial spacing was 165 km. From August
18 - October 10, 1978 (the date that SEASAT terminally mal- functioned) the
ground track equatorial spacing was 900 km.  From July 7 to  August 26, 1978,
the ground track was repeated every 17 days.  From August 27 to October 10,
1978, the ground track repeated once every 3 days.

Related Data Sets: SEASAT SASS (Levels 1a, 2)
                          Altimeter (Levels 1a, 1b, 2)
                          SMMR (Levels 1a, 1b, 2) and
                          VIRR (Level 1a)

Data Set Status: Complete.  The JPL DAAC  holds data for the entire 96 mission
days during which SEASAT was operational.  There are some gaps due to outages
which occurred on during the months of July, August, September and October.
Total elapsed time of the outages was around 14 days.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The University of North Dakota owns and operates a Cessna Citation II
aircraft (N77ND) for the purpose of atmospheric research.  This
aircraft type has a number of design and performance characteristics
which make it an ideal platform for a wide range of atmospheric
studies.  A series of structural modifications have been made to the
basic airplane.  These include the following: pylons under the wing
tips for a variety of probes in the undisturbed air flow away from the
fuselage; a nose boom for wind measurement; a heated radome to prevent
ice accumulation on the nose area; special mounts for upward and
downward looking radiometers; side-facing camera mounts for time-lapse
cameras; optically-flat glass windows for photography; and an air
inlet port for air sampling inside the pressurized cabin.  The
research instrumentation available on the Citation for the second
Cirrus IFO is described below.

The basic instrumentation package measured temperature, dew point
temperature, pressure, wind and cloud microphysical characteristics
along with aircraft position, altitude and performance parameters. The
three-dimensional wind field is derived from measurements of
acceleration, pitch, roll and yaw combined with angles of attack and
sideslip and indicated airspeed. The aircraft parameters were supplied
by an LTN-76 inertial navigation system and a Global Positioning
System (GPS).  Turbulence intensity can be derived from differential
pressure transducers and INS accelerometer outputs.

Cloud microphysical measurements were made with an array of Particle
Measuring Systems probes (FSSP, 1D-C,2D-C,1D-P) mounted on the
wing-tip pylons. These probes measure concentrations and sizes of
particles from one micrometer to several millimeters in diameter.  In
addition there were probes to measure both liquid water content and
icing rate. Several gas and aerosol sampling instruments were
available.  These include fast response O3 and NO2 monitors, and a
condensation nuclei counter.

A forward or side-looking video camera was also used to provide a
visual record of flight conditions. The data were sampled at various
rate from 1 to 24 sec-1. The sampling is controlled by the on-board
computer system which also displayed the data in real time in graphic
and alphanumeric formats while recording them on magnetic tape.

Radiosonde data were collected during the FIRE ASTEX for time period
May 28, 1992 through June 22, 1992 from the Valdivia (ship).  There
are 3 sets of interpolated sounding data.  They are 5-second,
20-meter, and 2-millibar.

Each file contains a 5-line header. The first line is the site name
(up to 16 characters), the next line is the latitude and longitude at
the time of launch, the third contains the date-time group at launch
in YYMMDDHHMM format.  Lines 4 and 5 describe the data to follow,
which comprise no more that 1500 additional lines.  The data are:
minutes, seconds past launch, ascent rate, height, pressure,
temperature, relative humidity, dew point, mixing ratio and wind speed
and direction.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-07-13<br><pre>

This data set contains the Level 1a Seasat scatterometer backscatter
measurements and telemetered parameters in engineering units without
atmospheric corrections applied.  The measurement temporal resolution is 1.89
seconds.  The data volume is 11.5 GB and the smallest order available from the
JPL DAAC is approximately 140 MB

SEASAT was launched on June 28, 1978, carrying a five sensor payload,  and
operated successfully until a power failure brought transmission to a stop on
October 10, 1978.  Its height and inclination were 791 km and 108.0 deg.,
respectively.

The microwave radar scatterometer (SASS) on the SEASAT-A satellite had  the
goal of determining the surface vector wind stress over the oceans and the
neutral stability wind vector at a 19.5 m reference height.  The physical basis
for the measurement technique is the Bragg scattering of microwaves from
centimeter length capillary ocean waves created by the surface wind.  The
strength of the radar backscatter is proportional to the capillary wave
amplitude, which is in equilibrium with the wind friction speed.

SASS cut two 500 km swaths 400 km apart along the ground track on  either side
of nadir.  In addition, there was a central swath 140km wide,  centering on
nadir.  SASS had a 50 km resolution cell and 100 km spacing  between cells. The
FOV was +/- 0.25 degrees 'cross cone'.  Pulse duration  was 4.8 milliseconds,
and the data stream was updated every 1.89 seconds.

Global coverage was achieved within the extremes +/-79 deg. latitude. From July
7 - August 17, 1978 the ground track equatorial spacing was 165 km. From August
18 - October 10, 1978 (the date that SEASAT terminally mal- functioned) the
ground track equatorial spacing was 900 km.  From July 7 to  August 26, 1978,
the ground track was repeated every 17 days.  From August 27 to October 10,
1978, the ground track repeated once every 3 days.

Related Data Sets: SEASAT SASS(Levels 1b, 2 )
                          Altimeter(Levels 1a, 1b, 2 )
                          SMMR (Levels 1a, 1b, 2) and
                          SAR(Levels 1a)

Data Set Status: Complete.  The JPL DAAC  holds data for the entire 96 mission
days during which SEASAT was operational.  There are some gaps due to outages
which occurred during the months of July, August, September and October.
Total elapsed time of the outages was around 14 days.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13-November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas
(November 13-December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO
in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1-June 28, 1992).  Each
mission combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface
observations with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties
and physical processes of the cloud systems.

SOFIA (Surface of the Ocean, Fluxes and Interaction with the
Atmosphere) is a research program carried out by French groups from
the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement (CRPE),
Laboratoire l'Aerologie (LA)-Toulouse, Centre de Meteorologie Marine
(CMM)-Brest, Institut Francais de Rechercher sur la Mer
(IFREMER)-Brest, Service d'Aeronomie-Paris, and Laboratoire de
Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD)-Palaiseau with cooperation from Centre
National de Recherche Meteorologique (CNRM)-Toulouse.

The scientific objective of SOFIA during ASTEX was the study of energy
transfer (heat, humidity and momentum fluxes) between the sea surface
and the atmospheric boundary layer at scales ranging from the local
scale to the mesoscale (50 km). The general concept of the program was
to develop a measurement strategy based on nested boxes in which
instrumentation would be used to estimate and quantify fluxes.  These
instruments, from which flux estimates at different scales would be
measured, were used in connection with satellite measurements to
understand and, hence, to validate the "satellite integration" of
fluxes, particularly in the presence of mesoscale oceanic and
atmospheric structures responsible for spatial inhomogeneity of
fluxes.

A wave buoy (IFREMER) was used to obtain the wave spectrum (not
directional measurements).  This buoy was drogued to have a slow speed
displacement.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-07-25<br><pre>

The data product "Geosat altimeter geophysical parameters colocated with
NOAA/NDBC buoy data" is an oceanographic data set. The data cover three years
(1986-1988) and are located at data points determined by buoy locations in the
North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans.  The data consist of selected Geosat
altimeter measurements colocated with measurements from 22 buoys at fixed
locations.  Measurements derived from Geosat consist of the radar cross
section, wind speed based on the algorithm by Brown (1981), and significant
wave height. Measurements from the buoys consist of wave spectra, significant
wave height, wave period, wind speed, sea and air temperatures and atmospheric
pressure.  The data consist of three 2-dimensional arrays.  The Geosat data is
colocated with the buoys in time and space.  The maximum distance between a
satellite footprint and a buoy is 0.5 degrees longitude.  The time difference
between a satellite overflight and a buoy data is less than one hour. The
colocated data sets were compiled in 1990-1991 by Roman Glazman and Stuart
Pilorz at the Jet Propulsion The data can be obtained through the anonymous FTP
account from podaac.jpl.nasa.gov under the sub-directory of "geo-buoy". The
data is also available on magnetic tape. Laboratory, California Institute of
Technology.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-05-08<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMS). Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June
29-July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

The Cross-chain LORAN Atmospheric Sounding System (CLASS) sonde data
were collected in four locations: Arkansas City, KS; Coffeyville, KS:
Iola, KS; and Muskegee, OK.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-04-02<br><pre>

Since 1985, the German Meteorological Service DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst) has
been extracting the global radiation from METEOSAT visible data based on a
method which was developed by Moeser and Raschke (1984). The method combines
results from radiative transfer calculations with cloud information from
METEOSAT-VIS data. The area of investigation is Central Europe.

The global radiation is one component of the radiation balance at the surface.
The radiation balance is an important climate parameter, because it describes
part of the ernergy fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere. Information
on the global radiation is also needed for agricultural applications and for
solar energy research.

Product pricing depends on scientific or commercial use.

General information about the DWD is provided on Web .

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

A special set of analysis products for the Atlantic Stratocumulus
Transition Experiment (ASTEX) region during June 1-28, 1992 was
prepared by Ernst Klinker and Tony Hollingsworth of the European
Centre for Medium-range Forecasting (ECMWF), and reformatted by Chris
Bretherton of Univ. of Washington.  These analyses, or more correctly
initializations and very short range forecasts using the ECMWF T213L30
operational model, incorporate routine observations from the global
network and special soundings from ASTEX that were sent to ECMWF
during ASTEX via the GTS telecommunication system.  About 650 special
soundings were incorporated, including nearly all soundings from Santa
Maria, Porto Santo, and the French ship Le Suroit, most of the
soundings taken on the Valdivia and Malcolm Baldridge, and almost none
of the soundings from the Oceanus.  Surface reports from the research
ships were also incorporated into the analyses after the first week of
the experiment.  Aircraft soundings were not included in the analyses.
ECMWF has requested that anyone making use of this data set
acknowledge them, and that those investigators publishing research
that makes more than casual use of this data set contact Ernst Klinker
or Tony Hollingsworth.

The data have been decoded by Chris Bretherton into ASCII files, one
for each horizontal field at a given level and base time.  All data
have the same horizontal resolution of 1.25 degrees in latitude and
longitude and correspond to base (initialization) times of 00, 06, 12,
or 18Z.  Different fields have different lat/lon ranges and sets of
available vertical levels, as tabulated below.  Also, some fields are
instantaneous (I) while others are accumulated (A) over the first 6
hours of a forecast initialized at the base time.  This is tabulated
in the 'time range' column below.  Instantaneous fields are best
compared with data at the base time, while accumulated fields are best
compared with data three hours after the base time.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-21<br><pre>

The SUSIM home page on the WWW is
<A HREF=http://louis14.nrl.navy.mil/susim_uars.html>http://louis14.nrl.navy.mil/susim_uars.html</A>.


The data are accessible via telnet daac.gsfc.nasa.gov (192.107.190.139),
login:daacims, password:gsfcdaac

The Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM) on NASA's
Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) measures the energy input
to the upper atmosphere by observing the solar ultraviolet spectral
irradiance in the 110 to 410 nm range.

The SUSIM measures the full-disk solar irradiance with high-precision
and accuracy to follow short-term and intermediate-term variations in
the solar output.  SUSIM consists of two identical double-dispersion
scanning spectrometers, seven detectors (5 photodiodes, 2 photon
counters), and solar ultraviolet calibration sources.  One
spectrometer measures the solar disk while the other is for
calibration.  SUSIM uses high-precision deuterium lamps calibrated by
NIST.  SUSIM's spectral resolution is 0.15 nm over the entire spectral
range using the photon counters and 1 to 5 nm using the photodiodes.
Daily spectral scans are made at 1.0 nm resolution.

Two SUSIM Level 3 data products are produced each day: Level 3AS, and
Level 3BS.  The Level 3AS format is common to all UARS solar
instruments.  The Level 3BS format is identical to the Level 3AS
format, except that instrument degradation is included in the 3BS data
products.  Only the Level 3BS data are available from the GSFC DAAC.

SUSIM_L3BS_DAILY: These data products are produced from the
corresponding Level 3AS data product, and contain 1 nm resolution
SUSIM daily mean gridded irradiances beginning with a wavelength of
115.5 nm to 411.5 nm.  In addition, the data product contains the
following solar indices: mean solar distance, H I Lyman alpha, O I
index, C II index, C IV index, Al edge, Mg II index, and the Ca II
index.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13
- December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

During the period from June 1 to June 29, 1992, 203 soundings were
obtained.  At present two forms of data exist - Level I and Level II.
Level I are the raw data produced in real time by the software of the
Atmospheric Instrumentation Research (AIR) radiosonde system.  These
data are at irregular pressure and height levels.  Level II data
consist of processed thermodynamic and wind data at a uniform
resolution of 10m, which essentially retains the highest possible
vertical resolution in the original data.  The Level II thermodynamic
data seem to be reasonably free of errors; however, as mentioned in
Schubert et. al., (1992) the wind data requires additional filtering
before use.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-14<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987) a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November 13
- December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud system.

During the period from June 1 to June 29, 1992, 203 soundings were
obtained.  At present two forms of data exist - Level I and Level II.
Level I are the raw data produced in real time by the software of the
Atmospheric Instrumentation Research (AIR) radiosonde system.  These
data are at irregular pressure and height levels.  Level II data
consist of processed thermodynamic and wind data at a uniform
resolution of 10m, which essentially retains the highest possible
vertical resolution in the original data.  The Level II thermodynamic
data seem to be reasonably free of errors; however, as mentioned in
Schubert et. al., (1992) the wind data requires additional filtering
before use.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-01<br><pre>

The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) version 7 Daily Gridded
Data consist of daily, global coverage of total ozone integrated over
the depth of the atmosphere and bulk reflectivity resulting from the
combined effects of the surface, clouds and tropospheric aerosols. The
temporal coverage of the data is from November 1978 to May 1993
(Nimbus-7 TOMS), and from August 1991 to December 1994 (Meteor-3 TOMS).
These data are archived at the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center
(DAAC).  Two new TOMS instruments were launched in July 1996 (Earth Probe
TOMS) and August 1996 (ADEOS TOMS).  Data from these instruments will be
archived at the Goddard DAAC when they become available.

This product supersedes both the version 6 GRIDTOMS data produced by
the Ozone Processing Team (OPT) at Goddard Space Flight Center and
archived at the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC), as well as
the derivative version 6 TOMS DAYGRIDS data set archived at the Goddard
DAAC.

The total ozone and reflectivity are mapped to a global grid of size
180 x 288 with a lat-long resolution of 1.00 x 1.25 degrees. These
data are stored in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) and are much
more easily visualized than the original GRIDTOMS data. HDF was
developed by the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA)
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

TOMS is the only source of high resolution global information about
the total ozone content of the atmosphere. As such, the data set is
important in studies involving upper air dynamics and chemistry on
both short (interannual) and long (decadal) time scales. The TOMS
instrument and its successors are the primary means by which regional
(e.g., polar) and global ozone patterns have been monitored on a
daily basis since 1978.

These data may be downloaded via anonymous ftp or ordered on media
from the Goddard DAAC.  To access the data through the anonymous ftp
server:

  1. ftp daac.gsfc.nasa.gov <A HREF=ftp://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov>ftp://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>

  2. login = anonymous, password = your e-mail address
  3. cd /data/toms

There is a README file describing how to access the data from the
files. The data files are in subdirectories by satellite, year,
and month (ex. /data/toms/nimbus7/1990/02). User Guides in Adobe
Acrobat format can be found in the documentation directory. Simple
read software are located in the software directory.

The DAAC maintains an online Web-based browser for previewing the
data and placing orders. The URL for the TOMS browser is at
<A HREF=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/BRS_SRVR/tomsbrs_main.html>http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/BRS_SRVR/tomsbrs_main.html</A>.


One can also place an order for the TOMS data by visiting the DAAC
Home Page at <A HREF=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov>http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>.  To access the DAAC Web

Search and Order page first click on the "Data" icon, then click on
the "Archives" icon, and then choose the "TOMS" link.  The data can
be ordered on 8mm tape (8200 and 8500 format), 4mm tape (60m and 90m),
9-track 6250 bpi, or ftp.

For those without Web access the data can also be ordered through the
DAAC online Information Management System (IMS).  Simply telnet to
daac.gsfc.nasa.gov (username = daacims, password = gsfcdaac).
("telnet://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov")

The TOMS version 7 data are also available on CD-ROMs.  First goto the
DAAC Home Page at <A HREF=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov>http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>, then click on the "Data"

icon, and then choose the "CD-ROM" link.

DATASET_COMMENTS:

The NASA Water Vapor Project data set (NVAP) is a total column
(integrated) water vapor data set comprised of a combination of
radiosonde observations, Television and Infrared Operational Satellite
(TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), and Special Sensor
Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data sets.  This is 5-year total and layered
(1988-1992) global water vapor data set.  The global layered water
vapor data set is created by slicing the total water vapor data set
using layered information that TOVS and radiosonde data provides.  As
a companion data set for analysis, STC-METSAT also prepared a global
(over oceans only), integrated cloud liquid water data set (since the
best global climate models now contain liquid water as an explicit
variable). STC-METSAT developed methods to process the data at a daily
time scale and 1o x 1o spatial resolution.  This work has become an
internationally accepted contribution to the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP).

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve the basic understanding of the interaction of physical
processes in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine
stratocumulus systems and the radiative properties of these clouds
during their life cycles and (2) to investigate the interrelationships
between the ISCCP data, GCM parameterizations, and higher space and
time resolution cloud data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

The development of parameterizations requires an understanding of the
processes that generate, maintain, and dissipate boundary layer
clouds. This development is currently impeded by lack of understanding
of the transition from stratocumulus clouds to trade cumulus clouds
and the factors that control cloud type and amount in the boundary
layer.  The Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition EXperiment (ASTEX) was
designed to address key issues related to stratocumulus to trade
cumulus transition and mode selection.  ASTEX involved intensive
measurements from several platforms operating from 1-28 June 1992 in
the area of the Azores and Madeira Islands.  The purpose was to study
how the transition and mode selection are effected by 1) cloud-top
entrainment instability, 2) diurnal decoupling and clearing due to
solar absorption, 3) patchy drizzle and a transition to horizontally
inhomogeneous clouds through decoupling, 4) mesoscale variability in
cloud thickness and associated mesoscale circulations, and 5) episodic
strong subsidence lowering the inversion below the LCL.  Detailed
descriptions of the scientific goals of ASTEX are in the FIRE Phase
II: Research plan (1989) and in the ASTEX Operations Plan (1992).

This ASCII formatted data set includes data collected aboard the
University of Washington's Corsair 131A airplane.  The cloud
microphysics probe (PVM-100A) was used to gather data on cloud liquid
water content, particle surface area, and effective droplet radius.
Please refer to the reference authored by H. Gerber to obtain
information on how the raw data were reduced to produce this data set.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-08-01<br><pre>

This data set contains Level 1a data consisting of decommutated earth-located
information about the intensity of radiation emitted  from the sea in a
microwave band in engineering units (watts, volts). Output is in the form of
Sensor Data Record tapes. The Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR)
is a passive  microwave radiometer measuring dual polarized microwave
radiation from the earth's surface and atmosphere in 5 frequencies; 6.63,
10.69, 18.0, 21.0 and 37.0 GHz. SMMR swath width  is 600 km.  Global coverage
was  achieved within the orbital extremes: +77/-72 deg. latitude from July 7 -
August 17, 1978.  From July 7 to  August 26, 1978,  the ground track was
repeated  every 17 days. From August 27 to October 10, 1978, the ground  track
repeated once every 3 days. The measurement temporal resolution is 10/second.
Data Set Volume is 11.9 GB.

SEASAT was launched on June 28, 1978, carrying a five sensor payload, and
operated successfully until a power failure brought transmission to a stop on
October 10, 1978.  Its height and inclination were 791 km and 108.0 deg.,
respectively. Global coverage was achieved within the orbital extremes: +77/-72
deg. latitude from July 7 - August 17, 1978 with a ground track equatorial
spacing of 165 km.  From August 18 - October 10, 1978 (the date that SEASAT
terminally malfunctioned) the ground track equatorial spacing was 900 km.
>From July 7 to August 26, 1978, the ground track was repeated every 17 days.
>From August 27 to October 10, 1978, the ground track repeated once every 3
days.  The measurement temporal resolution is 10/second.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-06-11<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
improve basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-26<br><pre>

This data product contains level 1b data from the Scanning  Multichannel
Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on Seasat.  The product consists of calibrated
information about the  intensity of radiation emitted from the sea in a
microwave band.  The parameter is calibrated brightness temperature.  Output is
in the form of calibrated Sensor Data Records.  Data product volume is 45.7 GB.

SEASAT was launched on June 28, 1978, carrying a five sensor payload, and
operated successfully until a power failure brought transmission to a stop on
October 10, 1978.  Its height and inclination were 791 km and 108.0 deg.,
respectively.

The Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) is a passive microwave
radiometer measuring dual polarized microwave radiation from the earth's
surface and atmosphere in 5 frequencies; 6.63, 10.69, 18.0,  21.0 and 37.0 GHz.
SMMR Swath width is 600 km.

Global coverage was achieved within the orbital extremes: +77/-72 deg. latitude
from July 7 - August 17, 1978 with a ground track equatorial  spacing of 165
km.  From August 18 - October 10, 1978 (the date that SEASAT  terminally
malfunctioned) the ground track equatorial spacing was 900 km.   From July 7 to
August 26, 1978, the ground track was repeated every 17 days.   From August 27
to October 10, 1978, the ground track repeated once every 3  days.  The
measurement temporal resolution is 10/second.

Related data sets: Seasat SMMR (Levels 1a, 2)
Altimeter (Levels 1a, 1b, 2)
SASS (Levels 1a, 1b, 2) and
VIRR (Levels 1a)

Radiosonde data were collected during the FIRE ASTEX for time period
June 7, 1992 through June 28, 1992 from the Malcolm Baldridge (ship).
There are 3 sets of interpolated sounding data.  They are 5-second,
20-meter, and 2-millibar.

Each file contains a 5-line header. The first line is the site name
(up to 16 characters), the next line is the latitude and longitude at
the time of launch, the third contains the date-time group at launch
in YYMMDDHHMM format.  Lines 4 and 5 describe the data to follow,
which comprise no more that 1500 additional lines.  The data are:
minutes, seconds past launch, ascent rate, height, pressure,
temperature, relative humidity, dew point, mixing ratio and wind speed
and direction.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-20<br><pre>

The First ISCCP Regional Experiments have been designed to improve
data products and cloud/radiation parameterizations used in general
circulation models (GCMs).  Specifically, the goals of FIRE are (1) to
seek the basic understanding of the interaction of physical processes
in determining life cycles of cirrus and marine stratocumulus systems
and the radiative properties of these clouds during their life cycles
and (2) to investigate the interrelationships between the ISCCP data,
GCM parameterizations, and higher space and time resolution cloud
data.

To-date, four intensive field-observation periods were planned and
executed: a cirrus IFO (October 13 - November 2, 1986); a marine
stratocumulus IFO off the southwestern coast of California (June 29 -
July 20, 1987); a second cirrus IFO in southeastern Kansas (November
13 - December 7, 1991); and a second marine stratocumulus IFO in the
eastern North Atlantic Ocean (June 1 - June 28, 1992).  Each mission
combined coordinated satellite, airborne, and surface observations
with modeling studies to investigate the cloud properties and physical
processes of the cloud systems.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-12-13<br><pre>

The data are accessible via telnet daac.gsfc.nasa.gov (192.107.190.139),
login:daacims, password:gsfcdaac

The Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII) on NASA's Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite (UARS) measures wind, temperature, and emission
rates in the mesosphere and thermosphere (80 to 300 km), by observing
the Doppler shift of visible airglow emissions.

The WINDII instrument is an all-glass field-widened achromatically and
thermally compensated phase-stepping Michelson interferometer, along
with a bare CCD detector that images the airglow limb through the
interferometer.  The instrument views the atmosphere simultaneouly in
two perpendicular directions, 45 degrees and 135 degrees from the UARS
velocity vector, to obtain the horizontal wind vector.  Measurements
are made day and night.

WINDII Level 3A data products consist of profiles that have been
interpolated both vertically and horizontally from the original
profiles to standard surfaces and locations defined by the UARS
project for all limb-viewing instruments. The Level 3A format is
common to all UARS instruments to allow for intercomparison.

The WINDII Level 3A data products consist of two types: Level 3AT and
3AL, both at standard pressure and altitude surfaces.  Level 3AT files
are time-ordered profiles and spaced at intervals of 65.536 seconds,
or about 495 km along the orbital track.  Level 3AL files are profiles
at the intersection of the orbital track spaced at intervals of 4
degrees latitude.

There are 3 subtypes or parameters for each Level 3AT and 3AL data
product, for a total of 6 products per day.  HRDI measurements are
made on altitude (A), and pressure (P) surfaces for each Level 3AT and
3AL type.  The following parameters are measured:

 1. MERWIN_A - meridional winds (m/s) on altitude surfaces
 2. ZONWIN_A - zonal winds (m/s) on altitude surfaces
 3. TEMP - atmospheric temperature (degrees K)

The horizontal resolution is 495 km along the orbital track for Level
3AT files, and 4 degrees latitude for Level 3AL files. The vertical
resolution for the UARS altitude surfaces are defined as:

 z(i) = 5*i             km, for  1 <= i <= 12
 z(i) = 60 + (i-12)*3   km, for 13 <= i <= 32
 z(i) = 120 + (i-32)*5  km, for 33 <= i <= 88

where "i" is the index of the data array.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-10-28<br><pre>

The NOAA/NASA Pathfinder Program SSM/I Level 3 EASE-Grid ocean products
are three data sets, marine wind speed, columnar water vapor, and cloud
liquid water, calculated using algorithms developed by Remote Sensing
Systems (Wentz, 1989).  These algorithms were modified by researchers at
the National Snow and Ice Data Center to operate with the NOAA/NASA
Pathfinder Program SSM/I Level 3 EASE-Grid Brightness Temperatures in the
equal-area, global projection.

There are three Ocean Product files per day in this data set. Coverage is
global and spans the Pathfinder SSM/I Benchmark period, from 1 August 1987
through 30 November 1988.  Resolution is 25 km for all channels.

The files are in HDF (Hierarchical Data Format), a self describing format.
For more information about HDF see <A HREF=http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu>http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu</A>.


They can be received through the JPL DAAC on tape or via anonymous ftp
from <A HREF=ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub>ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub</A>.  This data product is JPL product 078.

People interested in SSM/I data should also look at the other SSM/I data
available as there is coverage for longer time spans although not in the
EASE-Grid data format.  SSM/I data products are listed via
<A HREF=http://podaac-www.jpl.nasa.gov/SSMR_Products.shtml>http://podaac-www.jpl.nasa.gov/SSMR_Products.shtml</A>.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>
    The Land Cover Map of Great Britain is a digital map derived from the
classification of cloud-free satellite images from the American Landsat
Thematic Mapper (TM).

    Seventeen key land cover classes were identified throughout Britain and,
of these, eight classes were subdivided into, for example, upland and lowland
variants, giving a total of 25 cover types.

    The 25 land cover types include built-up areas, arable farmland, pastures
and forestry, together with a variety of semi-natural vegetation types.

    The classes are mapped on a 25 m raster overlay of the complete land
surface of Great Britain. The data are held in digital form as a 25 m raster
overlay of the British National Grid and can be presented in a variety of
digital exchange formats.

    They can be summarised by 1 km squares (or other resolutions) of the
National Grid and summary data are also held as Oracle tables.

    There are a wide range of users of the Land Cover Map in organisations
concerned with environmental impact assessments, pollution control, water
resources management, policy and planning, and environmental management.

    Its greatest potential can be realised through integration with other
data, such as geology, soils, climate, biological records, agricultural
statistics, and population census for use in decision support systems and
geographical information systems.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-05-16<br><pre>

ATLAST

ATLAST is a program for IBM compatible microcomputers, which  allows one to
examine and plot hydrographic and tracer section data.   One loads sections
into memory, plotting them as 'stacked' profiles  with superimposed color
contouring of a 2d variable, and separate  property-property plots with color
indicating a 3d variable (which may  be a water property or position in (x,y,p)
space).  The sections then may be 'browsed', plotting individual stations or
arbitrary subsets of stations, running up and down a single cast looking at a
numerical  values of all measured variables, and watching the inner
construction of four property plots.  The full content of the data may be
viewed by panning and zooming with a variable-size map window visible at all
times.  Thus one can reshape the section plot to bring out the upper ocean or
a western boundary current.  Plots may be set up or altered from a menu.

The software runs efficiently on 80386 - 80486 machines, and more slowly on
older 80286 IBM-AT class machines.  This version cannot run on the antique
8088 IBM-PC.  It uses the highest resolution graphics in the sequence
CGA-EGA-VGA, autosensing the installed board type (the choice can be
overridden).  A math coprocessor increases its performance, but is not
required.

The storage capacity and speed of this class of computer is well matched to
the task of providing a world atlas of ocean sections.  In fact, an 80 megabyte
hard disk can hold 2000 sections or so, together with the programs to plot
them.  A typical dataset with hydrographic variables and nutrients occupies
about 1 kbyte per station (using a 36-bottle rosette).  This means that 200 to
400 full stations can be read in or, equivalently, more stations subsampled to
a few depth or sigma-theta surfaces.

New data, including new tracer variables like tritium, helium-3, freons and
CO2, are readily added to the atlas.  At present we have 4 data types to
cover:  (type 1), simple hydrography, (2), hydrography + 3 sigma variables,
(3) these plus nitrate, phosphate and silicate and (4) these plus 3 more
variables, which may show freons, tritium or other tracers.  This rigid
structure will eventually be replaced with new file structure containing
complete headers and background cruise information.

Power OceanAtlas

Power OceanAtlas is a Macintosh computer application which provides a graphic
exploration environment to examine and plot oceanographic section data.
Power OceanAtlas 1.0 for Macintosh computers, is an enhanced version of the
OceanAtlas for Macintosh application and is a companion to ATLAST. Separate
versions - all with the same features - are available for PowerPC Macintosh
models, 680x0 models with floating point math co-processor (e.g. IIci's and
Quadras), and 680x0 models without the floating point math co-processor
(e.g. most 680x0 Performas). Thanks to the National Science Foundation
Power OceanAtlas 1.0 is available free of charge.

Power OceanAtlas data plots include offset profiles, property-property
plots, contour plots, and 3D plots, using color as a third (or fourth)
plotted variable to aid interpretation. We also provide station position
maps and a comprehensive data display window. All plots are linked and may
be "browsed" by sample and/or by station. Plots can be re-scaled, re-sized,
or have their colored variable changed. Selected areas of most plots can be
made into new plots. Standard levels, scales, contours, and colors can be
changed via user interfaces similar to those used in commercial Macintosh
applications. OceanAtlas provides data filtering, exporting, and editing,
plus allows data import. Many different types of calculations can be
performed.

Power OceanAtlas runs "native" on PowerPC-based Macintoshes. It is easier
now to create ratios and scaled variables. Data import options are greatly
expanded: Power OceanAtlas can directly import WOCE and NODC SD2 format
files. In addition, many bugs have been fixed in importing spreadsheet
format files. Power OceanAtlas adds animated 3D property-property plots and
3D profile plots, and an additional criterion to station filters allows
filtering by reported parameters.

The Power OceanAtlas electronic atlas of oceanographic sections provides a
unique reference and teaching environment.  Power OceanAtlas is also a
powerful data examination tool, and as such is useful for initial
exploration and data quality examination of new expedition data. The data
from these atlases are standard hydrographic stations (P, T, S, O2,NO3, PO4
and SiO3).

Power OceanAtlas is available via FTP from <A HREF=ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov>ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov</A> or

can be ordered on diskette from podaac@podaac.jpl.nasa.gov.  Information

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-03-19<br><pre>

The TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) system consists of three
separate instruments: High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder
Version 2 (HIRS/2), Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and Stratospheric
Sounding Unit (SSU). Each instrument has different characteristics,
resolutions, scan properties, etc.  which are described below. This
system is onboard the NOAA 6 through NOAA 14 and TIROS-N satellites.

The HIRS/2 instrument is a step-scanned multi-channel spectrometer
with 20 channels primarily in the infrared region of the spectrum
including both longwave (15 micron) and shortwave (4.3 micron), plus
one channel in the visible (.69 micron) region. Resolution of 17 km at
nadir, but at the end of a scan, resolution is 58 km cross-track by 30
km along-track with variable underlap between steps and scans. The
data include all 20 channels at 13 bit precision with time tags, Earth
location and calibration information.

The SSU is a step-scanned infrared spectrometer with 3 channels in the
15 micron C02 band. The 3 SSU channels have the same frequency but
different cell pressures. Resolution of 147 km at subpoint with an
underlap between adjacent scan lines of approximately 62 km at
nadir. The data include all 3 channels at 12 bit precision, with time
tags, Earth location and calibration information.

The MSU instrument is a passive scanning microwave spectrometer with
four channels in the 5.5 micron oxygen region. The 124 km resolution
at the subpoint creates an underlap of 115 km between adjacent scan
lines. Data include all 4 channels at 12 bit precision with time tags,
Earth location and calibration information.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

Canada and the United States carried out an atmospheric research
program called the Eulerian Model Evaluation Field Study (EMEFS) from
June 1, 1988 to May 31, 1990 under the coordination and management of
a bi-lateral, multi-agency Project Management Group (PMG).

The objective of the program was to collect daily air and
precipitation chemistry data for use in evaluating two Eulerian
long-range transport models: the Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM)
developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the
Atmospheric Deposition and Oxidants Model (ADOM) developed jointly by
Environment Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy,
the German Umweltbundesamt, and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)
(<A HREF=http://www.epri.com/>http://www.epri.com/</A>)


The 1988 intense EMEFS surface and aircraft field campaign was
performed to support short-term diagnostic model evaluations.

Air quality data measured include:

Surface measurements: carbon monoxide (CO), nitric acid (HNO3),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ammonia (NH3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), total active nitrogen (NOy), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide
(SO2), peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), aldehydes, formaldehyde, speciated
hydrocarbons (HC), and aerosol particles.

Aircraft measurements: nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
total active nitrogen (NOy), ozone (O3), peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), total peroxides,
speciated hydrocarbons (HC), aldehydes, hydrochloric acid (HCl),
nitric acid (HNO3), ammonia (NH3), nitrate radicals (NO3), sulfate
(SO4), ammonium (NH4), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium
(Cd), cloud water, bscat, and aerosol size.

Meteorological Observations include:
Surface measurements: temperature, relative humidity profiles, mixing
depth, and micro-meteorological data.

Aircraft measurements: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and
direction, and UV radiation.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-05<br><pre>

This product is one of several products containing SSM/I derived winds
over the oceans produced by Robert Atlas and Joseph Ardizzone (NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center) in collaboration with Ross N. Hoffman
(Atmospheric and Environmental Research - AER). A 2D variational
analysis method (VAM) was used to combine information from ECMWF 10m
surface wind analyses, SSM/I wind speeds (from Frank Wentz, Remote
Sensing Systems), and ship and buoy winds to produce new surface wind
analyses between -78 and 78 degrees latitude. Data sets designated as
level 3.0 contain gridded surface winds produced by the VAM.  Level
2.5 data sets contain SSM/I wind speeds with wind directions assigned
from the VAM analysis. Finally, the level 2.5 data is binned to grid
points over 5 and 30 day periods. This is designated as the level 3.5
product.

SSM/I wind speeds have been assimilated every 6 hours for the period
July 1987 to December 1994. Please note that all products were arrived
at using Wentz version-2 SSM/I. Extensions will be made as SSM/I data
becomes available. All data sets contain U and V components of the
wind in m/s. Gridded data (level 3.0 and 3.5) is represented on a 2
degree latitude by 2.5 degree longitude grid and is configured as
follows:

           rdata(i,j)

            i = 1,2,...,144 ==> lon = -180.0,-177.5,...,177.5
            j = 1,2,...,91  ==> lat = -90.0,-88.0,...,90.0

Data is available via anonymous FTP to <A HREF=ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov>ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov</A>

(137.78.96.30) or on tape in IDF (Iris Data Format) or HDF
(Hierarchical Data Format).  IDF makes use of IEEE 2-byte integers and
should be easily read on machines adhering to IEEE standards. HDF is
portable across all platforms and is rapidly becoming an industry
standard. Documentation and software are available on line. The data
sets are segmented by month. Level 3.0 data occupies ~6.3MB per
month. Level 2.5 constitutes the largest volume at ~25MB per month.
Level 3.5 binned data is ~.1MB in size.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

    The database comprises distributions of biological species in the
British Isles.

    The data incorporate the taxonomic code of the organism, together with
geographical coordinates of its location, date of observation, information
on habitat and conservation status.

    Over 6 million records covering 15,000 species are held in digital form
as Oracle tables. The majority of the data are donated by volunteer recorders
and are received by national recording schemes.

    The Biological Records Centre (BRC) is also assisted in its core
activities and database functions by the statutory Conservation Agencies
through a support contract administered by the Joint Nature Conservation
Committee (JNCC).

    The database is used to publish distribution atlases (at 10 km square
resolution) and to provide computerised retrieval and mapping services to
a wide user community.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-12-16<br><pre>

The NOAA/NASA AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder Monthly Sea Surface
Temperature CD-ROM contains monthly averaged sea surface
temperature (SST) data and browse images derived from the NOAA
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) using the
Pathfinder Version 3 algorithm.  Documentation and software are
also provided on the CD-ROMs.  Data for both the ascending pass
(daytime) and descending pass (nighttime) are available globally
on equal angle grids of 4096 pixels longitude by 2048 pixels
latitude, 2048 pixels longitude by 1024 pixels latitude and 720
pixels longitude by 360 pixels latitude.  This corresponds to
products previously referred to as 9km data.  Daily Pathfinder
"best" SST values are calculated using only the highest quality
pixels. Each data file contains two data sets.  The first  data
set contains the monthly averaged sea surface temperature values
which are in the form of digital numbers (DN).  The second data
contains the number of observations per pixel used to make each
monthly average.  Both data sets contain flags for land, ice and
missing values.  These data are provided in the Hierarchical Data
Format (HDF).  Browse images are in GIF format.  Currently
volume 11 and volume 12 exists for 1991 and 1992 respectively.
Data for earlier and later years will be provided on additional
CD-ROMs as they become available.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-08-05<br><pre>

The CD-ROM provides a comprehensive look at the TOPEX/Poseidon mission and
spacecraft. The TOPEX/POSEIDON mission was designed to provide information
about the changing topography of the world's oceans which in turn helps
scientists to understand the ocean's role in the global climate. The
TOPEX/POSEIDON spacecraft, launched in August 1992 and still operational as
of March 1996 carries an altimeter which has allowed measurements of the
ocean topography to be made.

The CD-ROM contains over an hour of digital video, audio, images, and text
captions which describe everything from the impetus for the mission to the
science results obtained in the first three years. The CD is divided into
the following seven sections: Mission History and Background, Mission
Description, Spacecraft, How the Measurement System Works, Mission
Operations, What We've Learned, Science Data. The CD-ROM is designed for a
general audience. It can also be also be used educationally for Grade 9
students and up.

The software and data on the CD are formatted such that they can be
accessed by Macintosh, PC, and other systems. For each of these platforms,
the following minimum requirements should be met:
* Macintosh- System 7.1, 68030 processor, 5MB free RAM, 256 color
640x480 pixel monitor, 2X CD-ROM drive - QuickTime 2.1 (included on CD)
* PC- Windows 3.1, 80386 processor, 8MB free RAM, - 256 color 640x480
pixel monitor, 2X CD-ROM drive, audio capability, QuickTime for

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-10-13<br><pre>

Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel consumption
has risen dramatically since the Inustrial Revolution. This data set represents
estimates of CO2 emissions from solid and liquid fuel consumption, gas flaring,
and cement production. The data set covers global, regional and national areas
from 1950-1989 using the methods of Marland and Rotty (1984). The data used for
estimating CO2 emissions were energy and population statistics from the United
Nations (UN), cement manufacturing from the U.S. Bureau of Mines, and gas
flaring data from the U.N. and from the Department of Energy (DOE).

Annual CO2 emission estimates are expressed in million metric tons of
carbon; per capita estimates are rounded and expressed in metric tons
of carbon.  Emission estimates are provided for nine regions in
descending order, with the highest emitting region in 1991 (North
America) listed first. National estimates are provided for the 20
highest CO2-emitting countries in 1991.  Data are tabulated by year
for Total, Solid, Liquid, Gas, Cement, and Gas Flaring CO2 emissions;
and Per capita emissions.  National estimates also include Bunkers -
emissions (in million metric tons of carbon) resulting from fuels
consumed by ships and aircraft engaged in international
transportation.  Emissions from bunker fuels are shown with the
country where the fuel loading occured.


The data records are as follows:

Global (1950-1991). CO2 estimates were derived from energy statistics compiled
by the U.N., the Bureau of Mines and the DOE.

Regional records of CO2 emissions:
Region IX: North America (1950-1991)
Region VII: Eastern Europe (1950-1991)
Region VI: Western Europe (1950-1991)
Region VIII: Centrally Planned Asia (1959-1991)
Region II: Far East (1950-1991)
Region IV: Oceania (1950-1991)
Region V: Middle East (1950-1991)
Region I: Developing America (1950-1991)
Region III: Africa (1950-1991)

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-12-16<br><pre>

This CD-ROM contains 10 pure ocean tidal models, that is, computer
 programs plus their data files to compute global ocean tidal
heights given latitude, longitude and time.  The CD-ROM also
contains: i) one loading tide model; ii) the set of tidegage data
used to intercompare the models; iii) a draft paper summarizing
the comparisons; iv) global maps (GIF images) of M2, S2 and other
tidal components and their current vectors; v)  an MPEG animation
showing global tides over several consecutive days;  vi) a list of
 references.  These tidal models are accurate to within 2 to 3 cm
in waters deeper than 200m.  In shallow waters they are quite
inaccurate, which makes them unsuitable for navigation or other
practical applications.  The models are the result of analysis of
precise measurements from the TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeters and
parallel developments in numerical tidal modeling and data
assimilation.  The CD-ROM contains the following models: AG95.1
(O. Andersen and older FES model; Kort-og Matrikelstyrelsen,
Denmark); CSR3.0 (R. Eanes and V. Bettadpur; U. Texas-Austin);
DW95.1 (S. Desai and J. Wahr; U. Colorado-Boulder); FES95.2
(C. Le Provost et al.; Institut de Mcanique de Grenoble, France);
 GSFC (B. Sanchez and E. Pavlis; Goddard Space Flight Center);
KANTHA2 (L. Kantha et al.; U. Colorado-Boulder); ORI.96
(K. Matsumoto et al.; U. of Tokyo, Japan); RSC94 (R. Ray,
B. Sanchez and D. Cartwright; Goddard Space Flight Center);
SR95.1 (E. Schrama and R. Ray; Goddard Space Flight Center);
TPX0.2 (G. Egbert, A. Bennett and M. Foreman; Oregon State U.);
and the loading tide SPOTL (D. Agnew, Scripps Institute of
Oceanography).  The models were tested on SUN-OS 4.1,
SUN-Solaris 2.4, Silicon Graphics, IRIX 5.3, and Cray UNICOS.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-12-29<br><pre>

This oceans data product consists of sensible and latent heat fluxes, and wind
stress components.  Wind vectors resulting from a variational analysis of SSM/I
wind speeds (see JPL product #044) were combined with surface temperature and
moisture data from ECMWF to calculate fluxes at the ocean-atmosphere interface.
The algorithm employed in the flux estimates uses the similarity theory of
Monin-Obukhov and is described in Helfand and Labraga (1988). The data was
produced by R.Atlas, J. Jusem and J. Ardizonne at the Goddard Space Flight
Center.

The fluxes were calculated every 6 hours for the period July 1987 to June 1988
and then monthly averaged. Extensions will be made as SSM/I data becomes
available. All data sets contain sensible and latent heat flux (W/M**2), and U
and V wind stress components (N/M**2) on a 2 degree latitude by 2.5 degree
longitude grid configured as follows:

rdata(i,j)

i = 1,2,...,144 ==> lon = -180.0,-177.5,...,177.5
j = 1,2,...,91  ==> lat = -90.0,-88.0,...,90.0

Data is available via anonymous FTP (binary mode) to podaac.jpl.nasa.gov
(137.78.32.15) or on tape in the Iris Data Format (IDF). IDF makes use of IEEE
2-byte integers and should be easily read on machines adhering to IEEE
standards. Documentation and software are available online. Each file contains
one set of monthly averaged fields and occupies approximately 100K bytes.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-12-16<br><pre>

The AVHRR MCSST CD-ROMs contain global monthly averaged Multi-Channel
Sea Surface Temperature (MCSST) data and browse images (GIF format)
derived from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
using the older Multi-Channel Sea Surface Temperature (MCSST)
algorithm.  Data were derived from measurements of emitted and
reflected radiance by the 5-channel AVHRR instruments aboard the
NOAA-7, -9, -11 and -14 satellites.  Data for both the ascending pass
(daytime) and descending pass (nighttime) are available in the
Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).  Sea surface temperatures (in degrees
Celsius) can be derived from Digital Number (DN) values.  In each data
file , there are three datasets that contain: valid data, interpolated
 data and flag values.  Data are given on an equal-angle grid of 2048
pixels longitude by 1024 pixels latitude; therefore, the spatial
resolution in pixels per degrees of longitude and latitude is 2048/360
or approximately 5.689.  Data with the same resolution has previously
been referred to as 18km data.  Read Software is available on each
CD-ROM as well as on the PO.DAAC FTP site (<A HREF=ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov>ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov</A>).

Programs to read the HDF data and attributes are written in C, FORTRAN
and IDL.  Each of the read programs has the capability to rewrite the
data in raw binary; however, the HDF library (available from
<A HREF=http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu>http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu</A>) must still be installed in order to use

these programs.  Documentation is provided on the CD-ROM.  Data
currently exist on four CD-ROMs for the period between November 1981
and December 1995.  More recent data will be provided on additional
CD-ROMs as available.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-11-21<br><pre>

The data are accessible via telnet daac.gsfc.nasa.gov (192.107.190.139),
login:daacims, password:gsfcdaac

The Solar-Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) on NASA's Upper
Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) measured the energy input to the upper
atmosphere by observing the solar spectral irradiance in the ultraviolet
spectral range from 119 to 420 nm.  The SOLSTICE measured the full disk solar
irradiance with high precision and accuracy to follow short-term (minutes to
hours), intermediate-term (days to weeks), and long-term (11 year sunspot,
and 22 year solar magnetic field cycles) variations in the solar output.

The SOLSTICE instrument is a three-channel ultraviolet spectrometer that
measures the magnitude of solar and spectral irradiance in the wavelength
range form 119 to 420 nm.  The design of the instrument allows for observations
of both the sun and bright blue stars (whose spectra in the SOLSTICE spectral
range is assumed to be constant) using the same optics.  The entrance and exit
slit sizes are varied, and different integration times are used to accommodate
the 5 to 8 order of magnitude difference between the brightnesses of the sun
and blue stars.

SOLSTICE is mounted to the two-axis Solar Stellar Pointing Platform (SSPP)
which can track objects to an accuracy of 1.5 arc minutes.  During the daylight
portion of an orbit SOLSTICE is pointed at the sun, and during the nighttime
portion it is pointed toward blue stars.  One or more full spectral scans of
the sun at the instrument resolution is completed each orbit.  Stellar scans
require longer integration times, and are only made at a few selected wave-
lengths throughout the spectral range, with typically one or two stars at
one or two wavelengths being observed each orbit.

Two SOLSTICE Level 3 data products are produced each day:  Level 3AS,
and Level 3BS.  The Level 3AS format is common to all UARS solar instruments.
The Level 3BS format is identical to the Level 3AS format, except that
instrument degradation is included in the 3BS data products.

SOLSTICE_L3AS_DAILY:  These data products contain a single array representing
a daily mean solar spectrum.  Each element in the array is spaced at 1.0 nm
intervals and centered on the half nm from 115 to 420 nm.  The array elements
have been normalized to an earth-sun distance of 1 AU.  Also produced, as
Level 3AS parameters, are daily average integrated intensities (Gaussian fits)
or core/wing ratios (Mg-II at 280 nm and Ca-II at 393 nm) for selected solar
spectral features.

SOLSTICE_L3BS_DAILY:  These data products are produced from the corresponding
Level 3AS data product, and a table (calibration file) of instrument degradation
function coefficients which have been determined from selected bright blue
stars.  The time-degradation function (which varies with wavelength) is applied
to the Level 3AS irradiance spectrum and the integrated irradiance of the
selected spectral emission features, but not to the core/wing ratios, to produce
the Level 3BS data products.

* NOTE: only SOLSTICE_L3BS_DAILY data are available from the GSFC DAAC.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-03-19<br><pre>

The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor is carried
on NOAA's Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) starting with
TIROS-N in 1978. Onboard the TIROS-N, NOAA-6, 8 and 10 POES
Satellites, the AVHRR Sensor measures in 4 spectral bands, while those
on the NOAA-7, 9, 11, 12 and 14 POES Satellites are measured in 5. The
primary objective of the AVHRR instrument is to provide cloud top and
sea surface temperatures through passively measured visible, near
infrared and thermal infrared spectral radiation bands.

NOAA Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites obtain global imagery
daily which are transmitted to the Command and Data Acquisition (CDA)
stations at Wallops Island, Virginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska. The CDA
stations relay the data to the National Environmental Satellite, Data
and Information Service (NESDIS), located in Suitland, Maryland, for
processing and distribution to forecasting centers of the U.S. and
other nations.

GAC (Global Area Coverage) data is produced from AVHRR data aboard
NOAA operational polar orbiting satellites. The GAC data are produced
on-board the satellite by sampling the AVHRR 1 km data to 4 km
resolution by averaging along-scan groups of four samples out of five
and skipping every third scan.  The data includes all 5 channels at 10
bit precision, with time tags, Earth location, and calibration
information.

The LAC Level 1B data are 1 km resolution data that are recorded
on-board the satellite and dumped at the CDA stations, at some later
time.

The HRPT Level 1B data are 1 km direct readout data obtained as the
satellite passes over CDA Stations. Hardcopy imagery from HRPT data
are also available.  Each dataset is generally 10-12 minutes in
duration, which requires 3 frames per channel.

  *************************

The Satellite Data Services Division (SDSD) of the NESDIS National
Climatic Data Center (NCDC) is responsible for archiving satellite
data within NOAA.  SDSD serves users whose interests span meteorology,
oceanography, and the land sciences representing federal, state, local
and foreign government agencies, universities, research organizations
and private industry. The SDSD archive contains over 30 years of polar
orbiter data from TIROS, ESSA, ITOS, NOAA, GEOS (Altimeter), Seasat
(SAR), Nimbus (CZCS), and TIROS-N (AVHRR and TOVS), and geostationary
data from ATS, SMS (VISSR), GOES (VAS), METEOSAT, and GMS.

These datasets exist in what can be called a 'primary database' built
from the various incoming data streams, and has 3 levels of storage:
on-line or active--data on media mounted for immediate access;
secondary on-line--data on media mounted in a device not ready for
immediate access, but shortly thereafter; and off-line--bulk storage
of unmounted media, digital and non-digital. The incoming digital or
non-digital data are processed (quality controlled, validated,
reformatted) and added to the existing datasets resident in the
primary database. Maintenance is then performed on the primary and
active databases whereby data is moved between storage levels of the
primary database and also migrated to the active database. The data
are then accessed and products are generated, quality controlled, and
delivered to users. These archival products include digital data,
photographic prints, and photocopies of paper charts. SDSD also has an
in-house catalog/inventory system containing high-level and detailed
descriptions of datasets and data granules.

The NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC), a unit of the National
Weather Service (NWS), is responsible for monitoring, analyzing, and
predicting climate variations for periods from a few weeks to a few
years. The monitoring and prediction functions are real time
operations, while the analysis or diagnosis and improvement of
monitoring and prediction methods are carried out in a developmental
or research mode. The principal goals of monitoring and prediction are
to identify, trace, and forecast important anomalies in various
elements of the climate of the Earth-atmosphere system. CPC major
activities include monitoring the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
phenomenon, development of climate data bases, improvement in climate
prediction, information center for climate nationally and
internationally, sea surface temperature (SST) data center for TOGA,
and the Geostationary Precipitation Data Center (GPDC) for the World
Climate Research Program (WCRP).

CPC is responsible for generating and disseminating a variety of meteorological
products for studying climate variations. These include climate bulletins;
public information; output file for FAX, teletype, and AFOS; drought
advisories; weather maps; agricultural bulletins featuring the Weekly Weather
and Crop Bulletin; global height and ozone analyses; global atmospheric and
oceanic analysis; ENSO advisories; 6-10 day outlooks; and monthly and seasonal
outlooks. The CAC dial-up and network service is also available to the
user community for accessing these as well as other on-line products. An
account can be obtained by paying a user fee which is based on estimated usage
for the following year.

record contains the time, latitude and longitude for the Geosat subtrack at 10
sec intervals; SSM/I wind speed, water vapor and cloud water interpolated to
the Geosat location; and a flag that indicates ocean, land, ice or missing
Geosat data.  The data were produced by F. Wentz (Remote Sensing Systems). The
data set is approximately 140 MB and is in unlabeled format. It is available on
magnetic tape. A subroutine is provided to read the data, and there is a user's
manual.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-08-05<br><pre>

The CD-ROM provides a comprehensive look at the TOPEX/Poseidon mission and
spacecraft. The TOPEX/POSEIDON mission was designed to provide information
about the changing topography of the world's oceans which in turn helps
scientists to understand the ocean's role in the global climate. The
TOPEX/POSEIDON spacecraft, launched in August 1992 and still operational as
of March 1996 carries an altimeter which has allowed measurements of the
ocean topography to be made.

The CD-ROM contains over an hour of digital video, audio, images, and text
captions which describe everything from the impetus for the mission to the
science results obtained in the first three years. The CD is divided into
the following seven sections: Mission History and Background, Mission
Description, Spacecraft, How the Measurement System Works, Mission
Operations, What We've Learned, Science Data. The CD-ROM is designed for a
general audience. It can also be also be used educationally for Grade 9
students and up.

The software and data on the CD are formatted such that they can be
accessed by Macintosh, PC, and other systems. For each of these platforms,
the following minimum requirements should be met:
* Macintosh- System 7.1, 68030 processor, 5MB free RAM, 256 color

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>
    In the early 1980s a total of 126 land and land use attributes were
quantitatively recorded from map and statistic sources for the 2858
10 x 10 km grid squares (cells) of the Ordnance Survey National Grid which
contained land in Great Britain.

    The attributes are grouped into categories:

    Physiography (eg. relative relief, altitude range);
    Climate (eg. seasonal rainfall, temperature and wind speed);
    Geology (eg. extent of stratigraphic units);
    Soils (eg. extent dominated by 8 major soil groups); Topography (eg.
population, settlement frequency);
    Land Use (eg. extent of farmland, woodland and urban land);
    Agricultural Land Classification;
    Conservation Status (eg. presence of National Parks).

    The attributes provide the basis for a land data set appropriate to
national and regional scales of ecological assessment and resource
evaluation.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>

    The Scheme was set up in 1976, after 3 years of preliminary trials, and is
a joint project between ITE and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.

    The scheme was set up with 2 aims:

1) to provide information on the fluctuations of butterfly numbers from
year to year, so that underlying trends can be assessed.
2) to detect changes from the overall trend at individual sites, that are
caused by local factors, such as management.

    In addition to the initial aims, the scheme also provides information on
aspects of the population ecology and phenology of butterfly species, both in
relation to the effects of changes in climate and as a contribution to basic
knowledge.

    It is the only long-term monitoring scheme of its kind in Britain.

    The methods used are described by Pollard (1977) and instructions for
recorders are available as a separate booklet.

    Briefly, at each site the recorder makes a series of counts, walking a
fixed route once a week from April to September, noting any butterflies seen
within 5 metres.

    To provide standardisation, walks are carried out only between 10.45 and
15.45 BST, and then only if the weather meets specified criteria.

    Transect routes are divided into sections, usually according to changes in
habitat, so the scheme provides information on habitat preferences of
different species, and gives a means of objectively assessing the effects
of management on species.

     Over 100 sites from the whole of Britain and Northern Ireland now
contribute to the Scheme each year. Results are analysed in several
different ways.

    At each site, the mean weekly count of each species is totalled to
provide an annual index of abundance.  The index of abundance is not a
population estimate, but has been shown to be related to propulation size
(Pollard, 1977).

    The annual indexes of abundance from all sites are then collated to
give either an "all sites" or regional index (Moss and Pollard, 1993).

    The fluctuations of the regional or "all sites" trends, can be used
as a baseline for comparison with specific sites to assess the effects of
local management (Pollard and Yates, 1993).

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-10-16<br><pre>

Vinnikov, Groisman, and Lugina have compiled annual and monthly
surface air temperatures mainly from the "World Weather Records",
"Monthly Climatic Data for the World", and "Meteorological Data for
Individual Years over the Northern Hemisphere Excluding the USSR". The
published record was supplemented with information from different
national publications. After removal of station records believed to be
biased or inhomogeneous, 301 stations were used to determine mean
temperatures for the Northern Hemisphere and 265 stations were used
for the Southern Hemisphere. The temperature data are given as
deviations from a 1951-1975 spatially averaged monthly temperature
record for the period 1991-1993.

The citation for this dataset is:

the password. The data bases are arranged as subdirectories in
/pub/trends93/ (co2, ch4, trace, emiss, precip, and temp) that
correspond to major chapter headings in Trends '93. The data files are
arranged as xxxxx.yyy where xxxxx is the name of the station, country,
site, region, or principle investigator and yyy is the page number in
Trends '93 (example: vostok.009 refers to the Vostok ice core dataset
as tabulated on page 9.

An earlier release of the Vinnikov-Groisman-Lugina dataset is also
available on the Greenhouse Effect Detection Experiment (GEDEX) CD-ROM
available from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Distributed Active
Archive Center (DAAC). The GEDEX CD-ROM contains many other
climatological datasets.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1995-03-23<br><pre>
Product #001 consists of monthly mean global distributions of sea surface
height, surface wind speed, sea surface temperature, surface wind velocity and
near-surface current.  Data sets were produced by Halpern et al. (see
References) in a series of annual atlases for 1987 through 1993.  Not all data
sets are continuous throughout 1987-1993.  Durations of data sets are: GEOSAT
sea surface height, 1987-1988; TOPEX/POSEIDON sea surface height, 1993; SSMI
surface wind speed, 1987-1993; AVHRR/2 sea surface temperature,
1987-1993; ERS-1 surface wind velocity, 1992-1993; ARGOS buoy drift of
near-surface current, 1989-1992.  Very little averaging or
interpolation of the data was made in order to retain the sampling
characteristics of each data set.   All data are presented as
two-dimensional arrays with flags to indicate missing data and
land.  The typical size of a pixel is 1/3-degree latitude by 1/3-degree
longitude.  Data sets are available electronically via FTP from ftp
podaac.jpl.nasa.gov in the directory for Product #001.  Data are also available
on magnetic tape.  Size of Product #001 is approximately 45 MB.
Descriptions of all data sets and color images of all monthly mean
(and annual mean) global distributions of each data set are published
in a series of annual hard-copy atlases (see References). Atlases also
contain color images of the monthly sampling distribution associated
with each data set.  Seven atlases, one for each year from 1987-1993,
have been produced (see References); for information about the atlas
series, contact Dr. David Halpern (halpern@pacific.jpl.nasa.gov).

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-11-18<br><pre>
    The Environmental Change Network (ECN) is a multi-agency, long-term
monitoring programme for identifying and quantifying environmental changes
associated with man's activities.

    It aims to distinguish man-made changes from natural variations and
trends, and to give early warning of undesirable effects.

    ECN measurements are collected regularly at a growing number of network
sites (currently 10 terrestrial and 37 freshwater) throughout the UK,
using standardised protocols.

    The data cover a wide range of physical, chemical and biological
parameters, including climate, air quality and flow, soil development and
chemistry, invertebrates, vertebrates, vegetation, land use and site
management practice.

        Oracle and Arc-Info are used to handle the resulting temporal and
spatial database, incorporating meta-information on data specifications,
origins and quality.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-11-21<br><pre>

This dataset contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS)
level 3 geophysical parameters derived using the physical retrieval
method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data
Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at
NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori
data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the
TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution
Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave
Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting
Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional
temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to
profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to
derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature,
outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total
ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.

The Path A system steps through an interactive
forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a
2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to
generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These
global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring
within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These
retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements
(such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an
Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data
Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This
analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6
hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.

The retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the
iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine
(1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature
profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the
difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the
brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the
full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite
zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated
layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of
multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients
given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon
the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the
iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).

There are 6 level 3 data product files, each of which is in the HDF
format and each representative of a different averaging time
period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter
arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods
include daily, 5 day (pentad) and monthly, with the AM and PM portions
of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree
longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-11-15<br><pre>

The PO.DAAC MGDR (Merged Geophysical Data Record) contains  global coverage
data from the TOPEX/Poseidon mission. The  objective of the mission is to
determine ocean topography with a sea  surface height measurement precision of
3 cm and a geocentric  sealevel measurement accuracy of 13 cm. The data product
combines measurements from two altimeters, a NASA dual  frequency (Ku and C
band) instrument similar to the Geosat  altimeter and a French (CNES)
instrument which is a proof-of- concept solid-state altimeter (Ku band). The
MGDR product also  contains high precision orbit and environmental correction
data.

Each CD-ROM contains two ten day cycles of data, cross-over  files for each
cycle and read software for VAX and UNIX. The data  from both altimeters is in
a common format. CD-ROM  distribution began in October 1993. Additional CD-ROMs
are  being made available as the data is processed.

On the CD-ROM, each cycle is in its own subdirectory and contains  a single
ASCII header file which describes the cycle and up to 254 pass files.  A pass
is one half revolution and extends from lowest to  highest latitudes for
ascending passes and vice versa for descending passes.  Each cycle contains 254
passes, although certain passes may not be present because of maneuvers or data
dropouts.

Each data record on the CD-ROM contains the time-tagged, geolocated range and
altitude, instrument and environmental  correction and other instrument
measurements.  Sea surface  height is calculated by subtracting the range from
the satellite  altitude.  The sea surface height can then be corrected for
instrument and environmental effects by selecting and  adding the corrections
from the MGDR.  The environmental  corrections include wet (from both TMR
measurements and  weather models) and dry tropospheric path delay, ionospheric
 path delay and electromagnetic bias.  The altimeter also measures significant
wave height (SWH) to within 0.5 m  or 10% of SWH and the radar backscatter
coefficient to within  0.25dB precision, 1.0 dB absolute.  Estimates of the
windspeed  (based on radar backscatter), geoid, mean sea surface and  various
tides are also present. Brightness Temperatures at nadir from the TMR at 18,
21, 37 GHz are given.

The data are distributed on CD-ROMs (ISO-9660) and in an integer  format usable
on VAX, Unix, PC and Macintosh.  "C" language  source code is provided on the
CD-ROM for use with VAX or  UNIX.  To use the CD-ROM on a Macintosh, the latest
version of  the Apple CD-ROM driver (4.0.2) is required.  To use the CD-ROM  on
a PC, Microsoft CD-ROM extensions (MSCDEX.EXE) is  required.  In addition, the
source code distributed on the CD-ROM  may require some changes to compile and
run on a Macintosh or  PC. A "C" compiler is required.

One warning about the data is in order.  It is considered a research  data set
for two reasons.Firstly, the data consists entirely of files comprising headers
and data records which contain over a  hundred parameters for each second. It
is swath data and there are no images. Software to extract the parameters from
each  record is the responsibility of the investigators.

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it is considered to be  research data
because data analysis is still in its early stages.  The instrument
performance was shown to be very good during the  verification phase.  The
precision orbit accuracy is better than four  cm.  However, the use of the data
to examine ocean properties is  just beginning and there is, as yet, no
consensus on how to filter the  data.  Hence, a suite of parameters and flags
have been included to  allow the user make their own selection criteria.

MGDR Delivery Schedule:  Coverage began September, 1992.  However, as the first
Precise Orbit was not available until  April 1993, the first MGDR was produced
in late summer 1993.   By early '94, all data from September 1992 to August
1993 was  processed to MGDRs.  Since that time MGDRs are being produced  as
soon as all input data is available, about two months after real-time.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-05-16<br><pre>

The Pathfinder AVHRR Land data set is being produced through the cooperation
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in order to facilitate integrated
global studies.  A Land Science Working Group was chartered to provide
recommendations and guidance for generating this land data set.

This data set contains reflectance and brightness temperature derived from the
five-channel cross-track scanning Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR)  aboard the NOAA Polar Orbiter 'afternoon' satellites (NOAA-7, -9, and
-11), along  with derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), cloud
identifiers and  ancillary data.  The data set is produced from the NOAA Global
Area Coverage (GAC)  Level 1B data spanning a period of more than 14-years
(1981-1996).

To produce this data set, ascending GAC orbit data are unpacked and staged.
Ancillary data needed in processing are retrieved. These include ozone data
from Nimbus-7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), land surface elevation
from the Earth Topographic Five Minute Grid (ETOPO5) data set, land/sea mask,
and satellite ephemeris files. Each scan is navigated using an orbital model.
Based on the precise navigation, latitudes, longitudes, solar zenith, solar
azimuth, scan, and relative azimuth angles are determined for each pixel.
Calibration and atmospheric corrections are applied, and counts are converted
to radiances which are used to derive reflectance and brightness temperatures.
Cloud flags are calculated and appended and the NDVI is calculated from the
surface reflectances. The data is then resampled to 8 km x 8 km pixels in the
output product and all ocean data are masked out.  Once ten days of daily data
are processed, they are composited by choosing values for each bin based on
the day that has the highest NDVI value.  Only those pixels within 42 degrees
of nadir are used in the composite.  Daily and 10-day global products and
their associated metadata are quality controlled prior to archiving at the
Goddard DAAC.

Data are available as daily images, and 10-day composites.  Both daily and
composite images have twelve layers of information, namely, NDVI, CLAVR cloud
flags, Quality check flags, scan angle, solar zenith angle, relative azimuth
angle, channel-1 and -2 reflectances, and channel-3, -4, -5 brightness
temperatures.  The data are mapped to the Goode's Interrupted Homolosine
projection.  Each image is stored in HDF as scientific data set (essentially
BSQ with gain and offset annotation).  The image dimension is 5004 pixels by
2168 lines, and each image is approximately 228 Megabytes (approximately 30
MB compressed). A separate ancillary HDF file of approximately 55 Megabytes,
includes the latitude, longitude, elevation, and land/sea mask.  Distribution
is mainly by FTP which is set up once data has been ordered, and on 4-mm and
8-mm tapes for large orders.

Information about the AVHRR Pathfinder can also be found on the AVHRR
Pathfinder Home Page on the World Wide Web (WWW) at

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-10-30<br><pre>

NSCAT, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
Scatterometer, is a specialized microwave radar that measures the speed and
direction of winds over the global ocean surface. The primary mission of
NSCAT is to acquire all-weather, high-resolution measurements of near
surface winds over the global oceans. The data product is known as the
NSCAT Science Product (NSP) and it consists of Level 1.7, Level 2.0 and
Level 3.0 products, providing collocated ocean sigma-0 data, vector wind
data, and averaged global wind maps, respectively.

The Level 1.7 data product consists of ocean-only, backscatter (sigma-0)
measurements, grouped by geographic location into wind vector cells (WVC).
Each data record is a cross-track row of WVC's. Included with the sigma-0
measurements are ancillary geometric and beam membership information needed
to process the data into vector winds.

The Level 2 data product consists of ocean wind vector solutions, derived
from sigma-0 measurements grouped by geographic location into WVC1s. Each
data record is a cross-track row of WVC's.

The Level 3 data are a set of global averaged maps of wind vector
solutions, various secondary variables and statistical descriptors. The
averaging interval is one day, spanning complete revs beginning and ending
nearest to 0h UTC and 24h UTC, respectively. Each level 3 map contains one
averaged parameter.

The NSP is the (JPL Propulsion Laboratory) JPL product 066 and it will be
available via tape. Level 3 data may be made available via FTP. NSCAT was
launched on ADEOS on 16 August 1996 and at time of writing (September 1996)
the data is being validated. It is anticipated that data will be available
to the general science community in spring 1997. More detail about the
product can be found in the on-line Guide document;

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1994-11-15<br><pre>

The data product SMMR, GOES-W VISSR Tropical Pacific surface thermal forcing
parameters (Liu) is comprised of oceanographic data.  The product consists of
surface latent heat flux, surface solar irradiance and net heat flux for January
1980 to September 1983.  The data are provided for the tropical Pacific Ocean,
i.e. the Pacific Ocean that lies between 20 degrees South and 20 degrees North.
The data are monthly averaged and the spatial resolution is 2 degrees by 2
degrees. Latent heat flux fields are derived from Nimbus-7 SMMR data and the
insolation fields are derived from the visible radiance measurements from the
GOES-W VISSR (Visible/Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer). The data product consists
of 45 monthly files for each of the 3 parameters for January 1980 - September
1983. Latent heat flux for October 1983 is also available. The data were
produced by T. Liu and C. Gauthier (Jet Propulsion Laboratory). The data is
available on magnetic tape or via FTP upon request.

</pre>
<hr>
<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-12-30<br><pre>

The Data Assimilation Office (DAO) at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight
Center produced a multi-year gridded global atmospheric data set for
use in climate research, including tropospheric chemistry
applications.  The data, which are being made available to the
scientific community, are well-suited for climate research since they
are produced by a fixed assimilation system designed to minimize the
spin-up in the hydrological cycle.  By using a nonvarying system, the
variability due to algorithm change is eliminated, and geophysical
variability can be more confidently isolated.

The analysis incorporates rawinsonde reports, satellite retrievals of
geopotential thickness, cloud-motion winds, and aircraft, ship and
rocketsonde reports.  At the lower boundary, the assimilating
atmospheric general circulation model is constrained by the observed
sea surface temperature, and soil moisture derived from observed
surface air temperature and precipitation fields.  The available
output data include all prognostic variables and a large number of
diagnostic quantities such as heating rates, precipitation, surface
fluxes, cloud fraction and the height of the planetary boundary
layer. These variables were chosen to assure a complete budget of the
energy and moisture cycles.  The assimilated data should also be
useful for estimating transport by cumulus processes.  The estimated
analysis errors for the height field are provided to help the user
assess the quality of the data.  All quantities are made available
every 6 hours at the full resolution of the assimilating general
circulation model. Selected surface quantities are made available
every 3 hours.

Parameters are stored on global grids (2.0 deg latitude x 2.5 degs
longitude) for the surface and at 18 pressure levels within the
atmosphere.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-10-30<br><pre>

NSCAT, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
Scatterometer, is a specialized microwave radar that measures the speed and
direction of winds over the global ocean surface. The primary mission of
NSCAT is to acquire all-weather, high-resolution measurements of near
surface winds over the global oceans. The data product is known as the
NSCAT Science Product (NSP) and it consists of Level 1.7, Level 2.0 and
Level 3.0 products, providing collocated ocean sigma-0 data, vector wind
data, and averaged global wind maps, respectively.

The Level 1.7 data product consists of ocean-only, backscatter (sigma-0)
measurements, grouped by geographic location into wind vector cells (WVC).
Each data record is a cross-track row of WVC's. Included with the sigma-0
measurements are ancillary geometric and beam membership information needed
to process the data into vector winds.

The Level 2 data product consists of ocean wind vector solutions, derived
from sigma-0 measurements grouped by geographic location into WVC1s. Each
data record is a cross-track row of WVC's.

The Level 3 data are a set of global averaged maps of wind vector
solutions, various secondary variables and statistical descriptors. The
averaging interval is one day, spanning complete revs beginning and ending
nearest to 0h UTC and 24h UTC, respectively. Each level 3 map contains one
averaged parameter.

The NSP is the (JPL Propulsion Laboratory) JPL product 066 and it will be
available via tape. Level 3 data may be made available via FTP. NSCAT was
launched on ADEOS on 16 August 1996 and at time of writing (September 1996)
the data is being validated. It is anticipated that data will be available
to the general science community in spring 1997. More detail about the
product can be found in the on-line Guide document;
(<A HREF=http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov:2031/DATASET_DOCS/nscat_nsp.html>http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov:2031/DATASET_DOCS/nscat_nsp.html</A>).

Information about NSCAT can be obtained from the NSCAT homepage

<H2>Summary</H2>
Last Updated:  1996-05-16<br><pre>

     The USGS HYDRO-CLIMATIC DATA NETWORK (HCDN) STREAMFLOW DATA SET
     is specifically suitable for the study of surface-water conditions
     throughout the United States under fluctuations in the prevailing
     climatic conditions.  This data-set is available on CD-ROM.  The
     same data is available via FTP.  FTP to 'srv1rvares.er.usgs.gov'
     Login anonymous and use your email address as password.  Go to
     directory '/hcdn92'.  Information about the data set is also
     available on the World-Wide Web at:
     <A HREF=http://wwwrvares.er.usgs.gov/hcdn_report/content.html>http://wwwrvares.er.usgs.gov/hcdn_report/content.html</A>.


     This data set, called the Hydro-Climatic Data
     Network, or HCDN, consists of streamflow records for 1,659 sites
     throughout United States and its Territories.  The potential consequences
     of climate change to continental water resources are of great concern
     in the management of those resources.  Critically important to society
     is what effect fluctuations in the prevailing climate may have on
     hydrologic conditions, such as the occurrence and magnitude of floods or
     droughts and the seasonal distribution of water supplies within a region.
     Records of streamflow that are unaffected by artificial diversions,
     storage, or other works of man in or on the natural stream channels or in
     the watershed can provide an account of hydrologic responses to
     fluctuations in climate.  By examining such records given known past
     meteorologic conditions, we can better understand hydrologic responses to
     those conditions and anticipate the effects of postulated changes in
     current climate regimes. Furthermore, patterns in streamflow records can
     indicate when a change in the prevailing climate regime may have occurred
     in the past, even in the absence of concurrent meteorologic records.

     DEVELOPMENT OF THE HCDN DATA SET:  Records for the HCDN were obtained
     through a comprehensive search of the extensive surface-water data
     holdings of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), which are contained in the
     USGS National Water Storage and Retrieval System (WATSTORE).  All
     streamflow discharge records in WATSTORE through September 30, 1988, were
     examined for inclusion in the HCDN in accordance with strictly defined
     criteria of measurement accuracy and natural conditions.  In addition to
     the daily mean discharge values, complete station identification
     information and basin characteristics were retrieved from WATSTORE for
     inclusion in the HCDN. Statistical characteristics, including the monthly
     mean discharge, as well as the annual mean, minimum and maximum discharge
     values, were derived for the records in the HCDN data set.

     CONTENTS OF THE HCDN DATA SET:  The HCDN includes data values for
     discharge measured at 1,659 streamflow gaging stations. Records
     cumulatively span the period 1874 through 1988, inclusive, and represent a
     total of 73,231 water years of information.  Information necessary for the
     identification of each station in the HCDN, along with any qualifying
     comments about the available record for the site, and descriptive basin
     characteristics, are provided on this CD-ROM.

     THE HCDN DATABASE contains both the streamflow data and information
     identifying and describing each station in the HCDN. The following
     are among the Parameters available for each station in the data base :
        drainage basin
        hydrologic region
        area of the drainage basin
        elevation of the gaging station
        Main channel slope
        Stream length
        Mean basin elevation
        Area of lakes, ponds, and swamps in percent of contributing drainage
                                                                    area
        Area of lakes and ponds, in percent of contributing drainage area
        Forested area, in percent of contributing drainage area
        Area of glaciers, in percent of contributing drainage area
        Soil index, in inches, a relative measure of potential infiltration
        Mean annual precipitation
        24-hour rainfall
        Mean minimum January temperature

     The HCDN CD-ROM has been produced in accordance with the ISO 9660 CD-ROM
     Standard and is therefore capable of being read on any computer that has
     appropriate CD-ROM driver software installed.  The data exist in four
     distinct forms on the CD-ROM.  One of these forms (ASCII) is readable on
     non-IBM compatible personal computers.  One form (binary) is readable on
     computers observing the IEEE floating point standard.  The other two
     forms require access software (GSSEARCH and HCDR) which currently can be
     executed only under DOS on IBM-compatible personal computers.

     Information concerning the HCDN data set is available from the Project
     Chief, Regional Hydrologic Processes Project, U.S. Geological Survey,
     431 National Center, Reston, VA 22092.

     Information concerning hydrologic data for a particular State should
     be directed to the District Chief, Water Resources Division, U.S.
     Geological Survey, for that State.  To obtain a contact and phone number
     for the particular State, please call 703-648-6815 at the U.S. Geological
     Survey, National Center, Reston, VA.

This world-wide web site is for the Mid-Atlantic region of the Sea Grant College Program.  The region geographically encompasses the coastal and near-coastal waters between New Jersey and North Carolina.  Within this region, the five Sea Grant Colleges actively promote and foster regional research and cooperation.
<P>
Sea Grant is a unique partnership between the nation's universities and its primary ocean agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<A HREF="http://www.noaa.gov">NOAA</A>) in the Department of Commerce.  This partnership has created a national network of researchers and educators focused on promoting better understanding and more informed use of our coastal, ocean and Great Lakes resources.

<H3>STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUND (SRF) WORKSHOPS</H3>

Beginning in March, the University of Maryland Environmental Finance Center (EFC), supported by the USEPA, will be conducting a series of two-day interactive workshops  (<A HREF="SRF/index.html">Workshop Registration Page</A>)  for state environmental professionals on ways in which to prioritize and fund watershed-based water quality projects using the State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF). Topics covered include:
<UL>
<LI>SRF Funding Framework which suggests ways to prioritize water-quality projects for SRF funding
<LI>Watershed-based solutions to water quality problems that can use the SRF
<LI>How the SRF works and can work for you
</UL>

<A NAME="STRUCT"></A>
<H3>STRUCTURE AND PURPOSE</H3>
With support from the US Environmental Protection Agency  (<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov">EPA</A>), the Environmental Finance Center located at <A HREF="../index.html">Maryland Sea Grant College</A>, University of Maryland (<A HREF="http://www.umd.edu">UMS</A>)was created to assist local communities in finding creative ways to pay for environmental projects. The Center promotes alternative and innovative ways to manage the cost of environmental activities, provides training and development opportunities in environmental management, and works to increase the public and private sector's awareness of the benefits associated with sound environmental management policies.
<P>
The Environmental Finance Center is part of the Coastal and Environmental Policy Program  (<A HREF="../CEPP/index.html">CEPP</A>) at the University of Maryland. CEPP is a non-degree granting program composed of the School of Law, the School of Public Affairs, the College of Agriculture, the Sea Grant Program and the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies. This multi-disciplinary design provides an integrative and collaborative approach to the Environmental Finance Center's mission.
<P>
The Center promotes a comprehensive and integrative look at environmental finance from a .strategic management perspective that suggests that sound environmental practices encompass a broad spectrum of activities. Activities .such as needs assessments, issue prioritization, identification of relevant environmental regulations and compliance issues, development of capital facilities plans, identification of revenue sources, and community participation, are precursors to securing financing that form part of the Environmental Finance Center's "holistic" approach.
<P>
In addition, the Center also serves as repository and clearinghouse for environmental finance-related information, including information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Environmental Financial Advisory Board (EFAB), and the Environmental Financing Information Network (EFIN), as well as other Environmental Finance Centers across the nation.
<P>

<HR>
<A NAME="PROJ"></A>
<H3>PROJECTS AND OPERATIONS</H3>
As part of its efforts to provide technical assistance and to address concerns on environmental finance issues, the Center carries out four major interrelated initiatives:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Technical assistance and support to enhance the capacity of state and local governments to meet and successfully implement environmental goals and regulations.
<LI>Training and curriculum development opportunities through established educational and environmental programs for students, mid-career executives, and senior executive professionals.
<LI>Public information and outreach designed to increase awareness of sound environmental planning and implementation practices; and
<LI> Information sharing and materials development as a repository and clearinghouse of innovative environmental finance-related information.
</UL>
<P>
Return to the <A HREF="#TOP">top of the page</A>.
<HR>
<A NAME="TECH"></A>
<H3>TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT</H3>
The Center conducts charrettes (intensive workshops) with local governments to discover what is needed to pay for environmental services. From these charrettes, a series of one-page summaries of the issues facing each community and the suggested recommendations have been developed. Case studies based on these charrettes constitute part of the core curriculum for environmental finance courses offered through the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs.<P>
The Center staffed and served as consultant to the <A HREF="BlueRibbon.html">State of Maryland's Governor's Blue Ribbon Panel</A> on funding the Chesapeake Bay Tributary Strategy. The Tributary Strategy plan is a multi-state, coordinated watershed-by-watershed approach to increase restoration of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The Center  researched alternative funding .strategies, and assisted in synthesizing and communicating the results of the special panel , in a report entitled Financing Alternatives for Marylands Tributary Strategies..
<P>
The Environmental Finance Center was part of a very successful interactive teleconference on environmental finance on September 13-14, 1995, which was broadcast from the University of Maryland to several locations nationwide using state-of-the-art interactive software.  This conference was a cooperative effort between the Environmental Finance Center, the Coastal and Environmental Policy Program and the School of Public Affiars at the University of Maryland with the Environmental Finance Center at the University of New Mexico and the Municipal Technical Advisory Service at the University of Tennessee.
<P>
In addition, the Center serves as a forum and facilitator to involve all appropriate parties in efforts to more efficiently and effectively explore, define, and develop alternative environmental finance opportunities and resources.

<A NAME="CURRIC"></A>
<H3>CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING</H3>
As part of the Center's collaborative efforts, a partnership has been formed with the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs. With the help of the Environmental Finance Center, a joint concentration in Public Sector Financial Management and Environmental Policy has been established to prepare future professionals for emerging environmental finance issues.  Courses on environmental finance have bben developed and offered to both graduate students and mid-career environmental professionals.<P>

<HR>
<A NAME="REPOSIT"></A>
<H3>INFORMATION/REPOSITORY ACTIVITIES</H3>
Drawing on its broad base of expertise, the Center is able to provide practical, proven, and innovative information that covers many areas of concern in the emerging field of environmental finance.<P>
As a repository and clearinghouse, the Center is an information resource for other institutions and environmental finance centers throughout the nation. The information and experience acquired through the Center's various efforts serves as an invaluable resource for assisting communities as they address environmental finance issues.

<H1>Maryland Governor's<BR>Blue Ribbon Panel</H1>

<H2>Financing Alternatives for Maryland's Tributary Strategies:  Innovative Financing Ideas for Restoring the Chesapeake Bay</H2>
</CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<I>The improvement and maintenance of water quality are the single most critical elements in the overall restoration and protection of the Chesapeake Bay.  Water is the medium in which all living resources of the Bay live, and their ability to survive and flourish is directly dependent on it.</I>
</FONT>
<P>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

In Maryland, about $200 million is spent each year from federal, state local and private sources to protect and restore water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. Estimates from the Tributary Strategies effort indicate that we will need an additional $60 million, on an annualized basis, to put in place all of the nutrient reduction activities needed to meet the 40% reduction goal. <P>

How to bridge $60 million gap equitably was the reason, in June of 1994, that Governor William Donald Schaefer appointed a Blue Ribbon Panel on Financing Alternatives for Maryland's Tributary Strategies.  Chaired by Eileen Rehrmann, County Executive of Harford County, the Panel was comprised of 25 representatives from the agricultural, banking, business, environmental and finance communities, and state and local governments. <P>

The Panel was asked to identify a menu of innovative and equitable financing ideas that would help fill the gap between current spending on Bay restoration activities and full realization of the 40% goal. Basic to the Panel's considerations was the issue of fairness and the need to assure that the burden of costs is distributed appropriately among those who pollute as well as those who enjoy and benefit from the Bay and its tributaries. <P>

This group debated a range of new and alternative methods for financing nutrient reduction activities and developed a menu of recommended options. The four major categories of the Strategies for which funding options were developed were:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Wastewater Treatment (biological and chemical nutrient removal)
<LI>Developed Land (e.g., storm water management; erosion and sediment control; septic systems management)
<LI>Agricultural Land (e.g., soil conservation and water quality planning;  fertilizer, organic waste and animal waste management;  conservation tillage)

<B>The Eastern Oyster: <I>Crassostrea virginica</I></B><BR>
<DD>Victor S. Kennedy, Roger I.E. Newell, and Albert F. Eble, editors<BR>
772 pages, hard cover, 8-1/2" x 11", 400 photographs, drawings and diagrams. 
<BR>
UM-SG-TS-96-01.  ISBN 0-943-676-61-4.  $95.00 + $3.50 shipping and handling
<P>
<B>The Eastern Oyster</B> is the most comprehensive synthesis about the biology of <I>Crassotrea virginica</I> since Paul Galtsoff published his landmark work, <B>The American Oyster</B>, in 1964. <B>The Eastern Oyster</B> extends Galtsoff's findings and adds considerably to details on such topics as anatomy, shell structure, and predators and pests. Its major thrust, however, is holistic, reflecting current approaches to biological processes and covering topics that could not have been studied in such detail thirty years ago.  Thus, there are intensive treatments of recent work in the physiology of feeding, population genetics, reproduction and larval biology, pollution and environmental effects, and diseases and mechanisms of defense. Concluding with discussions of the eastern oyster as a valuable ecological and commercial resource, several chapters address public management issues, aquaculture, and the effects of transferring oysters among ecosystems.

<B>Restoring the Nation's Marine Environment</B><BR>
<DD>Gordon W. Thayer, editor, 728 pp. UM-SG-TS-92-06.  $45.00 (cloth)
<P>
This book's thirteen chapters discuss in detail a wide variety of restoration projects, including: tidal marshes in North Carolina, mangrove systems in Puerto Rico, seagrass meadows in Australia, disused urban docks in inner city Liverpool, kelp forests in California, stream habitats affected by logging activities in North America, coral reefs in the Pacific and rocky shore communities in Cornwall degraded by an oil spill.  Written by a group of international experts assembled in Washington, D.C. for symposia and workshops on coastal habitat restoration, this book provides valuable information to those interested in the subject of restoring environmentally sensitive habitats.

<B>Dispersal of Living Organisms into Aquatic Ecosystems</B><BR>
<DD>Aaron Rosenfield and Roger Mann, editors, 496 pp. UM-SG-TS-92-04.  $35.00 (cloth)
<P>
The transfer and introduction by human beings of living organisms into aquatic ecosystems has a history that begins before Biblical times.  Whether inadvertant microorganisms or planned introductions of plants, shellfish and fish, such movements have been at times beneficial and at other times detrimental.  With an increase in aquaculture and the use of genetically engineered microorganisms has come a critical need to predict their ecological implications.  This book examines a number of case studies of translocating aquatic plant and animal species and focuses on the issues that scientists, entrepreneurs, and habitat and resource managers must take into account.  The 27 papers included in the book cover a a wide variety of species and are grouped in two sections:  Risks and Impacts and Risk Reduction and Safety. These studies should help those in research, business and management as they struggle with the issue of exotic species introductions.

<B>Oxygen Dynamics in the Chesapeake Bay</B><BR>
<DD>David E. Smith, Merrill Leffler and Gail Mackiernan, editors, 242 pp. UM-SG-TS-92-01.  $24.95 (cloth)
<P>
Scientists have known for some time that low levels of dissolved oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay have been increasing in recent years, pos-sibly as a result of human-induced changes in the ecosystem.  They have, however lacked a detailed understanding of the processes regulating dissolved oxygen levels in the Bay.  Maryland and Virginia's Sea Grant programs undertook a five-year, integrated research program -- funded by support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- aimed at defining these important processes.  This book synthesizes the results of this research, and includes sections on the influences of circulation, water column and microbial processes and benthic-pelagic interactions on oxygen dynamics in the Bay.

<B>Working the Chesapeake:  Watermen on the Bay</B><BR>
<DD>Mark E. Jacoby with illustrations by Neil Harpe, 156 pp. UM-SG-BK-91-01.  $14.95 (soft cover)
<P>
For generations, the waters of the Chesapeake Bay have provided a home for independent fishermen.  Called watermen, they often work alone or in small groups, spending hours, days and years on the open water.  To learn firsthand about the lives of Chesapeake watermen, Mark Jacoby went out with them in all seasons and weathers.  Though his initial purpose was to detail commercial fishing methods in the Chesapeake, he ultimately shows us much more:  the look of the water at dawn in a rising northeast wind, the sound of a waterman's voice cast in accents from our Colonial past.  While chronicling thirteen ways of fishing for the Bay's species -- oysters, crabs, finfish, soft and hard clams -- Jacoby gives us brief, impressionistic glimpses of what may be a disappearing world.
