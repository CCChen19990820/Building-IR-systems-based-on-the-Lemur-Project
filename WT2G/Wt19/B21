<B>Settlement Reached on <BR>
Behalf of VCU Professors</B>
<P>
CIR represented six male professors who sued Virginia Commonwealth
University for sex discrimination arising from a 1992 &quot;women-only&quot;
pay raise. After the trial judge granted VCU summary judgment
on the basis of a regression analysis that purported to show a
pay imbalance between the sexes, the full Fourth Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed. The <I>en banc</I> court said that a question
existed as to whether the regression analysis actually established
a pay imbalance and remanded the case for trial.
<P>
The day before the September 23 trial date, the parties negotiated
a settlement. VCU promised not to adjust pay in the future without
considering merit, but demanded that the financial details of
the settlement remain confidential. The professors stated that
they were very satisfied with the terms of the settlement.
<P>
<B>CIR Represents Class Objecting <BR>
to Proposed Settlement</B>
<P>
In September, a class of non-black Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms (BATF) agents moved to intervene in <I>Stewart v.
Rubin</I>. The initial case was filed as a class action lawsuit
in 1990 on behalf of all African-American Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms agents. The plaintiffs charged the BATF's Office
of Criminal Enforcement with discrimination against African-American
agents in its hiring and promotion practices. The parties reached
a proposed settlement that received the preliminary approval of
District Court Judge Royce Lamberth on July 9, 1996.
<P>
Under the proposed settlement, the class of African-American agents
will receive a multi-million dollar cash settlement. Further,
African-American agents will be eligible for promotion pursuant
to an informal procedure that will be distinctly different from,
and far less rigorous, than that applicable to all other agents.
<P>
CIR, on behalf of non-black BATF agents, is challenging the race-conscience
relief provided for in the proposed settlement on the ground that
it is unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment. Specifically,
there is  no evidence of present effects of past discrimination
and the remedy is not narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government
interest.

<B>Due Process Due Private Contractors</B>
<P>
The United States Supreme Court has been asked to hear a due process
case, in which the Department of Defense (DOD) arbitrarily canceled
a lucrative contract for default, without holding a hearing mandated
by federal law.
<P>
In <I>DCX v. William J. Perry, Secretary of Defense</I>, a defense
contractor was hired to manufacture lighting equipment for the
government, and had hired a subcontractor (the only subcontractor
with the necessary technology) to test the equipment. However,
the government intervened in the testing schedule and forced the
subcontractor to test other systems with a higher priority. The
delay resulted in DCX being in default on contract. DOD then abruptly
canceled the contract.
<P>
In taking that action, DOD did not follow its own regulations
requiring it to assess the circumstances and determine whether
the default was excusable. Under the government's own regulations,
the assessment must be made prior to terminating a contract. DCX
sued, alleging that by not applying the regulations, DOD violated
DCX's due process rights. Had a hearing been held, DCX would have
shown: 1) the government was responsible for the delay; 2) DCX
would still be able to meet the contract delivery date; and 3)
termination of the contract would bankrupt several small businesses
that subcontracted with DCX. The federal trial and appellate courts
held for the government, and DCX has now petitioned the Supreme
Court to review the case.
<P>
In its <I>amicus curiae</I>, Defenders urged the Court to review
the case on the ground that under the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment, government must act fairly when it deprives a
person of property, which in this case consists of contract rights.
<P>
<B>State Corners Market By Infringing Private Property Rights</B>
<P>
Defenders is co-counsel to Mr. Taylor who owns property surrounded
by the Cass Scenic Railroad in Pocahontas County, West Virginia.
Mr. Taylor decided to build a restaurant and souvenir shop to
service the hundreds of tourists to the Railroad. At present,
the only concession stand in the park is operated by the state.
Fearful of the competition from Mr. Taylor's proposed shop, the
state decided to simply block the only access to the property
across the state land. On the day construction was to begin, the
state locked the gate to the public access road, and has refused
to allow Mr. Taylor entry onto <I>his own property</I>. Since
then, the state has proceeded to take any action it desires on
the property without the consent of the owner, including removing
trees and altering its elevation.
<P>
Defenders plans to file a lawsuit in federal district court in
West Virginia, alleging the state: 1) unconstitutionally deprived
Mr. Taylor of his right to use and enjoy his private property
in violation of the United States and West Virginia constitutions;
2) tortuously interfered with Mr. Taylor's economic advantage
by preventing him from establishing his business; and 3) unlawfully
trespassed on private property.

<B>Report on School Choice Cases</B>
<P>
Ohio - The parties are briefing the case in the Court of Appeals.
The IJ brief is due on October 29th. Jeanne Allen of the Center
for Education Reform has agreed to coordinate an <I>amicus</I>
brief on behalf of pro-school choice groups. IJ expects oral argument
later this fall, and a decision most likely in the spring.
<P>
Milwaukee - IJ is briefing the non-religion state constitutional
issues in trial court, with a resolution expected later this fall.
 The court granted the NAACP's motion to consolidate its lawsuit,
which it filed in August, with the ongoing cases. The NAACP repeats
the same allegations, but adds a racial segregation claim. The
court will hold that issue until resolution of the current issues,
and we expect appeals to follow the next ruling rather than awaiting
resolution of the segregation claims.  The IJ's goal is to move
the litigation along swiftly, winning on as many issues as possible
at this level.  So far, the NAACP's efforts to derail the case
have not succeeded.
<P>
Vermont - As expected, the ACLU joined the lawsuit challenging
Chittenden's decision to pay tuition at religious schools. At
a status conference on October 1, the trial judge ordered the
state not to withhold education aid from Chittenden, and directed
Chittenden not to pay religious school tuition pending a ruling
on its merits. The court directed the parties to stipulate the
facts, and indicated it would expedite the case and render a decision
later this fall. That means the case should be in the Vermont
Supreme Court this winter, and possibly in the U.S. Supreme Court
as early as next year.

<P>
<B>NELF Enters Declaratory Jurisdiction Dispute</B>
<P>
NELF has entered a case which threatens to undercut the usefulness
of the federal declaratory judgment law. A declaratory judgment
is a method of obtaining judicial determination of rights and
wrongs before a matter has reached the stage of ordinary litigation.
Businesses often use this procedure to eliminate uncertainty.
<P>
The case involves a looming patent dispute between EMC Corporation
and Norand Company. Norand sent EMC a letter claiming EMC was
infringing its patents and suggesting EMC pay it millions in licensing
fees. Negotiations broke down and EMC filed suit in Boston seeking
a declaratory judgment that there was no infringement. A district
court judge found that the dispute was not sufficiently ripe to
confer jurisdiction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, which hears patent-related appeals, affirmed, but on
different grounds. It found jurisdiction but held that trial judges
have almost total discretion to decide whether to hear declaratory
actions, even when statutory jurisdiction is conceded.
<P>
NELF filed an <I>amicus</I> brief in its own name supporting rehearing
which argued that declaratory actions are a valuable way to remove
uncertainty. By giving judges broad discretion not to hear such
cases, the court undercut that process and may have introduced
subjectivity into the judicial process. Judges can now avoid types
of cases they do not want to hear and, may choose to hear cases
which interest them and for which they may have preconceived views.
This conflicts with the ideal of a neutral, objective judiciary.
While rehearing has been denied, NELF is supporting EMC in seeking
review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>
<B>NELF Files Brief in Connecticut <BR>
Property Tax Case</B>
<P>
On behalf of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association,
NELF has filed a brief in a test of whether that state's courts
will continue independent reviews of appeals from local tax authorities.
The case involves Hartford's taxation of copiers owned by Xerox
Company. The assessor used &quot;book&quot; value as the basis
for taxing the copiers, rejecting Xerox's evidence as to their
true market value, the statutory basis for local taxation. A Superior
Court judge affirmed the city's decision.
<P>
NELF's <I>amicus</I> brief to the Connecticut Supreme Court argued
that the judge erred by looking only to whether the assessor's
decision was &quot;reasonable.&quot; NELF argued that, because
of the inherent conflict between assessors' duties to apply the
law and to maximize tax revenues, courts can and must independently
determine all necessary issues including determinations of value.
Ceding that power to assessors could leave taxpayers vulnerable
to arbitrary and even malicious misassessments.
<P>
<B>NELF Defeats Effort to Tax Non-Profit <BR>
Legal Groups</B>
<P>
In a case with ramifications for all non-profit firms, NELF has
defeated the City of Boston's effort to levy taxes upon NELF's
Boston office. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled
that Boston violated state law when it denied NELF the tax exemption
statutorily allowed to all non-profit organizations.
<P>
The case began in 1991 when Boston reject NELF's first application
for exemption for its Boston office. Possibly referring to NELF's
successful challenge to a Boston ordinance, a city bureaucrat
sneered that the city would not &quot;feed the hand that bites
it.&quot; NELF appealed to the Appellate Tax Board and eventually
went to Superior Court. The city's position throughout was that
NELF was &quot;too political.&quot; While conceding that NELF
is non-partisan and completely avoids electoral politics and lobbying,
the city claimed NELF's work in the courts was an impermissible
effort to &quot;change the law.&quot; Eventually other property-owning
legal foundations headquartered in Boston were caught up in the
dispute when NELF's attorneys pointed out the hypocrisy of taxing
NELF while exempting groups with different missions.
<P>
The Court's decision resolves this matter. It stresses NELF's
essentially conservative role. Courts apply law, they do not make
it. By pursuing cases, NELF is not seeking to make new law; it
is trying to uphold the law as it already stands. The Court also
rejected Boston's claim that NELF serves too small a fraction
of the community to be entitled to exemption. It held that NELF's
legal work benefits the public as a whole and so NELF meets the
statutory test for a charitable organization.
<P>
By rebuffing Boston here, NELF not only protected its own interest
but also set a precedent that will limit future government attempts
to extract revenue from non-profits or to coerce them into tailoring
their missions to fit government's wishes.
<P>
<B>NELF Files Brief for Realtors in <BR>
Large Lot Zoning Case</B>
<P>
On behalf of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, NELF filed
an <I>amicus</I> brief with Massachusetts' highest court, urging
adoption of guidelines on how to review local zoning rules which
impose large minimum lot sizes. The case comes from Martha's Vineyard
where the town of Edgartown bars new housing on lots smaller than
three acres, substantially reducing the supply of affordable new
housing and imposing significant limitations on landowners' rights
to use their property. NELF's brief argued that the court should
require lower courts to give special scrutiny to large lot zoning
because of its negative impact on migration into the town and
because of its devastating effect on owners of lots under minimum
size.

<B>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><HR>

<P>
<B>Texas IOLTA Program Derailed</B>
<P>
The Washington Legal Foundation scored a major victory when the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit unanimously ruled
on September 12, 1996 that Texas' Interest On Lawyer's Trust Accounts
(IOLTA) program is subject to First Amendment and Fifth Amendment
takings challenges. In <I>Washington Legal Foundation v. Texas
Equal Access to Justice Foundation</I>, the court of appeals took
bar authorities to task for arguing that the interest generated
on clients' funds that are pooled before the funds are disbursed
to them is not the property of the clients. Comparing this fund
raising scheme to alchemy, the court ruled that interest always
follow the principal regardless of the amount generated. IOLTA
programs generate approximately $150 million<B> </B>annually nationwide,
which is used to supplement Legal Services Corporation funding
for activist groups. Texas bar authorities, along the American
Bar Association and other groups, are expected to seek Supreme
Court review of this precedent-setting decision, which conflicts
with a First Circuit decision also litigated by WLF.
<P>
<B>Superfund Law Challenged</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit in <I>U.S. v. Olin Corporation</I> seeking to uphold a
lower court decision that ruled that the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), or Superfund
law, does not apply to discharges of hazardous wastes that occurred
before the law went into effect, and that if it did, the law as
applied would violate the Commerce Clause because there was no
showing how the inactive site affects interstate commerce. WLF's
clients in the case include U.S. Senators Bob Smith, Lauch Faircloth,
Larry Pressler, Alan Simpson and Representatives Michael Oxley,
Bob Livingston, Joe Barton, Sonny Callahan, Jack Fields, Jimmy
Hayes, John Hostettler, Enid Greene, and Bill Goodling.
<P>
<B>Junk Science Challenged in the Courtroom</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the Supreme Court of Nevada in <I>Mahlum
v. Dow Chemical Co.</I>, arguing that Dow Chemical should not
be held liable for alleged injuries caused by silicone breast
implants made by Dow-Corning, a separate legal entity. WLF argues
that not only is there no credible evidence showing that the silicone
implants caused any harm, but that in any event, Dow Chemical,
which had nothing to do with the manufacturing or testing of the
silicone, should not be held liable because of a lack of legal
causation between the injuries and Dow Chemical. Rather, the plaintiff's
attorneys were simply trying to obtain money from Dow Chemical
because Dow Corning had filed for bankruptcy under the crush of
implant lawsuits.
<P>
<B>Sex Offender Law Defended</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Kansas v. Hendrick</I>
seeking to uphold state laws that impose preventive detention
on dangerous sex offenders after they complete their original
sentences. WLF filed its brief on behalf of Kansas state legislators,
asz well as Kansas's entire House of Representatives delegation
-U.S. Representatives Sam Brownback, Jan Meyers, Pat Roberts,
and Todd Tiahrt, as well as .

<B>Young America's Publishes Briefs on Social Security and Financial
Aid, and 3rd Edition of <I>The Myth of the Robber Barons</I></B>
<P>
The latest two issue briefs from the Young America's Foundation
provide information on the issues of social security privatization
and reform of the student financial aid system, two issues important
to college-aged students. These two briefs will provide information
that will allow conservative students to challenge liberal professors,
fellow classmates, and slanted editorials on the two subjects.
 
<P>
YAF has also published the 3rd Edition of <I>The Myth of the Robber
Barons,</I> by Burt Folsom, Visiting Fellow at the Mackinac Center.
First published in 1987, the book was widely praised and is now
assigned in scores of colleges and universities throughout the
United States. The book challenges the liberal interpretation
of the rise of big business that is found in many textbooks on
American history.

<B>Grove City College Rejects Department of Education Demands</B>
<P>
Grove City College in western Pennsylvania has announced that
it will end its participation in the Federal Stafford and Federal
PLUS loan programs at the end of the current academic year. The
college will replace the Stafford/PLUS loans for its students
with a privately financed loan program. Current regulations require
that Grove City sign a complex participation agreement that subjects
it to federal government oversight, and also to furnish audited
financial statements to the federal government. According to the
school this move reflects its long-standing principles of remaining
independent and free from government intrusion in the operation
of the College.

<B>Free Congress Foundation Video Tape: &quot;America the Bankrupt.&quot;</B>
<P>
The Free Congress Foundation has released a new video tape hosted
by the former Governor of Delaware, Pete DuPont, entitled &quot;American
the Bankrupt.&quot; The tape examines the &quot;true&quot; national
debt. The problems highlighted in the tape include: a national
debt that is spiraling out of control, a Medicare program that
will go bankrupt in 2001,  Social Security fraud, massive growth
in entitlement spending, a welfare system that doesn not work,
and soaring tax rates. The tape also features commentary by Senator
Larry Craig, Senator Don Nickles, Rep. Mark Neuman, OMB Director
Alice Rivlin, and several other economic experts. CONTACT: Free

<B>National Tax Limitation Foundation's State/Local Government
Fiscal <BR>
Restraint Project</B>
<P>
The National Tax Limitation Foundation (NTLF) has initaited a
project to review and analyze state and local government fiscal
restraint mechanisms. The maturation of the tax limitation movement
at state and local levels, and the devolution/block granting of
functions from Washington to the states convinced NTLF to undertake
this project. NTLF is seeking to create a systematic body of knowledge
that can illustrate what types and combinations of fiscal restraint
devices work best to control state/local government taxes and
spending. This will provide a unique, permanent body of data and
analysis that NTLF hopes will enable policy makers to shape state/local
government institutions in a more fiscally responsible fashion.
NTLF plans to work with key players in each state: state policy
councils, ALEC legislative leaders, tax research groups, fiscaly
conservative academics and taxpayer advocacy organizations and
activists.  CONTACT: National Tax Limitation Foundation, State/Local

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Reviewing the Revolution: Conservative
Successes in the 104th Congress<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>
<P>
Buoyed by the dramatic outcome of the 1994 elections,
conservatives had high expectations for the incoming Congress.
For the first time in 40 years, conservatives assumed key leadership
roles in both chambers. Particularly encouraging were the members
of the incoming House freshman class, many of whom had based their
successful campaigns on the Contract With America and its bold
commitment to reforming Congress and reducing the size and scope
of government.
<P>
Considering President Clinton's many vetoes of major
legislation, conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming
government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks
and retreats, the 104th Congress has fulfilled conservative's
hopes in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal
of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture,
and regulation.
<P>
The successes of the 104th Congress are particularly
significant when measured against the records of previous Congresses.
While this Congress adopted significant government reforms with
only narrow majorities, the New Deal and Great Society Congresses
had large liberal majorities. Moreover, the legislation passed
by those lawmakers was championed and signed by liberal Presidents.
Although the revolution remains to be completed, conservatives
should appreciate the progress that has been made.
<P>
No assessment of the 104th Congress would be complete
without a recognition of what could have been accomplished if
the President had not vetoed critical legislation. The most important
accomplishment of this Congress was a balanced budget bill which
would have eliminated the deficit by the year 2002 while mandating
$245 billion in critical tax reductions. American families would
have benefited from a $500 per child tax credit.
<P>
This legislation not only represented the first balanced
budget in 26 years, but also contained significant reforms in
government programs which would have returned power to states
and communities. In spite of the President's opposition, Congress
succeeded in reducing discretionary spending for the first time
since 1969. As submitted, the President's FY 1996 budget would
have raised the deficit to $211 billion; Congress deserves the
taxpayers' appreciation for cutting the Administration's projected
deficit nearly in half.
<P>
Perhaps the most notable achievement of the 104th
Congress was its overhaul of the nation's welfare system. While
the President twice vetoed welfare reform bills, he indicated
that he would sign a third which differed from the first two bills
only in minor respects. This historic legislation ends the federal
entitlement to welfare, contains real work requirements and time
limits, and fights illegitimacy. President Clinton promised to
&quot;end welfare as we know it.&quot; But it was conservatives
in Congress who made this promise a reality.
<P>
In many other areas, Congress succeeded in adopting
conservative, commonsense alternatives to liberal approaches advanced
by the Clinton Administration and its allies on Capitol Hill.
Congress restored funding for important national security programs
that were slashed by the Administration and its allies in Congress.
Lawmakers deregulated telecommunications, stemmed the tide of
costly federal mandates, and gave the President the line-item
veto.
<P>
Conservatives in the last Congress stopped the Clinton
health care bill that would have led to socialized medicine; this
Congress passed a scaled-down version of health care reform that
had as its primary goal enhancing portability of health insurance.
However, Congress did not address the flawed tax treatment of
employment-based health insurance that produces costly distortions
in the health care market, undermines consumer choice, and restricts
access to health insurance.
<P>
Congress has more work to do to complete work on
other conservative objectives. Lawmakers failed to pass legislation
to end racial preferences. They were unable to end government
funding for left-wing political activities. They failed to close
down the Energy, Education, Commerce, or Housing Departments.
The National Endowment for the Arts and the Legal Services Corporation
live on. But Congress did achieve cuts in all of these programs
that were unthinkable before 1994.
<P>
It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state,
and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed
to reform it. The 104th Congress, has taken significant steps
to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states,
local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated
that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; The 104th
Congress has actually done something to turn this rhetoric <BR>
into reality.<BR>

A Challenge to the U.S., <BR></a></B>by Richard Fisher
<P>
<I>Asian Studies Center Backgrounder</I>, No. 142, The Heritage
Foundation<HR>
<P>
China's moves to expand and modernize its air force poses the
first major challenge to the U.S. post-Cold War strategy in Asia.
With China's commitment to build a world class air force, Richard
Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, argues
that the United States must proceed with programs to guarantee
American air superiority in Asia. According to Fisher, the U.S.
should: sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter; maintain 12
Navy aircraft battle groups; develop an air-superiority fighter
for the Navy; accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile
and make advance U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies;
develop advanced versions of the F-16 and F-18 for allied and
friendly Asian air forces; and ask Russia and Israel to curtail
sales of advanced combat aircraft and related technology to China.

<P>
Ariel Cohen, Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies
at the Heritage Foundation, scrutinizes the fall of the Soviet
Union on the grounds that it was an empire. Prior to the downfall
of the Eastern Block, Sovietologists held no consensus that the
USSR was an empire to begin with. This is one reason why the fall
was so surprising. In theory and writings on empires, however,
there was abundant evidence that the USSR was soon going to collapse.

Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution,
and Jongryn Mo, Hoover National Fellow, predict that the North
Korean military and the leaders of heavy industry, will be the
powers who will control North Korea's destiny for the next few
years. The authors expect that North Korea will enter a period
of political instability and Kim Jong-Il will become little more
than a figurehead. The authors conclude that North Korea will
not likely improve its economy or stabilize its government in
the next few years. 19 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press,

<B>Antiproliferation of the 21st Century, <BR>
</B>by Kerry Herron
<P>
<I>Strategic Review</I>, Vol. XXIV, No. 3, United States Strategic
Institute<HR>

<P>
Kerry Herron, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, and Associate Director
for Security Studies at the University of New Mexico Institute
for Public Policy, examines the issue of &quot;full spectrum antiproliferation&quot;
as a nuclear deterrent in the post-Cold War world. Full-spectrum
antiproliferation presents an alternative to nonproliferation
and systematic deterrence. Herron explains that full spectrum
antiproliferation integrates: 1) polices that are designed to
slow and limit the number of states with nuclear weapons; 2) procedures
intended to reduce the nuclear dangers among proliferates by promoting
nuclear deterrence, nuclear surety (safety, security, and use
control), and responsible management of nuclear materials while
reducing the risks of nuclear terrorism; and 3) reactive capabilities
and policies for reducing risks associated with nuclear crises
that are not deterred or otherwise prevented. Herron believes
that full-spectrum antiproliferation is the best way to deal with
the world's current situation with nuclear missiles. According
to Herron, this policy &quot;recognizes the value of both prevention
and deterrence in coping with the challenges of nuclear proliferation,
and provides for their integration into policy options consistent
with a comprehensive proliferation strategy.&quot; He concludes
that twentieth century prescriptions are inadequate for twenty-first
century problems.  10 pp. CONTACT: United States Strategic Institute,

<B>The Nuclear Black Market</B><BR>
<P>
<I>CSIS Task Force Report</I>, Center for Strategic and International
Studies<HR>

<P>
CSIS's <I>Global Organized Crime Project</I> (GOC) was established
to develop short- and long-term strategies to deal with the threats
to U.S. national security in the post-Cold War era posed by global
organized crime. This report, produced by the Nuclear Black Market
Task Force, one of seven groups that make up GOC, focuses on the
supply, illicit trafficking, and demand for nuclear weapons and
weapons usable uranium and plutonium, from the Former Soviet Union
(FSU). The task force presents a bleak picture of poorly protected
storage sites for Russia's more than 1,500 tons of weapons-grade
fissile material guarded by demoralized and underpaid guards.
This creates a situation where terrorist groups or corrupt security
personnel, and even rogue states could obtain the components needed
to build a nuclear device. The current situation is ripe for struggling
nuclear workers to be tempted to steal or sell materials. Partly
as a result of dismantlement, the current trafficking trends have
upward trends. The potential for an accident or use of smuggled
nuclear materials is likely to increase. On a brighter note the
Task Force reports that certain trends are favorable. For example,
improvements in the material protection, control, and accountability
programs in the FSU is progressing, albeit slowly. Also the number
of deployed warheads has been reduced, transit states are starting
to use technical detectors, and the international community beginning
to respond to the problem. The Task Force has developed policy
recommendations in policy, organization, technology, legislation,
and international instruments. They recommend that U.S. policy
makers do the following: apply performance measures' aim for sustainability;
implement cooperative programs for material destruction and removal
of weapons from the FSU; develop bilateral safeguards with Russia;
consider exchanges on science-based stockpile stewardship with
Russia; encourage and enhance opportunities for bilateral cooperation
of law enforcement on a case-by-case basis; robustly support intelligence
efforts; pursue and prosecute nuclear smugglers to the fullest
extent of the law; and declare common policies on nuclear black
marketing and extradition with like-minded governments. 50 pp.

<B>The Prophets of Doom: The Security Threat of Religious Cults,<BR>
</B>by Andrew Hubback
<P>
<I>Occasional Paper</I>, No. 67, Institute for European Defence
and Strategic Studies<HR>

<P>
Andrew Hubback, a freelance writer and a commentator on security
affairs, examines the potential terrorist threat of some religious
cults. A recent example of such violence was the nerve gas attack
on the Tokyo subway by the Japanese religious cult <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I>
(Search for the Supreme Truth). The <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I> attack
was only part of growing trend of violence by religious cults
directed at forces of authority within states and targeted at
the general public. Religious cult terrorism introduces a new
aspect to terrorist warfare-their violence is as inspired by religion
as much as politics. Even the most violent secular terrorist groups
have eschewed such cruel weapons as nerve gas because they believe
such an attack would be counter productive to their political
cause. As recent peace settlements in certain hotspots in Central
America, the Middle East and Southern Africa have shown, former
terrorist groups have some common interests with their enemies.
Some fanatical apocalyptic religious cults have no such rational
ends as peace with those they see as their enemies. Hubback briefly
surveys violent cults throughout history and illustrates the recent
increase in cult terrorism. He then goes into detail about several
groups including <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I>, The Christian Identity
movement and the Oklahoma City bombing, and other international
cults such as the Order of the Solar Temple. He concludes with
suggestions on how to counter religious cult terrorism. He says
the first and most important step that should be taken is to recognize
the threat in the first place and be on guard. According to Hubback,
the security services of democracies should devote the necessary
resources to collecting intelligence on &quot;subversive, anti-social
and potentially violent cults. The authorities must be prepared
for a pre-emptive strike not only to protect the general public,
but to protect innocent cult members as well.  44 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Developing a Consensus for the Future: A Report of CSIS U.S.
China Policy Task Force</B><BR>
<P>
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies<HR>

<P>
In 1994 the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies (CSIS)
established the U.S. China Policy Task Force, co-chaired by Senators
Max Baucus (MT), Frank Murkowski (AK), Chuck Robb (VA), and Representative
Jim Kolbe (AZ), Harold Brown, a CSIS counselor, and Lawrason Thomas
of the Amoco Corporation. The Task Force has addressed several
issues affecting U.S.-China relations including: U.S.-China economic
and commercial relations; political issues including human rights;
domestic developments in the PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; regional
security; and cross-strait relations. U.S.-China relations have
developed to a point where disputes over individual issues pose
a threat to the overall relationship between the two nations and
prevent a consistent and coherent bilateral policy. This report
covers four elements that the Task Force believes U.S.-China policy
should revolve around; 1) developing a new consensus to reestablish
executive branch leadership and bipartisan congressional support
in regards to the priorities of U.S.-China relations; 2) a new
consensus that reflects &quot;value propositions&quot; to promote
U.S. interests and give direction to the overall relationship;
3) striving within U.S. politics and policy to accommodate both
pragmatism and idealism; and 4) the new consensus should hold
a firm U.S. position concerning cross-strait relations that acknowledges
that Chinese on the mainland, and in Taiwan, maintain that there
is only one China. The rest of this report covers the issues of
economic and commercial relations, political and human rights
issues, and bilateral and regional security relations, with specific
recommendations. 93 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and

<I>F.Y.I.</I>, No. 116, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Angela Antonelli, Deputy Director for Economic Policy Studies
at the Heritage Foundation, shows that the 104th Congress has
made several strides toward cutting regulatory red tape and began
to return common sense to regulation. However, she points out,
alarmists have been successful in convincing the American people
a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences.
According to Antonelli, this Congress has a solid record of reforms
that will create a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory
system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels
of public health, safety, and environmental protection. 11 pp.

<B><a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/cbrief27.html">Why Congress Should Privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,</a></B>
<br>
by John Barry 
<P>
<I>Committee Brief</I> No. 27, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
John Barry, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, calls for
the privatization of the two largest housing-related government
sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie
Mac). Ongoing hearings on the subject have brought forth the diverse
opinions of different federal agencies over whether federal sponsorship
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is necessary or not. Barry points
out that Congress is now considering privatization while at the
same time defending its oversight role. Barry says that Congress
should keep in mind two important facts to guide its decision
concerning the two GSEs: 1) Congress is ultimately responsible
for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers-so congressional oversight
of these GSEs is necessary if they remain government sponsored
as and place the taxpayer at risk; 2) the original mission of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, establishing an efficient secondary
mortgage market, has been fulfilled-so Congress should end their
sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Barry includes other
reasons for breaking the links between Fannie Mae and Freddie

<I>Backgrounder</I>, No. 1087, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
In the 1988 case <I>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</I>,
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that workers are entitled a refund
of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective
bargaining, contract administration, and grievance processes.
In 1992, President Bush issued an executive order requiring that
federal contractors post notices to inform workers of their Beck
rights. However, the Clinton Administration has rescinded this
order and has cooperated with union officials to keep workers
from knowing about these rights. The Worker Right to Know Act
is currently under consideration in Congress. The bill would require
unions to get permission from their members in order to use mandatory
dues for politicking or other activities outside of collective
bargaining. Weinstein and Wielgus argue that The Worker Right
to Know would enable union workers to exercise their rights freely.

<B>Competition in Electric Power: Strategies for Reform,</B>
<br>
by Doug Bandow
<P>
<I>Policy Report</I>, No. 14, John Locke Foundation<HR>

<P>
Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, discusses deregulation
of the electric utility industries. Until the 1970s, it was assumed
that electric utilities were natural monopolies, and that electrical
service could not be provided through competitive markets. However,
examples of successful deregulation in the airline, banking, broadcasting,
energy, telephone and other utilities have made it less far fetched
to call for a similar deregulation of electric power. Steps toward
electric power deregulation have slowly been made since the disastrous
economy of the late 1970s shed light on the problems with electric
industry monopolies. In 1992 Congress mandated wholesale competition.
And by 1994 California and other states have even moved toward
retail competition. Bandow stresses the point that this process
of moving toward increased competition in the electricity industry
will not be without its difficulties. The complicated structure
of the system now as an enforced monopoly, with its state and
federal power subsidies, special regulatory impositions on utilities
for non-energy purposes, ownership restrictions of power companies,
and control of power grids, means that none of the issues can
be solved in isolation. Bandow calls for a federally planned and
enforced program to eliminate subsidies, contracts made under
the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, non-energy
requirements, restrictions enforced under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act (PUCHA) of 1935, and control over access to transmission
grids while limiting stranded costs. This whole process will be
complicated politically and any change will generate opposition
from some interests. Bandow stresses that utilities deregulation
will be a significant factor in improving Americans' quality of
life in the early 21st Century. He concludes by saying that the
federal government, states, industry, consumer groups, and other
interests should work together to create a true market for electric
power that will provide Americans with better services at lower
costs. 62 pp.  CONTACT: The John Locke Foundation, P.O. Box 17822,

<B>Understanding Electricity Deregulation in Pittsburgh,</B>
<br>by Jake Haulk
<P>
Allegheny Institute<HR>

<P>
Jake Haulk, Research Director at the Allegheny Institute, discusses
how the deregulation of the nation's electric utilities holds
extremely large potential benefits in terms of lower prices and
higher quality of service for consumers. According to Haulk, regulation
as it is currently practiced is no longer appropriate for the
U.S. economy. &quot;Regulation encourages too much capital spending,
provides no inducement to cut costs and results in huge and wasteful
expenditures on litigation of prices and other regulated activities.&quot;
Steps have already been taken to ease the transition to deregulation.
For example, Haulk points out, federal agencies have mandated
that transmission grids of all competition at the wholesale level
will be open to all qualified generators. Retail deregulation
will soon follow this introduction of competition at the wholesale
level. Haulk also says that all customers will be able to choose
among a number of suppliers and have a choice of service levels
and price schedules in the new competitive system. Transmission
and distribution companies will be separately owned and probably
still regulated, but the generators and retail marketers will
be free to operate in a profit maximizing manner. He conservatively
estimates that a typical local residential customer in Allegheny
County will save about 30 percent, or $350 per year on electric
bills. 16 pp. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy,

<B>Promise and Peril: Implementing a Regulatory Budget,</B>
<br>
by Clyde Wayne Crews
<P>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project</I>, Competitive Enterprise Institute
<HR>

<P>
Clyde Wayne Crews, Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute,
discusses the implementation of a Regulatory budget. He examines
the pluses and minuses of requiring Congress to set enforceable
limits on the amounts that federal agencies can force private
citizens to spend on federally mandated rules and regulations.
According to Crews, there currently exists a breach between rulemaking
and accountability. What he calls &quot;regulation without representation.&quot;
Congress loves to take credit for such legislation as the Clean
Air Act, but then blames the federal agencies, whose powers they
drastically increased with such legislation, for being &quot;out
of control.&quot; Meanwhile, the federal agency bureaucrats are
not accountable to voters. A regulatory budget would require Congress
to set and enforce cost caps on the regulations that the agencies
impose. Prioritizing what regulations bring the greatest benefits
and sensible protection would be a responsibility of Congress
and the agencies. Congress will become more accountable to the
voters for the costs and results of regulatory policy. Crews calls
for a few other steps to be taken to ensure that a budgeting effort
remains manageable and accountable. He calls for the establishment
of a regulatory cost freeze and the implementation of a &quot;Regulatory
Reduction Commission&quot; to address the existing $647 billion
regulatory enterprise; employing separate budgets for economic
and environmental/social regulation; and the controlling of hard-to-measure
indirect costs by abandoning the regulatory methods that most
often generate them. 28 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute,

<HR>

<P>
Donald Boudreaux, Professor of Economics at Clemson University,
and Andrew Kleit, Professor of Economics at Louisiana State University,
argue that market forces are more effective than antitrust laws
in preventing monopolies from occurring. Kleit and Boudreaux argue
that economic research shows that predatory pricing is not likely
to result in a monopoly. Rival competitors have the incentive
and the ability to withstand a predatory price war. They maintain
that customers and suppliers of the predatory prices often have
the incentive and ability to thwart predatory efforts. Some elements
of antitrust law serve to thwart market forces of policing against
predation. Lawful 'private policing' strategies such as minimum
resale price maintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, and
price discrimination are rendered unlawful as a perverse consequence
of antitrust law. Antitrust prohibitions then increase the costs
of private firms of protecting themselves from monopoly. 20 pp.

<P>
In a joint publication, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution,
and the Institute for Policy Innovation, present a list of the
top ten worst government regulations. In the introduction, Robert
Kasten, former Senator from Wisconsin, and Chairman of the Center
on Regulation and Economic Growth for the Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution, points out that government regulators frequently
far exceed the original intent of Congress when enforcing regulation.
Without &quot;sunset&quot; provisions, regulations stay in effect
even after they have become obsolete or outdated. To compile this
list, IPI and AdTI asked leading policy experts to write a brief
article on what they believed exemplified the worst regulations
from Washington. Kasten proposes that the regulations would be
perfect candidates for Congressional overhaul or elimination during
the next &quot;Corrections Day.&quot; Those ten regulations are:
the federal wetlands policy; the 60-40 rule; off-label drug use
regulations; the federal peanut program; the FDA's slow approval
process; Superfund; Environmental Tobacco Smoke; The Delaney Clause;
Discipline of special education students; and Toxic Release Inventory.

<B>The Impact of Enterprise Zones, <BR>
</B>by Terry Van Allen<HR>

<P>
Enterprise Zones are set aside low-income areas that have reduced
tax and regulatory barriers in order to stimulate economic development,
investment, and opportunity. Terry Van Allen, Director of Research
Initiatives at the University of Houston-Clear Lake, examines
the issue of how Enterprise Zones affect employment. He argues
that Enterprise Zones have a major impact on reducing unemployment.
His study also shows that vast majority of the new entry level
jobs go to the residents of the low-income zone, contrary to the
claims of critics. He also dispels the myth that most businesses
relocate to Enterprise Zones from other communities. Instead,
the evidence shows that most of the businesses in Enterprise Zones
have either been expanded or newly created from &quot;within&quot;
the designated communities. He also counters the argument that
the cost of providing tax incentives is too high. Van Allen argues
that poverty areas already have low tax revenues and high welfare
costs, so the benefits far outweigh the costs. The analytical
model that Van Allen has created projects that the designated
poverty areas on average can reach employment rate parity with
the surrounding more-prosperous communities within twelve years.
He recommends that the Clinton Administration and Congress increase
the number of Enterprise Zones and provide for capital gains tax
incentives within Enterprise Zones. 145 pp. CONTACT: Austin &amp;

<B>Is New York City Killing Entrepreneurship? </B><br>
by William Mellor
<P>
Institute for Justice<HR>

<P>
The Institute for Justice examines how New York City has made
it hard for self-employed entrepreneurs to pursue productive livelihoods.
New York's regulatory system is filled with entrepreneurs who
find that if they were to comply with the law, they would have
to abandon their way of making an honest living. The underground
economy in New York City now may represent as much as 20 percent
of the city's overall economy. This report looks at the government-created
barriers of licensing and permitting laws and public monopolies,
and their effect on entry-level entrepreneurship in New York.
They illustrate how obstacles to enterprise created by government
often times far exceed any legitimate exercise of government authority
to regulate in order to protect health and safety. IJ also focuses
on the tragedy, as well as the heroic efforts of those who try
to earn an honest living, despite the burden of senseless rules
and requirements whose main purpose seems to be to limit competition
in particular occupations. Finally, IJ makes recommendations for
how to create easier legal entry into entrepreneurial endeavors.

</B>by Bill Beach
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1091, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
As long as governments have been collecting taxes, the death of
well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors.
The manifestation of such a tax today is the estate tax. Except
the estate tax effects more than just the wealthy, with the hardest
hit being small business owners. Bill Beach, John M. Olin Senior
Fellow in Economics, puts forth the case for repealing the estate
tax, and identifies it as the &quot;worst tax of all.&quot; According
to Beach, the social and economic costs of the estate tax far
exceeds the revenue that it brings to the government. Growing
evidence shows that the estate tax: reduces economic growth, and
hurts the incomes of the people that wealth redistribution was
intended to aid; it increases the cost of capital, this slows
down research and development and the investment in machines that
would increase worker productivity instead-and thus wages; it
keeps the interest rates on home loans and other major purchases
unnecessarily high; and it does not raise very much money-and
may, in fact, cost government and taxpayers more in administrative
and compliance fees than it raises in revenue. Using two leading
econometric models, a Heritage Foundation study found that the
repeal of the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect
on the economy. According to the analysis, if the tax were repealed
this year, over the next nine years: America's economy would average
as much as $11 billion per year in extra output; an average of
145,000 additional new jobs could be created; personal income
could rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current
projections; and the deficit would actually decline with the revenues
generated by extra growth. Beach points out that that estate tax
has few friends other than tax attorneys. 30 pp. CONTACT: Chris

</B> 
<br>
by Dan Mitchell
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1090, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Dan Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy, explains
how dynamic scoring should be used to modernize the revenue-estimating
process. Dynamic scoring recognizes that tax policy effects the
economy, as opposed to static analysis, which assumes that tax
changes have no impact on economic growth. Mitchell argues that
dynamic scoring, if used properly, can help bring about sound
tax policy by reducing the politically unpleasant side-effects
of tax cuts. Static analysis does not take into account the fact
that a larger economy created by easing a tax burden brings in
larger revenue to government coffers. Politicians usually support
the idea of cutting taxes. However, they are afraid of being blamed
for the higher deficits that static analysis predicts will happen
with tax cuts. Mitchell lists several points that policy makers
should consider when taking steps to modernize the revenue-estimating
process: learn from history that static scoring overestimates
how much revenue will be generated by a tax increase, while underestimating
the revenue feedback that pro-growth tax changes will generate;
realize that dynamic analysis is not perfect, as opposed to static
analysis which is guaranteed to give the wrong answer; tax cuts
that have a greater effect on behavior, such as a capital gains
tax cut have a greater revenue feedback effect; policy makers
should insist that taxpayers get full disclosure on whatever model
and methodology is used by revenue estimators at the Joint Committee
on Taxation and the Treasury Department; have the goal of tax
policy be the maximization of growth, not tax revenue; and include
the estimated private and governmental compliance costs of taxation.
Mitchell concludes by saying that dynamic forecasting is based
on a proper understanding of how the economy works, and that history
has shown this approach to be more realistic. 17 pp. CONTACT:

This report from Cato presents an objective, comparative analysis
of the spending and tax policies of 46 state governors. Stephen
Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies, and Dean Stansel, Fiscal
Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, constructed a 14-variable
index of fiscal performance and applied it to the records of each
governor who took office before 1993. The authors then graded
each of the governors on their fiscal conservatism. George Pataki
of New York, Steve Merrill of New Hampshire, and Fife Symington
of Arizona, received the grade of &quot;A.&quot; Gaston Caperton
of West Virginia, Tom Carper of Delaware, Lawton Chiles of Florida,
and George Voinovich of Ohio received &quot;F's.&quot; A significant
trend that was uncovered by the study was that states have become
more fiscally conservative since 1994, and the new governors as
a class tend to be more fiscally conservative than those elected
before 1993. 84 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

<B>Accounting for Growth: Incorporating Dynamic Analysis Into
Revenue Estimation, <BR>
</B>by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<P>
<I>Policy Report</I> No. 138, Institute for Policy Innovation
<HR>

<P>
Gary Robbins, John M. Olin Senior Research Fellow at the Institute
for Policy Innovation, and Aldona Robbins, Bradley Senior Research
Fellow at the Institute for Policy Innovation, examine the issue
of &quot;dynamic analysis.&quot; Dynamic economic analysis is
the process of estimating economic changes that occur because
of changes in tax policy. It does not assume that all economic
behavior and variables remain the same if tax laws or government
expenditures change. Robbins and Robbins used dynamic analysis
with three hypothetical changes: a per capita tax of $5,200; an
elimination of the capital gains and dividend taxes on individuals;
and a uniform rate for individual and corporate income taxes of
19 percent, all with a commonly accepted baseline of 2.5 percent
annual growth from 1996 to 2010. They found that the head tax
raises GDP 22 percent above baseline by 2010. By removing individual
capital gain/dividend taxes raises GDP 8.5 percent, and the 19
percent uniform rate puts real GDP 7.5 percent above baseline
by 2010. Their use of dynamic analysis suggests tax reform aimed
at growth can increase annual output roughly 10 to 15 percent.
This boost would lead to more jobs, higher incomes, and an expanded
tax base which would bring higher revenues, not losses. 19 pp.

<B>The Hidden Heir: How Estate Taxes Are Swallowing up Family
Businesses And Farms-And How We Can Stop It</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York<HR>

<P>
The Public Policy Institute of New York examines the detrimental
effects of New York's state-level estate and gift taxes. With
federal estate taxes, and the additional burden of New York state's
top rates reaching 76 percent, owners of family businesses and
farms are often times forced to flee New York when they retire,
taking valuable assets with them. Most states do not add to federal
estate taxes, but simply take some of the tax that otherwise would
go to the federal government. New York collects the most revenue
of the states that do levy estate or inheritance taxes and has
the highest top rates on inheritance to children. Contrary to
the nationwide trend of states repealing their death taxes, New
York has been expanding its estate tax. This paper argues that
New York must reduce its rates, reduce the burden of the state
gift tax; conform estate tax credits to the federal level; and
make policy changes that can ease the transfer of family businesses
from one generation to the next. Finally, this paper argues that
New York could go further than a reduction in disadvantages, and
create an actual incentive for family businesses to locate in
New York state. By establishing a New York Sate Family Business
Fund, the fund could loan family businesses and farms money to
pay federal estate taxes. It would be capitalized with a small
share of exiting estate revenue flow-so that revenues from the
rich would pay for keeping family businesses and their jobs in
New York. 27 pp. CONTACT: The Public Policy Institute of New York

<B>Public-Private Promises #1: Three Rivers Stadium,</B><br>

<P>
In light of the proposal to build a new government subsidized
baseball stadium in Pittsburgh, Grant Gulibon, Research Associate
at the Allegheny Institute, examines the rosy promises made in
a similar proposal approximately thirty-five years ago for Three
Rivers Stadium. Gulibon's report examines the claims used to justify
the construction of Three Rivers Stadium and contrasts them with
the stadium's actual performance since its opening. He found:
the original estimated cost of the stadium was $13.8 million,
while its final cost is estimated to be between $52 and $62 million;
the 83.5 acre site where the stadium was built was estimated to
cost $10 million in 1958, re-estimated to cost $21.72 in 1962,
but ultimately cost $45 million; Three Rivers Stadium was to be
a &quot;self-financing&quot; project which would not require city
or county operating support, but, has run up a $43 million deficit,
and has received operating subsidies for the Allegheny County
Regional Asset District; very little of the predicted private
development plans for the area surrounding the stadium exists
due to a lack of market demand; Through 1991 the city had over
$100 million on the stadium, still owes $40 million on the bonds
floated for the original construction, and had provided $27.1
million in subsidies for stadium operating deficits over the same
time period; deficits continued even after the stadium authority
hired a private management group to manage Three Rivers in 1982;
and St. Louis' Busch Stadium, four years older than Three Rivers
and nearly identical in size and design, privately financed and
has been privately owned and operated since it opened, was completed
under budget, has turned a profit each year since it opened, and
has been cited by baseball officials as one of the model facilities
in operation today. 19 pp. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute, 7 Parkway

<B>Restoring Opportunity to Arkansas: Changing a &quot;Tax and

Arkansas Policy Foundation
<P>
Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute,
and Dean Stansel, Fiscal Policy Analyst at Cato, discuss how changing
the tax policy in the state of Arkansas, would restore opportunity
to the state. In Arkansas, tax and spending has exploded over
the past fifteen years. Moore and Stansel list several examples
of Arkansas' heavy taxation: state spending is 50% higher than
it was in 1980-and spending has risen 12% faster than state income
in the same period; if the state budget had only grown at the
rate of personal income growth, Arkansas could both balance its
budget and give every family in the state a $1,000 tax rebate;
Arkansas' high tax burden is 15% above the national average, and
is weakening the state's competitiveness with other states; spending
priorities have been radically rewritten since 1980, from traditional
state responsibilities such as education, highways, and hospitals
to less productive and more redistributive goals such as welfare,
public health, and debt service; and that the state budget has
been growing at an annual rate more than twice that of inflation.
To solve these tax problems, Moore and Stansel offer the following
spending restraints and tax cuts: a 25% cut in personal income
tax rates, eventually to become a 5% flat tax to deliver economic
growth; indexation, which prevents state government from benefiting
through inflation; eliminate the state capital gains tax on new
investment, to have a giant impact on investment and job growth;
enact a one-year budget freeze to allow the rest of the state
to catch up; and finally, implement a constitutional budget cap
that prevents growth of spending from rising faster than the growth
rate of the state population plus inflation. Moore and Stansel
conclude that such measures have led to stunning economic success
in states as  different as Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey.

<B>Taxation and Economic Performance, <BR>
</B>by W. Kurt Hauser
<P>
<I>Essay in Public Policy</I>, Hoover Institution<HR>

<P>
Kurt Hauser, President of a San Francisco investment management
firm, argues that increased tax rates do not raise the desired
additional revenues. In his essay he shows that the economy as
a whole tends to perform worse following a tax increase. Reduction
in tax rates, however, tends to make the economy perform more
favorably. Hauser notes that economists have debated for the past
two centuries over whether or not higher rates of taxation leads
to increased levels of government revenues. More recently, he
points out, the revenue generation forecast for the tax increase
of 1990 and 1993 fell short of the mark. According to Hauser,
higher tax rates tend to reduce the tax base because of the disincentives
that they cause to work, produce, save, or invest. There are also
incentives to hide, shelter, and underreport income when tax rates
are raised. Policy makers still continue to believe that increases
in marginal tax rates will raise revenues without the adverse
effects on economic growth, job creation, or standard of living.

<B>Operating on American Health Care: Will Free Market Reforms
Survive? </B>
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I>, American Legislative Exchange Council<HR>

<P>
This issue of <I>F.Y.I.</I> examines how free-market reforms concerning
health care have grown since the failure of the Clinton health
care proposals. According to ALEC, states are repealing the bad
reforms associated with Clinton Care, such as, community rating,
guaranteed issue, price controls, and managed competition. States
are now busy dealing with the massive managed-care systems and
protecting patient's rights. Instead of the centralized systems
of Clinton style reforms, states are moving toward market solutions
that allow choice to the patients and better overall care. !8
states have enacted laws allowing for medical savings accounts
(MSAs). Also in this issue, Dr. Merrill Mathews, Health Policy
Director at the National Center for Policy Analysis, discusses
solving the portability problem. He says that the problem should
be resolved without costing the federal government additional
money or distorting the health insurance market. States should
provide risk pools for uninsurable individuals. Kim Pacelli, ALEC
Research Assistant, briefly examines how states might reform Medicaid
programs if block grants are granted to states. More than 40 states
have already sought waivers from the federal government. 19 pp.

<B>Multicultural Mental Health: Does Your Skin Color Matter More
than Your Mind? <BR>
</B>by Sally Satel and Greg Forster
<P>
<I>Policy Brief</I>, Center for Equal Opportunity<HR>

<P>
Sally Satel, a psychiatrist and lecturer with the Yale University
School of Medicine, and Greg Forster, Policy Analyst at the Center
for Equal Opportunity, examine a new mental health field called
&quot;cultural competence&quot; or &quot;multicultural therapy.&quot;
According to Satel and Forster, this movement threatens to discredit
traditional therapy and replace it with identity politics. This
concept of therapy sees human behavior as primarily culture-dependent.
So according to the theory of this practice doctors and patients
will experience mistrust and miscommunication if they are of different
racial or ethnic groups. It also assumes that white therapists
are racist. San Francisco General Hospital has the most prominent
cultural competence program in the United States. The doctors
in the mental health unit there specialize in different patient
groups-blacks, Asians, Latinos, gays/lesbians/bisexuals, women,
and HIV-positive. The city of San Francisco has even created a
racial specialization for non-doctor health professionals: African
American Health Services Specialists. The authors argue that no
one believes that race and culture are irrelevant to mental health,
but that muticultural therapy seeks to establish rigid rules of
treatment based on stereotypes and groupthink. They conclude that
the patient is a human being, not a cultural puppet, and that
multicultural approach to psychotherapy spends more energy separating
patients into groups than treating them. 19 pp. CONTACT: Center

<B>Waiting Your Turn: Hospital Waiting Lists in Canada,</B>

<I>Critical Issues Bulletin</I>, Fraser Institute<HR>

<P>
Cynthia Ramsey, Health Economist at The Fraser Institute, and
Michael Walker, Executive Director of The Fraser Institute, present
the Institute's sixth attempt to examine and document the extent
to which waiting lists are being used as a way of adapting to
the conflict between limited budgetary allocations and the potentially
unlimited demand for free health care. This year's results show
that Canadians waited longer in 1995 than in 1994 to receive medical
treatment. They found that patients in 1995 waited longer-10.2
weeks from referral by a general practitioner to a specialist
until the receipt of treatment-compared to 9.7 weeks in 1994.
They also found that the number of people on surgical waiting
lists and the amount of time they are waiting for the treatment
varies from province to province. Patients in Prince Edward Island
wait almost two months longer for surgical procedures than people
in Quebec. Fraser's survey measured what specialists consider
to be clinically reasonable amounts of time to wait for surgical
procedures. In almost every instance, the responding specialist
thought that patients were waiting too long for treatment. Ramsey
and Walker conclude that a plausible explanation for the waiting
times is that governments are using them as a way to control health
care expenses by rationing access to health care.  58 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Repairing the Ladder: Toward a New Housing Policy Paradigm,
</B>
<br>by Howard Husock
<P>
<I>Policy Study</I>, No. 207, Reason Foundation<HR>

<P>
In this report, Howard Husock, Reason Foundation Adjunct Scholar,
examines the reasons why housing policy for the poor has not worked.
He lays out an overall plan and specific details for an new housing
policy paradigm that is based on ongoing, already successful initiatives.
He argues that the problems of public housing and related subsidy
programs is partly a result of a fundamental misunderstanding
of the role which housing plays in social and economic life. He
also argues that replacement policies that emphasized subsidized
rentals risk creating a new generation of problems and complications,
including the further undermining of the social structure of civil
society in poor neighborhoods. According to Husock, housing must
be seen as more than a physical good, and viewed as part of a
social system. or &quot;housing ladder.&quot; The housing ladder
concept relies on the notion that to best serve the most people,
the fullest range of privately owned housing types must be built.
The desire of the occupants of housing to move up the ladder from
one type to another, and the need to protect the value of one's
housing investment, plays a key role in maintaining the social
fabric of neighborhoods, especially very poor neighborhoods. Husock's
concept of the housing ladder comes from historical data that
indicates that private, owner-occupied housing has played a key
role in the lives of those of modest means. He uses examples of
private, public and nonprofit initiatives which have begun to
build or facilitate the construction of the housing that regulation
or deep subsidy programs have made difficult to build in recent
years, that can lead the way to a new housing paradigm. 66 pp.

<B>The Social Security Fraud,</B>

<P>
Abraham Ellis, a New York City attorney, illustrates that Social
Security is just another entitlement program, not an insurance
system. He also shows that the Trust fund is an &quot;economic
house of cards.&quot; The payments are continuously being raised
regardless of a retiree's contributions. Meanwhile, the receipts
from the Social Security tax go into general government revenue.
Ellis points out, that in the event of a real economic crisis,
the government would have trouble meeting its obligations to elderly
Americans that depend on it. According to Ellis, Social Security
is unfair to prudent young people who could produce much more
for retirement by investing the amount that goes into social security
taxes. Overall, Ellis shows that Social Security is just another
way for getting additional taxes from the people. 208 pp.  CONTACT:

20 years. They also found that: 88 percent of Americans believe
that Social Security either is in trouble today or will be in
trouble within the next 20 years; 60 percent of all Americans
under the age 65 believe that Social Security will not be there
for them when they retire; voters reject most traditional Social
Security reforms such as raising the retirement age, raising payroll
taxes, or reducing benefits; and approximately two-thirds of voters
would support privatization of Social Security, and transforming
it into a privatized mandatory savings program. 7 pp. CONTACT:

the New York Association of Scholars and the Empire Foundation

the State University of New York. They discovered a nationwide
trend in whereby students take an odd mixture of courses that
do not build on previous knowledge, while avoiding more fundamental
and serious subjects. For example, one campus mandates that students
take courses in physical education while at the same time does
not require courses in history, literature, philosophy, arts,
English composition, mathematics or science. In addition, intellectual
permissiveness and political correctness are running rampant on
these campuses with courses such as, &quot;Literature of Sports,&quot;Deviance,&quot;
&quot;Love and Sexuality,&quot; and &quot;Stage Combat.&quot;

<B>Charter Schools in Action: What Have We Learned?</B><br>

<P>
Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Finn, Manno and Bierlein report their findings from the first
year of a two-year Hudson Institute study of U.S. charter schools.
The report focuses on the schools' start-up problems, solutions
to those problems, and the policy environments in which such schools
are most apt to thrive or falter. Start-up problems, not surprisingly,
include financial burdens and regulatory and political hurdles.
Among the many recommendations the writers make are setting up
charter schools to be legal entities in their own right, giving
charter schools the same per pupil operating funds that conventional
public schools receive, and using the charter model to develop
ways of holding all public schools accountable for their results.
Hudson suggests that charter schools may be the most vibrant force
in American education today and notes that the current demand
for charter schools far outweighs the supply. 127 pp.  CONTACT:

reinventing the federal role in education. Finn and Ravitch discover
rising enrollment figues in advanced math and science courses,
but disappointedly find that while more than three-fifths of high
school graduates now proceed directly to college, barely two-fifths
of them were in the academic track in high school. The study recommends
that schools continue to try to adhere to the strong academic
core that the National Commission on Excellence suggests. 66 pp.

<B>The New Paradigm on Environmental Enforcement: Environmental
Audit Privilege and Immunity Legislation,</B>
<br>by R. Kinnan Golemon and Laura Wolf
<P>
<I>The State Factor</I>, Vol. 22, No. 1, American Legislative
Exchange Council<HR>

<P>
R. Kinnan Golemon, a prominent expert in the field of Environmental
Law, and Laura Wolf, an environmental lawyer in Austin, present
a new paradigm for environmental enforcement. For the last twenty-five
years environmental regulation has focused on the &quot;command
and control&quot; model. Golemon and Wolf argue that this model,
which has developed an extremely complicated regulatory scheme,
is outdated and needs to change. They believe that a new environmental
regulatory model should focus on and encourage voluntary compliance.
Goleman and Wolf present &quot;audit privileges and penalty immunities&quot;
as part of the solution. These give an incentive for regulated
entities to conduct environmental audits without the fear of major
sanctions. The audits will promote candid, effective discussions
within the regulated entities to help find the causes of, and
the solution to, environmental noncompliance. They will also remove
the incentive to not identify or hide noncompliance so that the
problem can be solved in the most constructive possible way. 13

<B>Privatizing the Public Lands, <BR>
</B>by B. Delworth Gardner
<P>
<I>Focus on Utah</I>, No. 1, Sutherland Institute<HR>

<P>
B. Delworth Gardner, Professor Emeritus of Economics at Brigham
Young University, argues that the federal government should dispose
of its public land in the West, and permit private parties to
own and control the land itself. According to Gardner, private
management is superior to public management in conserving resources.
In economic markets, the future generations are represented by
entrepreneurs who will profit from, and are most interested in,
conserving resources for their future use. She continues by stressing
that consumers and taxpayers are the beneficiaries if market products,
in this case, land use user fees, are priced at competitive levels.
Although some public management products appear to be free or
subsidized, taxpayers must pay for such things as the lobbying,
campaign contributions, propaganda, and court costs that are incurred
in order to influence public decisions. Privatization and market
allocation at a price would make it so each consumer would pay
for what he gets. Resources would be more productive, and products
would increase in variety in order to be tailored toward consumer
tastes. If private entrepreneurs marketed hunting and fishing
privileges, they would manage the resources more efficiently and
more successfully. Private firms also have a greater incentive
to stop undesirable managerial behavior than government bureaucrats.
Finally, Gardner argues that the federal government should gradually
dispose of the public lands, and they should try alternative ways
for privatizing the public lands, such as long-term competitive
leasing of public lands to private groups. 17 pp. CONTACT: Sutherland

John Tottie, Senior Economist for Tax and Budget at Citizens for
a Sound Economy, examines the $47 billion in research and development
(R&amp;D) spending by the Department of Energy (DOE)-supposedly
for the benefit of taxpayers and the U.S. economy. In the early
days of the 104th Congress, DOE published &quot;Success Stories:
The Energy Mission in the Marketplace,&quot; highlighting what
the department thought were its successes in applied energy research
and development. The 22 page report seems like an attempt to fight
off the much needed reductions in the bloated spending by DOE
on R&amp;D. Tottie argues that the private industry that stands
to benefit from the R&amp;D spending, not taxpayers, should be
responsible for the costs associated with developing scientific
knowledge that has specific commercial applications.  8 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
The Competitive Enterprise Institute commissioned <I>The Polling
Company</I> to perform a nationwide poll of 1,000 registered voters
nationwide. They found that most Americans support environmental
protection, but are not activists. They also found that most Americans
support a greater role for state and local governments in environmental
policy, and that state and local governments are better suited
at addressing environmental concerns than the federal government.
According to the survey, most Americans see devolution, regulatory
reform, and property rights as being consistent with environmental
protection. Also, Americans see nothing anti-environment about
alternative approaches to environmental policy. CEI argues that
the challenge for supporters of environmental regulatory reform
is to articulate a vision for the future of environmental policy
that combines the public's concern for environmental protection
with their preference for limited government policies. Americans
have come to realize that extensive federal bureaucracies are
not necessary to advance environmental protection, and that pursuing
environmental reform is not &quot;anti-environment.&quot; 25 pp.

<B>A New Environmental Tool? Assessing Life Cycle Assessment,
</B> 
<br>
by Mark Duda and Jane Shaw
<P>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I>, No. 81, Center for the Study
of American Business<HR>

<P>
&quot;Life cycle assessment&quot; (LCA) is a process that attempts
to measure the total environmental impact of a product and its
manufacturing process. Mark Duda, Fellow at the Political Economy
Research Center (PERC), and Jane Shaw, a Senior Associate of PERC,
discuss the reasons why this procedure should not be used to shape
public policy. According to Duda and Shaw, LCA is useful to companies
that want to know whether the raw material they use might become
scarce or become environmentally harmful. When companies use LCA
their data is generally reliable and their goals are usually clear.
If such procedures were used for public policy and regulatory
purposes, argue Duda and Shaw, it would require that practitioners
use data from a wide range of sources and then translate this
data into environmental impacts. The averages and aggregates produced
would be inaccurate and would not describe the differences between
one product and another. According to Duda and Shaw, it is hard
to translate resource consumption and emissions data into actual
environmental impacts. For example it does not take into consideration
the environment in which production occurs. Overall, they conclude,
LCA makes sense for individual firms, which use it to plan how
they will respond to environmental regulations and to the environmental
concerns of their customers. If LCA information is collected at
the industry level it is not sufficiently accurate for making
broad public policy decisions.  20 pp. CONTACT: Center for the

<B>A Turf Fight for Indoor Air Quality Protection, <BR>
</B>by Dwight Lee
<P>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I>, No. 79, Center for the Study
of American Business<HR>

<P>
Dwight Lee, an Adjunct Fellow for the Center for the Study of
American Business, discusses the bureaucratic turf war over the
control and regulation of indoor air. The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) has jurisdiction over workplace
safety and is in a fight with the Environmental Protection Agency
over jurisdiction of indoor air quality (IAQ) in the workplace.
The agency that is able to gain control over IAQ will be in a
good position to expand its budget and power. According to Lee,
EPA and OSHA are using the political issue of tobacco smoke to
muscle for their larger budgets. OSHA has made a proposal to ban
smoking in all work sites under its jurisdiction. According to
Lee, OSHA's position relies on flawed and biased studies that
emphasize that indoor pollution can be addressed by singling out
particular pollutants such as tobacco smoke. In reality, indoor
air pollution is a general problem that cannot be effectively
dealt with by singling out particular pollutants. Lee argues that
OSHA ignores cost saving alternative approaches, ignores the advantages
of market incentives and exaggerates the benefits of regulation.
Overall, it exploits the politically contentious issue of tobacco
to grab for more power. Lee concludes that the only argument that
can be made for OSHA IAQ regulation is that it would be no more
inefficient than EPA regulation.  16 pp. CONTACT: Center for the

Bruce Yandle, an Adjunct Fellow at The Progress &amp; Freedom

Auburn University, and Mark Brandly, a doctoral candidate in economics
at Auburn, call for the creation of Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs). EIAs will recognize that different regions face different
environmental and pollution problems. Different regions should
be given flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways that
are best suited for their particular area, instead of the top-down
command and control system that we currently have. Yandle, Barnett
and Brandly call for an end to federal fuel taxes that discriminate
against alternative fuels. With EIAs, states and regions could
design fuel taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner
burning fuels for their area. Changing the laws that discriminate
against alternative fuel vehicles will be a lower cost way to
improve automobile efficiency and a reduction in American reliance
on imported petroleum than Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards. 57 pp. CONTACT: Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,

The trend of privatization, which was in part, inspired by the
collapse of the former Soviet Union, is being hotly debated throughout
American government. This book is a collection of original essays
by distinguished scholars that examine the potential benefits,
as well as the possible pitfalls, of national and global privatization.
This book also provides several perspective on how privatization
can best be achieved. With the support of empirical evidence,
the various authors asses the institutional changes and economic
impact of this worldwide trend. 270 pp. CONTACT: Rowman &amp;

by Bob Moffit and Ed Meese
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1089, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Bob Moffit, Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies at The
Heritage Foundation, and Ed Meese, former Attorney General of
The United States and Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow at The
Heritage Foundation, present twenty-one steps that public officials
can take to support their local police. Moffit and Meese draw
upon the success of former New York City Commissioner of Police
William Bratton's short tenure, in which serious crime dropped
36 percent, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45
percent drop in murder. A reduction in crime does not depend upon
new cars or computers, more officers and bigger budgets. What
is most important, this paper says, is solid personnel management
and a clear mission for combating crime and disorder, with support
from the public, the state and the courts, and the press. Moffit
and Meese give the following suggestions for specific ways that
local officials can strengthen their police forces through their
own efforts: police should have a more back to basics role; police
should combat minor &quot;disorder&quot; crimes that provide an
environment for more serious crimes; raise the standards for who
can become a police officer; improve police compensation; target
hot spots; and reduce caseloads for detectives, among other suggestions.
Moffit and Meese call on the federal government to: block the
appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity
to public safety; review federal statutes dealing with crime,
and repeal the ones that impinge on the legitimate authority of
local and state law enforcement officials; review the impact of
the <I>Miranda</I> ruling; and pursue ways through enterprise
zones to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods among other suggestions.
Overall, states and localities need maximum flexibility to combat
violent crime. 37 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

<I>Government Integrity Project Report</I>, No. 10, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Ken Weinstein, Director of the Government Reform Project at the
Heritage Foundation, reports that under the Clinton Administration
a string of federal grants have continued to subsidize the Laborers'
International Union of North America (LIUNA) even as government
investigators were uncovering evidence of organized criminal influence
in the union. Weinstein argues that restrictions or elimination
of grants to politically active groups such as unions should be
seriously considered by Congress. Meanwhile, Congress should act
immediately to: require that relevant grantmakers at certain federal
bureaus testify about their knowledge of allegations of criminal
infiltration of LIUNA; prohibit organizations whose officers have
records of criminal wrongdoing from receiving federal grants;
renew efforts to restrict lobbying by federal grantees; and order
a General Accounting Office investigation into LIUNA's handling
of federal grants. Weinstein concludes by pointing out that it
is bad enough that mandatory dues from union members are used
to pay for corruption and political activities, tax payers should
not have to pay as well. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The

<B>Civil Right and Sexual Behavior: An Analysis of the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act, <BR>
</B>by Paul Mero
<P>
<I>Insight</I>, Family Research Council<HR>

<P>
Paul Mero, a political consultant and congressional staffer, examines
how the Employment Non-Discrimination Act might lead to the adoption
of the entire homosexual rights agenda. He argues that organized
homosexuality, the political pragmatic side of the homosexuality
movement, has narrowly worded this bill as a calculated risk that
the final determination of this legislation will rest on some
very fundamental notions about homosexuality <I>per se</I>, and
whether or not mainstream America will accept these notions. According
to Mero, the narrowly worded language of the legislation is very
ambiguous and includes the curious term &quot;bisexual.&quot;
Mero says this term is one of the calculated risks with which
organized homosexuality is testing mainstream America. &quot;Bisexual,&quot;
is a person that has sex with both men and women. Unlike the word
&quot;lesbianism&quot; or &quot;homosexuality,&quot; which some
of the public can accept as possibly genetic traits, bisexuality
cannot be taken seriously, according to Mero. He argues that amending
the 1964 Civil Rights Act with the word &quot;bisexual&quot; would
be the same as society granting its crowning approval of promiscuous
sexual activity and to renounce marriage and traditional mores.
It would be no different than implying that promiscuity is a genetic
trait. Or it seriously confuses behavior with orientation. Mero
concludes by showing how organized homosexuality has exploited
the Hate Crimes Bill to further their agenda. They did it claiming
victimhood, confusing homosexuality with innate human properties
such as skin color, using bogus studies to support quantitative
claims of discrimination, winning the endorsement of former &quot;conservative&quot;
Republicans, and taking the media along for the ride with their
disregard for facts. Many of the same components exist for the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 17 pp. CONTACT: Family Research

<B>Feminist Jurisprudence: Equal Rights or Neo-Paternalism?</B>
<br>by Michael Weiss and Cathy Young
<P>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 256, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
Cato Associate Policy Analyst, Cathy Young, and University of
Houston Law Professor, Michael Weiss, argue that the rise of feminist
jurisprudence has gone far beyond the original and widely supported
goal of equal treatment for both sexes. According to Young and
Weiss, the new feminist legal theory agenda is to redistribute
power from the &quot;dominant class&quot; (men) to the &quot;subordinate
class&quot; (women), while such key concepts of Western jurisprudence
as judicial neutrality and individual rights are declared to be
patriarchal fictions designed to protect male privilege. Some
feminist-initiated legal reforms have addressed real wrongs such
as the inadequate protection for victims of domestic violence.
However, say Young and Weiss, feminist legal theory has resulted
in increasingly loose and subjective definitions of harassment
and rape, dangerous moves to eviscerate the presumption of innocence
in sexual assault cases, and a broad concept of self-defense in
cases of battered wives. The authors conclude that Courts and
legislatures should not limit individual rights and reaffirm the
fundamental principle of the classical liberal origins of the
movement for women's rights: equality before the law regardless
of gender. 63 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

bad public relations and Presidential vetoes, the 104th Congress

by Christine Olson and Robert Rector
<P>
<I>Issue Bulletin</I>, No. 228, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
According to Christine Olson, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
and Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467) will promote
the moral renewal and economic revitalization of America's most
poverty-stricken urban and rural areas. The bill is sponsored
by Representatives J.C. Watts (OK) and James Talent (MO). It will
use tax incentives, regulatory relief, innovative school reform
pilot projects and homeownership incentives for areas of high
rates of poverty, crime, welfare dependency, joblessness, and
poor schools. Olson and Rector argue that the bill will achieve:
increased job creation; small business expansion and formation;
moral renewal; expanded educational opportunities; greater private
philanthropy to aid the poor; and greater participation by religious
organizations in providing services to the poor. This bill gives
Congress and the Administration an opportunity to change the way
the federal government has been involved in community development
over the last 30 years. The bill realizes that what our nation's
poorest communities need more than larger benefits checks from
the government is economic conditions that enable depressed communities
to become more profitable places for work and businesses. Olson
and Rector conclude that this bill represents an excellent opportunity
to make a bipartisan stand for children by tackling the root causes
of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy. 18 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain,

<br>by Pat Fagan and Wade Horn
<P>
<I>Issue Bulletin</I>, No. 227, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Pat Fagan, William H. G. FitzGerald Fellow in Family and Cultural
Studies at The Heritage Foundation, and Wade Horn, Director of
The National Fatherhood Initiative, illustrate how Congress can
protect the rights of parents to raise their children. They argue
that the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, introduced
by Senator Charles Grassley (IA) and Representative Steve Largent
(OK), will give parents superior standing over government and
its agencies in their children's education and in the protection
and formation of their children's moral character. Fagan and Horn
point out that the bill will declare that parents' rights to direct
the upbringing of their children are fundamental rights which
government can curtail only under conditions of &quot;compelling
interest&quot; and under &quot;strict guidelines&quot; of judicial
procedure, legal terms which guide courts in their decisions.
Overall, they say, the rights of parents as a group are disregarded
or endangered in too many cases by government officials. According
to Fagan and Horn, because of the persistent danger to the fundamental
rights of parents from state court rulings, professional associations,
government bureaucracies, the educational establishment, and international
agencies and bodies, parental rights need codification into law.

<P>
John Walters, President of the New Citizenship Project, and James
O'Gara, Director of Research for the New Citizenship Project,
call for President Clinton to exercise leadership in the war on
drugs. They report that he has a poor record in this area. Interdiction
efforts and prosecution for illegal drugs are down, illegal drug
usage and emergency room admissions are up. Walters and O'Gara
argue that part of the problem has been not appointing effective
leaders in key positions to articulate and enforce a strong antidrug
message, and inappropriate reductions in staff at agencies dedicated
to fighting drugs on the front lines. They call on Congress to
focus federal efforts on law enforcement and programs that work,
and fund only those rehabilitation programs that have a track
record of success. One way to do this is to allow funding for
drug counseling and rehabilitation programs provided by religious
organizations. Walters and O'Gara conclude that American taxpayers
deserve presidential leadership on this issue, and the complexity
of the issue is not an excuse for ineffective policy and lack
of serious effort. 15 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

Edward Lazear, Hoover Senior Fellow, discusses how the culture
wars in America threaten our ability to absorb new immigrants,
and to benefit from the diversity already present in the United
States. He argues that much of the conflict of the culture wars
in America is generated by government policies that reduce the
incentives to become assimilated and emphasize the differences
in the population. Some examples that Lazear lists are: education
in one's native language; unbalanced immigration policies that
result in large and stable ghettos, welfare availability; and
encouragement of a multilingual society by allowing citizens to
vote in languages other than English. Lazear explores patterns
of cultural assimilation and makes recommendations on policy related
to immigration, education, and language that may lead to an end
of the culture wars. 32 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press,

<B>Federal Drug War Ignoring Great Ally: Faith-Based Treatment,
</B><br>
by Robert Maginnis
<P>
<I>Insight</I>, Family Research Council<HR>

<P>
Robert Maginnis, Senior Policy Analyst at the Family Research
Council, illustrates how the government is actively discouraging
some of the most effective programs from drug treatment. Faith-based
drug treatment programs have consistently produced the highest
&quot;cure&quot; rates in the country for treating drug abusers.
State and federal agencies have tried to shut down several faith
based drug treatment centers because their practitioners did not
have proper medical qualifications This is despite the fact that
faith-based treatment has had much higher success rates at a fraction
of the cost of government endorsed centers. Maginnis says that
there are two differing schools of thought on the root causes
of drug addiction. Government agencies mostly believe that it
is a disease and should be treated as such. Faith based treatment
sees addiction as beginning with a moral problem and that treatment
requires an acceptance of moral absolutes. Maginnis says that
as far as drug treatment goes, one size does not fit all. Therefore
a diversity of treatment alternatives, including low cost taxpayer-free
and faith based programs must be available. The government should
not try to fight the drug war alone when the local faith community
can play a vital role in prevention and treatment. 12 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</FONT></B>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Violence Against Women Act Declared Unconstitutional</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CIR won a victory on July 26, 1996, when U.S. District
Judge Jackson L. Diser ruled that the Violence Against Women Act
(&quot;VAWA&quot;), was an impermissible exercise of Congressional
authority under the Commerce Clause and the Enforcement Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. In<I> Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic
and State University</I>, CIR represents Antonio Morrison, a Virginia
Tech football player, who was sued, along with two teammates and
the University itself, by a female who formerly attended the school.
The July 26th Order granted CIR's Motion to Dismiss the case based
on VAWA's unconstitutionality.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At issue in the <I>Brzonkala</I> litigation was the
section of VAWA providing a federal tort remedy for crimes of
violence motivated by an animus toward the victim's gender. Although
the Department of Justice and the National Organization for Women
argued that VAWA was constitutional because of (i) the enormous
impact gender-based crimes have on the national economy and interstate
commerce and (ii) Congress's power to enforce the Equal Protection
Clause, the court disagreed. Judge Kiser ruled that the Supreme
Court's recent decision in <I>Lopez v. United States</I>, striking
down the Gun-Free School Zones Act as beyond Congress's Commerce
Clause power, undermined the arguments of DOJ and NOW. Finding
extensive similarities and few distinctions between the School
Zones Act and VAWA, Judge Kiser held that the latter was also
unconstitutional.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As for the Enforcement Clause claim,  Judge Kiser
points out, VAWA attempts to compensate women who are victims
of violent acts because of their gender, not because of the states'
denial of their Equal Protection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CIR to Represent School Board in Supreme Court</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CIR, along with Michael Carvin of Shaw, Pittman,
Potts and Trowbridge, represents the Bossier Parish School Board
in <I>Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board</I>, a Voting Rights
Act case which should be argued during the Supreme Court's fall
1996 term. This is expected to test a question left unanswered
by the Court in its major Voting Rights decisions of last term:
whether a local government may be forced to create racially gerrymandered
districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bossier Parish is a rural district of northern Louisiana,
with a minority population of about twenty percent. Because of
the highly scattered nature of the minority population, every
voting subdivision in the parish currently has a white majority.
This has not prevented African-Americans from winning local elective
offices in the past.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1993, the Bossier Parish School Board unanimously
accepted a new voting map with twelve districts, all of which
had white majorities. The district lines were based upon nonracial
considerations; an identical plan had already been approved for
use in other elections. Nonetheless, the Justice Department refused
to dilute minority voting strength. This refusal was based in
part on the development by the NAACP of an alternate map, which
would include two oddly-shaped (but majority-minority) districts.
The Justice Department has taken the position that the Voting
Rights Act requires a system of race-based proportional representation,
or, alternately, that the failure to embrace a gerrymandered map
is proof of racist intent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Professor Sues Bowling Green State University
for Sex and Race Discrimination</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Hartman v. Trustees of Bowling Green State
University</I>, CIR is representing Dr. John Hartman, a white
male professor, who has sued Bowling Green and the Accrediting
Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications for
discrimination against him based on his race and sex. The Complaint
was filed July 1, 1996 in Federal District Court in Ohio.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1994, in response to an advertisement, Dr. Hartman,
a tenured professor of Mass Communications at Central Michigan
University, applied for a faculty position that would involve
teaching a class on diversity in media at Bowling Green. Despite
Dr. Hartman's excellent credentials, Bowling Green hired a less
experienced black female without a Ph.D. This hiring decision
came on the heels of the Accrediting Council's withdrawal of full
accreditation from the Bowling Green School of Journalism because
the percentages of women and minorities on its faculty were less
than those in the general population.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Ohio Civil Rights Commission previously concluded
that there was probable cause to believe that Bowling Green discriminated
against Dr. Hartman in this matter.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Union College Sues Maryland Officials
for Religious Discrimination</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In June CIR, along with Co-Counsel R. Hewitt Pate,
Sarah C. Johnson and Mark B. Bierbower of Hunton &amp; Williams,
filed a complaint on behalf of Columbia Union College in Federal
District Court in Maryland. The Complaint alleges First and Fourteenth
Amendment violations, and violations of the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Union is a private college affiliated with
the Seventh-day Adventist Church that applied for funds from the
State of Maryland through the Father Sellinger Program. The Maryland
Higher Education Commission denied the fund request stating that
Columbia Union was &quot;pervasively sectarian.&quot; The Commission
has granted funds to Catholic schools such as Mount St. Mary's
and Loyola University, schools which, although &quot;sectarian,&quot;
are apparently not pervasively so. Columbia Union met all the
other requirements necessary to participate in the program and
asserts that the denial of funding by the Commission constitutes
discrimination on the basis of its religious beliefs and speech.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CIR wins reversal in Fourth Circuit in <BR>
<I><B>Smith v. VCU</B></I></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Smith, et al v. Virginia Commonwealth University</I>,
CIR is representing five male professors at VCU who claimed sex
discrimination when the school gave an en masse raise to female
professors in 1992. On May 10, 1996 an <I>en banc</I> panel of
the Fourth Circuit issued a decision reversing a district court's
grant of summary judgment for the University. The opinion of the
court obtained the support of six judges with three judges concurring
and five dissenting.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>en banc</I> decision rejected VCU's attempt
to justify the raises with a regression analysis showing pay disparity
between the genders. The court said that there was an issue of
material fact whether some of the factors excluded from VCU's
study-like performance, productivity and merit-skewed the results
and permitted a false finding of &quot;gender disparity.&quot;

<HR>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>High Court to Decide Who Can Sue Under ESA</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on November
13, 1996 in <I>Bennett v. Spears</I>, to determine whether a property
owner may assert an injury to an economic interest or constitutionally
protected property right under the citizens suit provision of
the Endangered Species Act (ESA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners are two individual ranchers and two irrigation
districts in southern Oregon who rely on water from a series of
federally-operated reservoirs known as the Klamath Project. The
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
determined that a minimum level of water needed to be maintained
in the reservoirs to preserve endangered fish species that inhabit
the reservoirs. However, maintaining this water level threatened
Petitioners' beneficial and productive use of their property by
making the supply of irrigation water irregular.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners filed a &quot;citizen's suit&quot; under
Section 11(g)(1) of the ESA, challenging the decision on the ground
that the government failed to consider economic factors in making
the decision. The federal district court dismissed the suit, and
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding
that the petitioners' economic interest did not fall within the
&quot;zone of interests&quot; protected by the ESA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders has argued that Congress specifically included
economic factors among those to be considered in making decisions
under the ESA. Furthermore, protecting private property rights
and economic interests is an integral part of species conservation.
Therefore, economic interests are within the &quot;zone of interest&quot;
protected by the ESA and petitioners should have standing to bring
a citizen's suit to protect those interests.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Federal Pressure on Local School Board Violates
Constitution</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Sakaria &amp; Hillman v. Dare County (North
Carolina) Board of Education</I>, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
orchestrated the condemnation of private beachfront property for
wetland mitigation, by backing a county school board into a corner
over a required wetland permit. The owners of the property that
is being condemned are now petitioning the United States Supreme
Court to review their case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners Elpis Sakaria and Mr. and Mrs. Hillman
each purchased a residential beachfront lot on Cape Hatteras Island,
North Carolina, to build a retirement home. Adjacent to the lots
is the local school. In 1988 the School Board needed to expand
the school's athletic field, to qualify the school for accreditation.
The Board owned 12.5 acres next door, enough for the expansion.
However, the Army Corps delineated 3 acres &quot;wetland,&quot;
and arbitrarily required the Board to create 1.84 acres of wetland
for each acre of wetland used to expand the field.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From 1988 to 1992, the Army Corps rejected 41 sites
suggested for mitigation. With time growing short to obtain accreditation,
the Board &quot;negotiated&quot; an outcome with the Corps: the
Corps would grant a permit if the application included creating
a .5-acre wetland on the Sakaria and Hillman properties. The Board
filed the permit application, and immediately began to condemn
the private property. The property owners challenged the validity
of the condemnation of their property on Fifth and Tenth Amendment
grounds, but so far have been unsuccessful in court.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders will file a brief <I>amici curaie</I> supporting
a Petition for Writ of Certiorari before the United States Supreme
Court arguing that 1) coercion by the Army Corps of the county
school board to carry out a federal objective at the local level
violates the Tenth Amendment and 2) a state agency violates the
Fifth Amendment when it uses its power of eminent domain to accomplish
a federal purpose unrelated to its narrow grant of eminent domain
authority.<BR>

<P>
<B>Hog-Wild Regulators Jeopardize Family Farm</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Warren family has been raising hogs in Chesapeake,
Virginia for three generations. But Earl Warren's livelihood is
now at risk because of a new city ordinance enacted specifically
to regulate him out of business.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For over sixty years, the Warrens have operated a
traditional feed-lot hog farm. Over time, urban expansion has
moved into rural areas and now surrounds their farm. The Warrens,
however, have been able to adapt up until now by simply down-sizing
their operation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Recently, the city has grown more aggressive in its
effort to make Chesapeake hog-fee, and adopted a new swine control
ordinance in April of 1992. Despite Mr. Warren's good faith attempts
to conform his hog-farming practices to the ordinance, many of
its mandates are arbitrary and have nothing to do with public
health and safety-making full compliance impossible. Indeed, the
farm has continued to comply with applicable environmental standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If Mr. Warren does not fully comply, however, he
faces being shut down as a &quot;public nuisance.&quot; This flies
in the face of the U.S. Supreme Court's admonition in <I>Lucas
v. South Carolina Coastal Council</I> that a legislature cannot
simply decree a historically lawful use of property a &quot;nuisance&quot;
without compensation being paid to the owner. In a lawsuit filed
against Mr. Warren on March 30, 1995, the city has openly stated
in court that its goal is to permanently close down the farm.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even though the city is suing Mr. Warren, it has
not yet met its own burden of demonstrating that the farm is a
nuisance according to Virginia common law. Defenders' attorney
Barry C. Hodge is defending Mr. Warren in Circuit Court in Chesapeake.
A trial was held on September 8, 1995, but the court has stayed
its decision to hear further evidence as to the feasibility of
complying with the ordinance.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Sell Columbia Gas Eight Inches and They'll Take
Fifty Feet</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1995, Deana Drain and her husband Robert were
forced, at their own expense, to move their home and shed to comply
with a utility company's claim of a fifty-foot right-of-way for
the gas line that crosses their .44 acre lot in Randolph County,
West Virginia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1950, a right-of-way was sold to the gas company
across what is now the Drain's property to install an eight-inch
gas pipeline. The agreement did not specify the width of the right-of-way,
therefore full use was made of the property over the years. A
shed was built six inches from the line in 1962, and the Drains
installed their modular home seven and a half feet from it in
1992.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In April of 1993, however, Columbia Gas informed
the drains that their buildings encroached on the company's newly
claimed fifty-foot right-of-way, and later sued the Drains to
force them to move the buildings. According to Columbia, the Drains
cannot put any structures-including fences and trees-within twenty-five
feet of either side of the pipeline. The new easement affects
one-third of their property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Gas bases its authority of federal pipeline
safety standards. Columbia asserts that these regulations allow
it to claim a fifty-foot right of way without having to purchase
the Drains' property through eminent domain. Federal regulation,
however, does not require a gas company to maintain a fifty-foot
right-of-way. Another inconsistency is that many other property
owners have buildings within the claimed easement boundaries who
have not been force to move them under pressure from the gas company.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With Defenders serving as co-counsel, the Drains
filed a counterclaim alleging Columbia Gas's action was an unconstitutional
taking of their private property. After a three-day non-jury trial,
parties are now preparing post-trial documents.<BR>

Rights Violation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioner, Mrs. Evelyn Smith, earns a living by
renting four townhouses she owns in Chico, California. Due to
her religious beliefs, she refused to rent a townhouse to an unmarried
heterosexual couple. The couple complained to the California Fair
Employment and Housing Commission, which found Mrs. Smith guilty
of unlawful &quot;marital status discrimination&quot; under state
law and prohibited Mrs. Smith from excluding heterosexual unmarried
couples from her property, even though &quot;heterosexual couples&quot;
is not a constitutionally protected class. The California Supreme
Court affirmed the decision, stating that Mrs. Smith could have
avoided the conflict &quot;by selling her units and redeploying
the capital in other investments.&quot; Mrs. Smith has petitioned
the United States Supreme Court to review the decision, on the
basis that the California law violates her First Amendment right
to religious free exercise and her Fifth Amendment property rights.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders presented the Fifth Amendment argument
in its brief to the Court supporting Mrs. Smith's petition for
review, that the California law violates Fifth Amendment rights.
Specifically, the law deprives Mrs. Smith of her right to exclude
others, which is among the property rights protected by the Fifth
Amendment Just Compensation Clause, and which has been identified
by the United States Supreme Court as one of the most fundamental
aspects of property ownership.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Challenge to Large-Lot Zoning on Chappaquiddick</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will hear
a challenge to a local zoning by-law that imposes a three-acre
minimum to build on residential lots on Chappaquiddick. The purported
public interest underlying the three-acre minimum was environmental
protection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioner Herring Creek Farm owns 215 acres of residential
property on the Island and had planned to develop it with homes
on one-acre lots for low- to moderate-income families. At trial,
Herring Creek showed that the three acre minimum did not advance
the stated environmental goals and further that the large lot
sizes makes home ownership nearly impossible for middle- and lower-income
families. The trial court upheld the by-law. This appeal to the
highest court in the state followed directly from that decision,
bypassing the intermediate appeals court due to the interest in
the high court in establishing statewide guidance on this issue.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders argued as <I>amicus curiae</I> supporting
Herring Creed that the zoning restriction is constitutionally
invalid because it fails to &quot;substantially advance&quot;
the government interest in protecting the environment. The United
States Supreme Court has held that a law that derogates from private
property rights is invalid if the law does not substantially advance
the goal sought to be achieved by the law. Oral argument is currently
scheduled before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.<BR>

<B>Indians Claim Right to Harvest Shellfish on Private Property</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Years before Washington became a state, the United
States purchased by treaty from 16 Northwest Indian Tribes the
right to use the beach and surrounding upland in Puget Sound.
Under the treaties, the Tribes retained their right to take &quot;fish&quot;
from all customary locations not staked off or occupied by settlers.
The State of Washington later took title to the tidelands and
sold them to private citizens. These private landowners have &quot;seeded&quot;
the tidelands to create new shellfish beds, and have harvested
the shellfish, enjoying exclusive use and quiet enjoyment of the
tidelands for over a century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Now the United States-on behalf of the Tribes-is
suing the State of Washington, claiming that the Tribes' right
to &quot;fish&quot; includes the right to harvest shellfish even
on privately owned tidelands. The United States has offered no
payment of just compensation for its destruction of these private
property rights on behalf of the Indian Tribes. The outcome of
this case between the federal and state governments will affect
200,000 private property owners. The federal district court decided
the case in favor of the Tribes. The case is now before the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders filed a brief <I>amicus curiae</I> in the
Ninth Circuit on behalf of 65,000 members of the Upland Property
Owners of Washington (UPOW), which has intervened in the lawsuit.
Defenders advanced three property rights arguments. First, the
United States' claim to fishing rights for the Tribes constitutes
a physical invasion of private property and second, destroys the
private owners' investment-backed expectations in the tidelands.
Third, Defenders argued that the government's position in this
case violates the Equal Footing Doctrine, which requires that
any state admitted to the Union must be granted all rights and
privileges given to the original thirteen states.<BR>

<B>Milwaukee School Choice Action</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As expected, Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge Paul Higginbotham
in August refused to lift an injunction preventing Milwaukee school
children from attending religious schools in the choice program,
and ruled that the program violates the religion clause of the
Wisconsin Constitution. However, the judge dissolved the remainder
of the injunction, meaning that at least 300 more youngsters will
be able to attend nonsectarian schools this year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ruling followed four hours of testimony and three
hours of oral argument. Former Milwaukee Public Schools superintendent
Howard Fuller led off with testimony on why the choice program
is essential not only to expand opportunities for minority and
economically disadvantaged kids, but to foment needed reform in
the public schools.  Zakiya Courtney testified on the real-world
effects of the program and the injunction. Two parents, Pilar
Gonzalez and Val Johnson-representing hundreds of others-offered
personal perspectives on what private schools have meant for their
children and economic burdens the families face in keeping them
there. Harvard professor Paul Peterson testified on his recent
study finding substantial academic gains among choice students.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unfortunately, it was clear that Judge Higginbotham,
though moved by IJ's witnesses' testimony, found the religious
school aspect of the program untenable. He concluded that the
Wisconsin Constitution is more prohibitive than the First Amendment,
and that the program's &quot;primary effect&quot; is to advance
religion.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But Judge Higginbotham was not persuaded that the
plaintiffs showed a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on their
other state constitutional claims, so he lifted the rest of the
injunction on the enrollment caps. That means the number of eligible
students increases from 1,500 to 15,000; and that schools may
enroll up to 100 percent of their students from the choice program
(up from 65 percent.) Last year, about 1,500 choice students were
enrolled in nonsectarian schools in the choice program. This year,
about 1,900 applied to nonsectarian schools. They now will be
able to attend, which also somewhat relieves the pressure on the
PAVE program to provide scholarships.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the litigation front, IJ will attempt to extricate
the religion issues from the remainder of the case and seek an
immediate appeal of that portion of the judge's ruling. The non-religion
issues are schedule for three rounds of briefs and argument before
Judge Higginbotham over the next three months. Also, on the eve
of the hearing, the NAACP filed a lawsuit claiming the expanded
program promotes racial segregation. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Religious School Choice in Vermont</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The IJ will file a lawsuit this week against the State of Vermont
on behalf of the Chittenden school board. The board voted to include
religious high schools among those available to students at public
expense. (Vermont towns that have no public  high schools pay
tuition for students at neighboring public high schools or private
schools.) Contending that tuition payment at religious schools
chosen by parents violates the First Amendment, the state has
cut off all education funds to the town, even though the portion
that would be allocated for religious high school tuition constitutes
only two percent of the town's education funding.</FONT><BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The IJ will seek a preliminary injunction in state
court, arguing that (1) including religious schools among the
options does not violate the First Amendment, (2) exclusion of
religious schools violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,
and (3) the cutoff of state funds exceeds the state's authority.

<B>Landmark Legal Foundation Blasts Senate Ethics Committee</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Landmark Legal Foundation, co-counsel to former RTC
criminal investigator L. Jean Lewis, who last year testified before
the Senate Special Committee investigating Whitewater, blasted
the Senate Ethics Committee for its failure to sanction Maryland
Senator Paul Sarbanes and the Whitewater Committee's minority
chief counsel, Richard Ben-Veniste, for their use of a private
letter written by Lewis, which was &quot;undeleted&quot; from
a computer diskette.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Ethics Committee completely abdicated its
responsibility to Ms. Lewis and to all Americans. Senators and
Senate staffers are not above the law,&quot; said Landmark President
Mark R. Levin, who filed the ethics complaint on Lewis's behalf
last December. &quot;They are not free to behave as rogue federal
police violating the privacy rights of witnesses appearing before
Congress. Nor are they free to take a witness's personal property,
which they did in this case.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Lewis's 22-page personal letter, which was unrelated
to Lewis's work in investigating Madison Guaranty Savings and
Loan and the Whitewater Development Corporation, was apparently
retrieved by computer technicians from a computer diskette Lewis
produced in response to the Senate Whitewater Committee's subpoena
for information relevant to her investigative work. Since her
letter was not subject to the Whitewater Committee's subpoena
as it fell outside its subject matter and time frame, when Senator
Sarbanes and Ben-Veniste retrieved it from the diskette they violated
Ms. Lewis's Fourth Amendment privacy rights.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Astonishingly, the Ethics Committee did not
talk with Ms. Lewis or her counsel at any time during the nine
months following the filing of the complaint, though it apparently
interviewed Senator Sarbanes and Ben-Veniste to return to Ms.
Lewis her personal property; and, it offered no explanation or
justification for its summary dismissal of our complaint,&quot;
declared Levin. &quot;When the Constitution can be so easily trampled,
when an individual's rights can be so easily ignored, and when
Ethics Committee members close their eyes to these abuses, there
is something terribly wrong in the U.S. Senate.&quot;<BR>

<B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Federal Appeals Court to Determine
Whether Students' Rights to Free Speech Includes Giving Religious
Messages At Graduation Ceremonies</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On August 14, 1996, the Eleventh Circuit Court of
Appeals reheard oral arguments in the case of <I>Adler v. Duval
County School Board</I>. This case is on appeal from a decision
of a federal district court in Florida which held that a school
board policy permitting students to determine what type of graduation
message they would give does not violate the Constitution, even
if that message includes religious speech. Arguments were presented
to the Eleventh Circuit in March 1995 on this case. The court
did not hand down a decision, but instead has asked to hear further
argument.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The case began in May 1993 by challenging a school
board policy allowing the graduating senior class to elect to
have two minutes of uncensored speech to open or close the graduation
ceremonies. If the students chose to utilize the two minutes,
they would then elect a fellow student to address the class. The
content of the message was to be determined by the student addressing
the class and was not to be censored by the school. The school
policy allowed students to give any type of message, from poetic
speech to religious speech. During the 1993 graduation ceremonies
of the 17 schools in Duval County, 6 senior classes chose either
no message or a secular message, while the remaining 11 chose
a religious message.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ACLU brought suit on behalf of 3 students against
the Duval County School Board arguing that this policy allowed
religious messages or prayer and thus violated the First Amendment.
Liberty Counsel, a religious civil liberties legal defense organization,
intervened on behalf of 11 students to defend the school policy,
arguing that the free speech rights of students was at stake.
If the school board were to lose the case, the students' free
speech rights would be taken away.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The men and women of northwestern Montana and northern
Idaho have just as much right to sue regarding violations of federal
environmental statutes as do organized environmental groups says
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In a decision
reversing a federal district court ruling, the appeals court held
that rural residents of the timber producing area have legal standing
regarding environmental issues despite the fact that their primary
concern is economic. In addition, the court held that statutes
governing the management of national forests are dedicated to
timber harvesting activities and that the local resident may sue
to challenge U.S. Forest Service decisions reducing allowable
timber harvests.<BR>

<B>MSLF Help Stops U.S. Forest Service</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A property owner in northern California says the
willingness of MSLF to provide her legal assistance brought an
almost immediate concession from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS),
even before MSLF filed a single document. For years, the USFS
had used the property of Kate Novoa without permission. Yet when
she objected, the USFS asserted that it had an easement over her
land. Remarkably, the USFS never produced documented proof of
its alleged easement. When Ms. Novoa advised USFS officials that
MSLF was willing to provide her legal assistance, the USFS suddenly
discovered that it had no easement over her land and agreed to
end its use of her property.<BR>

<B>Forest Service Ignores Facts - Locks Out Miners</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Clinton Administration officials have taken steps
to prevent mining in Park County, Colorado by creating what they
call the Hoosier Ridge Research Natural Area (RNA). But in so
doing, they have ignored the fact that the proposed area does
not meet the requirements of federal regulation that the area
be &quot;virgin&quot; and &quot;unmodified&quot; by act of man.
In addition, the area contains numerous mining claims of which
the federal government is well aware. Remarkably, none of the
federal documents supporting the creation of the Hoosier Ridge
NRA addresses the fact that the are is neither &quot;virgin&quot;
nor &quot;unmodified&quot; or the fact that mining claims are
present. As a result, MSLF filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Park
County Mining Association and others seeking to have the RNA classification

for the Sixth Circuit split 7 to 7 on overturning an earlier holding

that the phrase &quot;valid existing rights&quot; did not protect
the riparian rights of lake front property owners. A ruling by
a three judge panel of the Sixth Circuit that upheld the Michigan
court was vacated when an <I>en banc</I> hearing was granted.
Judge Danny Boggs, in a 40-page opinion, chastised both the federal

<FONT SIZE=2>In a case involving the Montana man who has become
the poster child for Endangered Species Act (ESA) abuse, the Interior
Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) has ruled that self defense may not
be claimed in the death of a grizzly bear. John Shuler, who killed
a grizzly bear when confronted in his own yard, was convicted
of a violation of the ESA despite his plea of self defense. An
Administrative Law Judge ruled that although Shuler reasonably
feared for his life (the necessary precedent for the use of deadly
force), he could not claim self-defense since he was at fault
for introducing himself into &quot;the zone of imminent danger.&quot;
The IBLA upheld that remarkable ruling, declaring that since Shuler
knew a grizzly bear was outside, he should not have left his house.
Since the IBLA's ruling conflicts with the law on self-defense
(a homeowner may confront an armed intruder on his own property),
MSLF will file a lawsuit in federal court.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Applewood Corporation wants to convert a vacant commercial
building in Dummerston, Vermont into a day care center. But its
plan hit a roadblock in Vermont's Act 250. A jurisdictional opinion
by Vermont's Environmental Board held that the Town did not have
authority over this small-scale project (which the Town meeting
has approved) because the Town had not used proper procedures
to adopt its subdivision rules. That let the state-wide Board
assert authority over the project.<BR>
</FONT>

while they were on strike. The case involves a labor dispute at
Yankee Gas. The company offered a raise but announced a plan to
later change medical benefits. The union did not immediately strike,
but refused to commit to staying on the job during negotiations.
Realizing that would leave its operations at the union's mercy,
Yankee put its offer into effect. The union promptly struck and
its members filed for unemployment benefits.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The state ordered benefits paid to the workers because
it felt portions of Yankee's offer were inferior to the prior
contract. Yankee appealed. NELF's <I>amicus</I> brief with the
Superior Court, in the name of the Connecticut Business and Industry
Association argued that the refusal to commit to staying on the
job prevented the union from claiming a lockout. The judge agreed
and reversed the order to pay unemployment benefits. He also noted
that the state should have reviewed the final offer to see if,
viewed as a package, it was inferior to the expired contract.

have met requirements of Rule 23. Because it did not, the court
vacated the settlement.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unless reversed, the consequences of this decision
on business and the judicial system will be dramatic and negative.
Instead of one comprehensive and fair settlement that resolves
the issue and caps businesses' exposure, there will be years of
litigation with inconsistent judgments, enormous legal expenses
and a lack of predictability. The upshot will be that, while some
plantiffs may get more money, many will get less, far more money
will be spent on legal fees and kept by plaintiffs' lawyers, and
courts will be crowded with hundreds of thousands of complex,
repetitious cases.<BR>

<B>NELF Help Bring Massachusetts Tax Law Into the 21 Century</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court has acknowledged
the &quot;assistance&quot; received from an <I>amicus</I> brief
prepared by NELF in a tax case which tested whether the state's
tax coded can be adapted to modern manufacturing techniques. The
case, <I>Houghton-Mifflin Co. v. Commissioners of Revenue</I>,
involved whether a major publisher, which had subcontracted a
number of physical tasks like binding while continuing to perform
high technology work like organizing texts and designing CD/ROMS,
was entitled to retain its manufacturing status. Manufacturing
status provides a business with significant tax incentives to
increase investment and employment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NELF's brief, filed on behalf of Associated Industries
of Massachusetts, argued that continuation of the exemption in
this case was reasonable application of the 1930's-era law to
today's changed conditions.<BR>

<B>Court Allows Second Bite at the Apple</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>California Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) is
fighting tooth and nail to get a &quot;second bite at the apple.&quot;
He and a handful of his supporters have filed suit in federal
court trying yet again to strike down term limits. Furthermore,
Bates' bid to undo the state term limits is being given a sympathetic
ear by a federal trial court that is disregarding PLF's precedent-setting
victory in <I>Legislature v. Eu</I> and is heading down its own
path requiring the validity of Proposition 140 to be litigated
through the court system all over again!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The court has refused to dismiss the lawsuit and
has given Mr. Bates great latitude to make up arguments for keeping
his suit alive. For instance, the Berkeley lawmaker has argued
that since he was not individually named as a party to the first
Proposition 140 lawsuit, he was not bound by it. Well, Mr. Bates
may not have been named in that prior suit, but an investigation
of documents filed with the Fair Practices Commission revealed
that he helped underwrite it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Public records show that Mr. Bates spent $12,000
trying to defeat Proposition 140 at the ballot box, and when that
failed, he paid another $1,000 directly to the law firm that represented
the Legislature in the California Supreme Court for the purpose
of supporting the first challenge to state term limits. In addition,
a subpoena of that law firm's billing records revealed that not
only did Tom Bates help finance <I>Legislature v. Eu</I> litigation,
but 39 of his colleagues who were not parties to that case also
contributed to the lawsuit- to the tune of $229,000! With this
information  in hand, PLF went back to federal court demanding
again that Mr. Bates be bound by the first lawsuit and that his
suit be dismissed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In spite of Mr. Bates' obvious involvement in the
prior case, the federal court decided that he could start the
case all over again in her court because in her opinion his contribution
was too small a sum to buy him &quot;control&quot; over the prior
lawsuit. The court would not accept that 58 legislators challenged
Proposition 140 in 1991 by either lending their names to the complaint
or by opening their pocketbooks, with nonparty legislators underwriting
 half the lawsuit. Instead the court has permitted the lawmaker's
lawyers to recruit two Democratic Assemblywomen, Barbara Friedman
and Martha Escutia, as additional plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

<P>
<B>Voting Districts Drawn by Race Rules Unconstitutional</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In another victory for equal protection, the United
States Supreme Court held on June 13, that election districts
in Texas and North Carolina that were drawn along racial boundaries
are unconstitutional. PLF argued in both cases that race is an
inappropriate criteria for drawing lines for congressional districts
and that the interests of all Americans are ill-served by political
boundaries that isolate minority voters in so-called &quot;majority-minority&quot;
districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Texas' 18th, 29th, 30th and North Carolina's 12th
congressional districts were oddly configured and bizarre in their
geographic configurations. There was nothing compact or contiguous
about the districts in question which were drawn for the sole
purpose of assuring the election of black representatives, while
completely disregarding traditional districting principles. In
both cases, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the arguments made
by PLF which has long advocated individual rights over group rights
and the necessity for government to act in a color-blind manner,
both in the context of &quot;affirmative action&quot; programs
and in the context of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court
also rebuffed the Department of Justice's continuing attempts
to coerce states into a &quot;max-black&quot; scheme of maximizing
the number of minority districts, even when there is no compelling
reason to do so.<BR>

<B>Fate of Santa Monica Rent Control Before State Supreme Court</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under the pretext of &quot;helping the poor and the
elderly&quot; the Santa Monica rent control bureaucrats have been
taking rental property owners to the cleaners while expanding
the scope of regulation and control of rental properties throughout
the city. And yet, despite the economic and social harms it causes,
rent control remains a source of long-term security and prosperity
for the bureaucrats and huge administrative staffs need to keep
the program operating.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Using 1980-1990 census data from Berkeley, Santa
Monica, and Cotati, a California Apartment Association-PLF Rent
Control Project study reveals the damaging impact rent control
has on housing and people-particularly the poor, minorities and
the elderly. The study proves the bureaucrats wrong, rent control
does not accomplish what was originally intended, and this is
evidence that cannot be ignored.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The CAA-PLF Rent Control Project fired its first
salvo in the war against rent control on March 16, 1994, against
the City of Santa Monica. That suit charged, among other things,
that Santa Monica's rent control ordinance effects an uncompensated
taking of private property in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
In addition to showing that the rent regulations fail to advance
any legitimate governmental interest (and therefore are unconstitutional),
the suit challenges the local rent board's bizarre accounting
practices and determined whether owners receive a &quot;fair return.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A trial court threw out PLF's lawsuit claiming the
rent control board had a &quot;rational basis&quot; for imposing
its restrictions. Under this weak standard, rental property owners
have little hope of successfully challenging such measures as
unconstitutional takings. Fortunately, the California Court of
Appeal overturned that trial court decision in this case, ruling
that courts must not take challenges to rent control too lightly
and instead must examine such cases with a higher level of scrutiny.
In so holding, the court unanimously rejected the idea-urged by
the Rent Control Board and accepted by the trial judge-that courts
must uphold rent ordinances if they can imagine any conceivable
rational basis for enactment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The court determined that if rental property owners
can prove that a rent control law has denied them economically
viable use of their land or fails to substantially advance a legitimate
government interest, then that law &quot;goes too far.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In so ruling, the Court of Appeal ordered the trial
court to conduct a full trial and hear PLF's damaging evidence.
Greatly disturbed by the prospect of having to defend its rent
control regime and accompanying socialist policies, the city sought
refuge in the California Supreme Court where the case presently
sits.<BR>

<B>SLF Again Mounts Legal Assault on City of Atlanta &quot;Domestic
Partnership&quot; Ordinance</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The city of Atlanta in September enacted a &quot;domestic
partners&quot; ordinance, allowing for non-married<B> </B>partners
of City employees to receive healthcare and other benefits. SLF
filed suit in local superior court challenging the constitutionality
of the ordinance. A similar ordinance was enacted in 1993, and
SLF's lawsuit against the City in that case was successfully decided
by the Georgia Supreme Court. The Court held that the City ordinance
defined specifically both &quot;dependence&quot; and &quot;family&quot;
for purposes of justifying the extension of employee benefits
in a manner which conflicted with the state constitution and statutes
and was therefore unconstitutional and void.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the present case, the City ordinance similarly
defines &quot;dependent&quot; in a manner which SLF attorneys
contend conflicts with state law. In a press conference held in
Atlanta in September to announce the lawsuit, SLF President Matthew
J. Glavin told the press corps, &quot;Atlanta has once again crossed
the line drawn by the General Assembly and the Georgia Supreme
Court by attempting to recognize relationships not recognized
at the state level. We trust that this lawsuit will once and for
all put an end to the City's illegal efforts.&quot; <BR>

<B>FDA's Dr. Kessler Ordered to Give Deposition</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF scored a major victory in its ongoing litigation
against Dr. David Kessler and the Food and Drug Administration
regarding the FDA's ban on dissemination of vital medical literature
to doctors on the off-label use of FDA approved drugs and devices.
In <I>WLF v. Kessler</I>, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia recently denied Dr. Kessler's attempts to prevent
WLF attorneys from taking his deposition regarding this clearly
unconstitutional FDA policy of censorship, and ordered him to
appear for a two-hour deposition. Justice Department and FDA attorneys,
however, are seeking to appeal that decision.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>WLF Represents Congressmen Seeking to Uphold &quot;3/5 Rule&quot;
on Taxes</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit in <I>Skaggs v. Carle</I> on behalf of 22
U.S. Senators and Representatives who are defending the constitutionality
of the House's recently adopted &quot;3/5 Rule&quot; on taxes.
The rule, which requires a three-fifths vote rather than a simple
majority to raise taxes, is under attack by several Democrats
in the House and a variety of liberal organizations.  WLF's brief
argues that the plaintiffs claims are not justiciable and the
Constitution imposes no restraints on the House of Representatives'
power to adopt procedural rules.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Supporting Tort Reform for Municipal Governments</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to throw
out a huge tort award imposed on an Oklahoma county because one
of its deputy sheriffs allegedly used excessive force when pulling
a motorist from her car during a traffic stop following a high-speed
chase. WLF argued in <I>Bryan County v. Brown</I> that while public-sector
employees can be sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 if they
violate someone's constitutional rights, a municipality should
not be held liable for the actions of its employees unless those
actions were taken pursuant to some established municipal policy.
WLF urged the Court to reject the lower court's determination
that such a policy can be found to exist based simply on the municipality's
alleged negligence in hiring the deputy sheriff. WLF argued that
plaintiffs should be required to demonstrate that the municipality
repeatedly has made negligent hiring decisions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>WLF Demands Probe of FDA's Contacts with Plaintiffs' Bar</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently demanded that HHSs Inspector General
launch an investigation of meetings between senior FDA officials
and members of the plaintiffs' bar. FDA officials have had repeated
contacts with plaintiffs' lawyers who are pushing FDA to take
action unfavorable to the many pharmaceutical and medical device
companies who are targets of class action lawsuits. WLF recently
determined through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that FDA
has been failing to keep written records of all such meetings,
as it is required to do by law. WLF is demanding that the Inspector
General investigate the full extent of the violations by senior
FDA personnel. WLF charges that by attempting to hide their meetings
with plaintiffs' lawyers, FDA officials create the impression
that the agency has become beholden to a politically powerful
interest group, at the expense of the health and safety of the
American people.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>High Court Sides with WLF in First Amendment Challenge to FEC
Rule</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Supreme Court in late June struck down a Federal
Election Commission rule that restricted party committees in making
independent expenditures in connection with congressional elections.
The ruling in <I>Colorado Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. v. FEC</I>
was a victory for WLF, which had represented eight Members of
Congress as well as former Senator Eugene McCarthy in the case.
The High Court accepted WLF's argument that the First Amendment
prohibits restrictions on the type of independent political speech
(i.e., campaign spending not directly controlled by a candidate)
at issue in this case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Court Once Again Says No to Racial Gerrymandering</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Supreme Court in late June struck down racially
gerrymandered congressional districts in North Carolina and Texas,
holding that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits using race
as the predominant factor in drawing electoral lines. In the Texas
case, <I>Bush v. Vera</I>, WLF had represented Linda Chavez's
Center for Equal Opportunity and several Members of Congress who
opposed dividing the electorate along racial lines. WLF argued
that racial gerrymandering is unnecessary to permit blacks and
Hispanics to compete in elections on an equal footing and promotes
divisiveness between people of different races.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Commercial Speech Rights Supported</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF continued its strong advocacy of commercial speech
when it argued this month in the Maryland Court of Appeals (that
state's highest court) that Maryland may not constitutionally
restrict the right of businesses to advertise going-out-of-business
sales. Maryland imposes strict licensing requirements on all such
advertising and has been attempting to fine a furniture store
that advertised a liquidation sale without first jumping through
all necessary bureaucratic hoops. WLF argues in <I>Jakanna Woodworks,
Inc. v. Montgomery County</I> that the First Amendment bars Maryland
from attempting to suppress advertising that the State does not
claim is false or misleading and that calls attention to activities
that are fully legal (indeed, that are not even subject to regulation
in Maryland).<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>National Fatherhood Initiative
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;




	On almost every indicator of child well-being, children today fare worse than their counterparts just a generation ago. The reason: the dramatic rise, over the last thirty years, in the number of children living in fatherless households.  Indeed, children growing up without fathers are more likely to fail at school or to drop out, engage in early sexual activity, develop drug and alcohol problems, and experience or perpetrate violence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Fatherhood Initiative was founded three years ago to counter the growing problem of fatherlessness by stimulating a broad-based social movement to restore responsible fatherhood as a national priority. With the support and involvement of such notable Americans as former U.S. Education Secretary <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>, actor James Earl Jones, and pollster George Gallup, we developed the following three-part strategy for ensuring that more children grow up with a loving father. <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

First, we are pursuing an aggressive public education campaign highlighting the importance of fathers to the well-being of children and communities.  In fact, NFI has netted nearly 20,000 media mentions over the past two years. In addition, we have developed, in conjunction with the Ad Council, a national public service announcement (PSA) campaign to raise the awareness of every American that fathers make unique and irreplaceable contributions to the lives of their children, and that collectively we need to support and encourage men to be good and responsible fathers. One of these ads has appeared nearly a half dozen times in <i>USA Today</i>. In partnership with Radio America, we have also developed a series of two dozen radio PSAs featuring such prominent Americans as former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, Senator Dan Coats, General Colin Powell, Senator Bill Bradley, Congressman and former Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent, and Penn State football coach Joe Paterno.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Second, we are organizing coalitions of national and local community leaders committed to creating a culture that values and supports good fathers. In October of 1994, we convened the first ever National Summit on Fatherhood in Dallas, Texas, where hundreds of our nation's civic, business, and philanthropic leaders gathered to begin building a national consensus on the need to quickly reduce father absence. We then organized and hosted an interfaith leadership summit on fatherhood in June 1996. This summit attracted dozens of representatives from various faiths who discussed ideas for encouraging, both individually and collectively, engaged fathering.  Additionally, we are partnering with national civic organizations, including United Way of America and Boys and Girls Clubs of America, to stimulate local voluntary efforts toward father-friendly community building.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We are also increasingly working with the nation's governors.  For example, NFI was recently awarded a contract by the Virginia  Department of Health to implement a state-wide fatherhood promotion campaign as part of Governor George Allen's citizen empowerment initiative.  As the coordinator of this effort, NFI developed a series of state-specific PSAs, hosted local fatherhood forums throughout the state, and developed a resource center to assist grassroots organizations and individuals to implement local fatherhood promotion efforts.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to our work in Virginia, NFI has been asked to provide consultation and advice to such diverse governors as William Weld of Massachusetts, Roy Romer of Colorado, Pete Wilson of California, and Birch Bayh of Indiana, as each seeks to find ways to promote, rather than discourage, responsible fatherhood through state policy initiatives. To help support our state policy work, NFI recently co-authored a document entitled "Seven Things States Can Do To Promote Responsible Fatherhood." Published by the NGA's Council of Governors' Policy Advisors, this report has been widely disseminated to state and local government officials.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Third, we are taking our pro-fatherhood message directly to individual men.  Through the skill building and community resource materials, we provide information on how men can become better fathers, and how local communities can promote, encourage, and support fathers.  One of our most successful publications, Father Facts, contains national data on trends in fatherhood, as well as research documenting the negative consequences of father absence.  We also publish a resource catalogue containing books, tapes, and other fatherhood products.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is substantial evidence that our efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Whether reflected in stadiums filled with Promise Keepers, the streets of our nation's capital inundated with Million Man Marchers, or news stories highlighting the connection between absent fathers and such diverse social ills as crime, educational failure and welfare dependency, fatherhood is in the air. Virtually everyone-from Dan Quayle to Bill Clinton-now agrees: fathers matter, and they matter a lot more than many had previously realized.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The job, however, is only half done.  Though few still argue seriously that fathers are superfluous, the number of children growing up in father absent households continues to rise.  This year, more than a million children will experience the divorce or separation of their parents. An additional 1.3 million babies will be fathered out of wed-lock. Overall, nearly 2.5 million children will join the ranks of the fatherless.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certainly, much has been accomplished.  But we must not delude ourselves into believing that the struggle to renew fatherhood has been won. Far too many children grow up in homes without fathers. The most important battles are still before us.  Achieving attitudinal change may be hard; but behavioral change is even harder.  And that is what our children need most of all.

<b>Neoisolationism and Global Realities,</b> by Murray Weidenbaum<p>
<i>Policy Study</i> No. 130, Center for the Study of American Business<p>
Murray Weidenbaum, Director of the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the U.S. cannot revert to isolationist policies in the post-Cold War era given the current and strong trends towards globalization. To support his argument, Weidenbaum presents eight major points which illustrate the increasingly strong movement towards globaliliztion. First, he states that existing technology and international competition have already made America part of the global marketplace. Second, he points to the fact that U.S. businesses are increasingly participating in the international economy given the potential high profits and growth rates. Third, he presents the argument that with growing numbers of cross-border alliances, transnational enterprises are becoming more and more common. Then, Weidenbaum argues that the booming economies and little government regulation in some foreign countries, have made it so the rewards of foreign investment far outweight the risks of political instability. The fifth point is the attraction the diversifying of investments internationally holds to businessmen seeking to minimize their vulnerabiltiy to regional recessions. Next he points out that the U.S. can not ignore the rise of China and other Southeastern Asian countries as Economic powerhouses; it must be prepared to compete with them both in the U.S. and Asian markets. Similarly, the continued process of economic unification in Western Europe and the growing strength of Germany, also demands a U.S. presence in the global marketplace. Finally, he argues that given the United States strong economy, too much potential for further growth exists in the international sphere that would be lost should the U.S. choose to follow an isolationist course.  Weidenbaum concludes by asserting that protectionism does not work and that as the twenty-first century approaches, private enterprises, not government, will lead the U.S.'s movements on the global stage. 16pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington Univers

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/fyi103.html">Flawed Intelligence Report No Guide for Missile Threat</a>, by <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><p>
<i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 103, The Heritage Foundation<p>
In his assessment of the U.S. intelligence community's 1995 report on America's need for a missile defense system, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation Baker Spring argues that given a host of inconsistencies, the report should not be used by members of Congress to help them determine their votes on the Defend America Act.  The act would commit America to the deployment of a missile defense system by 2003, but the intelligence community's report asserts that the U.S. is under no real threat of a missile attack in the near future.  Spring writes, however, that the authors of the assessment: 1) fail to address the threat posed by long-range missiles in China and Russia; 2) write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack; 3) are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles; 4) unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America; 5) underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation; 6) are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles; and 7) inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized launches against the U.S. Baker concludes by raising questions about the legitimacy of the report, noting that the General Accounting Office has launched an investigation to determine if the Clinton Administration intervened in the production of the report. 4pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1083.html">Will Clinton Pay the Price for America to Remain a Global Power,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><p>
<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1083, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Baker Spring, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, writes that the Clinton Administration is underfunding its own proposed force structure for America's military by approximately $130 billion.  According to Spring, this coming shortfall will leave the United States with two options: 1) increase defense spending to match America's current level of international commitments; or 2) renege or partially withdraw from existing U.S. security commitments.  While opponents of defense spending have argued that with the Cold War over the U.S. no longer needs to have a defense budget three times the size of any other nation (as it currently does), Spring disagrees. He holds that the American military's distance from the areas to which it is committed and must project power, the high technology weaponry it uses in order to limit casualties, and its volunteer rather than conscription troops all demand higher levels of spending.  Spring also argues that reneging on security commitments could open the door to a host of international conflicts that a down-sized U.S. military could not deal with. In order to resolve the funding shortage, Spring calls for a large scale debate in Congress to alert the American people to the problem and ultimately lead the U.S. to be capable of meeting its global security commitments. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<i>F.Y.I.</i>  No. 104, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Ariel Cohen, Senior Policy Analyst for The Heritage Foundation, outlines a report written by advisors of Communist Party Leader and former Russian presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganov. The authors of the report, proponents of hard-line communist doctrine and advocates of more aggressive military posturing, make a number of suggestions which, if adhered to, could prove profoundly disturbing for the United States. Such possibilities include: 1) Russia adopting a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats; 2) maintaining the conception of the U.S. and NATO as Russia's enemies.; 3) reorganizing Russia's military into a series of smaller but highly mobile units; and 4) preparing to reconquer by force the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union. Cohen cautions that regardless of the election's outcome, the views expressed in the report reflect those of many highly placed officials in Russia's government and military and could influence policy in the years to come. 11pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/asc141.html">Why Renewing MFN for China Serves U.S. Interests,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a><p>
<i>Asian Studies Center Backgrounder</i> No. 141, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Stephen J. Yates, Policy Analyst for the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, contends that revoking China's Most Favored Nation trading status would be directly contrary to the United States' interests in Asia.  China's human rights abuses, weapons proliferation, and a host of other problems have prompted many in Congress to call for the denial of MFN to China. But Yates argues that  such a revocation is not in accordance with either the MFN's historical or contemporary purpose. MFN, rather than being the extension of special trading privileges, is more aptly described as the normal trading status.  According to Yates, the termination of normal trade relations with China would have serious consequences. Rather than revoke MFN, Yates outlines a policy which he holds to be more consistent and cohesive than that carried out so far by President Clinton. This policy, whose aim is to promote both democracy and improved U.S. Chinese relations, includes: 1) renewing China's MFN status; 2) inviting China's president to the White House for a full state visit; 3) following a more broad-based strategy towards Asia; 4) using policy tools better suited to the problem; and 5) repealing or amending the Jackson-Vanik amendment. 12pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/lect566.html">China: Friend or Enemy?</a> by Hon. Barbara Hackman Franklin<p>
<i>Lecture</i> No. 566, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Barbara Hackman Franklin, former Secretary of Commerce examines the relationship between the United States and China in light of China's growing economic, geographic and military importance.  Despite China's increasing commitment to free market principles, Franklin sees human rights, trade deficits, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and intellectual property rights as obstacles to improving ties between the two countries. Even with these difficulties, however, Franklin believes the U.S. must continue to strengthen its relationship with China. Only by doing so can the U.S. help to strengthen the democratic and free market ideas currently gaining strength in China. She argues that the current U.S. policy lacks consistency and direction. Her remedy for this problem is the adoption of a strategic framework, outlining the goals, objectives, and expectations for the United States' relationship with China.  Included in this framework would be actions such as granting China permanent Most Favored Nation status and bringing the country into the World Trade Organization.  Franklin concludes by asserting that only by strengthening its economic and political ties with China, can the U.S. help direct the course China will take in the years to come. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/lect562.html">Entering the Pacific Century,</a> by Senator Jesse Helms<p>
<i>Lecture</i> No. 562, The Heritage Foundation<p>
United States Senator Jesse Helms calls for a shift in America's policy towards Asian nations, condemning the Clinton Administration for its indecisiveness and lack of priorities.  Helms believes continued support for political and economic freedom should be first on America's Asian agenda.  He asserts that the U.S. must use a firmer hand in dealing with the People's Republic of China, refusing to tolerate China's flagrant abuses of human rights and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Helms also argues that the U.S. must encourage Japan to take a leadership role in the international community commensurate with its economic standing. Facilitating dialogues between North and South Korea, and India and Pakistan figure significantly in Helm's agenda for U.S.-Asian relations. Finally, Helms cautions that the U.S. must pay close attention to Russia's dealings with Asian nations and work closely with states in ASEAN in order to promote democracy in Vietnam, Burma, and Laos.  According to Helms, the U.S. must adopt a more cohesive Asian policy if it is to be prepared for the emergence of Asia as the focal point of political and economic power in the near future. 20pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org</a>.

<b>Terrorism: The Failed Response,</b> by Geoffrey Lee Williams and Alan Lee Williams<p>
<i>Occasional Paper</i> No. 66, Institute for European Defense and Strategic Studies<p>
Geoffrey Lee Williams, Professor of International Relations at the University of Cambridge, and Alan Lee Williams, Director of the Atlantic Council of the United Kingdom, argue that although the power to terrorize with weapons and violence as a means to an end has a very long tradition, modern terrorists are distinguished from their predecessors by an adherence to ideology. Marx, Lenin, and Mao all considered violence to be useful only as an instrument for the advancement of the revolution. However, they were wary of the use of terror because the shedding of innocent blood could alienate "the masses." The authors also offer definitions in order to provide distinction between the various terms and euphemisms for terrorists. In addition, they encourage governments to cooperate in order to avoid further violence. 55pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Privatization 1996,</b> edited by John O'Leary<p>
<i>Tenth Annual Report on Privatization</i>, Reason Foundation<p>
In this annual report, the Reason Foundation provides a comprehensive account of privatization of government assets, enterprises, and public services. The first section focuses on trends towards privatization in the public sector at the federal, state and local levels. The next area of analysis examines the politics of privatization, looking especially at the experiences of Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith and New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman. Then, the report examines tools which will enable the government to understand the trends of activity based costing, contract monitoring techniques, and the use of competition within government.  This year's survey also covers contracting trends such as education privatization, solid waste management, and emergency medical services.  The final section of analysis looks at infrastructure trends, examining how industries as diverse as air traffic control, electric power, and corrections facilities are making the transition towards privatization.  68pp.  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<p><b>Designing Comprehensive Privatization Programs for Cities: Pittsburgh,</b> by John Stainbeck and Paul Kengor<p>
<i>Allegheny Institute Report</i> No. 96-14, Allegheny Institute and Reason Foundation<p>
John Stainback, President and CEO of Privatization for America, and Paul Kengor, Research Fellow for the Allegheny Institute, examine the challenges faced by city governments struggling with falling revenues and rising expenditures. Their solution centers around a comprehensive city-wide privatization program. The program involves nine different types of privatization for a city's assets, services, facility operations, debt, and infrastructure. The plan relies on government involvement in the creation and implementation of the privatization process. In an attempt to strengthen their governing ability and improve the quality of services provided to their citizens, city officials work to determine the types of privatization their situation demands, the level of control they want to maintain, and the assets they are willing to put into play.  Stainback and Kengor caution that while some risks do exist, they are still far outweighed by the benefits comprehensive privatization holds. These include: 1) reduced government costs; 2) generation of non-tax revenue; and 3) improved capabilities of developing and financing infrastructure. 46pp.  CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, Suite 612, 7 Parkway Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15220-3703, 412/937-4526, fax 412/928-1501

<b>Power Struggle</b>, by Kerry Jackson<p>
<i>FYI</i> May 8, 1996, American Legislative Exchange Council<p>
Kerry Jackson, Editor of <i>FYI</i>, examines the current move towards deregulating the electric power industry.  According to Jackson, while some consumer groups and utility companies have reservations about opening up the electric power market to competition, the move toward deregulation grows stronger everyday, particularly among industry insiders. As Jackson points out, legislators in approximately 30 states are devising legislation that would provide the best service to consumers, but in a low-cost, competitive market. ALEC is addressing the issue with its Energy, Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture Task Force. Jackson concludes that competition within the electric power industry will lower costs for consumers and offer them the best form of consumer protection possible. 4pp.  CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b>Reinventing Air Traffic Control: A New Blueprint for a Better System,</b> by Robert Poole and Viggo Butler<p>
<i>Policy Study</i> No. 206, Reason Foundation<p>
Robert Poole, President of Reason Foundation, and Viggo Butler, Chairman of United Airports Limited, Inc., assert that the Federal Aviation Administration: possesses a bureaucratic subculture; is subject to external micromanagement; and suffers from conflicts of interest between safety regulation and air traffic control operation.  In order to solve this problem, they set forth a plan by which a system of user fees would replace the current airline ticket tax and general aviation fuel tax. The authors believe that doing so would cure many of the FAA's structural weaknesses, leading to improved air safety, fewer flight delays, and shrunken operating costs. The new fee structure would be determined by aircraft weight and distance flown, and would exempt smaller, private aircrafts from most fees and taxes. To determine the fee structure, Poole and Butler recommend the development of a new user-controlled, not-for-profit Air Traffic Control corporation. Modeled after the ATC board which will soon assume control of Canada's air traffic control, the board would be set up and controlled by the government, air traffic controllers, airlines, and business aircraft owners. The new ATC system would be funded entirely by user fees and would be subject to arms length regulation by the FAA. Poole and Butler conclude that if the United States follows the example of not only Canada, but also Germany, Britain, and Switzerland, the fundamental problems of the system can be solved.19pp  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1085.html">Senator Pressler's Bold Proposal for Spectrum Freedom,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><p>
<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1085, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Adam D. Thierer, Alex C. Walker Fellow in Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation, examines Senator Larry Pressler's staff discussion draft intended to enforce a complete overhaul of the United States' wireless spectrum regulatory policy. Thierer asserts that the Senator's reform proposal is badly needed because the current system suffers from a host of problems, including a resistance to change and a lack of respect for First Amendment rights. According to Thierer, Pressler's plan would: 1) provide spectrum flexibility; 2) expand and make permanent the auction and allocation process; 3) create a second broadcast spectrum solution; 4) prohibit FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates; 5) demand release of more publicly held spectrum; 6) transfer all spectrum responsibilities from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to the FCC and block grant public safety spectrum to the states; and 7) require a spectrum report to monitor progress. While Thierer, on the whole, endorses Pressler's proposal, he lists four changes which he believes would improve upon the initial plan. These include: holding outright, unambiguous auctions for all spectrum uses and users;  ending "public interest standard" regulation and guaranteeing equal First Amendment protections for all media, whether print or electronic; ending protectionist policies in spectrum technologies; and  de-licensing the entire spectrum. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>A Free Market Solution to Groundwater Allocation in Georgia,</b> by Terry L. Anderson and Pamela S. Snyder<p>
<i>Issue Analysis,</i> Georgia Public Policy Foundation<p>
Terry Anderson, Executive Director of Political Economy Research Center (PERC), and Pamela Snyder, a PERC Research Assistant with, discuss the overuse of the Floridian aquifer system by groundwater pumpers in Georgia. Anderson and Snyder write that the state's use of regulation to reverse overdraft of the aquifer is not being welcomed with open arms, but, in the absence of well-defined property rights to groundwater, water users "race to the pumphouse" to capture their share of the resources before someone else does. The authors offer a market-based alternative to proposed government regulation, calling for privatization of the Floridian aquifer system in Georgia on a regional basis by defining quantified groundwater rights and allowing their transfer among users. 20 pp.  CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>California's Fiscal Condition,</b> by Tom McClintock<p>
<i>Briefings</i> No. 1996-51, Claremont Institute<p>
Tom McClintock, Director of Economic and Regulatory Affairs at the Claremont Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies, writes that, despite some positive signs, the California economy is still not stable. Attributing California's recession in the early 1990s to dramatic tax increases, McClintock points to a growing state debt, deferral of pension loans, and several bookkeeping anomalies as key indicators of impending economic difficulties. With these economic weaknesses, he holds that California is ill-repared to deal with its crumbling infrastructure. Noting that while spending per capita had increased significantly over the past twenty years, California is now providing fewer-and poorer-quality services to its citizens. Based upon this, McClintock concludes that California's problems stem not from how much revenue the state is receiving but rather how that revenue is spent. To remedy this problem, McClintock suggests two fundamental shifts in how California's policy makers allocate the budget: 1) restoring the state's constitutional restraints requiring a balanced budget, prohibiting borrowing, and limiting spending growth; and 2) downsizing the state bureaucracy and incorporating more competitive, free market oriented principles into the provision of goods and services. 9pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org">http://www.claremont.org.</a><p>

<b>Small Business Survival Index: Ranking the Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation,</b> by Raymond J. Keating<p>
Small Business Survival Foundation<p>
Raymond J. Keating, Chief Economist for the Small Business Foundation, examines the impact of a variety of taxes on small businesses on a state by state basis.  Asserting that how a government manages issues of investment and entrepreneurship is a vital economic matter, he concludes that high taxes and burdensome regulations will significantly reduce incentives for entrepreneurs to engage in high risk ventures. The end result of this process, according to Keating, is the restraint and diminishment of economic growth.  In order to provide both entrepreneurs and legislators with a more comprehensive understanding of the comparative degree to which their state promotes investment and growth, Keating ranks and measures some of the major costs imposed on entrpreneurship, investment, and businesses in each state.The Index surveys nine major government related costs imposed on small businesses and entrepreneurs. The taxes compared include: personal income taxes; capital gains taxes; corporate income taxes; property taxes; sales taxes; and death taxes. The survey also looks at the impact of unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation costs, and the total crime rate on small businesses.  Using these nine factors to shape his analysis, Keating summarizes the climate of each state for investment and small business opportunities.  13pp.  CONTACT.

According to Cameron, employees are protected from such situations by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The report also covers what litigants should expect from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and examines the role the First Amendment, federal labor laws, and compulsory union fees could play in such a situation.

<b>Social Security: Facing the Facts,</b> by Mark Weinberger<p>
<i>Project on Social Security Privatization</i> No. 3, Cato Institute<p>
Mark Weinberger, a partner in the law firm Washington Council, P.C., singles out Congress for their failure to address Social Security reform in the midst of the budget debate. Weinberger shows that the Social Security program could begin going bankrupt as early as 2113. He attributes this problem to the combined impact of the "graying of America," combined with increased costs and higher standards of living. To remedy this situation, Weinberger asserts lawmakers have four options: 1) reduce benefit payments; 2) increase the program's funding; 3) run up the federal debt; or 4) restructure the program so that people can save money in private accounts yielding higher returns. It is the fourth option, Weinberg endorses, concluding that it has the best potential for averting a potential crisis. 10pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

During his tenure from 1978-1980 he oversaw the privatization of the Chilean pension system. In this paper, Piera discusses the international trend of bankrupt pension systems, how he successfully privatized the Chilean pension system, and how the new Chilean system has increased the productivity of capital and thus the rate of economic growth in its economy.

Wilson Mixon, Jr., Professor of Economics at Berry College, challenges the assumption that the government is the best institution to provide basic services such as policing, a transportation infrastructure, and education.  In his introduction, Mixon argues that while the trend towards privatization is gaining support, most people still endorse government involvement in activities as diverse as mail delivery and banking.  But it is because of the government's long standing involvement in these services, Mixon asserts, people have forgotten that private initiatives are also capable of meeting society's many needs.  In fact, as one essay, authored by Henry Hazlitt, concludes, private, voluntary means are actually more effective in serving the community than forced government initiatives.  Other selected essays by Barbara Dodsworth, William R. Allen, and William Dickneider focus on the relationship of government funding and art.  Clint Bolick and Raymond J. Keating write against regulation of the communications industry, while Hannah Lapp and Scott Payne make the case for increased privatization of education.  The revitalization of private charity rather than public welfare is discussed by authors including Gerald Wisz, Robert Peterson, and David T. Beito.  Finally, the deregulation and privatization of banking, transportation, and law enforcement, are the focus of essays by Richard Syll, William B. Irvine, and Nicholas Elliott.    CONTACT.

<b>The Uncertain Hand: Hong Kong Taxis and Tenders,</b> by Christopher D. Hall<p>
Hong Kong Center for Economic Research<p>
The history of taxi regulation in Hong Kong shows that the uncertain regulation is the major source of risk in that business, according to Christopher Hall, Senior Lecturer in the School of Economics and Finance at the University of Hong Kong. After World War II, the taxi business in Hong Kong was basically a cartel of more expensive brand name operators controlled by the police as if it were a private enterprise with public monopoly rights. By the mid-1960s the burgeoning transport-bureaucracy introduced public auctions to allocate licences and, in effect, stripped the police of their power to control the business. The illegal taxi trade grew soon after. In 1985, the current de facto arrangement came about in which licence holders have gradually gained control of the taxi business. Hall argues that the taxi business would be a safe investment if regulation change, real and suggested, did not create so much uncertainty. 266 pp.  CONTACT: Hong Kong Center for Economic Research, School of Economics, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, 852/2547-8313, fax 852/2548-6319

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/tp14.html">Creating a Financial Services Industry for the 21st Century Part One: Tear Down the Walls,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><p>
<i>Heritage Talking Points</i> The Heritage Foundation<p>
John S. Barry, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, condemns the current financial regulatory system which mandates the forced separation of financial services.  According to Barry, historically barriers were created between commercial and investment banking because of fears of high risk losses and conflicts of interest. But he argues that these fears are groundless, that in fact banks engaging in investment activities are less likely to fail than those that did not. He also asserts that integrated banks are less likely to succumb to conflicts of interest than purely commercial or investment banks. Having addressed the major arguments against bank integration, Barry outlines the following plan for modernizing America's financial services industry: 1) repealing the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956; 2) repealing the Banking Act of 1933; 3) eliminating federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision; and 4) allowing commercial companies to offer financial services such as individual savings and checking accounts, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services. Barry holds that the implementation of these suggestions will benefit both American businesses and consumers, providing them with more profitable investment opportunities, easier access to capital, reduced costs, and a more stable financial services sector. 17pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 102, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Mark Wilson, Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy at The Heritage Foundation, and Angela Antonelli, Heritage Deputy Director for Economic Policy, illustrate that the real problem behind workers' declining take-home pay is not a low minimum wage, but rather the hidden costs of government mandates, taxes, and regulations. According to Wilson and Antonelli, government mandated benefits, ranging from unemployment insurance to workers compensation, dramatically increase the cost to employers to hire and keep workers on their payrolls. They also point out that growing numbers of government regulations increase the cost of employing workers and in the long-run drive down productivity, further escalating costs. Wilson and Antonelli assert that if Congress truly wants to increase wages and job opportunities for American workers they should not raise the minimum wage. Rather, they should focus on reducing the costs of employing workers by cutting payroll taxes; cutting the capital gains tax; enacting significant regulatory reform; and increasing the skills of the workforce. 10pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>How Corporate Welfare Won: Clinton and Congress Retreat from Cutting Business Subsidies,</b> by Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel<p>
<i>Policy Analysis</i> No. 254, Cato Institute<p> 
Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, and Dean Stansel, Cato Fiscal Policy analyst, demonstrate that the federal government currently spends $75 billion a year on direct subsidies to business. Despite that last year both Congress and the Clinton Adminstration pledged to attack this pervasive corporate safety net, the study finds that those promises have been largely unfulfilled. The study reveals that many corporate subsidy programs were reduced minimally, or not at all. In addition, the Clinton Administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress. In fact, the Administration's 1996 budget actually requested a slight increase in spending. The report concludes that an unwillingness to reduce the corporate social safety net undermines the rest of the government downsizing agenda. 29pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>


<b>Georgia Jobs Tax Credits: Needed Incentives or Needless Subsidies?</b> by Dr. Steve Morse<p>
<i>Issue Analysis,</i> Georgia Public Policy Foundation<p>
Dr. Steve Morris, a member of the Academic Advisory Board at the Georgia Center for Public Policy, argues that tax incentives passed in Georgia in 1994 to attract business were unnecessary and fail to address the real needs of Georgia's businesses. According to Morse, while such actions sound good in theory, in reality they have been proven to do little to affect a state's overall economic development. He bases his arguments on over thirty years of studies showing that most tax incentive programs simply give unnecessary tax incentives to businesses to do what they would have done anyway. Morse believes that if Georgia wishes to remain economically competitive in the coming years, it must abandon its current agenda of unnecessary tax incentives and adopt a policy which  focuses on factors businesses find truly important when making location decisions.  These factors include: 1) the availability of an educated and trainable workforce; 2) low taxes; 3) a high quality of life; 4) first-class research and development facilities; and 5) non-burdensome regulations. 9pp.  CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>How Title XI Ship Subsidies Sink the Taxpayer,</b> by John S. Tottie<p>
<i>Issue Analysis</i> No. 28, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
John S. Tottie, a Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, argues that the 60 year old Title XI Federal Ship Financing Guarantee Program, which guarantees loans for a wide variety of vessels and shipyard modernization projects, has accumulated $1 billion in loan defaults. Tottie posits that the case against Title XI is the case against entrenched political pork. Because the Title XI loans have a "subsidy value" and the resources available for investment are not unlimited, the government's favoritism of the shipbuilding industry also means that other goods and services that consumers want will be less plentiful. Tottie continues that any defense of Title XI must explain why the government, and not the American people, should decide how scarce economic resources are to be allocated. In conclusion, Tottie believes Title XI should be repealed. 16pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse.</a>

<b>White House Tax Theories,</b> by Alan Reynolds<p>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper</i> No. 191, Hudson Institute<p>
Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at Hudson Institute, critically anaylzes <I>The President's Council of Economic Adviser's 1996 Economic Report</i> assertion that changing tax rates have had no discernable effect on work effort, productivity, savings and economic growth. Reynolds debunks the myths presented by the CEA report which declares that the reduction of tax rates in the early 1980s was responsible for the large budget deficits that have persisted since. The Economic Report also states that whereas the impact of tax policy on savings is ambiguous, the ability of decreasing fedeal budget deficits to increase national savings is perfectly clear. Reynolds argues that the report does not bolster its finding with facts, and dismisses inconvenient truths as though they have become politically incorrect, in effect asking Americans to disregard scientific method in favor of naked politics and raw emotion. 16pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1084. The Heritage Foundation<p>
Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, dispels some of the myths and misconceptions associated with welfare and children. He argues that children are suffering simply because the U.S. welfare system has failed. Furthermore, the system has failed because the ideas upon which it was founded are flawed. Rector writes that flawed assumptions that children in families with higher income do better in life, and that welfare can easily raise family income, amount to the false conclusion that welfare is good for children. Rather, Rector points out, welfare has detrimental effects on cognitive capabilities, negatively effects the long term employment and earning capacity of young boys, and promotes illegitimacy. Rector concludes that those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed not at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependency and illegitimacy. 14pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Unintended Consequences: How Government Policies Hurt Oregon's Poor,</b> by Martin L. Buchanan<p>
<i>Fiscal Insight</i> No. 12, Cascade Policy Institute<p>
Martin Buchanan, Policy Analyist for the Cascade Policy Institute, argues that government policy at many levels is actually hurting Oregon's poor families in four ways. In order to escape poverty, families or individuals must surmount four barriers which Buchanan likens to four Berlin Walls. These barriers consist of taxes on the poor, obstacles to employment and enterprise, forced purchases of certain services, and higher prices for the poor. The paper also recommends several government actions to help poor Oregonians at the federal, state and local levels. Buchanan believes that the interests of the poor align well with the general interest and if these burdens are lifted from the poor, the burdens will lighten for all. 12pp.  CONTACT: Cascade Policy Institute, 813 S.W.

<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1081, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, reports on Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros's plan to introduce the benefits of market competition into the public housing industry despite efforts to hinder the plan by an alliance of moderate Republicans and liberal Democrats. However, with the support of House reformers and leaders, in conjunction with bold intervention by the federal courts, Utt believes, there is a good chance that these needed reforms in America's New Deal housing policies will survive the lobbying efforts of a public housing industry determined to preserve its costly taxpayer-supported monopoly over housing for the poor. Utt argues that this clash over housing reform is far more than a dispute over spending levels. Rather, the dispute concerns how government should help the poor. 13pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Value of Welfare: Cato vs. CBPP,</b> by Michael Tanner and Naomi Lopez<p>
<i>Briefing Papers</i> No. 27, Cato Institute<p>
Michael Tanner and Naomi Lopez of the Cato Institute reviewed the Center on Budget and Policy Priority's critique of the Cato study comparing the benefits available from entitlement programs with income available from work. Tanner and Lopez maintain that a review of the original study published by Cato and the criticisms in the CBPP study reveals that the Cato study remains an accurate appraisal of the level of welfare benefits. The study, by Tanner and Lopez, states that the CBPP report fails to account for the values of non-cash welfare benefits such as Medicaid. In addition, the Cato study's inclusion of housing benefits more accurately reflects the work vs. welfare tradeoff for long term welfare recipients. Turner and Lopez conclude that with the exception of a small error in the calculation of the values of food stamps in five states, the criticisms of the Cato study are unfounded. 29pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

<b>Replacing Welfare in Wisconsin,</b> by Andrew Bush<p>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper</i> No. 192, Hudson Institute<p>
Andrew Busch, Assistant Professor of Political Science at The University of Denver, examines Wisconsin's new welfare reform program. This new program, "Wisconsin Works" (W-2), is a work-based system which tries to help parents establish their own means of long-term support, primarily through work. The focus of W-2 will be with its financial and employment planners (FEP's), who will help families plan and execute employment strategies. The idea behind W-2 is that consistent employment is the way out of poverty, and finding a job for unemployed parents is only the beginning of the process-showing them how to keep a job is the real aim. 8pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>A Working Solution to the Welfare Crisis: The Full Employment Model of Welfare Reform,</b> by Peter S. Barwick<p>
Commonwealth Foundation<p>
Peter S. Barwick, Research Associate for The Commonwealth Foundation, posits that thirty years after the inauguration of the Great Society, it is clear that the welfare state has failed to deliver on its promise to end poverty. In fact, there is now a broad consensus that welfare programs have contributed substantially, if unintentionally, to a worsening of the plight of the poor by undermining the two-parent family and a commitment to work. Barwick presents the Full Employment Model as a promising and fully developed proposal for reforming the current welfare system. The merits of the reforms are detailed and the improvements of the current system are underscored. Advantages cited by Barwick include an end to welfare as an entitlement and the provision of practical work experience. However, Barwick acknowledges and explores important questions raised by the Full Employment Model such as the cost and the role of the bureaucracy. 12pp.  CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, 3544 North Progress Avenue, Suite 101, Harrisburg, PA  17110, 717/671-1901, fax 717/671-1905.

<b>Challenging America's Inverted Health Priorities,</b> by Elizabeth M. Whelan<p>
<i>Priorities</i> Vol. 8 No. 1, American Council on Science and Health<p>
This speech by Elizabeth M. Whelan, President of the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), relates that her top priority at ACSH involves helping Americans distinguish between real and hypothetical health risks, and to separate the leading causes of disease and death from the leading causes of unnecessary anxiety. She argues that the purpose of public health measures, whether carried out at EPA, the FDA, in Congress, or in the private sector, should be the prevention of premature disease and death. She rejects the notion that public health efforts should have hidden goals which might include harassing industy, alarming people about nonrisks, banning useful, subtances or advancing other social and political agendas. Whelan posits that the nation's health priorities are inverted because health issues are pushed to center stage, squandering limited public health resources. Examples include the mother who worries about the alleged carcinogin Alar in applesauce, but fails to buckle her child into a car. She suggests that the influential factors creating inverted health policies include the enormous political and economic clout of the manufacturers of the leading cause of preventable death, cigarettes ,and the contamination of the public health profession by an ideologically fueled form of political correctness that chills open dialouge. 10pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Health Risk Reporting: Getting the Story Straight,</b> by Courtney LaFountain<p>
<i>Contemporary Issues Series</i> No. 78, Center for the Study of American Business<p>
Courtney LaFountain, Environmental Researcher at the Center for the Study of American Business, offers nine fundamental questions that readers should ask when evaluating a story about a new risk. LaFountain's concern focuses on press coverage of studies of three possible environmental health risks to show that many of these points are not addressed in media coverage of risk-based research. The author suggests that journalists have a tendency to report the political or human interest side of a risk, rather than the technical or scientific side. Her nine point plan for the analysis of information involves inquiries which are directed toward correcting false information and disclosing the whole story on partial reporting. Cases she applies her nine point plan to include the major news coverage of the Savitz-Loomis Study, the Long Island Breast Cancer Study and the Greenpeace Chlorine Study. 24pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>FDA Reform, Take One: Chairman Kassebaum's Bill,</b> by Michael F. Cannon<p>
<i>Issue Analysis </I>No. 27, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
Michael F. Cannon, Health Care Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, discusses Nancy Kassebaum's Food and Drug Administration Performance and Accountability Act of 1996. Cannon believes the proposal addresses the FDA's obstruction of doctors' and patients' efforts to obtain badly needed treatments, the rise in health care costs, and violations of the First Amendment. These proposals include such measures as refocusing the FDA's mission and balancing the agency's safety and efficacy standards against the needs of the seriously ill. The bill would also allow FDA accredited private firms to review product applications on behalf of the agency and would shorten the time it takes to bring drugs, medical devices and biologics to market, where they may help patients. Though not without shortcomings and with several provisions yet to be added to the bill, Cannon believes the Kassebaum Bill will enable doctors and patients to obtain new treatments faster, and at a lower cost, than under the current regulatory regime-without compromising patient safety. 9pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse.</a><p>

<b>Medical Savings Accounts: The Singapore Experience,</b> by Thomas A. Massaro and Yu-Ning Wong<p>
<i>NCPA Policy Report</i> No. 203, National Center for Policy Analysis<p>
Thomas Massaro, Harrison Foundation Professor of Medicine and Law, analyzes Medical Savings Accounts in Singapore and has revealed a system which offers individuals access to care while holding down costs. According to the study, the island city-state spends only 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, lower than other Asian nations and well below the United States at 154 percent. In addition, Singaporeans have access to the most modern technology, including CAT scans, bypass surgery and organ transplants. Moreover, there is very little waiting in Singapore, either to see a doctor or to obtain high technology services. Massaro argues that the fact that people are spending their own money, rather than a third party insurer, has helped to curtail Singapore's health care costs. Also, because people are free to exercise choice in the medical marketplace, providers of care have strong incentives to maintain quality. The study concludes that if Medical Savings Accounts were available in the United States, prudent buying would begin to chip away at the high price of care and might significantly reduce it. 19pp.  CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Immigration and America's Cities: A Sign of Economic Health,</b> by Stephen Moore<p>
Alexis de Toqueville Institution<p>
Stephen Moore, Visiting Fellow at the Alexis de Tocqueville Insititution, argues against the overtures by Members of Congress and President Clinton to significantly reduce both legal and illiegal immigration on the basis that such a reduction is needed to stop the drain on cities and states facing heavy fiscal, social, economic and other "costs" of immigration. Moore's study of America's 85 largest cities, using Census data over a 15-year period, which demonstrates that high levels of immigration are generally associated with cities that have more positive economic indicators. The study finds that, compared to cities with the fewest immigrants, cities with the highest proportion of immigrants in 1990 had on average: 15% higher per capita incomes; 90% lower tax burdens; 130% higher job growth; 17% lower crime rates; and 17% lower poverty rates. 48pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1611 North Kent Street, Suite 901, Arlington, VA  22209, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<b>Judging an Interest Group by the Politicians it Keeps: An Analysis of NEA-PAC Contributions to House Races,</b> by John Berthoud<p>
<i>Issue Brief</i> No. 120, Alexis de Tocqueville Institution<p>
John  Berthoud, Vice President of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, relates that a review of contributions by the political action committee of the National Education Association reveals that the Congress that NEA is seeking to elect would radically change the direction of American government. Most significantly, NEA's ideal Congress would vastly expand federal spending and taxation. The average House candidate supported by the NEA during the last election cycle had an agenda to increase federal spending by $302 billion per year. On the other hand, the candidates that the NEA opposed had a net agenda to cut federal spending by $22.6 billion per year. Berthoud also states that, despite NEA's pledge of support for America's children, if NEA could have the Congress it wanted, it would mean either hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on American families or hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits for future generations. 7pp.  CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1611 North Kent Street, Suite 901, Arlington, VA  22209, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/cb26.html">Why Vouchers Are Needed for Poor Children,</a> by Denis P. Doyle<p>
<i>Committee Brief</i> No. 26, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Denis Doyle, Heritage Visiting Fellow in Education, argues that Congress has a historic opportunity to convert Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged, into a voucher program. He proposes that poor families, rather than bureaucrats, decide where their children will go to school. Doyle cites the widely recognized problems with Title I, including the adverse effect of the Supreme Court's Aguilar decision which actively discourages poor children from attending non-government schools by penalizing them if they do. Doyle concludes that in order to reform Title I, the program should be reconnecting to its true beneficiaries-students and not schools. As it is, Title I commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child and if that money were available as a Title I voucher it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs. Such an approach, writes Doyle, would mitigate the effects of the school bureaucracy and begin to instill values which foster character development. 5pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Bilingual Education in Massachusetts, The Emperor Has No Clothes,</b> by Christine H. Rossell and Keith Baker<p>
Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research<p>
Christine Rossell, Professor of Political Science at Boston University, and Keith Baker, a private social science research consultant, thoroughly examine the bilingual education program in Massachusetts public schools for limited English-proficient (LEP) students. They look at the controversial aspects of bilingual education nationwide,and they survey the history of bilingual education in Massachusetts.  Rossell and Baker provide eight recommendations for improving edicuational programs for LEP students: 1) free school districts from the legal obligation to provide native language instruction; 2) increase the LEP population size needed to trigger a self-contained classroom; 3) require parental consent for enrollment in a self-contained classroom; 4) require English language fluency for teachers in an educationl program for LEP children; 5) change the criteria for entering and exiting a self-contained classroom; 6) eliminate specific class-sized ceilings; 7) better research that would allow social scientists to analyze the success of the programs; and 8) the ideal program is that which involves "structured immersions." 242 pp. CONTACT: Pioneer Institute For Public Policy Research, 85 Devonshire Street, 8th floor, Boston, MA 2109, 617/723-2277, fax 617/723-1880.

<b>The Heartland Report on School Finance Reform for Illinois,</b> by Joseph L. Bast, Herbert J. Walberg, and Robert J. Genetski<p>
<i>Policy Studies</i> No. 72 and 73, Heartland Institute<p>
Joseph L. Bast, President of The Heartland Institute, Herbert J. Walberg of the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Robert J. Genetski of Chicago Capital, Inc., formulate a reply to the Governor's Commission on Education Funding and offer alternative principles for school finance reform. The report cites evidence which demonstrates why public schools are failing in Illinois, such as excessive bureaucracy and regulation. Moreover, the writers maintain that spending more money will not alleviate the situation. They argue that student achievement is not related to spending because increased spending rarely addresses the reasons schools are failing. The second part of the report offers a means to improve public schools through a market-based approach. The plan incorporates parental choice, private school choice, competition, and curriculum based exams to improve the quality, and the means to gauge the quality, of public schools.

<b>With Liberty and Justice for All: Redefining the Educational Choice Debate,</b> by Jennifer A. Marshall and Jennifer E. Marshall,<p>
<i>Family Policy,</i> Family Research Council<p>
Jennifer A Marshall, Educational Policy Analyst for the Family Research Council, and Jennifer E. Marshall, Welfare Policy Analyst for the Family Research Council, survey the philosophical and historical background of public education. They assert that, given the failure to establish a full educational choice program anywhere in the U.S. after a quarter century, choice proponents must challenge themselves to develop a new scheme. The proposal should place a premium on liberty and on the private benefits of education while reformulating the public-purpose rhetoric employed by the education establishment. Marshall and Marshall also believe the new proposal should avoid the weaknesses associated with vouchers, including the menace of government regulation, consistent challenges to constitutionality, dim prospects for political passage, the danger of expanding an entitlement mentality and a narrow coalition of beneficiaries to support passage. The authors invest faith in a refundable tax credit scheme to overleap the hurdles presented by means tested voucher programs. 7pp.  CONTACT: Family Research Council, 700 13th Street, N.W., Suite 500, Washington, DC  20005, 202/393-2100, fax 202/393-2134, Internet <a href="http://www.frc.org">http://www.frc.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/tp15.html">How to Talk About Property Rights: Why Protecting Property Rights Benefits All Americans, </a>by John Shanahan<p>
Heritage Talking Points No. 15, The Heritage Foundation<p>
John Shanahan, Policy Analyst for The Heritage Foundation, argues that although the government has the power to confiscate private land, it must compensate the owner. However, when government regulates how private owners may use their land, it typically does so without any recognition of, or compensation for, the costs. Shanahan notes that this de facto taking of property-the practice of restricting a person's right to use his property without compensating him for losses caused by the restriction-is now being questioned. The author discusses House and Senate bills which would protect private property and contract rights. Shanahan also offers the philosophical groundwork concerning the importance of private property. Shanahan laments that although the Supreme Court has clearly sided with the Constitution when requiring the government to pay just compensation when any amount of land is confiscated, the Court's decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear. As a result, executive branch agencies have had wide latitude in taking property through regulation. 4pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Regulation vs. Conservation,</b> by Jonathan H. Adler<p>
<i>CEI Update </i>Vol. 9, No. 5, Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Jonathan Adler, Director of Environmental Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, illustrates how regulation, the primary means that the federal government employs to protect endangered species and ecologically sensitive lands, might actually discourage voluntary stewardship and conservation of private property. He calls for non-regulatory, incentive based programs and compensation to maintain environmental standards. Forcing agencies to compensate for a regulation that constitutes a "taking" out of their own budget will cause them to examine whether the benefit of the regulatory action is worth the compensation. This way, according to Adler, "land-use regulation will only be pursued when the benefits appear to justify the costs or when other options are impractical or more costly." The coercive regulatory system that is presently used by the federal government costs the taxpayers approximately $300,000 per wetland acre protected. Adler argues that incentive-based programs would conserve wetlands at a fraction of the cost and would protect private property rights. 3pp.  CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/488-0806.

<b>Key Issues in Environmental Risk Comparisons: Removing Distortions and Insuring Fairness, </b>by George M. Gray<p>
<i>Policy Study </i>No. 205, Reason Foundation<p>
Dr. George Gray, Deputy Director and Regulatory Toxicologist at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, maintains that environmental risk management is crucial in order to ensure that scarce public health resources are used wisely. Risk assessment plays a key role in environmental decisions such as setting drinking water standards, Superfund site cleanup goals, and standards for pesticide residues on food. The Reason Foundation claims that risk assessment is associated with nearly all of the two percent of Gross National Product that is spent annually in the United States on environmental protection. Gray argues that many of the standard risk assessments use to establish regulatory standards deliberately overstate people's exposure to environmental contaminants. To best employ risk assessment to protect people, risk characterization must be improved to make better use of science in order to find the most accurate estimates, not "conservative" estimates. All risk comparisons, concludes Gray, require the best science and risk assessment to maximize protection of human health. 18pp.  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>A Positive Agenda for Environmental Policy, </b>by Bruce Yandle<p>
<i>The Shape of Things </i>No. 6, Progress & Freedom Foundation<p>
Bruce Yandle, Alumni Professor of Economic and Legal Studies at Clemson University, delivered the remarks in this paper at a Progress & Freedom Foundation roundtable on the environment. Yandle begins by mentioning that it has been nearly a quarter century since the United States and most of the industrialized world have been engaged in a massive effort to maintain environmental quality. He argues that the current "command-and-control" system is obsolete and that U.S. environmental polices need to be changed. An agenda for change would involve the following elements: <i>Goal Orientation</i>, policy should emphasize measuring, monitoring and reporting on environmental policy; <i>Flexibility,</i> innovation should be rewarded instead of penalized; <i>Biological Envelopes</i>, organizations such as river-basin, water-shed and air-shed associations should be encouraged and allowed to innovate in order to achieve goals; <i>Community Common Sense</i>, environmental protection decision making should take place where outcomes and costs matter the most; <i>Common Law,</i> statutory blocks against common law solutions to environmental problems should be removed; and <i>Property Rights</i>, private parties should be justly compensated for public benefits that they are asked to provide. Yandle concludes by arguing that the U.S. needs to update the blueprints for America's environmental policy-which have changed very little in twenty-five years.  4pp. CONTACT. Richard F.

<b>The New Paradigm in Environmental Enforcement: Environmental Audit Privilege and Immunity Legislation,</b> by R. Kinnan Golemon and Laura D. Wolf<p>

This issue illustrates how self-audit environmental laws are beneficial to both industry and the environment. It debunks four myths about self-audit privileges, reveals the flaws in the Environmental Protection Agency's policies and philosophies regarding the laws, and provides an update of legislation in the states. The authors examine-and then dismiss-arguments against self-audit laws, deeming them unfounded. The conclusion they reach is that the pervasive and voluminous regulation that has evolved over the years is inferior to a "model that focuses on and encourages voluntary compliance." Such a policy would allow regulatory agencies "to direct their limited enforcement resources at those among the regulated community that do not strive to be good citizens." 13 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

They find that the primary challenge of future sustainability is conservation of forests and other wildlands and wild plant and animal species to ensure integrity of local ecosystems. They also find that ensuring adequate funding for agricultural research, as well as researching new ways to fight soil erosion around the world is a priority.

 <b>Marbury's Travail: Federalist Politics and William Marbury's Appointment as Justice of the Peace,</b> by David Forte<P>
<i>The Catholic University of America Law Review </i>Vol. 45, No. 2, The Columbus School of Law<p>
David Forte, Professor of Law at Cleveland State University, examines the Federalist politics behind William Marbury's appointment as Justice of the Peace in the last days of John Adam's presidency. Soon after his inauguration, Thomas Jefferson discovered the undelivered commisions of the previous president that included Marbury's, and immediately ordered them withheld. Forte shows how the ambition of Marbury, the son of an established, but impoverished, family, worked his way up to a position of power in the Maryland gentry. Marbury's political loyalty to the Adam's wing of the Federalist party in Maryland earned him a nomination as Justice of the Peace, "the most powerful office in the lives of the common people." Marbury's position amongst Adam's loyalists brought him Jefferson's enmity. It was Jefferson's refusal to allow Marbury to take office that lead to the landmark case <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>, that established judicial review, and sizably increased the power of the judicial branch of government. 53 pp. CONTACT: The Columbus School of Law, The Catholic University of America, 620 Michigan Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C., 202/319-5140.

<b>Gun Control: Is the Tide Turning, </b>by Austin Fulk<p>
<i>Organization Trends  </i>June 1996, Capital Research Center<p>
Austin Fulk, Research Associate at the Capital Research Center, examines the recent move in many states to allow individuals to carry loaded, concealed weapons. Fulk points out that as the federal government has been tightening gun control laws, anti-gun control organizations have been focusing their efforts at the state level. He points to approximately a dozen states where regulations regarding the carrying of concealed weapons have been relaxed. After debating the arguments against concealed weapons, and asserting that guns do not lead to increased violence, Fulk goes on to document the contributions of groups such as the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. Next, he traces the rise of the gun control movement, detailing the work of groups such as Handgun Control, Inc., Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and the Violence Policy Center. Fulk concludes by noting that while the federal government may soon assist proponents of concealed weapons by passing legislation allowing concealed weapons holders to carry guns across state lines, that help is not critical. Just as education and welfare reforms have been devolving to state levels, so too, he claims, has the issue of gun control. 7pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>Handbook on Religious Liberty Around the World, </b>edited by Pedro C. Moreno<p>
Rutherford Institute<p>
Edited by Pedro Moreno, International Coordinator for The Rutherford Institute, the <i>Handbook on Religious Liberty</i> examines the historical and legal aspects of religious liberty around the world.  In John W. Whitehead's forward, he argues that a type of religious apartheid-the exclusion of religious belief and persons from the public sphere-is occurring throughout the world, even in the United States.  To support this thesis, Moreno provides detailed accounts of instances of religious persecution throughout the world.  Attacks against Christians, Jews, and a variety of others are documented from a wide array of countries, including India, Sudan, Israel, China, Kenya, Australia, and Thailand.  Given special attention are the instances of religious persecution in the United States, where, The Rutherford Institute argues, religious beliefs, particularly Christianity, are being systematically eradicated. Knowing where religious discrimination is occurring and taking action to stop it are critical, according to Rutherford because: 1) where religious apartheid exists, persecution of individual believers inevitably follows; and 2) with the rise of secularism, the positive restraining effects of Judeo-Christian beliefs upon citizens will end.  347pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Discrimination, Affirmative Action, and Freedom: Sorting Out the Issues,</b> by Roger Pilon<p>
<i>American University Law Review,</i> Vol. 45, February 1996 <p>
Roger Pilon, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, analyses the current debate over affirmative action from the perspective of First Principles. Arguing that individual liberty is grounded in the idea of individual sovereignty, he demonstrates how the breakdown of the distinction between private and public has led to the confusion that surrounds the anti-discrimination/affirmative action debate among both liberals and conservatives, with liberals trying to impose affirmative action in both the public and private sectors, conservatives trying to impose anti-discrimination in both sectors. Neither side seems to appreciate how the ideas of private and public sovereignty would sort the issues out in the respective sectors.

<b>A Court Without a Compass, </b>by Roger Pilon<p>
<i>New York Law School Law Review </i>Vol. 40, No. 4<p>
Roger Pilon, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, argues in a symposium on James F. Simon's <i>The Center Holds: The Power Struggle Inside the Rehnquist Court,</i> that Simon presents a one-dimensional morality play of the last 40 years of Supreme Court jurisprudence. Concluding, correctly, that the Reagan/Bush appointees have shifted the Court only slightly, Simon's analysis, according to Pilon, nonetheless misses the deeper currents in 20th century jurisprudence that help explain why the Rehnquist Court is as political as the Warren and Burger Courts were and why constitutional law today has become so politisized. The Court today, Pilon concludes, is without a compass because its members, reflecting those currents, have no deeply grounded philosophy of the Constitution.

<b>Emancipating School Prayer: How to Use the State Constitution to Beat the ACLU and the Supreme Court,</b> edited by Harry V. Jaffa<p>
Claremont Institute<p>
Harry Jaffa, Professor Emeritus of Political Philosophy at Claremont McKenna College and a Distinguished Fellow at the Claremont Institute, argues that Congress has the constitutional authority to immediately pass legislation allowing voluntary prayer in schools. He adds that this prayer would be guided by the acknowledgment of God expressed in the preambles of 46 U.S. state constitutions. This would at once recall the idea of "liberty under God," and remind all Americans that acknowledging God has not been a danger to, but rather the formation of unparalleled freedom for two centuries. Further, he argues that a joint resolution of Congress would preclude the Supreme Court from acting in opposition without declaring all 46 state constitutions unconstitutional. 49pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, E-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet <a href=" http://www.claremont.org">	http://www.claremont.org. </a>

<i>Lecture</i> No. 567, The Heritage Foundation<p>
In this speech given at The Heritage Foundation's Resource Bank Annual Meeting, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith puts forth ways in which Americans can liberate themselves for self-government. He begins his speech by discussing his experience as mayor and how he eschewed the public policy trends of the last thirty years of continuously raising taxes and establishing social programs and control mechanisms to solve the city's problems. As mayor, he has contracted out several city services, set up incentives for social workers to place welfare recipients in jobs, connected kids in tough neighborhodds to their local churches, fought for school choice, and overall, allowed flexibility and innovation in the delivery of public services. Goldsmith calls for devolution, but warns that it will not be successful unless it leads to a market-based system for providing government services. The system has to recognize that "the way to create true value is to let citizens and taxpayers make decisons that are in their own best interests." 5pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>Initiative and Referendum in Pennsylvania,</b> by Charles E. Greenwalt II<p>
Commonwealth Foundation<p>
The process of "direct democracy," by way of initiatives and referendum, has fallen short of what reformers had in mind because of its extreme vulnerability to corruption. The question is, writes Charles Greenwalt, Senior Policy Associate at The Commonwealth Foundation, should Pennsylvania join the list of 24 states (and the District of Columbia) that have adopted procedures for statewide initiatives and the 25 states (and the District) that have adopted statewide referendum? Some of the major opposition relates to issues involving "finances," which would only allow those special interest groups with a good financial backing to get their issues on the ballot. Another problem the opposition raises is the belief of a 'complexity' of issues', which argues that the average or even slightly above average citizen would not really understand what he/she was voting on because the topics are too complex for their understanding. Proponents see this "direct" process as a must and point to the Pennsylvania Constitution, which says that the power and right to make laws ultimately rests with the citizentry. In addition, proponents of initiative and referendum believe that a higher voter turnout that develop and provide additional checks on lawmakers. Either way, concludes Greenwalt, what will work for one state may not work for another, thus each state must decide individually if the process of initiative and referendum outweighs the cost of corruption. 40pp.  CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, 3544 North Progress Avenue, Suite 101, Harrisburg, PA  17110, 717/671-1901, fax 717/671-1905.

Moreover, these amendments will restore to the Constitution the notion of a finite federal government, something that was implicit in the design of the government and understood by the Founders as an essential part of the system they created. In addition, Mitchell identifies and outlines the motivations of the obstructionists in Congress who blocked these reforms. 95pp.  CONTACT. Americans Back in Charge, 900 2nd Street, N.E., Suite 200A.

<b>Rethinking Divorce,</b> by William A. Galston<p>
Center of the American Experience<p>
William A. Galston, Director of the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland, surveys the ramification of divorce upon America's children, and calls for a reexamination of divorce laws in the United States. Galston holds that America currently tolerates a system that cares more for adults' interests than for children's.  Because of this, he argues, millions of children each year are being adversely affected by divorces-which the current legal and cultural environment permits. To remedy this, Galston states that Americans must first make it the country's goal to both reduce the number of divorces involving minor children, and, when such divorces are unavoidable, seek to mitigate their consequences for the children. Next, he recommends implementing social and legal changes to help couples before and during marriages, as well as at the threshold of divorce.  He also advocates eliminating the unilateral no-fault divorce system when there are children involved.  If divorce cannot be prevented, Galston advocates working to minimize the effects upon children by attempting to prevent diminished income, diminished parenting time, and the disruption of established ties. 5pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis MN 55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621.<p>

<b>Hollywood's Two Big Lies,</b> by Michael Medved<p>
<i>Declarations of Independence</i> Vol. 3, No. 1, Independence Institute<P>
Film critic Michael Medved condemns the Hollywood entertainment industry for what he calls their "two big lies:" 1) their claim that they present a realistic picture of the world; and 2) that they tailor their work to meet consumer demands. Taking on the first claim of Hollywood insiders, Medved critiques their portrayal of violence, sexuality, and religion. Next, he provides empirical evidence that more traditional, family-oriented entertainment fares better at the box office than more violent, sexually explicit fare which the industry claims the public wants. Medved asserts that people in Hollywood are not motivated by any desire to have their work mirror real life, or even make money. Their real desire, he claims, stems from a desire to win the approval of their peers for producing shocking and untraditional work. To combat this phenomena, Medved recommends that the American public should be more selective about the television programs and films they choose to watch. Their individual boycotts may not impact industry decisions, he writes, but it will impact their own lives. If they are not seeing the negative images of Hollywood, they can not be directly harmed by them.  5pp.  CONTACT: Independence Institute, 14142 Denver West Parkway, No. 101, Golden, CO  80401, 303/279-6536, fax 303/279-4176.

<b>On the Frontline of the Culture War: Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America,</b> by William A. Donohue<p>
Claremont Institute<p>
William Donohue, President and CEO of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, examines the attack launched upon the American Boy Scouts by various groups charging them with discrimination.  Donohue begins his essay by first examining the principles upon which the organization was first founded.  Asserting that the Boy Scouts were intended to be a group dedicated to instructing young men on how to live moral, upright lives, he argues that the exclusion of atheists and homosexuals is in accordance with the group's mission.  Next, Donohue documents several recent court cases brought against the organization by various individuals in the homosexual, atheist, and feminist communities.  His next area of analysis focuses on the cultural war he feels the liberal establishment and members of the cultural elite have declared against the Boy Scouts.  Donohue then examines the role of the ACLU in the legal proceedings, arguing that an anti-family, anti-God bias permeates the legal association and is prompting it to promote  an agenda which seeks the exclusion of morality and tradition from the American landscape.  The essay concludes with an afterward by Edward J. Erler, Senior Fellow at the Claremont Institute, which recounts the recent court rulings pertaining to the Boy Scouts, most of which seem to favor the group's right to ascribe to its traditional moral code.  37pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org"> http://www.claremont.org.</a><p>

<b>The New Majority: The "Leave Us Alone" Coalition,</b> by Grover G. Norquist<p>
<I>Imprimis</I> Vol. 25, No. 5, Hillsdale College<p>
 Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform, asserts that America is currently in the midst of a historic political realignment.  This shift is occurring, Norquist writes, as traditional liberal coalitions break down, and a more conservative coalition forms.  He terms this new political coalition the "Leave Us Alone" coalition, describing its members as ordinary men and women motivated by their love for freedom, family and tradition, while sharing the common desire of being left alone by the government.  The opposition they face in their efforts to control the political landscape, Norquist calls the "Takings Coalition."  He claims that while for years this alliance has been made up of groups wanting the government to take money from other Americans and give it to them, they are now fighting amongst themselves, and their numbers are shrinking. With victory for the "Leave Us Alone" coalition in sight, Norquist outlines a four-step plan to insure their success. According to him, they must: 1) oppose any and all tax increases; 2) end the Left's sense of inevitable victory; 3) seize the moral high ground; and 4) defund the opposition. 5pp.  CONTACT: Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242, 800/437-2268.

<b>The Intellectual Foundations of the Cultural Decline,</b> by Stephen B. Young<p>
Center of the American Experiment<p>
Stephen B. Young, member of the Board of Trustees at the Center of the American Experiment, argues that a powerful force has been eating away at the soul of American society in recent years.  This force he attributes to a line of political thought which holds personal license and moral relativism as superior to the American tradition of freedom and liberty under the rule of law. Intellectually, Young ascribes this philosophy to a French ethic originating in Rousseauian theory. The triumph of this ethic over that purported by English philosophers Bacon, Locke, Hume, and Smith and German writers Kant and Hegel, generated what Young terms "the deconstruction of traditional norms and ethics."  For the origins of its growing dominance in modern American thought, Young looks to the Vietnam war and the need of baby boomers to find a social philosophy that supported their opposition to the traditional claims of the American state. Young not only criticizes the prevalence of this ideology in American society in general, he also examines its specific impacts upon America's colleges and universities.  Its existence there, he charges, has made any true leadership or reform impossible. To solve this widespread problem, Young calls for society at large to demand greater accountability amongst themselves and within the university community.  15pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN  55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621

<b>Public Policy Grantmaking: Four Women Donors Offer Their Views, </b>by Ethelmae Humphreys, Heather R. Higgins, Sue Anschutz Rodgers, and Kristin Avansino<p>
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy </I>June 1996, Capital Research Center<p>
While women control approximately 60 percent of the nation's wealth and are gaining more and more prominence in the workforce, the Capital Research Center reports that women donors are less likely than men to support non-profit organizations promoting changes in public policy.  This issue of <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I> takes a look at four women serving at key positions at foundations who do contribute to institutions involved in public policy.  Ethelmae Humphreys, Chairman and President of the Humphreys Foundations, discusses her work to promote a free society, outlining the parameter her foundation has set for public policy recipients and her devotion to social issues.  Next Heather R. Higgins, Director of The Randolph Foundation, writes about the important benefits of contributing to public policy groups rather than just giving directly to charities.  Then, Sue Anschutz-Rodgers, President and Executive Director of The Anschutz Family Foundation, discusses how philanthropic donations to public policy best facilitate the interplay between business, government, and the non-profit sector.  Finally, Kristin A. Avansino, President and Executive Director of the E.L. Wiegand Foundation, relays how her foundation's respect for the sacred, democracy, free-market principles, and hard work have led them to award grants to public policy organization.  4pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>The Council on Foundations: The Era of Lady Bountiful Is Over Message to America</b><p>
<I>Foundation Watch </I>Vol. 1, No. 5, Capital Research Center<p>
From April 22nd through 24th in Atlanta, Georgia, the Council of Foundations held their annual meeting. The program, comprised mostly of liberal activists and philanthropists, did feature conservatives Father Richard Neauhaus, founder of the journal <I>First Things,</I> and John Von Kannon, Vice President at The Heritage Foundation.  According to the Capital Research Center, the convention was representative of modern philanthropy's obsession with appearances. More than one hundred awards were distributed for accomplishments in public relations, yet not one program was commended for delivering lives from welfare, helping drug users overcome their addictions, or helping the handicapped.  In other words, for their charitable contributions. Much of this arises, asserts Foundation Watch, from the Council's current President, Dorothy Ridings,  and her obsession with media relations.  But in the Council's focus on how people perceive their actions, they are forgetting to carry out their true mission, claims the article. Foundation Watch suggests that the Council reaffirm the centrality of service to the mission of philanthropy, recognizing where America's charitable institutions have gone wrong.  7pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>All the King's Horses and All the King's Men: What Would Charity Do Without Them?</b> by Leslie Lenkowsky<p>
<I>Philanthropy </I>Vol. IX, No. 3, Philanthropy Roundtable<p>
Leslie Lenkowsky, President of the Hudson Institute, examines the controversy in the philanthropic community over proposed changes in their relationship with the federal government.  He notes that while much of the American public supports philanthropic groups assuming greater responsibility for social work, those same groups fear the repercussions of losing government funds.  But Lenkowsky argues that partnership has actually harmed the work of philanthropies more than it has helped them. To support this, he points to the restrictions placed upon programs, and the realignment of priorities to match government demands.  Another problem arising from the mutual dependency of the federal government and philanthropies, according to Lenkowsky, has been that their goals and beliefs have merged, depriving the relationship of any diversity of thought, and along with that, any vitality.  Lenkowsky compares their relationship to a dysfunctional marriage that leaves both parties worse off.  To remedy these problems, he calls for a reexamination of their partnership that will lead to the formation of a new partnership, where government and philanthropic organizations maintain a greater degree of separation from each other. This, Lenkowsky believes, would facilitate a reordering of priorities, increased flexibility, and a reinvigorated private sector more capable of meeting society's needs.  6pp.  CONTACT: The Philanthropy Roundtable, 320 North Meridian Street, Indianapolis, IN  46204-1725, 317/639-6546.

<b>Liberalism and Community,</b> by Steven Kautz<p>
Social Philosophy & Policy Center<p>
Steven Kautz, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Emory University, defends the classical liberalism of Locke and Montesquieu, against its communitarian critics.  According to Kautz, communitarians have charged liberalism with being both morally and politically deficient.  He counters these arguments by first exploring the problem of community as it has evolved in recent years. Kautz then looks at the various disagreements which have taken place between Democrats and Republicans. The next component of Kautz's analysis centers on the arguments of three important, new communitarians: Richard Rorty, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel. Contrasting their views against more traditionally liberal philosophies, he discusses Walzer's account of moral reasoning, Barber's concept of the nature of republican community, and Cory's writings on the nature of the self. Kautz also addresses the issues of patriotism, self-government, and virtue, ultimately confronting the question of whether liberal reason can sustain the moral life of a community. Kautz concludes that it is the very liberalism which communitarians attack that has made the notion of community possible, that because of its tenets people can live together in a peaceful, prosperous and just society. 232pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green University, Bowling Green, Ohio 43403-1088, 419/372-2536, fax 419/372-8738.

<b>The Communitarian Challenge to Liberalism,</b> edited by Ellen Frankel Paul, Fred Miller, Jr., and Jeffrey Paul<p>
Social Philosophy and Policy Center<p>
This book focuses on the debate over the protection of individual rights verses the importance of community interests.  The collection of essays included in this volume addresses questions such as whether individual rights should trump group rights, the role communities ought to play in shaping their members' values, and the extent to which government should promote community values. One series of essays deals with conflicts between liberal and communitarian doctrines on the nature of moral agency and the functions of good government. Another collection focuses on alternative ways to conceive of the two doctrines and challenges the basic assumptions about the harmful effects of capitalism on communities. Also explored in this volume are the basic questions of whether it is possible for any society to have one common good, whether culturally diverse states can ever become true communities, and whether participation in the community should be voluntary or mandated by the government. Contributing to this work, and coming from a variety of perspectives are: Neera K. Badhwar; Martha Nussbaum; John Haldane; Chandran Kukathas; Will Kymlicka; David Conway; Steven Kautz; Ronald Beiner; Cass R. Sunstein; George B. Fletcher; Stephen Macedo; Benjamin R. Barber; and James S. Coleman. 306pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green University, Bowling Green, Ohio 43403-1088, 419/372-2536, fax 419/372-8738.

<b>The Cost of Race and Gender Preferences in California Government Contracting,</b> by Tom McClintock<p>
<I>Briefings</I>, No. 1996-53, Claremont Institute<p>
Tom McClintock, Director of Economic and Regulatory Affairs at the Claremont Institute, argues that when arbitrary distinctions are made on factors such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred. The author examines the financial costs associated with such policies, specifically with respect to California government. McClintock relates that affirmative action and racial preferences in California permeate many aspects of life, including education, and that federal requirements incur additional costs. The costs are divided six ways between private and public sectors costs and include costs to government from above market prices, caused by reduced competition, and opportunity costs associated with the application of resources below their highest and best use. 10pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org">http://www.claremont.org.</a>

<b>Still Choosing by Color,</b> by Michael Lynch<p>
<I>Briefings </I>No. 1996-53, Claremont Institute<p>
Michael Lynch, Public Policy Research Fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, looks at the recent report by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on the admissions process at The University of California, Berkeley, calling the validity of their findings into question. For seven years, the OCR has been investigating whether race played an undue influence on admittance to the University. Recently, they concluded that the admissions policy does not discriminate on the basis of race. Lynch holds, however, that the, OCR's findings notwithstanding, race does play a major role in admissions at Berkeley. He charges that the OCR's report does not include even the most basic data on which it should have formed its conclusions (applicant pool versus admission data and SAT GPA data for the various admission categories and ethnic and racial groups). When this matrix of criteria is examined, according to Lynch, it reveals that white and Asian applicants were not given the same access to reviews and were seriously underrepresented  in acceptances when compared to their numbers in the applicant pools. Based upon the sheer empirical evidence, Lynch concludes that the admission policies of UC Berkeley would be found unconstitutional under the recent Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Cheryl Hopwood v. State of Texas.

<b>Virtuous Markets: The Market as School of the Virtues, </b>by Ian Maitland<p>
Center of the American Experiment<p>
Ian Maitland, Senior Fellow at the Center of the American Experiment, questions the assumption that the market destroys virtues such as honesty, loyalty and responsibility.  He asserts that proponents of that philosophy base their belief on the existence of a self-seeking, individualistic mindset which supposedly reigns there. This camp sees the market as both destroying the virtues within society and undermining the market's own moral foundations.  Maitland, however, takes a different point of view.  He argues that rather than undermining societal virtue, the market actually works to generate them. In order for businesses to function successfully, he asserts, they must be staffed by individuals who trust and are able to work with each other.  Trustworthiness, self-control, and sympathy are all virtues he claims the market requires and, because of that need, promotes.  Maitland concludes by calling into question the modern presumption that competition forms the basis of the market system, asserting that cooperation in fact is the most fundamental aspect.  11pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN  55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621.

<b>Theft By Consent: The Lottery's Economic and Social Impact on Alabama,</b> by John Hill<p>
Alabama Family Alliance<p>
John Hill, Policy Analyst at the Alabama Family Alliance, looking at the case currently being made in Alabama in favor of a state lottery, assesses its probable impact on the state's economy.  Despite the promised benefits lottery advocates claim Alabama would reap, Hill finds that any good to come from such programs would be minimal, while the harm would be significant.  By comparing one proposed model to a similar program already in place in Georgia, Hill concludes that the lottery is essentially a voluntary, regressive tax.  The scholarship money lottery revenues provide in Georgia go mostly to upper and middle class students, according to Hill, while the funds from the ticket purchases come mostly from the state's poor. Next, he asserts that lottery sales have led to a decline in food sales equivalent to the revenue of lottery ticket sales, thereby negating any supposed benefit to retailers.  He also documents that the legalization of state sanctioned gambling such as lotteries have been shown to lead to increases in the rate of violent crime, gambling addictions, and, indirectly, instances of spousal abuse. Hill also points to the wide-spread illegal purchases of lottery tickets by teenagers, and notes that administering lottery programs has proven costly in other programs where administrative costs have risen faster than any other form of revenue collection. On the whole Hill, concludes that a state lottery would be an inefficient and costly way to raise state revenues. 25pp.  CONTACT:  Alabama Family Alliance, P.O.

<b><i>City Journal </i></b><br>
Summer 96, Manhattan Institute<p>
This issue of <i>City Journal</i> features an article by Contributing Editor Sol Stern entitled "The Invisible Miracle of Catholic Schools." Stern illustrates how inner-city Catholic schools in New York have educated some the neediest and uneducable kids from the city's most troubled neighborhoods, for a third of what taxpayers spend per pupil for the city's public schools. Despite the proven success of Catholic schools, Stern notes that liberals have ignored them in their search for solutions to the problems of New York's ailing public schools. Other articles in this issue include: "Special Ed: Kids Go In, But They Don't Come Out," by Kay Hymowitz; "Why L.A. is Bouncing Back," by Joel Kotkin; and "Reinventing the Port Authority," by Dick Netzer.

Tom Arrandale, examines what one might expect with the transition from monopolies to competition in the power industry. Arrandale points out that although competition, by nature, brings lower prices, it may raise the price of power for less savvy purchasers. Other articles in this issue include: "Fish Tales," by Charles Mahtesian, which examines the aquarium building binge in several cities in recent years; "Ruckus Over Rating," by Penelope Lemov, which examines controversies in the bond rating system that could bring more government regulation; and "A Dollar's Worth of Government," by Jonathan Walters, which tries to determine exactly what one unit of government service costs.

<b><i>Headway</i></b><br>
July 1996<p>
This issue of <i>Headway</i> features several articles on the issue of what is "authentically black." Joseph Brown, an Editorial Writer with the <i>Tampa Tribune,</i> tells about when his "blackness" was question when he came out on a different side of a policy issue than the civil rights establishment. Meanwhile, Sharon Brooks Hodge shares a story of when her "authenticity" as a black was questioned because she is "articulate." Ron Freeman, President of The Freedom Foundation in Summit, Missouri, argues that authentic blackness should mean being free and responsible to one's self and family, rather than shifting blame and avoiding responsibility. Finally, Jacqueline Gordon, founder and Director of the Christian Women's Forum, laments that too many African-Americans see black "authenticity" and "genuiness" linked to being politically liberal. These viewpoints show how broad generalizations about blacks are enforced within the black community itself and how this serves to work against the original ideals of the civil rights movement. 38 pp.  CONTACT: <i>Headway,</i> 13555 Bammel N.

<b><i>Carolina Journal</b></i><br>
April-May 1996, John Locke Foundation<p>
The April-May <i>Carolina Journal</i> centers on an articled entitled "Lemon and (Sub)Lime: Why We Must Re-engineer State Government." In this article, John Hood, President of the John Locke Foundation, compares state government to the U.S. auto industry to demonstrate the need for political leaders to take risks and be innovative. He finds that over the last 20 years the per-capita cost of state government in north Carolina and the price of a new car grew by about 70 percent in real terms. During the same period of time, however, the quality of these two products moved in separate directions. Concerning education and social services, increased state spending has not shown significant gains in education achievement and a key indicator in social well-being_the number of illegitimate births_has gotten worse. Meanwhile, during the same period of time, the struggling American automobile industry has dramatically improved and has reclaimed a competitive position in the world market. According to Hood, the comparison gives three lessons from the auto industry to state government: 1) competition is essential; 2) managerial flexibility is key; and 3) focus on results is crucial.

<b> CIR Wins Reversal in Fourth Circuit in Smith v VCU</b><p>

In <i>Smith, et al v. Fourth Commonwealth University,</i> CIR is representing five male professors at VCU who claimed sex discrimination when the school gave an en masse raise to female professors in 1992. On May 10, 1996 an en banc panel of the Fourth Circuit issued a decision reversing a district court's grant of summary judgment for the University. The opinion of the court obtained the support of six judges with three concurring and five dissenting.
<p>
The en banc decision rejected the VCU attempt to justify the raises with a regression analysis showing pay disparity between the genders. The court said that there was an issue of material fact whether some of the factors excluded from VCU's study_like performance, productivity and merit_ skewed the results and permitted a false finding of "gender disparity." In separate concurrences, Judge Wilkinson wrote that the "search for knowledge is too important to sacrifice to the spirit of separatism"; and Judge Luttig hailed the importance of merit and performance in salary decisions at VCU and declared the study performed there to be inadmissible evidence of a pay disparity.
<p>
<b>Texas Filed Petition for <i>Writ of Certiorari</i> in <i>Hopwood</i></b><p>
In <i>State of Texas, et al. v. Hopwood, et al.</i>, CIR and the firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher represent Cheryl J. Hopwood and Douglas Wade Carvell, two white applicants to the University of Texas Law School who were denied admission despite credentials that would have led to their admission had they been African-American or Mexican-American. In March, the Fifth Circuit held that the school's use of racial preferences in student admissions was unconstitutional and ruled that the Law School could not continue to consider race in its admission process. On April 30, 1996, defendants filed Petition for <i>Writ of Certiorari </I> asking the United States Supreme Court to take the case.
<p>
Defendants provided no less than six separate questions for review. They argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that: 1) Justice Powell's view in <i>Regents of California v. Bakke</i> that "diversity" constituted a compelling state interest is the law of the land: 2) the law school was permitted to rely upon discrimination in some of Texas' public elementary and high schools in adopting a race-based admissions policy, despite clear statements in Supreme Court opinions to the contrary, and :3) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is unconstitutional to the extent that it permits damage claims against states. The Clinton Administration filed an <i>amicus </I> brief on defendants' behalf agreeing with the first two contentions, and, indeed, going further to assert that the law school had a compelling interest in <i>racial diversity</i> (as opposed to the more limited notion of diversity in Justice Powell's <i>Bakke</I> opinion). Even the Clinton Administration, however, could not adopt defendants' argument that the Title VI is unconstitutional.
<p>
The plaintiffs-respondents Hopwood and Carvell filed papers in May in opposition to Texas' petition  refuting these and other even less-plausible arguments. On July 1, 1996 the Supreme Court denied the petition for <i>Certiorari.</i> The case now returns to the District court for the issue of damages.

<b>Developments in the Milwaukee School Choice Litigation:</b><p>
The Wisconsin Supreme Court denied the state's motion to reconsider its ruling dismissing its original jurisdiction over the litigation. That means IJ will be in Dane County Circuit Court. 
<p>
The chief judge of the Dane County Court denied the state's motion to substitute Judge Paul Higginbotham. The judge has a liberal reputation, but seems committed to a prompt resolution of the case. Contrary to press reports, Judge Higginbotham has never issued any substantive ruling in this case_the injunction was issued by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and remains in effect pending a ruling by Judge Higginbotham.
<p>
Following these two rulings, IJ promptly filed a motion to dissolve the injunction and to schedule an evidentiary hearing. Although IJ asked the court to dissolve the injunction in its entirety, they asked the alternative that it dissolve the injunction as to nonsectarian schools, because only one of the remaining legal issues affects them.
<p>
<b><i>Black v. Village of Park Forest</i></b><p>
The Institute challenges a housing inspection ordinance in a southern Chicago suburb that allows local officials to conduct warrant-less, non-consensus inspections of single-family rental homes. On June 25, IJ filed briefs in support of cross-motions for summary judgment in the case. Briefs will be filed throughout the summer and a decision could come as early as September. The Institute represents tenants who reside in rental homes in Park Forest. The objective of the lawsuit is to establish that if government inspectors wish to enter rental homes, they must first ask for and receive a tenant's explicit consent. If tenants do not wish to grant inspectors access to their homes, the government must obtain a search warrant based on some reasonable belief (probable cause) that the housing code is being violated.
<p>
<b>Davis Bacon Act Challenge</b><p>
Representing four black construction contractors and three public housing organizations, the Institute for Justice amassed historical and economic research showing that the Davis-Bacon Act was originally intended to discriminate against black construction workers and that it is still having that effect today. The Institute has submitted six briefs and three large appendices. A decision could come anywhere between the next moth or sometime next year.
<p>
<b>New Jersey Welfare Case</b><p>
The Third Circuit heard oral arguments on June 10 in the appeal of the district court's decision upholding New Jersey's welfare reform program. The district court held that freezing welfare benefits and refusing to give additional benefits for additional children does not violate the rights of AFDC recipients. Legal Services of New Jersey, with the assistance of the ACLU and NOW, appealed the decision. Representing three New Jersey AFDC recipients and three public interest organizations, the Institute for Justice submitted briefs in the district court and the appeals court. IJ's briefs showed how the New Jersey case fits into a carefully-planned welfare rights agenda, orchestrated by Legal Services attorneys. A decision is expected in the next few months.
<p>
<b>Inter-racial Adoption Case</b>
<p>
<i>Matthew O. and Joseph I. v. Texas Dept. of Protective and Regulatory Services,</i> the Institute's attack on barriers to interracial adoptions, a state trial court recently denied class certification. Judge F. Scott McCown Found that Lou Ann and Scott Mullen, acting as next friends to the proposed class of minority children, cannot adequately represent the class because neither is Mexican or African American, while most of the class members are. Thus, the court found the Mullens "lack the identity of interest necessity."
<p>
The court further found that the Institute's argument that the use of race in adoption is unconstitutional_combined with its overall efforts challenging racial classifications and the regulatory welfare state_create a "very serious conflict of interest" with the proposed class. Such a conflict also precluded class certification.

Devils Tower Triumph_Climbers in Business</b><p>
A landmark challenge brought by users of Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming has ensured that all may use the nation's first monument pending a trial. An order from Wyoming federal district court prevents the National Park Service (NPS) from closing the site for religious observances by a number of Native Americans. The Wyoming court granted MSLF's motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the NPS from closing Devils Tower to commercial climbing to conform their conduct in furtherance of those American Indians' religious necessities (which) amounts to "impermissible governmental entanglement with religion."
<p>
<b>Victory in Crooked Lake II</b><p>
Property owners on Crooked Lake in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan won a second victory when a federal district court ruled in their favor in another challenge to the attempt by the U.S. Forest Service to regulate private property due to its adjacency to a federal wilderness area. On May 16, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan barred the Forest Service from enforcing regulations denying MSLF clients motorboats access to Crooked Lake. The court agreed with MSLF on all counts, ruling: only Congress may use the Property Clause; only federal land was designated as part of the wilderness; private land could become part of the wilderness only with the consent of the owner; buffer zones could not be created around the wilderness; and wilderness designation is "subject to valid existing rights."
<p>
<b>Gasoline Tax: Unconstitutional?</b><p>
As the national debate heats up on the controversial fuel tax that was part of the 1993 Clinton tax package, MSLF has asked the Supreme Court to rule that the tax was unconstitutional on the day President Clinton signed it into law. MSLF believes the tax violates the Constitution's Origination Clause since it failed to originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The lawsuit challenging the tax was filed by the Wyoming Trucking Association before federal district court in Wyoming where the court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case. The district court ruled that, by act of Congress, any challenge to a federal tax must first be heard by the Internal Revenue Service. On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the appellate court, while expressing concern as to whether the Origination Clause was violated, agreed with the district court that Congress had prohibited suits such as the one filed by the Wyoming Trucking Association.

<B>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION<P>
Punitive Damages Case</b><p>
In a case that has generated much publicity, the U.S. Supreme Court has, for the first time ever, reversed a state court award of punitive damages on the grounds that the damages were so excessive as to offend constitutional due process. This case may induce lower courts to begin to rein in spiraling punitive awards which have made some state courts into virtual litigation lotteries.
<p>
<i>Gore v. BMW </i>was an Alabama case awarding $2 million in punitive damages to a doctor whose BMW was repainted without his knowledge before he bought it. The case was a paradigm of the absurdities that occur under the current system which allows juries virtually complete discretion to award punitive damages. NWLF's <i>amicus</i> brief, filed on behalf of the  New England Council, argued for constitutional guidelines to restrain such awards. This decision begins that process.
<p>
<b>Massachusetts Employment Case</b><p>
After Ms. O' Brien, who had no written employment contract with the company, was detected making anonymous calls to her supervisor, she was fired. She sued for breach of contract in Superior Court and in <i>O'Brien v. NYNEX</I> she won a total judgment of $500,000. That award included, in addition to a large breach of contract award against the company, $100,000 against her supervisor for his malicious interference with her employment.
<p>
NELF argued to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that the lower court had erred in finding that Ms. O'Brien could base a breach of contract action on the company's Personnel Manual. While the SJC did allow the contract action, it held, as NELF and NYNEX had argued, that if the Manual constituted a "contract," O'Brien had to follow all the rules in the contract including the grievance process. Since she never filed a grievance, the court held that she forfeited any "contract" right she may have had.
<p>
The court, however, did uphold the award against the supervisor personally. In a decision that may reflect the unusual facts of this case, the court held that a jury could find that the supervisor was so personally antagonistic to Ms. O'Brien that he forfeited future cases to ensure that this ruling does not create a loophole allowing fired employees to recover tort damages in employment cases. 
<p>
<b>Retroactive Property Tax Case</b>
<p>NELF will represent the Connecticut Business & Industry association in a Connecticut tax case involving Southern Connecticut Gas Company in which the primary issue is whether a town can reassess a taxpayer's listed property years after the tax was levied and paid.
Connecticut law requires owners of property to file an annual list of all real and personal property with the town in which the property is located. The town has a period to review the data and then it publishes a "Grand List" which includes all property in the town and its taxable values. In this case, a town seeking additional revenue reassessed the company's property years after the tax was paid.
<p>
Connecticut law permits the Grand List to be revised to include "omitted" property. The Superior Court rejected the town's effort to stretch that provision to cover a dispute over the property's value. If the town is successful, all Connecticut property owners will face a dramatically higher risk of retroactive property tax bills.
<p>
<b>NELF Fights Unemployment Compensation Award</b><p>
On behalf of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, NELF will file an <i>amicus</I> brief in the SJC in a Massachusetts unemployment compensation appeal which involves whether an employee who was fired knowingly violating a reasonable and uniformly enforced company policy can still receive unemployment compensation. The employee, a nursing aide, was fired for cursing an elderly patient in violation of a policy against verbal or physical patient abuse.
<p>
The Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed a lower court's denial of benefits, adding a "deliberate" glass to the statute. NGLF's brief will argue that that decision is legally wrong and would undermine laws and rules prohibiting patient and elderly abuse and, more generally, it would lower the already low threshold for receiving unemployment benefits, raising costs for Massachusetts employers and employees.
<p>
<b>Veteran's Tax Case Reaches End of the line</b><p>
After four years of litigation and a supporting brief from the U.S. Solicitor General, the U.S. Supreme Court has designed a petition for <i>certiorari </i>in NELF's effort to stop Massachusetts' policy of taxing federal military retirement benefits.

<B>NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION, INC.<P>
Union Scheme Against New Employees</b><p>
National Right to Work Foundation attorneys have filed unfair labor practice charges with the Washington State Personnel Board on behalf of a Tocoma hospital employee after a state agency and its union concealed information from newly hired workers detailing their rights to cut off the use of compulsory union dues for politics.
<p>
Western State Hospital social worker Jennie Stephenson brought charges which describe how the Washington Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and the Washington Federation of State Employees (WFSE) union, in new employee orientation programs routinely withhold details on the limits of union-mandated forced-dues payments.
<p>
Foundation attorneys charge that the failure of an employer to provide such information violated regulations concerning employment relations.
<p>
In her charges, Ms. Stephenson seeks an order to restore the constitutional rights of workers by requiring that DSHS immediately begin informing new employees of their rights to withhold forced dues for politics. She also is asking for a refund of nonchargeable fees, plus interest, collected in the last six months, the removal of barriers to challenging forced-dues amounts, and the full disclosure of the right to withhold forced dues to all members of the bargaining unit.

<B>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION<P>
<i>BMW v. Gore</i>: Punitive Damages</b><p>
In a major victory for civil justice reform, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 opinion on May 20, 1996, that a $2 million punitive damage award for minor paint damage to a BMW automobile was "grossly excessive" under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The landmark decision came only a few weeks after president Clinton, at the insistence of plaintiffs' lawyers, vetoed a measure that would have placed limits on the award of punitive damages in product liability case. WLF argued that the $ 2 million punitive damages, 500 times the amount of the compensatory damages, was clearly excessive in light of BMW's good faith effort to comply with applicable disclosure laws and reasonable industry standards.
<p>
<b><i>Bennett v. Plenert</i>: Endangered Species Act</b><p>
On May 24, 1996, WLF filed a brief in U.S. Supreme Court supporting the rights of persons affected by federal decisions taken under the Endangered Species Act to sue under the citizen suit provision of the ESA in order to challenge those decisions. WLF's clients include Senator Dick Kempthorne of Idaho, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife, Representative Richard W. Pombo, Chairman of the Resources Committee Task Force on Endangered Species, and Representatives Bill Baker, Helen Chenoweth and Gerald Solomon and the Fairness to Land Owners Committee. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled that only environmentalists who wish to protect endangered species have standing to challenge agency decisions in court. WLF argued that businesses, ranchers, property owners and others who are directly affected by decisions under the ESA should also have a standing to challenge the excessiveness of agency decision making under the ESA.
<p>
<b><i>Habeas Corpus </i>Reform Measure</b><p>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court on May 17, in this expedited case to hear a challenge to the recently enacted <i>habeas corpus</i> reform measure. A hearing in the case was held on June 3, 1996. The death row defendant in this case challenged the constitutionality of the new law enacted earlier this year that limits the ability of death row inmates to file second and successive <i>habeas corpus </i>petitions. The law has a "gatekeeper" provision that requires that such petitions be first approved by a three judge panel of the respective U.S. Court of Appeals and that decisions granting or denying the filing of the petition cannot be reviewed in the Supreme Court. The oral argument centered around the question of whether Congress could deprive the Supreme Court of original jurisdiction to hear <i>habeas corpus </i>petition filed with the High Court. The last time such a petition was granted was over 70 years ago.
<p>
<b><i>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona</i>: Official English</b><p>
On May 24, 1996, WFL filed a brief in the Supreme Court supporting a provision in the Arizona Constitution that requires state employees to speak English while on the job. In its brief, WLF represented 34 Members of Congress, the State of Nebraska, and the Claremont Institute, and argued that the First Amendment rights of government employed are not infringed by a state law requiring that official business of the state be transacted in English. In this case, a government employee argued that the First Amendment protected her right to settle damage claims against the State of Arizona in Spanish rather than in English.

<hr><P>
<font size=3> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once in a while, someone comes up with an idea everyone can agree on. Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy has come up with a way for all Americans to know exactly how much their employers have to pay the government -- and for what -- in order to keep them on the payroll. It's called the Right to Know Payroll Form.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	If your employer adopted this form, your pay stub would show every bit of money the government takes from your pocket each payday. And why shouldn't you have this information? You're a taxpayer and the government is supposed to serve you, not the other way around. These costs affect you directly. Who can object to your knowing? 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The "Right to Know" pay stub would tell you how much your employer paid: 1) to administer federal, state and local taxes; 2) to comply with mandatory programs like the Americans with Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, etc.; 3) for unemployment insurance; 4) for workers' compensation; 5) for the employer's share of Medicare; and 6) for the employer's share of Social Security. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Did you know all that was coming out of your paycheck? Well, we're not through, of course. We haven't mentioned the rest of the items that would appear on your pay stub: 1) withholding for federal income tax; 2) withholding for state income tax; 3) the employee's share of the Social Security tax; 4) the employee's share of the Medicare tax; 5) withholding for local income tax. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After all that is deducted from your earnings, you get to keep what's left. Just so you have some idea how your pay stub would look money-wise, take the example provided by the Mackinac Center, based on current tax rates. John Doe's two-week pay stub starts with an amount of $1,026.59, which represents the total amount his employer must put up to pay all the costs we mentioned, plus pay John Doe. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	After the first group of costs listed above are taken out -- in other words, the "hidden" money that vanishes before Mr. Doe sees a single penny, even on paper -- John is left with a gross of $916.67. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, take special note: The way John Doe's pay stub now reads, he has the impression that $916.67 is his total cost to his employer. Yet, the "Right to Know" payroll stub tells a different story: that his employer already has paid $109.92 to the government just to employ Mr. Doe. Every two weeks. And the same is true for every employee.	Then, all the rest is taken out -- Social Security, income tax, etc. And what is John Doe left with out of a total $1,026.59? Just $686.67. Another way to put it: Before John could be paid $686.67, the government had to be paid $339.92. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Well, now. Doesn't that seem like a lot? It does to me. Don't you think that if all Americans could see in this kind of detail exactly how much of their money is being diverted to the government -- much of it before they even know about it -- they might have a few more questions about why the government needs that much money and what is being done with it? I do. In fact, I think every employer should give this sort of accounting to every employee. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And many in Michigan already have. The largest, and most notable, is the State of Michigan. That's right, all 60,000 State of Michigan employees will receive a list of what the state -- the taxpayers, really -- must pay for their Social Security and Medicare taxes. Although the state will not provide employees with the costs of workers' compensation or unemployment insurance, this is a great first step. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the Right to Know Payroll Form is a great idea. Imagine a country where every employee knew how much government <I>really</I> cost him or her in the form of lost wages. I suppose this kind of "better-informed citizenry" would make a few people in liberal, big-government circles just a wee bit uncomfortable. After all, people suddenly would see the hand of big government dipping into their wallets every couple of weeks, whereas before it was done on the sly. But liberal discomfort has never bothered me before.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	And it doesn't bother me now.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1079.html">American Military Intervention: A User's Guide,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/hillen.html">John Hillen</a><p>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1079, The Heritage Foundation<p>
John Hillen, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, writes that, America will continue to squander its military resources on such inconclusive and tangential operations as Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, if concrete guidelines for military intervention are not adopted. Hillen lists five criteria for military intervention: 1) it should defend national security interests; 2) it should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments; 3) it should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable; 4) it should enjoy congressional and public support; and 5) the armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success. Congress should also require, according to Hillen, that the National Security Strategy, an annual report by the President to Congress, contain: a prioritization of national interests and national security interests; a listing of criteria, such as those listed here, that will give guidelines for when, where, whether, and how the U.S. military should conduct military interventions; a set of criteria for deciding when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other structures; an unequivocal guarantee that the President will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies; and a declaration that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive and attainable military objectives that can be achieved through proven military doctrine. 19 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Imperative of American Leadership: 
A Challenge to Neo-Isolationism, </b>
by Joshua Muravchik <p>
The American Enterprise Institute<p>
Joshua Muravchik, a Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, calls for an active, interventionist American post-cold war foreign policy. Muravchik argues that at times "America must be the policeman -- at others, the mediator, teacher, or benefactor." Only America, as the sole superpower, can provide leadership in upholding world peace. Muravchik uses the case of Bosnia to illustrate his argument. He asserts that Europe's and the United Nations' unimpressive response to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia revealed the decay of the United Nations and remains as the saddest example America leaving leadership to others. He claims that the current "great divide" over American foreign policy "is no longer between hawks and doves but between 'Washingtonians' (isolationists and so-called 'realists' who want above all to 'avoid entangling alliances') and 'Wilsonians' (activists prepared to spend treasure and even blood to defend world peace)." He also believes that America's domestic problems -- both economic and social -- arise more from weakness of character than from lack of money or presidential attention. He believes that addressing domestic problems and conducting an active foreign policy go hand in hand. 261 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th Street, N.W., Washington, DC  20036, 202/862-5800, fax 202/862-7178.

<b>The World Bank and Economic Growth: 50 Years of Failure,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1082.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1082,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Bryan Johnson, Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, examines the unsuccessful efforts of the World Bank to promote economic growth in less developed countries. In light of President Clinton's recommendation that the United States give more money to institutions like the World Bank, Johnson shows that the Bank's approach to economic development has not worked. Concerning the World Bank, Johnson says Congress should: 1) phase out financial support for it; 2) seek a General Accounting Office audit of its lending practices; 3) make remaining funding contingent on public access to its records and information; and 4) require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries. Johnson provides a detailed history of the bank, and illustrates its failed policies. In his conclusion, Johnson points out that although the World Bank played an important role in getting Europe on its feet after World War II, it has drifted from its original mission to become little more than a clearinghouse for international welfare. 21 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>A Miasma of Corruption: The United Nations
at 50,</b> by Stefan Halper<p>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 253, Cato Institute<p>
According to Stefan Halper, a former White House and State Department official, the United Nations' lack of accountability to its member-nations has led to corruption, mismanagement and a disconnect between costs and benefits. Halper presents a detailed analysis of mismanagement at the U.N., citing such evidence of corruption as: "secretive budget practices; an ever-growing army of irresponsible, unaccountable bureaucrats; and a massive duplication of effort." Overall, he calls for a comprehensive, independent audit of the United Nations, followed by drastic downsizing and reform, including privatization of many agencies. If such steps are not taken, Halper recommends the United States consider terminating U.N. membership. 24 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>Wages, Profits, and Income: Politics vs. Reality,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi97.html"><I>F.Y.I</I>. No. 97,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Mark Wilson, The Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy at the Heritage Foundation, examines the conventional American wisdom that says that wages are down, the middle class is shrinking, corporations are getting fat, and the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. Wilson shows conventional wisdom to be wrong. For example, while there has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase. He also shows that higher profits benefit workers, while falling profits limit compensation growth. Wilson, concludes that to the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, more government programs, restrictions on trade, and increasing the minimum wage will not bring a solution. Policies that focus on the primary problems -- high taxes and slow productivity growth -- need to be implemented. 11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Promise and Peril: Implementing a Regulatory Budget,</b> by Clyde Wayne Crews<p>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project,</I> Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Clyde Wayne Crews, Fellow in Regulatory Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, illustrates how Americans live under a regime of "Regulation Without Representation," noting that much of today's regulatory rulemaking is done by agency bureaucrats not accountable to voters. He also points out that the amount of <I>non-tax</I> dollars government requires to be spent on regulation is equivalent to over one-third of the level of government spending. Crews proposes a "regulatory budget" that would enforce greater accountability by limiting the regulatory costs that agencies can impose on the private sector. Ideally, a full-scale budget paralleling the fiscal budget could be implemented. This would require Congress to divide a total budget among agencies. Crews argues that the real innovation of regulatory budgeting is its potential to make regulatory agencies feel the consequences of regulatory decision making, rather than the regulated parties alone. There are, however, some pitfalls to regulatory budgeting according to Crews. For example, under a budget, agencies have an incentive to underestimate compliance costs while regulated parties have the opposite incentive. Crews concludes that a regulatory budget is not a magic device that alone can reduce the current $647 billion cost of regulatory compliance. But, while burdens continue to increase and the benefits of regulation seems more ambiguous, it is necessary to make institutional changes that specify the purpose and reach of delegated regulatory power.  28 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, D.C., 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640.<p>

<b>Broken Promises: What's Gone Wrong with the Economy in the 1990's</b>, by Stephen Moore <p>
<I>IPI Policy Report</I> No. 136, The Institute for 
Policy Innovation<p>
Stephen Moore, IPI Research Fellow, examines the sluggish economic growth of recent years, illustrating the distinct and deliberate change in fiscal policy that has taken place under Presidents Bush and Clinton. Moore shows that compared to the supply-side fiscal policies of President Reagan, the tax-and-spend polices of the 1990's raised the overall tax burden by 1.25 percent of GDP, real federal non-defense spending rose by 30 percent, median family income has fallen by 5 percent (or $2,100 per household) and that tax hikes have failed to deliver the promised revenue. Moore concludes that if the tax-and-spend policies of Bush and Clinton continue, the 1990's will produce the largest budget deficits and the slowest economic growth rate of any decade in the past half century. 29 pp.  CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 250 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX 75057, 214/219-0811, fax 214/219-2625, e-mail <a href="mailto: ipi@I-link.net">ipi@i-link.net</a>, Internet http://www.ipi.org.

<b>Market Opening or Corporate Welfare?<br>
"Results-Oriented" Trade Policy Toward Japan,</b> by Scott Latham<p>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 252, Cato Institute<p>
Under President Clinton, the United States has become progressively more protectionist in trade policy according to Scott Latham, an international trade consultant. He argues that in trade disputes with Japan over cars, semiconductors and photographic film, the Administration policy constitutes "corporate welfare in the international arena." The trade disputes, according to Latham, are a result of American firms' enlisting intervention in trade by the government to make up for their previous neglect of the Japanese market. These firms seek "bureaucrat-to-bureaucrat managed trade, not free trade." This study reveals the biggest beneficiaries of the Clinton Administration's protectionist trade policy toward Japan, and concludes that American charges of closed Japanese markets for the disputed products are groundless. Overall, according to Latham, results-based trade policy is not about opening markets, but instead about granting special favors to policitally powerful U.S. industries. 47 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto:cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>The Decline of the Nation-State in International Trade and Investment: Is the United States Losing Its Grip?</b> by William H. Lash, III<p>
<I>Policy Brief,</I> No. 168, Center for the 
Study of American Business<p>
William Lash, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business, examines whether United States sovereignty and the concept of a nation state have been diminished with the expansion of trade agreements and the dominance of transnational corporations. He finds that the nation-state is alive and well in today's freer market place, as well as American sovereignty, arguing that what was widely perceived as a threat to U.S. sovereignty, the World Trade Organization (WTO), by law cannot usurp national sovereignty. Furthermore, 94 percent of U.S. investors have their portfolios limited to U.S. firms, while foreign investors still face many restrictions in the U.S. in industries such as nuclear energy, broadcasting, coastal and inland shipping, and domestic air transportation. Another reason nation states remain strong is cultural identity. Lash predicts that consumers and corporations clinging to cultural identity will fortify the notion of a nation-state and continue to support trade. Lash gives the examples of Canada excluding the U.S. operated Country Music Television and the EU restricting the import of non-European television programming and film. Efficiency, the concept that experts believed would lead to the demise of the nation-state by multilateralism, may not always be what the population desires, concludes Lash. 15 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>Federal Estate and Gift Taxes: Are They Worth the Cost? </b><p>
The Center for the Study of Taxation<p>
This report was published by The Center for the Study of Taxation to illustrate the effect of estate and gift taxes on family businesses, federal revenues and the national economy. Many people presume that the estate tax will not affect them unless they have a large estate. However, a home, a modest investment portfolio, life insurance, retirement benefits, and/or business property can easily qualify as an estate in the taxable range. Ironically, the report notes that the tax does not even raise very much revenue for the federal government. The federal government spends the equivalent of 65 percent of the revenue raised by estate taxes just to enforce compliance with the tax. Overall, this report shows that estate and gift taxes cost people jobs by presenting a huge obstacle to business continuity and business growth as well as limiting the creation of new jobs and increasing the cost of capital accumulation. 16 pp. CONTACT: The Center for the Study of Taxation, 695 Town Center Drive, Suite 1460, Costa Mesa, CA 92626-1924, 714/641-8067, fax 714/641-3128.

<b>The Flat Tax and Small Business,</b> by Scott Moody<p>
<I>Issue Analysis,</I> No. 26, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
Scott Moody, Flat Tax Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, examines the effect of the proposed Shelby/Armey flat tax on small business. He finds that the flat tax simplifies the current income tax by dramatically downsizing the 600 different tax forms into just two, each the size of a postcard. This simplification would reduce the cost of complying with the current tax code for all businesses by 94 percent-from $150.6 billion per year to $9.4 billion a year. Moody also illustrates how small businesses bare a much higher compliance cost in relation to their total revenue than larger businesses The flat tax allows for higher capital spending by small businesses, and eliminates the double taxation that occurs when there is a capital gains tax. Investments in small businesses gain profits nearly exclusively as capital gains. So eliminating the capital gains tax would help small businesses immensely. 13 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet http://www.cse.org/cse.

<b>New Jersey Income Tax Cut Led to Savings, 
Not Rise in Local Taxes,</b> by Timothy Goodspeed and Peter Salins<p>
<I>Civic Report</I> No. 1, The Manhattan Institute<p>
Timothy Goodspeed, Professor of Economics at Hunter College, and Peter Salins, Professor of Urban Affairs and Planning at Hunter College and a Senior Fellow at the Manhanttan Institute, illustrate that Governor Whitman's income tax cut in New Jersey lead to savings in local taxes. They found that historically, "there has been little or no relationship between income tax rates, which have varied significantly, and property tax rates, which have increased consistently but moderately." In 1995, the first year of the Whitman tax cuts, there was virtually no change in real property taxes relative to 1994. Goodspeed and Salins also point to an economic phenomenon called "the flypaper" effect. The flypaper effect says that localities are more likely to spend lump sum grants from the state than they are to spend money raised by local revenues. This means, for example, that local school boards are more efficient with their funds when they have to answer directly to the local community. 10 pp. CONTACT: The Manhattan Institute, 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017, 212/599-7000, fax 212/599-3494. <p>

<b>What Medicare's Advisers are Telling Congress About Medicare Reform,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi99.html"><I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 99,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Robert Moffit, Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, reports that the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) and Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC) have called on Congress and the President to slow the explosive growth in Medicare spending. PROPAC and PPRC are official panels that were established to advise Congress on Medicare reimbursement and physician payment reform. The panels gave Congress the following significant recommendations and opinions on general Medicare reform: 1) Medicare spending urgently needs to be controlled; 2) beneficiaries of Medicare need to be given more choices; 3) neither panel opposes Medical Savings Accounts; and 4) today's Medicare price controls cause limitations and heavy costs. Overall, Moffit concludes, the reports of these two commissions underscore the need for fundamental reform. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Establishment Strikes Back: Medical Savings Accounts and Adverse Selection,</b> by Peter Ferrara<p>
<I>Briefing Paper</I> No. 26, The Cato Institute<p>
Peter Ferrara, Associate Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, challenges the criticism directed toward Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) as a component of proposed structural reforms of Medicare. Critics of MSAs argue that they would appeal only to the healthy while traditional Medicare would be left to serve the sick. Ferrara, however, shows that recent studies that argue this point are seriously flawed. Based on actuarial studies and experience in the private sector, MSAs will appeal to a wide cross section of the elderly, regardless of their health status. Overall, Ferrara concludes that MSAs remain the best hope for reforming the Medicare system. 12 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, E-mail <a href="mailt:cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org,</a>Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>Perspectives on the Continuing Debate Over School Choice</b><p>
<I>Dialogue</I> No. 13, Pioneer Institute<p>
In the November 1995 issue of <I>Dialogue, "Responses to a Harvard Study on School Choice: Is It a Study at All?"</I> The Pioneer Institute gathered nine school choice experts to critique a draft manuscript of <I>Who Chooses, Who Loses? Culture, Institutions, and the Unequal Effects of School Choice,</I>edited by Harvard Professors Richard Elmore, Gary Orfield, and Bruce Fuller. Professor Fuller requested the opportunity to respond to Pioneer's critique. In this response, Fuller defends the impartiality of the research compiled by him and his colleagues. He also welcomes the stimulation to the debate that the Pioneer study contributes, but criticizes the fact that only advocates of school choice were invited for the critique. Fuller maintains that the empirical evidence shows that school choice is not the panacea that advocates proclaim. Terry Moe, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and participant in the Pioneer critique, responds to Fuller's defense of his study. Moe points out that the Harvard study was not undertaken by impartial researchers either. Furthermore, the Harvard study is, in reality, not a real "study" as its authors proclaim. The Harvard report was merely a collection of separate papers presented at a conference and complied into one volume. Moe writes that on the brute facts, the Harvard report and the Pioneer critique do not differ too much. The difference is in the interpretation. The Harvard report is negative and Moe thinks that this is unjustified. 8 pp. CONTACT: Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research, 85 Devonshire Street, 8th floor, Boston, MA 2109, 617/723-2277, fax 617/723-1880.

<b>The Decline of Academic Standards in California Public Education: The Story Behind the Student Testing Fiasco,</b> by Ben Boychuk<p>
<I>Briefings</I> No. 1996-49, The Claremont Institute<p>
Ben Boychuk, Research Associate at the Claremont Institute, examines the issue of educational standards and educational reform. The essential question, asks Boychuk, is: Would schools be improved by raising standards in the present system, or is a more fundamental overhaul needed? To answer this, he looks at the state of California and their well-documented attempts at education reform by raising standards. "Back-to-basics" reforms in the early eighties, which refocused on skills instruction, such as grammar, spelling, addition, and subtraction, brought slow but steady improvement in student exam score. Later in the 1980's, however, state education officials shifted their focus away from basic skills and implemented policies popular at teachers' colleges and among progressive education theorists. In 1987, these abstract educational theories were implemented on a much more ambitious scale with the result being that verbal and math SAT scores dropped dramatically. Boychuk  urges parents to stress a "basics-first" philosophy in their local schools and not to just ask for stated curriculum goals and academic standards. Parents should monitor homework and/or classroom assignments for academic as opposed to an "attitudes" focus. For, districts, he suggests a review of current standards for academic rigor, appropriate scope and sequence. Districts should also eschew teaching fads and require basic instruction in reading, grammar, composition, correct spelling, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. Finally, collective bargaining agreements with local teachers' unions should be re-examined to see if they interfere with curriculum reform efforts. 25 pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, E-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com"> 2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet http://www.claremont.org

<b>Superfund: The Shortcut that Failed,</b> by Richard L. Stroup<p>
<I>Policy Series</I> No. PS-5, Political Economy Research Center<p>
According to Richard Stroup, Senior Associate at PERC, Superfund, the federal program to clean up hazardous waste sites, was supposed to be a shortcut. The Environmental Protection Agency was given authority by Congress to clean up waste sites immediately and then bill the responsible parties. Stroup argues that Superfund has failed to achieve the desired results and that it should be scrapped. Superfund has replaced common-law procedures with nearly unchecked bureaucratic control. Overall, Stroup calls for Congress to allow both citizens who feel harmed (or at risk) and those accused of wrongdoing access to judicial review. This would curb the tendency by EPA, according to Stroup,  to create unsubstantiated and exaggerated fears in order to justify expensive cleanups. 28 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Avenue, Suite 211, Bozeman, MT  59715, 406/587-9591, fax 406/586-7555.

<b>Property Rights, Regulatory Takings, and Environmental Protection,</b> by Jonathan Adler<p>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Jonathan Adler, Director of Environmental Studies at The Competitive Enterprise Institute, challenges the notion that property rights undermine sound environmental conservation. Instead, he argues, they lie at its foundation. Under current environmental laws the federal government can, through regulation, take private land without just compensation. This directly contradicts the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The government pays the owner the value of his land when it takes the owner's property to create a publicly-desired resource, such as a military base, road, or wildlife preserve. However, when the government forces a property owner to alone bear a public burden on his land through regulation, the government rarely pays anything. For the last two decades, federal land-use control has been the most utilized way of achieving environmental objectives. Adler calls for Congress to ensure compensation for regulatory takings to restore Constitutionally guaranteed property rights and to lead toward the development of a new generation of environmental protection. Groups opposing compensation for regulatory takings argue that requiring compensation would impose an extreme financial burden upon the federal government. Adler argues that such claims are overstated and that requiring federal agencies to pay compensation would make them "more aware of the financial risks of over-relying on land-use regulation to achieve statutory goals." Other approaches, notes Adler such as incentive-based wetland conservation programs, present a possible way to achieve statutory goals on a far more cost-effective basis. Furthermore, forcing agencies to pay for the private property right they revoke through regulatory takings will encourage them to examine non-regulatory approaches to protecting the environment. Adler concludes that compensating landowners eliminates the negative environmental incentives created by the heavy hand of existing government regulations. 30 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connect

<b>Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife,</b>
by Robert Smith<p>
Competitive Enterprise Institute's Center
for Private Conservation<p>
Robert Smith, Senior Environmental Scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argues that where human activity has contributed to species decline, the problem of overexplotation or overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather than private ownership. According to Smith, wherever there is public ownership one finds overuse, waste, and extinction. Private ownership, however, results in sustained-yield use and preservation. He uses the case of salmon to illustrate his point. Because no one owns the rights to salmon, each user of this common property resource is pitted against one another. This has lead to rapid depletion of the stock. Meanwhile, in some European countries, salmon fisheries are healthy because the rights to the salmon or the salmon rivers are privately owned. Game ranches, hunting preserves and safari parks also add support to the argument. Overexplotation and extinction of wildlife appears to stem from their treatment as a common property resource. The proper method for wildlife conservation, argues Smith, is creating private property rights. 24 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Private Conservation, Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640, e-mail <a href="mailto: cpc@cei.org">cpc@cei.org.</a>

<I>Report</I> Vol. 9, No. 4, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute<p>
John DiIulio, Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton, and George Mitchell, a member of the Governor's Task Force on Corrections, challenge arguments that American prisons are overflowing with low-level drug offenders and first-time non-violent criminals who can be safely released into the community. This study examined the portfolios of Wisconsin prisoners now serving sentences. This allowed DiIulio and Mitchell to trace the prisoner's criminal histories back to the juvenille justice system. They found that 91% of the inmates had current or prior conviction for a violent crime, the recidivism rate is approximately 90%, the majority had violated their probation or parole. The authors conclude that the people who really go to prison in Wisconsin are violent criminals and criminals with long records. 37 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI  53211, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup276.html"><I>Backgrounder Update</I></a> No. 276, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Kenneth Boehm, Chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, calls for the abolishment of federal funding for the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). During the FY 1996 appropriations process, congressional leaders reduced a fraction of the funding for the LSC with a promise to end the federal subsidy by 1998. However, during the 1980s supporters and employees of LSC grantees fought efforts to reform federal subsidies to the Corporation. They mounted a massive lobbying campaign, financed in part by federal funds, and devised loopholes to avoid the few restrictions that eventually were imposed. With renewed pressure to reform in 1995, LSC fought back with strategies designed to ensure that their spending habits and politicized activities would continue-business as usual. Therefore, according to Boehm, it is imperative that Congress reaffirm its decision to phase out federal subsidies by 1998. 7 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org"> Insider@heritage.org.</a>

The group issues papers that usually stress two points: 1) locking up criminals does not reduce crime; and 2) the criminal justice system is rigged against minorities. Instead of focusing on the finding of guilt and the appropriate punishment for criminal acts, TSP examines the sociology of the "root causes" of crime. Among the groups that TSP has great influence over are liberal judges, criminal defense attorneys, and law professors. Because their papers tend to blame criminal activity on the failures of society, their answer to crime is more government money for Social programs. TSP illustrates, according to the paper, why legislation should be passed preventing federal funds for groups to lobby for more federal funds.  4 pp. </ul>

<b>American Orphanages: How We Used to Care for Children,</b> by Marvin Olasky<p>
<I>Philanthropy, Culture & Society,</I> Capital Research Center<p>
Marvin Olasky, Senior Fellow at the Progress & Freedom Foundation, presents a short history of the American orphanage. This research comes in light of the search for alternatives of failed welfare programs and alternatives to government as the cure for societal ills. Much of his findings contradict the conventional history of American orphanages that is filled with images of child abuse and neglect due to the absence of close government oversight. For the most part, Olasky finds that the accepted history of orphanages is biased towards accentuating the negative aspects while preventing us from seeing the positive role that they have played in the past. 6 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>CIR Sues Delaware State Bar Association</b><p>

CIR represents three white students who were rejected from the Louis L. Redding Fellowship Program for first year law students in the State of Delaware because of their race. The Redding Program is operated by the Delaware State Bar Association and provides internships for first year law students from across the nation who want to spend a summer in Delaware. Virtually every significant law firm, various corporations, the Legal Aid Society, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and various state officials in Delaware participate in the Program by contributing money and/or offering internships to successful applicants. Successful applicants spend half the summer at another sponsoring employer, and receive approximately $8000 for the summer. This upcoming summer will be the second year of operation for the Redding Program. To date, no white students have been chosen for the Program. CIR has sued the United States, the Department of Justice, Gregory M. Sleet (the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware), the Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of Finance of the State of Delaware, and various private entities. The lawsuit commenced in early April.
<p>
<b>CIR Sues College for Discriminatory Hiring Practices</b><p>

Dr. Ronald L. Reisner, a white male, was employed as a part-time Adjunct Professor of Government at John Jay College from 1987 to 1993. During that time, Dr. Reisner, who holds a law degree from Rutgers University and a Ph.D. from Columbia, received excellent teaching evaluations from students and outstanding performance ratings from his faculty peers.
<p>
In 1993, John Jay advertised for a permanent tenure track faculty position in public administration. The hiring committee selected a black candidate as its first choice and Reisner, who is white, as its "alternate." When the committee's first choice candidate turned down the school's offer of employment, Provost Basil Wilson, citing an inadequate "affirmative action" search, decided to leave the position open rather than offer it to Reisner, who taught the classes on a temporary one year contract.
<p>
The following year, Reisner reapplied and was one of three finalists for the position, the other two being black males. It turned out that one of the other finalists did not meet the minimum qualifications for the position and the other withdrew his application after questions were raised about his credentials. Once again, John Jay decided to extend the candidate search for a third year. Soon thereafter, when the candidate who had withdrawn from consideration announced that he was available again, the Department of Public Management immediately hired him and the other black finalist as part-time adjuncts for the 1994-95 academic year. The firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, and the Center for Individual Rights filed a discrimination suit on Dr. Reisner's behalf in September, 1995. Discovery is proceeding and trial is scheduled to begin in January, 1997.

<b>INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE</b><P>
<B>Battle for Choice in Ohio: Round I</b><p>

On May 15, the Institute for Justice filed its opening brief in the Ohio trial court in support of the school choice plan enacted last year. IJ worked closely with the state attorney general's office and clients and allies in Cleveland to compile necessary data. The Institute also took the lead in coordinating <I>amicus</I> briefs in this case. The Center for Education Reform hired Mark Snyderman of Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher to draft a brief that was joined by a substantial number of choice supporters. The final brief is due June 20, and oral argument is scheduled for June 24 in Columbus. The Institute is working with Hope for Cleveland's Children and Councilwoman Fannie Lewis to transport parents and children to Columbus for the argument.
<p>
<b>IJ Files Cert. Petition in <I>Immediato v. Rye Neck School District</I></b><p>
On May 15, the Institute -- on behalf of the Immediato family of Mamaroneck, New York -- filed a petition for <I>certiorari</I> with the U.S. Supreme Court in a challenge to a "mandatory volunteering" program for public high school students. Such programs require that students perform community service in the manner prescribed by school officials or they will not graduate.
<p>
The centerpiece of the petition is the issue of parental liberty. The Institute will ask the Court to affirm the right of parents to direct their children's education as fundamental under the Fourteenth Amendment, and to restore much needed balance between public school authority and parental rights. Ironically, the Friday before the filing, President Clinton in a major policy address urged all public middle and high schools to mandate volunteering as a condition of graduation.

<b>	NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION</b><p>

<b>Union's Arbitration Scheme Violated Teachers' Rights</b><p>
 
National Right to Work Foundation attorneys recently announced a victory for employee rights as a federal appeals court refused to defer to a teacher's union "arbitration" scheme designed to deny Michigan educators their right to cut off the use of their compulsory union dues for politics. The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit came in a challenge by Michigan educators to the Michigan Educators Association (MEA) and National Education Association (NEA) teacher unions. The decision struck down the unions' attempt to use internal "arbitration" proceedings to preclude judicial consideration of the educators' claims that the unions' forced-dues exactions violated their Constitutional rights.

<b>	NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><P>

<B>NELF and NAM Help Win Health Care Case</B><P>
The U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans has ruled in favor of the New England Legal Foundation and the National Association of Manufacturers in the fight against laws that threaten businesses' power to control health costs. The case, <I>Cigna Heath Plan v. Louisiana,</I> involved Louisiana's "any willing provider" law which allows any doctor to join the staff of a health maintenance organization or a preferred provider organization.
<P>These laws, which are supported by doctors and other health care providers, eliminate the economies of scale which HMOs and PPOs use to control medical care costs. If HMOs and PPOs cannot guarantee a certain volume of patients, they cannot negotiate lower prices. In turn, those groups will be unable to set their rates as low as they otherwise could, and an important brake on the health care cost spiral will be lost.
<P>
The Louisiana law was challenged by Cigna, a major insurer which operates PPOs in that state. On behalf of NAM, NELF filed a brief arguing that the law is preempted by the federal ERISA law, which bars states from enacting laws which "relates to" employee benefit plans. Since almost all group health plans are provided by employers, the court agreed with NELF that ERISA applies and states cannot interfere.
<p>
<b>Massachusetts Capital Gains Controversy</b><p>
In 1994, the Massachusetts legislature enacted a major tax reform aimed at encouraging investors to hold onto capital assets longer by adopting a tax which declined depending upon the length of time they were held. That law was promptly challenged by a group supported by public employee unions which argued that the law violates a state constitutional provision which requires a uniform rate of taxation on income derived from the same "class of property."
<p>
NELF will represent Associated Industries of Massachusetts in supporting the law. The constitutional issue depends upon analysis of just what is being taxed upon the sale of a capital asset. Plaintiffs' simplistic position is that "sales are sales" and the length of time an asset was held does not change its "class." NELF, supported by economists and venture capitalists, will instead argue that what is being taxed on sale of a capital asset is the seller's personal exercise of discretion in choosing an asset and the time at which to sell it. Affidavits in this case show that in the real world of investments, assets with different holding periods are valued differently. The new law thus accords better with actual financial practice as well as providing a spur to longer-term, stable investments that benefit the state's economy and its people.

<p>
<b>THE RUTHERFORD INSTITUTE</b><p>
<b>Supreme Court to Hear Free Speech Case</b><p>
The Rutherford Institute has filed a "friend of the court" brief in a case before the Supreme Court dealing with the rights of pro-life protesters. The brief argues that the injunction against protesting in a "floating" bubble zone, which pro-lifers in <I>Schenk v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York</I>  face, is an unconstitutional, prior restraint on free speech.
<p>
The injunction provides for a 15-foot floating bubble zone around clinic clients. If anyone in the zone objects to a pro-lifer speaking to them from outside the zone, they can ask pro-lifers to be silent-on pain of being held in contempt of court. Under this injunction, clinic escorts can demand that the pro-lifers not speak to the clients whether the clients desire it or not. The Supreme Court has previously upheld the concept of a bubble zone (see <I>Madsen</I>), but the "floating" bubble zone goes beyond what was permitted.

<b>SOUTHEASTERN LEGAL FOUNDATION</b><p>
<b>U.S. Supreme Court Appeal in Voting Rights Act Case on Course</b><p>
SLF's attempt to intervene on behalf of Georgia voters in the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against the State of Georgia, which was denied, gets another shot at judicial scrutiny-this time, from the U.S. Supreme Court. SLF Chairman Robert J. Proctor and General Counsel Henry D. Granberry, III, are preparing briefs on the critical legal question of intervenor status of voters in Voting Rights Act cases. SLF has argued that the State did not adequately represent the interests of Georgia voters in the lawsuit because the State was focused on defending specific voting district changes enacted by the legislature last year. SLF's potential intervenors include a sitting State Representative, a candidate for the State Senate, and a registered Georgia voter. Appeals under the Voting Rights Act are direct to the U.S. Supreme Court and therefore do not require application for <I>certiorari.</I>

<b>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION</b>
<p>
<b>Deportation Supported in Fraud Case</b><p>
WLF filed an <I>amicus curiae</I> brief in the U.S. Supreme Court asking for the reversal of an appeals court decision that would require the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to overlook flagrant immigration fraud. In the case, <I>INS v. Yang,</I> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the INS cannot deport an alien based on the alien's fraudulent acts and misrepresentations, no matter how many or how long maintained, as long as the alien's motive for the misconduct is to enter and stay in this country. WLF argues that federal immigration law clearly gives the INS discretion to deport an alien for committing immigration fraud.
<p>
The case involves a Taiwanese couple who perpetrated a lengthy course of fraud beginning in 1978. The fraud was discovered by the INS during an investigation of immigration fraud committed by their children. In January of 1992, the INS issued the couple an order to show cause why they should not be deported. Overruling the Board of Immigration Appeals, the Ninth Circuit held that the INS could not consider the fraudulent acts. The court ruled that the INS had adopted a policy of forgiving an alien's "initial fraud" employed "to secure entry into the country" and that all of the subsequent fraudulent acts were "inextricably intertwined" with the initial fraud.
<p>
In its brief, WLF argues the statute involved commits the waiver of deportation to the agency's discretion. WLF further argues that even if Congress had not expressly committed the waiver of deportation to the agency's discretion, the Supreme Court's <I>Chevron</I> doctrine requires that INS's reasonable interpretation of the statute be given deference.
<p>
<b>FDA Chief David Kessler Refuses to Appear for Deposition</b><p>
David A. Kessler, Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), refused to appear for questioning in response to a notice of deposition served by WLF in <I>Washington Legal Foundation v. Kessler</I>. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of FDA's restrictions on peer-reviewed journal articles, excerpts of medical textbooks, and other information about off-label uses distributed to doctors by pharmaceutical companies. FDA has maintained in the suit that it has no policy of restricting such materials. Documents obtained by WLF, however, indicate that the agency has threatened enforcement actions against firms that distributed such materials. WLF seeks to depose Commissioner Kessler to give the agency an opportunity to clarify its position with Kessler's own prior statements.
<p>
<b>Supreme Court Urged to Hear Property Rights Case</b><p>
In <I>Mock v. Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Resources,</I> WLF asked the Supreme Court to review a Pennsylvania state court decision holding that a land owner could not obtain compensation under the Fifth Amendment for a denial of a permit to fill "wetlands" for development. Conrad and Barbara Mock sought a permit to fill eight-tenths of an acre out of four acres of wetlands. The property, surrounded by a cement factory, a tire store, and other commercial development, was rendered valueless by the lower court decision. WLF argues that compensation is required under the Supreme Court's landmark 1992 decision in <I>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Commission.</I>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"><br><p>
<h3>May 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<p>
<b><font size=4>The States and The People: An Historic Coalition</font></b></center>
<hr><p><font size=3>
I have just returned from the Nineteenth Annual Resource Bank Meeting in Chicago, April 25-26, and I am encouraged. Despite frustrating wheel-spinning in Washington, the conservative movement is not sitting around, grumbling, waiting for the political leadership to get its act together.  We are taking matters into our own hands through an amazing variety of nonprofit and grassroots adventures around the country.  We need this kind of responsible citizenship and creative self-government to put America back on track.  If the people will lead, the leaders will follow.<p>
As you may know, the Resource Bank -- the Heritage department responsible for publishing <i>The Insider</i> -- is Heritage's information clearinghouse, strategy forum, and coalition builder for leading policy groups, scholars, and activists.  At this year's annual meeting, entitled "The States and The People: Setting the Agenda for Devolution," 290 conservative leaders, representing 180 national think tanks, state think tanks, public interest legal groups, grassroots and pro-family groups, ministries and volunteer service organizations, academic institutions, corporations and business groups, and state and local government offices, assembled to discuss methods for returning federally usurped powers to the states and the people.<p>
	At 1995's Resource Bank meeting, entitled "A Time for Leading," we celebrated an exciting new political environment where ideas thought unrealistic just months before were being discussed as serious options.  Bob Dole had called for the abolition of four federal agencies, the flat tax was miraculously on the table, Joycelyn Elders had been run out of office, and Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards were selling Doritos corn chips. <p> 
	Well, no one said it would be easy, but, in retrospect, perhaps the conservative movement was a bit overly optimistic.  We may have turned the corner in our fight against liberalism, but we have a long way to go. We do have new intellectual ammunition at our disposal, though.  The emergence of the idea of devolution, of returning powers to the states and the people, presents the conservative movement a great opportunity to go on the offensive against big centralized government. <p>
The concept of devolution, and the related concepts of federalism, subsidiarity, and decentralization, have long been standards in the pantheon of conservative principles.  But when federalism and devolution recently re-emerged in the national policy debate -- initially in the context of unfunded federal  mandates -- conservatives were not yet ready with a lot of practical ideas to exploit the opportunity.  Moreover, as Heritage's welfare analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> points out, there is "federalism," and then there is "federalism."  Having the federal government collect taxes and hand them over to ultra-liberal state welfare agencies without a few, principled, conservative "strings" is not true federalism.<p>
The purpose of this year's Resource Bank meeting, then, was to help set the conservative agenda for devolution -- devolution from the federal government to the states, from state governments to local governments, and from all spheres of government to the people.  We plan to publish proceedings of the conference.  Watch <i>The Insider</i> for the announcement.<p>
I cannot do justice in this space to all the marvelous speakers, but here is a sample.  Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith spoke of the challenges he has faced in reforming entrenched bureaucracy whose highest priority is its own survival.  Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources Becky Norton Dunlop described how Virginia fought EPA dictates concerning emission testing systems, proving that states <i>can</i> successfully resist federal micromanagement.  California Director of Social Services Eloise Anderson recounted her struggles to fashion a welfare system that promotes individual self-sufficiency in family and community, rather than dependency on the morally bankrupt welfare state.  Activist Susan Mitchell described how she and other Wisconsin school choice advocates led a diverse coalition in a sophisticated campaign to devolve control over education to parents and communities.  Kids Hope USA Executive Director Virgil Gulker spoke movingly of his work leading individual believers in evangelical churches to minister personally to at-risk kids. National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship President Steve Mariotti outlined his program's success at launching inner-city children on enterpreneurial careers, by teaching them how to start and run their own businesses.<p>
These are the people and programs that will make devolution happen.  State-friendly partners in the federal government are necessary allies, but we will be waiting a long time for Washington to decentralize itself.  The Enumerated Powers and Tenth Amendment Enforcement Acts currently before Congress, for example, will have much better chances for passage if our friends in Congress hear from the heartland. Indeed, true devolution, true federalism, a truly free and responsible society will not occur unless we the people and the states demand it, step up to our own responsibilities, and lead the way.
It was, after all, the people and the states who authorized the federal government, not the other way around.  Moreover, the federal leviathan grew not only as a result of federal usurpation but also as a result of abdication by the states and the people -- in exchange for phantom perks and promises. If the new citizenship movement is any sign, perhaps Americans are finally learning -- the hard way --  that every time we abdicate a little piece of responsibility that is rightfully ours, we lose a little piece of freedom too.<p>
	It will take an historic coalition, The States and The People, to return America to her constitutional principles of federalism, limited government, and accountability in government. "The states" and "the people" are the two parties to whom the Tenth Amendment reserves the "powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution." It is up to us to rein in government.  We have our work cut out for usand worthy work it is.

Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., President of The Heritage Foundation, outlines a conservative internationalist foreign policy that is anchored in the foundation of vital American interests. In his introduction, Dr. Feulner defines those vital interests as developments that could concretely affect the security or economic future of America and its citizens immediately. Feulner discusses specific failures of President Clinton's interventionist strategy and points out that humanitarian interventions and other experiments have diverted attention from key items on the American foreign policy agenda, including: bilateral relations with Russia; China and its increasing hostility in East Asia; Iran, which has engaged in clandestine nuclear efforts as well as terrorism exportation; NATO, whose future has become entangled with Bosnia; missile defense, which has been dismissed as unnecessary by the administration; and the promotion of free trade, most notably the failure to expand NAFTA to include Chile. Overall, Feulner argues that when America's vital interests are served, so are the values of political and economic freedom worldwide. He lists the following as America's most vital interests: 1) safeguarding U.S. national security; 2) preventing a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf; 3) maintaining access to foreign trade; 4) protecting Americans against threats to their lives and well-being; and 5) maintaining access to resources. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

The Chemical Weapons Convention: A Bad Deal for America, </a>

Baker Spring, Senior Defense Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, surveys the decades-long effort to ban chemical weapons in anticipation of an extensive chemical weapons convention soon to be considered by the world powers. He argues that in order for any convention to deserve the support of the Senate, the agreement, as with all other arms control agreement, must pass a five part test: 1) will the convention reduce the risk of war?; 2) are the convention's requirements consistent with America's global responsibilities?; 3) is the convention adequately verifiable?; 4) are the provisions of the convention enforceable?; and 5) does the convention enhance U.S. national security? Spring lays out three principles for effective counter-proliferation of chemical weapons, including the need to deter a chemical attack,  the need for defenses against chemical weapons, and the need for offensive capabilities. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

<p><font size=3>
Jonathan Clarke, Research Fellow in Foreign Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, argues that the Administration's failure to address vital interests has created a vacuum in U.S. foreign policy. He writes that while the Administration has strived to change conditions in Haiti, Ulster and Bosnia, it has ignored enhancing relations with Russia, China, Western Europe, and Japan. The recent bombings by the Irish Republican Army and Hamas, according to Clarke, have proven the instability of the peace that the administration claims to have secured in the respective regions of Northern Ireland and the Middle East. And even if the administration's claims are accepted at face value, continues Clarke, regions such as Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Haiti have little relevance to America's vital interests. Interests that include relations with crucial nations such as Russia, China, Japan, and the West European powers and are in disarray. Clarke concludes by writing that the vacuum created by ignoring what should be the epicenter of foreign policy cannot be compensated by miscellaneous policy successes on peripheral foreign policy matters. 17 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, <a href="mailto:cato@cato.org">E-mail cato@cato.org</a>, Internet

The International Republican Institute sponsored a 22-member delegation to observe Russia's State Duma elections held December 17, 1995. This report relays the findings and observations of the delegation and their recommendations for future improvement in Russia's electoral process. First, they recommend that the secret ballot be practiced even though open voting (voting outside of the booth) is customary for Russians. In general, they recommend that the counting process become more secure. Counters should be better trained and tabulation process should be better organized to close opportunities for vote manipulation. Finally, the military involvement at some voting sites had the potential to create military influence over voting. The report also contains a survey of the major political parties, delegate observations on electoral environment and administration, delegate reports from the 10 cities monitored, exit poll results, and lists of new State Duma deputies. 121 pp.  CONTACT: International Republican Institute, Suite 900, 1212 New York Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005-3987, 202/408-9450, fax 202/408-9462, <a href="mailto:IRI@access.digex.net">e-mail IRI@access.digex.net</a>.

Is There a "Clinton Crunch"?: How the 1993 Budget Plan Affected the Economy</a>,

This recent paper, by Heritage analysts William Beach, Scott Hodge, John Barry, Joe Cobb, and Mark Wilson, helps show why there is widespread dissatifaction among Americans about the nation's economic performance, despite relatively good economic figures such as low interest rates, inflation and unemployment. Using the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM)-a major economic model of the U.S. economy also used by the federal government and many Fortune 500 companies-economists at the Heritage Foundation investigated how the economy would likely be performing today had Congress not raised taxes in 1993 as the nation was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession. According to their analysis, the 1993 tax hike, supported by the President, did produce what has come to be known as the "Clinton Crunch." The "Clinton Crunch" is the economic situation in which there is a larger tax bill for families combined with a stagnation in incomes and an economy that is performing well below its potential. They found that the 1993 Budget had the following effects on the U.S. economy: 1) economic growth has been slowed by $208 billion; 2) the pace of business formation has been slowed by over 40,000 new businesses; 3) job growth has been slowed by 1.2 million jobs; 4) the growth in household income and savings has been cut; and 5) the reduction in the deficit attributable to the 1993 plan has been small. Removing the effect of the 1993 budget, using WUMM, shows that the economy would have been performing significantly better today had the legislation not been enacted. 23 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

<p><font size=3>
In his introduction, Lawrence Reed, President of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, praises the retreat of statism in American public policy. However, he points out the ravages of its influence are still with us: "bloated, overbearing bureaucracies; crushing tax burdens; deficits and debt swallowing huge chunks of public budgets." Reed argues that privatization is the cure for public sector waste, fraud and inefficiency. With a foreword by Michigan Governor John Engler, this collection of twenty-six  essays supporting privatization includes contributions from: Hans Sennholz, President of The Foundation for Economic Education; Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute; Burton Folsom, Senior Fellow at the Mackinac Center; Clint Bolick, Director of Litigation at the Institute for Justice; and several other authors. The essays are grouped into six sections; 1) the privatizing idea; 2) downsizing the federal bureaucracy; 3) transportation and highways; 4) private property and environmentalism; 5) rethinking "public" services; and 6) the challenge ahead.  202 pp. CONTACT: The Foundation for Economic Education, 30 South Broadway, Irvington-on-Hudson, NY  10533, 914/591-7230, fax 914/591-8910.

This issue centers on the topic of privatization. In the first article, Editor Kerry Jackson illustrates how several states have implemented privatization programs. Some of the most notable include: the proposed privatization of the new international arrival building and the cargo facilities at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York; the privatization of state daycare centers and some Department of Motor Vehicle functions in New Jersey; and the outsourcing of student loan processing operations in Indiana. Jackson also reports on how New Zealand used privatization to return from the brink of economic collapse and the success of prison privatization efforts in Texas. In another article the Reason Foundation puts forth a case for governments to sell off underutilized assets to offset budgetary shortfalls. 7 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th Floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

Vague and complicated prevailing wage laws are important to potential government contractors because they effect who will bid on government contracts and how competitive those contracts will be. Greg Smith, Task Force Director at the American Legislative Exchange Council, explains that prevailing wage laws require government contractors to pay minimal administratively determined wages and fringe benefits to employees working on public works projects. Moreover, Smith writes that the U.S Department of Labor determines the wage on the federal level in a way that usually reflects union wages and benefits rather than market rate. State prevailing wage laws are modeled after the federal law which was enacted with the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931. Davis-Bacon was passed in order to exclude black and immigrant workers from providing cheaper labor in the place of higher paying white union labor. 5 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

Heritage Policy Analyst Bryan Johnson presents and then disproves the major myths concerning free trade expansion. Myth #1: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. Myth #2: High manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the cost to the overall economy. Myth #3: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. Myth #4: Trade deficits are harmful while trade surpluses are beneficial. Myth #5: Trade deficits cost jobs. Myth #6: Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies. Myth #7: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits import competition and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. Myth #8: Countries like Japan are called protectionist simply because the U.S. has experienced difficulty penetrating their markets. Myth #9: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy. Myth #10: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. And Myth #11: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. 11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.<br>

The Heritage Foundation</font>
<p><font size=3>
Daniel Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy at The Heritage Foundation, illustrates the ins and outs of the flat tax. He begins by explaining what the flat tax is, then moves on to discuss its advantages. Mitchell also provides an easy model from which the reader may calculate their tax bill and then illustrates how today's tax system is anti-growth and anti-family. A state-by-state summary of a flat tax's potential impact is included, which shows how the flat tax would renew the American job creation machine and help homeowners-despite the warnings of skeptics. Mitchell also illustrates how a flat tax would positively control the deficit, how it would help seniors, and how it would save social security. He concedes in his conclusion that the one question that the book does not answer about the flat tax is how it will be achieved. The reader is reminded of how much power politicians wield as a result of their ability to tinker with the tax code to benefit special interests. The book includes a preface by Jack Kemp and an introduction by Senator Richard Shelby. 60 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

This line-by-line analysis of Michigan's 1995-96 state budget reflects a principled vision for Michigan culture, according to the authors, by asking this question about each budget item: Should this program or activity be done by the authority of the state and financed by taxation, or should it be done by its individual citizens acting in voluntary cooperation and private contract with one another? The study recommends over $2 billion in spending reductions (over 7% of the state budget) achieved by eliminating unnecessary and counterproductive programs, rolling back unjustified program growth, and contracting out for services that can be handled more efficiently by the private sector.  97 pp. CONTACT: The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

The new Congress took charge in January of 1995 and promised to close and consolidate redundant and obsolete government agencies. Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, examines the progress that has been made on these promises. Overall, he finds that in a sharp contrast to past years, Congress actually followed through on its promises and achieved more than expected. They shut down 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs throughout the federal government. Utt points out that while Congress has done its part to reduce government waste, only about $600 million of the $5.8 billion in potential savings has been signed into law by the President. He concludes that it is obvious that tremendous progress has been made in cutting wasteful, obsolete, and redundant federal programs, however, he urges that Congress and the President revisit many of the independent agencies that survived and make additional cuts as appropriate.  20 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.<br>

<b><font size=3>The Decline of Welfare in Wisconsin, <br></font></b>

<i><font size=3>Report</font></i><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman"> 
Vol. 9, No. 3, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute</font>
<p><font size=3>
Lawrence Mead, Visiting Professor in Public Policy at Princeton, examines the decline of welfare in Wisconsin. Between 1987, when Governor Tommy Thompson came into office, and 1994, the state of Wisconsin cut its welfare rolls (Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC) by 23 percent, much more than any other state. Liberals claim the drop in the caseload has to do with Wisconsin's thriving economy, not necessarily the efforts by the Thompson administration to reform welfare. Mead's paper shows otherwise. He says that the economy played a part, but that it was the welfare reforms, especially the implementation of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program (JOBS) that greatly influenced the shrinking of Wisconsin's welfare rolls. On the issue of whether the state has gained or lost money on welfare reform, Mead shows that although it has spent much more on administration and support services than before, due to the drop in the caseload, Wisconsin has saved an estimated $68 million overall.  44 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53221, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

<p><font size=3>

Genevieve Young, a Washington, D.C. attorney, illustrates how advocates for government-controlled health care have reformulated their strategy by sneaking their agenda through state capitals and into schoolhouses. She reports on a recent investigation sponsored by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to see how the state's public school system was being used to provide health programs for students and their families. The investigation found that several district's school based-health clinics were already providing extensive health services. The Pennsylvania General Assembly had no previous knowledge of, nor had it given consent to, the establishment and funding of such services. Young shows that legislatures are also discovering that programs and proposals that claim to be intended for America's children actually represent a renewed assault on private health care. Further investigation into the issue has revealed that state education reform programs have become the road to health reform, and that state agencies and private foundations have been the forces behind enacting Clinton Administration health care proposals through a back door. Young calls for Congress and legislatures to re-examine how children have become pawns in political struggles over power and money, and how healthcare reform, defeated in Congress, is being implemented under the guise of "education reform." 7 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<p><font size=3>
According to this paper, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its current form is inefficient and a "prototypical centralized, bureaucratic regulatory agency." Furthermore, the most significant cost of FDA's inefficiency is human, as America's outmoded medical regulatory process directly results in jobs being exported abroad and denies new medical technology to patients that need them much sooner than unnecessary delays allow. The Progress and Freedom Foundation has developed a replacement model for medical technology regulation that is designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical products while providing patients with faster access to new treatments. The Progress and Freedom proposal offers competitive forces in order to eliminate the "regulatory creep" inherent in monopolies such as the FDA. While maintaining the existing legal requirements for safety and effectiveness and even the FDA stamp of approval, the plan relies on nongovernmental bodies to review and certify new medical products. 116 pp. CONTACT: The Progress & Freedom Foundation, 1301 K Street, N.W.

Denis Doyle, Heritage Foundation Visiting Fellow in Education, and Christine Olson, Heritage Policy Analyst, write that, the only overriding federal responsibility in education is to guarantee the constitutional right of all Americans, while acknowledging that Washington is also better equipped than the states to collect and display educational data than all the states and localities. However, as far as management of classroom instruction and curriculum, the federal government is suitable for little more than offering advice. Doyle and Olson outline The Back to Basics Education Reform Act (H.R. 1883), which seeks to eliminate the Department of Education within one year of enactment. They also look at another proposal to merge DOE with the Department of Labor and the EEOC. Overall, they conclude that Americans no longer support major federal solutions to quintessentially local problems. This report includes a detailed appendix that lists several unneeded programs administered by DOE as well as their budgets, their negative effects, and specific reasons for their termination. 44 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

<p><font size=3>
Charles Sykes, Senior Fellow at the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, illustrates the current crisis in American schools: Americans rank at the bottom of international tests in math and science; national reading scores continue to fall; and despite massive increases in spending, American schools continue to produce students who lack basic skills and knowledge. Sykes writes that the reaction within the education establishment to the decline in test scores has been to lower standards, and that what has triumphed is a "mediocre, feel good education that is more concerned with pumping self-esteem than it is with passing on knowledge." Sykes traces the roots of these educational fads to their current state today. He also discusses the following: why American students test poorly in language, math and science when compared with peers from other countries; why "self-esteem" has supplanted grades and genuine achievements in American schools; how the education teachers' unions and school boards lower standards while continuing to raise budgets and taxes; and how curriculum and standard tests are being dumbed down so everyone can pass but no one can excel. Sykes concludes the book with a checklist for parents, teachers and students who want to evaluate their schools, and a series of recommendations to restore the quality standards for learning. 339 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Education Reform, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.

<P><font size=3>
Sheldon Richman, Vice President of Policy Affairs at the Future of Freedom Foundation, calls for South Carolina to drop out of Goals 2000. He examines each of Goals 2000's "goals" and shows how they will lead to more federal government intrusion, and ultimately federal control of curriculum, teaching practices, and even facilities. Richman warns that non-compliance with "voluntary" Goals 2000 directives could lead to litigation against states and local school districts. Significantly, some states-Montana, Alabama, California, Virginia, and New Hampshire-have already dropped out or refused funding because of "too many strings" attached to the funding and participation. In illustrating South Carolina's experience with Goals 2000, Richman notes that local educators and elected boards are losing their freedom to set agendas, to teach in the way they find effective, and to monitor their own progress. Richman concludes that Goals 2000 is: based on the flawed belief that all children and teachers are interchangeable; based on an unsound model of education looking at schools as factories; and based on the flawed view that bureaucratic government monopoly is public spirited and benign. 16 pp. CONTACT: South Carolina Policy Council Education Foundation, 1419 Pendleton Street, Columbia, SC  29201, 803/779-5022, fax 803/779-4953.

Institutional Investors, Social Investing, and Corporate Governance, </font></b></i><br>
<font size=3>by A.B. Krongard, Chairman, Securities Industry Association, <br>
and James F. Hogg, former Dean, William Mitchell College of Law. <br>
This monograph discusses two recent and related phenomena: the aggressive role that institutional investors-especially union and public pension funds-increasingly seek to play in running corporations ("corporate governance"); and "social investing"-investing with an eye toward political correctness. Both are becoming front-burner legal and political issues in light of the Clinton Administration's pro-labor, pro-social investing policies, according to the authors. 76 pp.

<b><font size=3>Reforming the Law of Takings in Michigan, <br></font></b>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">by Donald Kochan</font>
<p><font size=3>The Mackinac Center for Public Policy</font>
<p><font size=3>
If the state of Michigan takes from a land owner some, but not all, of the use or value of his land, the owner is not entitled to any compensation. This forces a few land owners to bear the entire cost of these "takings" that are intended to benefit the public as a whole. Many states have initiated reforms that would permit land owners to be more fairly compensated. This study outlines the practice of takings jurisprudence in Michigan, reviews the legislative responses in Michigan and other states, and makes specific recommendations for reform. 34 pp. CONTACT: The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b><font size=3>Finding Fault with No-Fault Divorce Laws:
A Policy Paper from Focus on the Family, <br></font></b>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">by Glenn Stanton<p>
Focus on the Family</font>
<p><font size=3>
Glenn Stanton, Social Research Analyst at Focus on the Family, illustrates that the no-fault divorce revolution-once touted by the women's liberation movement-has proven to be a failure. Starting with a brief history of divorce law in the United States, Stanton moves into a history of the no-fault movement, which started in California in 1969 and brought some form of no-fault law to the other forty-nine states by 1985. According to Stanton, the no-fault reformers had four goals: 1) to lower the already increasing divorce rate; 2) to foster greater equality between men and women; 3) to improve the lives of women and children; and 4) to expand individual choice and happiness. Stanton examines each one of these goals and shows that no-fault has had the exact opposite of the intended effects. The study concludes with policy recommendations. First, divorce laws should work to preserve the institution of marriage, and should give more balance to the rights of the party that desires to preserve the marriage. Next, couples who both agree they want to dissolve their marriages without having to show fault should face a substantial waiting period  before the divorce is granted. Also, division of property should be tied to fault. To change the current overwhelming disregard for the effects that divorce has on children, Stanton argues that the needs and desires of the parent should not override those of the children, which are, as a rule, the participation of both parents in their upbringing. Overall, Stanton believes that, divorce laws should make it more attractive to invest in marriage instead of divorce.  12 pp. CONTACT: Focus on the Family, 8605 Explorer Drive, Colorado Springs, CO 80920, 719/531-3400, fax 719/548-4525.

<b>CIR Reaches Successful Settlement in <i>Henry Painting Co. v. Ohio State University 
</i></b><br><font size=3>
CIR represents Jerry Henry, the white owner of Henry Painting Co., who, until 1986, regularly contracted with Ohio State University ("OSU") to perform painting contracts. However, since 1986, Henry Painting has been excluded from the bidding process because OSU has reserved all painting contracts for minority-owned businesses pursuant to a 100% set-aside program. That set aside program, in turn, was OSU's implementation of the Ohio State Minority Business Act, a state law requiring all state agencies to set aside 15% of all contracts for minority-owned businesses. Because OSU could not locate any minority bidders in other areas, it contrived to reach its 15% goal by reserving all of its painting contracts exclusively for minorities.<p>
In 1994, CIR, on behalf of Henry, brought suit against OSU challenging the constitutionality of OSU's set-aside practices. The lawsuit ended when the parties signed a binding judicial consent decree.  Under the consent decree, the State of Ohio agreed to an injunction against "considering race, color, national origin, gender, social or economic disadvantage, or any factor other than standard State procurement policies and practices, in awarding painting contracts at [OSU]."  OSU also agreed to pay the plaintiff $368,000 in damages and attorneys fees.
<p><b>CIR Challenges the Constitutionality of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act</b><br>
CIR is assisting in the defense of Antonio Morrison, a Virginia Tech student-athlete. Mr. Morrison, along with two other individuals and Virginia Tech, is named in a lawsuit filed by Christy Brzonkala, a student at the University. The lawsuit contains state and federal claims stemming from her alleged rape by Mr. Morrison and a codefendant in September 1994. Of importance to CIR is Brzonkala's attempt to impose civil and criminal liability upon Mr. Morrison under the so-called Violence Against Women Act ("VAWA").  CIR is arguing that VAWA represents an illegitimate exercise of Congressional power.<p>
Congress purported to pass VAWA pursuant to its authority under the Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  CIR contends that VAWA exceeds Congressional power under the Commerce Clause as defined by the Supreme Court in <i>United States v. Lopez</i>.<p>
A grand jury, after hearing testimony by the police, refused to indict Mr. Morrison for any criminal violation.<br><p>

<b>CIR Reaches Successful Settlement in<i> Doe v. United States</i></b>
<br>
CIR represents Michelle Doe, a young white high school student who wanted to attend Camp Planet Earth, a summer science camp which, based upon conditions set forth by the National Science Foundation to those receiving funds through its Summer Science Camp program, was open exclusively to minority students. Although Doe possessed strong academic credentials, Camp Planet Earth rejected her simply because of race. CIR brought suit against various state entities, including Texas A&M University, which operated the racially discriminatory summer science camp program, and the National Science Foundation. Doe has settled with the state entities and the federal government.  In addition to paying damages and attorneys' fees: 1) the state defendants agreed to discontinue any discriminatory practices on the basis of race, color, national origin, or ethnicity in selecting applicants for Camp Planet Earth; and 2) the federal defendants agreed to take reasonable steps to prevent discrimination by any summer science camp receiving funds from the National Science Foundation. Recent correspondence from Texas A&M indicates that it no longer wishes to operate Camp Planet Earth.<br></font><p>

<b><font size=4>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</font></b>
<p>
<b>Endangered Species Act is Before the Supreme Court </b>
<br>
Defenders of Property Rights is preparing a brief <i>amicus curiae</i>in the case of <i>Bennett v. Plenert</i>, requesting that the United States Supreme Court reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in that case. At issue is whether plaintiffs asserting an interest other than preservation of endangered species may sue the government for violating the procedures established by the Endangered Species Act ("ESA").<p> 

Plaintiffs in this case are two individual ranchers and two irrigation districts located in the state of Oregon. They filed a "citizens suit" challenging a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biological opinion that concluded that the preservation of the endangered Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker (species of fish) requires that the water level in two reservoirs be maintained at a designated minimum level.  The plaintiffs who use the reservoirs' water for commercial and recreational purposes, claim the government violated certain provisions of the ESA by neglecting to consider the economic impact caused by its finding that the reservoirs were critical habitats for the fish.<p>
	
In affirming the lower court's dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint, the Ninth Circuit Court astonishingly held that "only plaintiffs who allege an interest in the preservation of endangered species" may bring citizen suits under the ESA.  The ranchers and irrigation districts, the court held, did not fall within this category. "To the contrary," the court wrote, "they claim a competing interestan interest in using the very water that the government believes is necessary for the preservation of the species."  Because the ranchers' and irrigation districts' interests in the water were solely economic and recreational, the court held that they could not sue to force the government to comply with the ESA.  The court held thus, notwithstanding that it was "aware that the ESA specifically provides that the government should consider a variety of factorsincluding economic onesin designing critical habitat for a species."<p>
	
This Ninth Circuit opinion is the legacy of the last term's <i>Sweet Home </i> case, where the U.S. Supreme Court stated that the ESA's citizen suit provision was designed to further the goal of species protection by allowing "interested persons" to sue to enforce the ESA."  As well as quoting from the Sweet Home case, the Ninth Circuit also cited with approval the 1978 Supreme Court case <i>Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill</i>, wherein the Court had earlier concluded "[T]he plain intent of Congress in enacting [the ESA] was to halt and reverse the trend toward extinction, whatever the cost."

<b><i>Terry L. and Gayle E. Beardslee v. Crawford County Road Commission</i></b>
<br>
On July 19, 1994, Terry and Gayle Beardslee awoke to find a bulldozer belonging to the Crawford County Road Commission on their forty acres of woodlands in upstate Michigan. Without notice, public hearing, or offer of compensation, the county bulldozer proceeded to destroy hundreds of the Beardslee's trees, shrubs, and other landscaping to clear an abandoned and overgrown logging trail that the county decided to claim as public highway.<p>

When the Beardslee's bought the property in 1989, neither the title insurance policy nor a survey of the land indicated a claim to the trail that diagonally traversed their property.  Impassable in many places, they erected barriers and posted no trespassing signs at both ends of the trail.<p>

In the process of improving this proposed road, the county expanded the eight-to-ten foot wide trail to fifteen feet. An attorney retained by the Beardslees advised them that no documents of record give the county any public right-of-way across their property.
<p>
The Beardslees are now telling their story in state court.  They are seeking compensation from the Road Commission for the damage already done to their property, and to have the road moved elsewhere.  Defenders of Property Rights is standing by the Bedraggles' request to make sure that the Road Commission is obedient to the Fifth Amendment.

<b>Milwaukee School Choice</b><br>
On March 29, 1996, the Wisconsin Supreme Court deadlocked 3 to 3 on the Milwaukee school choice case, and sent the case back to the trial court for a decision.  Three justices decided against the program because of a violation of the Wisconsin Constitution, including the state establishment clause.  They did not reach a decision on whether the program violated the Establishment Clause under the U.S. Constitution or the First Amendment issue. The other three justices believe the program is constitutional in all respects.  Of the three justices against the program, one is retiring and a new justice was recently elected to replace him.

<b>Property Rights in Michigan's Upper Peninsula</b>
<br>
In a nationally-significant case regarding the ability of the U.S. Forest Service to manage private property as wilderness, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted MSLF's petition for a rehearing en banc. The Court also vacated an earlier decision by a three judge panel upholding the authority of the Forest Service.
<p>
Lake front property owners in the Upper Penisula of Michigan have been denied their right to use the entire surface of Crooked Lakea right recognized by Michigan Lawby U.S. Forest Service regulation. The Forest Service asserts that since it owns property abutting the southern portion of the Lake, it may regulate the Lake. The Forest Servie claims the Property Clause of the Constitution gives it such authority over private property even though Congress specifically excluded private property from wilderness designation or management.

<b>MSLF Challenges Federal Race-Based Set Aside</b>

On behalf of George Keritsis, a white male of Greek ancestry, sole shareholder and President of Southern Cad/Cam, Inc., (SCC) a turnkey supplier of personal computers and related products and services, MSLF has challenged the use, by the United States Army, of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act to restrict bids on electronic computer equipment and software to certain racial groups. Despite SCC's submittal of the lowest bid, the contract was awarded to the next higher bidder because of Mr. Keritsis' race. The next highest bid was more than half a million dollars greater than that submitted by SCC.

<b>Air Force Base Converison Victory Upheld</b><br>

The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston has affirmed a lower court decision allowing continued leasing at the site of the former Pease Air Force Base.  This decision keeps New Hampshire's largest source of new civilian jobs on track. NELF has represented the Greater Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce and two other business groups since 1992 when an environmental group brought suit to block the federal government's sale of Pease to a state agency set up to convert the base to commercial use. NELF and the New Hampshire business community strongly support Pease as a key element in the state's ongoing return to economic health. Some national environmental groups had proposed using litigation threats to block conversion of military bases in order to coerce concesssions from state and federal governments.  By rejecting their case here, the court struck a blow against the plan.

<b>Brown University Title IX Case Argued in Court of Appeals</b><br>
Brown University has argued its appeal of use of Title IX to micromanage the university's athletic programs.  The case is a key test of how willing courts will be to use anti-discrimination laws as the basis for strict quotas.  On behalf of several national associations of coaches and athletes, NELF argued that Brown has provided equal athletic opportunities for both sexes and the different number of male and female intercollegiate athletes reflects student interests beyond the schools control.
<br><p>
<b>U.S. Supreme Court Decides <i>O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin</i>Case</b>
<br>
In a defeat for the business community, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that virtually any worker over 40 years of age, replaced by a younger person, can bring a "prima facie" age discrimination claim, even if a replacement is also over 40. The Court reversed a lower court decision NELF had supported, which held that a plaintiff could only take advantage of "prima facie" inference if the replacement came from outside the protected class. The decision did leave open a ray of hope, noting the case might have come out differently if age difference had been "insignificant."
<br><p>
<b>Certiorari Denied in <i>Leger</i> and <i>NARPO</i></b><br>
The U.S. Supreme Court has denied petitions for certiorari in <i>NARPO v. ICC</i> and <i>Leger v. Commissioner of Revenue</i>, in which NELF sought to use the Court's due process decisions to provide enhanced rights for property owners. While denial of certiorari has no precedential significance, it means that these cases are at an end.

<b>Court Says 'No' To Arbitrary Fees For Landowners</b>
<br>
For several years, Richard Ehrlich operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a townhouse condominium project on the property. The City Council approved the project on condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis courts. They also demanded that he pay over $33,000 for public art.
<p>
PLF argued that the fees are unconstitutional for failing the "rough proportionality" test laid down in <i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i>. Conditions for a permit are justifiable only if local officials can show that there is a reasonable connection or essential "nexus" between the conditions and any harm caused by the project being permitted. The extent of the exations must also be "roughly proportional" to the project's impact on the community. The <i>Ehrlich</i> case differs in that the property owner is being asked to come up with cash instead of land.<p>

Citing PLF's victories in <i>Dolan</i> and <i>Nollan v. California Coastal Commission</i>, the state Supreme Court held that local bureaucrats cannot arbitrarily and capriciously shift the cost of public projects on private landowners in the form of development fees. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the court did not go far enough. Under the court's equivical reasoning, the tough standards established in <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> now apply to some, but not all, fees imposed on land use approvals. In other words, bureaucrats are subject to scrutiny only when property owners have to individually "negotiate" over terms of their particular permits.
<p>
Applying the "new" standard to Mr. Ehrlich, the state justices nevertheless ruled that he must still pay $33,220 for public art and that he must go back to the city so that the bureaucrats can have a second shot at justifying their $280,000 recreational fee.
<br><p>

<b>Bureaucrats Force Landowners To Sustain Economic Losses</b>
<br>
Leon Scharf is the principle owner of a 70-year-old apartment building in New York. In February 1994, the building was ravaged by fire. What was not burned was damaged by water used to fight the blaze. Consequently, the building was no longer safe for its tenants who had to relocate. Repairing the building to habitable condition would have far exceeded its fair market value, and yet the former tenants (also beneficiaries of New York's rent control law at Mr. Scharf's expense) filed suit demanding that the building be rebuilt so that their protected tenancies may be resumed.
<p>
New York's special Housing Court agreed that repairs would cost more than the market value of the building after restoration. However, the court ruled that this fact "was not dispositive." Instead, it held that Mr. Scharf had a "duty" to restore the property and that the tenants were "entitled" to have "their" apartment building restored. According to the court, it is Mr. Scharfnot the public as a wholewho must satisfy the city's need for affordable housing. 
<p>
In short, Mr. Scharf is being forced into a course of action guaranteed to cause a substantial loss of economically viable use of his property, not simply because the cost of restoration exceeds the fair market value itself has been severly depressed in the first place by the regulatory regime on New York's rent control laws. Pacific Legal Foundation argued to a New York appellate court that the government's demand that he repair this uninhabitable building is an unconstitutional regulatory "taking" of his property.

<b>SLF Attempts Intervention in Voting Rights Act Lawsuit Against State of Georgia</b>
<br>
On behalf of an elected member of the Georgia General Assembly, a candidate for office, and a Georgia voter, SLF has waded into the legislative redistricting battle underway in Georgia. SLF contends that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which empowers the U.S. Department of Justice to "pre-clear" any voting district changes in 16, mostly Southern, states is an unconstitutional usurpation of judicial power by the executive branch.
<p>
In its effort to challenge the outdated pre-clearance section of the Act, SLF attempted to intervene in a pending lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against the State of Georgia for its most recent state redistricting efforts, which demanded that Georgia instead use its 1992 legislative map. The 1992 map has come under intense scrutiny by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in a separate but related action underway since 1994 for its use of race as a sole criteria for legislative redistricting.
<p>
Attempting to intervene before the same three-judge court which is hearing the legislative redistricting case, SLF asked the court to enter its clients as co-defendants in the action, arguing that the citizens of Georgia have standing to raise constitutional questions not raised by the State defendants. In early April, the three-judge court in Atlanta granted provisional intervention status to SLF's clients. Within a week the Court had withdrawn the status, reasoning that SLF's claims were "too remote." SLF is currently preparing a direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court under the Voting Rights Act on the issue of intervention status of citizens to challenge the pre-clearance section of the Voting Rights Act.

<b>SEC Urged to Recognize Self-Audit Privilege</b>
<br>
WLF filed a petition for rulemaking with the Securities and Exchange Commission urging the agency to adopt a policy against using a company's internal evaluations or self-audits in enforcement actions. Such self-audits are a tool that companies use to strengthen their compliance with federal securities laws. WLF argued that SEC policy should reflect that self-audits by companies are indispensable to the SEC's efforts in maintaining compliance with those laws.
<p>
WLF argued that the SEC should insititute a broad privilege of confidentiality for firms' self-critical evaluations or audits that lead to the correction of improper activity. According to commentators, the SEC "is increasingly requesting production in its investigations of routine internal audit reports and reports of special investigations." The petition states that the SEC has created a powerful barrier to self-critical initiatives by failing to recognize such a privilege.
<p>
WLF Asks Supreme Court to Reject State Suits on FDA-Approved Medical Devices
In <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr</i>, WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that state-law suits claiming injuries caused by FDA-approved medical devices are impermissible because they are pre-empted by federal law. WLF argued that, given the extensive regulation of medical device design and marketing by the FDA, permitting still more regulation at the state level (in the form of lawsuits) would discourage development of new and useful medical devices. WLF further argued that the plain language of the 1976 amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act indicates that Congress intended to preempt state product liability suits against a medical device manufacturer that has complied with FDA labeling and manufacturing requirements. The <i>Medtronic</i> case is being watched closely by the business community, because it will provide a strong indication of the High Court's willingness to bar state-law suits against manufacturers whose products are already subject to significant federal regulation.

<b>Regulators Must Prove Knowledge of Clean Water Act Violations</b>
<br>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <i>United States v. Ahmad</i>, urging the court to overturn a criminal conviction under the Clean Water Act because the district court refused to instruct the jury that the government must prove that the defendant had knowledge of all the elements of the offense. Alternatively, WLF asked the court to set aside the unduly harsh 21-month prison sentence for the first offender because the Sentencing Guidelines for environmental infractions were unlawfully promulgated by the Sentencing Commission and are otherwise flawed.
<p>
WLF argued in its brief that Congress intended that "knowing" violations require the government to prove knowledge of all the elements of the offense. WLF urged the Court to follow the Fourth Circuit which requires a higher intent standard than the Ninth Circuit's lower standard recently enunciated in <i>United States v. Weitzenhoff</i>.

<h2>May 1996 <i>Insider</i></h2>
<h3>In Focus: Book Review</h3>
</center><p>
<i>Temptations of a Superpower</i><br>
by Ronald Steel, Cambridge University Press 1995
<hr>
<p>
In his latest work, <i>Temptations of a Superpower</i>, Ronald Steel scores against what he views as a U.S. foreign policy that has outlived its usefulness, taking a brief, but well-targeted, stab at the present foreign policy dilemma of the United States.  What role should America play in the post-Cold War international arena?  Should the U.S. move toward an interventionist strategy, or pull back into an isolationist position?  Mr. Steel, Professor of International Relations at the University of Southern California and author of <i>Walter Lippman and the American Century</i>, skillfully dissects the underlying principles that served as the pillars of American Cold War foreign policy, while pointing out that new ones are needed.<p>

He begins by undermining the widely accepted notion that the United States "won" the Cold War, questioning whether the United States has come to a position as world leader by its own design or purely by default. With the absence of a great power as an opponent,  Steel argues that the U.S. role as superpower has lost its onus.  With global conflicts changing from quarrels between nation-states to intra-state ethnic and religious disputes, the former policies aimed at containment are becoming increasingly outdated.  He states: "Now we are alone:  a superpower without a challenger, a crusader without a mission."  The rules of the game are changing, but the United States continues to dance singly to the tune of the Cold War, at the risk of sacrificing significant domestic concerns and endangering the nation's pocketbook.
<p>
Wilsonian ideas, such as collective security and self-determination, combined with an entrenched, elitist bureaucracy are competing with Cold War goals, methods, and attitudes, writes Steel. Though alliance-building can serve well in situations involving only nation-states, Steel believes that collective security will only escalate today's smaller, yet complex, intra-state conflicts into regional problems. Furthermore, Steel asserts that the idea of self-determination is so impossibly open-ended that, even after years of debate, it cannot translate into practical foreign policy.  However well-intentioned it may be, it is rooted in the basic assumption that differing people cannot live together, an idea completely contrary to the American experience.  
<p>
The foreign policy "establishment" must also be addressed, according to Steel.  These estranged bureaucrats, hidden away from public scrutiny, have agendas and perspectives all their own.  They make their livings off of a bureaucratic organism that gorged itself on tax dollars (and continues to do so) during the Cold War, and now, even without the need for such monstrous budgets, they strive to maintain this behemoth in a symbiotic effort to preserve their own jobs. Steel believes that these "experts" have become ends unto themselves, and no longer the means for creating sound foreign policy.  
<p>
Steel advises a new direction for foreign policy based principally on self-interest, without the moral baggage that has so characterized many U.S. international policies.  Promoting democracy, confronting "hostile" ideologies, or acting as moral guardian should play a lesser role in American foreign policy.  He pushes the ideas of selective engagement and benign spheres of influence.  With specific guidelines set by a principle of selective engagement, the United States would intervene globally only when its vital interests are threatened. He then relinquishes the responsibility of "conflict management" to the regions in which the conflicts occur.  For example, just as Vietnam once halted the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, so would European states themselves supervise the present situation in Bosnia. Steel believes that this regional self-accountability will more easily provide global stability than an ever-widening U.S. umbrella.
<p>
<i>Temptations of a Superpower</i> is a clearly and concisely written critique, but this published lecture is a bit brief, and lacks detail in many areas.  In addition, it is purely academic, and focuses only on description, by-passing the much needed element of prescription.  Despite this,  Steel has written a quite enjoyable and provocative work, and is well worth the few hours required to read it.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Justice, Freedom, the Flat Tax, and the Tithe
 - April 1996 Insider - Heritage</TITLE></HEAD>

<h3>April 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Justice, Freedom, the Flat Tax, 
and the Tithe</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> The last thing you should worry about when you study the matter of various flat tax 
proposals is whether it will take a 17 percent or 21 percent rate to work. From a biblical 
perspective, two far higher priorities on taxes should be the issues of justice and freedom. 
Both are recurring biblical themes, and both are terribly jeopardized by the present tax 
system in the United States. By contrast, both would be remarkably enhanced with almost 
any flat tax approach. <p>
	Complexity, almost always, is the enemy of justice. Simplicity is its friend. As soon as 
matters get complex, in virtually any venue, the opportunity for corruption takes over. When 
people cant understand a tax code, they get either cynical or opportunistic, and neither 
attitude is congenial to evenhanded justice.<p> 
	Its pretty hard, for example, to beat the simplicity of the tithe. No one can ever come to 
Gods court of appeals arguing that calculating 10 percent was just too difficult, or that he 
couldnt find a tithe consultant smart enough to figure it out.<p> 
	By the same token, its noteworthy that God never established one tithe for the wealthy and 
another for the poor and common folk. The rate was the same, and we can assume that God 
considers that arrangement just. The book of Proverbs reminds us bluntly that were not to 
use two sets of standards in any financial dealings. <p>
	To be sure, almost none of the flat tax proposals now being suggested for our country is even 
yet really equal in its application. To exempt the first $36,000 (or thereabouts) of everyones 
income before starting to apply a 17 percent tax clearly favors the poor, who under such a 
plan would pay no tax at all. And Im not persuaded yet that individual income from interest 
and dividends should be exempted from taxationan idea that will appear to many to favor 
the rich, despite the argument that this income is already taxed at the corporate level. But 
thats why I say we shouldnt get hung upup least yetin the details. The simplicity of the 
proposals tends radically toward justice, and that should be appealing to biblically minded 
folks. <p>
	The other important reason for favoring a flat tax rate is that it would promote freedom. In 
one fell swoop, the flat tax minimizes the role of government in all its attempts to 
micromanage society and culture. For far too long now have we allowed great segments of 
our public life to be driven by tax considerations. The big government social engineers tinker 
constantly with the tax code: tax incentives here, tax deductions there, write-offs for this 
desirable goal, and five-year forgiveness clauses if you take on some other cause the 
government happens to like.<p> 
	The power to tax is indeed the power to destroy, but by extension it is also the power to 
shape a societys values and idealsand in doing so to establish which freedoms will be 
promoted and which will be restricted. So it is a wise people who place simple but strong 
restraints on their governments ability to drill a million holes in the tax code.<p> 
	I say all this fully aware that my employer, World magazine, gets part of its lifeblood from 
tax-deductible gifts from readersand that such revenue might be at least a little jeopardized 
if charitable contributions are no longer tax deductible. <p>
	Not to worry! For that is the very point. As long as people make gifts, even to worthy causes, 
primarily because they are tax deductible and not because that cause is passionately 
important to them, both the tax code and the government behind it are way too important. 
Yes, we may lose a few gifts to our charitable organizationsbut in the end, both we and 
they will breathe so much more deeply of the great air of freedom that it will be a good trade.<p> 
	I have no idea whether a 17 percent flat tax or one at 21 percent will be needed to sustain our 
government through the transition that is coming. Either way, its a great bargainnot 
because of the rate, but because of where the idea ultimately takes us. <p>

offers several new recommendations to adjust to the delays and negative developments
that have characterized the missile defense program in the past year including: <br>
<ol><li>the U.S. Senate should seek ways to remove the obstacles to effective missile
defenses posed by the ABM Treaty, including possible withdrawal from the treaty; <li>
Congress should forego development of ground-based systems for national missile 
defense and accelerate deployment of sea-based, wide-area defenses; <li>Congress
should accelerate the deployment of space-based sensors to enhance the effectiveness 
of both theater and national missile defense; <li>Congress should direct the Air Force 
to develop follow-on space-based defenses to begin deployment early in the next decade; 
<li>Congress should ensure that the Ballistic Missile Defense Office develops an integrated,
but open, architecture for battle management, command, control, and communications to 
support missile defense systems.</ol>14 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage

Richard Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, believes that deterring conflict in the 
Taiwan Strait is the most important challenge for American foreign policy in early 1996. China has 
militarily intimidated the emerging democratic system of Taiwan ever since the Republic of Chinas 
President, Lee Tenghui, visited the United States in June of 1995. According to Fisher, what is at stake in 
Taiwan is not only peace and stability in the region, but the viability of democracy in Taiwan. Since 1987 
the Republic of China has sought democratic political reforms that will soon make Taiwan a democracy.

This report by Richard Vedder, John M. Olin Visiting Professor of Labor Economics and Public Policy at 
the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the U.S. GDP today might be 20 percent higher 
if the regulatory buildup that began in the Johnson Administration had not occured. According to his 
analysis, if regulatory activity remained at 1963 levels, the 1993 U.S. GDP would have been about $7.6 
trillion instead of $6.3 trillion. Vedder notes that regulation imposes direct costs, requiring businesses to 
commit resources to implement governmental mandates. He concludes by writing that while some 
regulations are necessary, such as those on food and drugs, other regualtions have expanded without fully 
considering the costs and consequences of such action. 13 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of

Chairman of Center for the Study of American Business Murray Weidenbaum argues that nearly all of the 
attention in public policy discussions and legislation aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on business is 
focused on either very large enterprises or very small businesses. According to Weidenbaum, medium 
sized firms do not benefit from the protections provided to small businesses or the economies of scale 
generated by large businesses. Fortune 500 companies fill out basically the same forms and meet the same 
requirements as medium-sized firms. Therefore, the cost of complying with regulation is a higher percent 
of sales for the medium-sized firms than for larger ones. Weidenbaum shows that Congress has responded 
to the issue of uneven distribution of regulatory burdens in the predictable manner. Instead of reducing the 
burden of regulation, it has arbitrarily exempted companies of different sizes. He gives as an example, a 
series of federal regulations that take effect when a company hires its 50th employee. Because of this, some 
small firms are reluctant to expand. Weidenbaum concludes by recommending that Congress significantly 
reform and reduce regulation on business. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business,

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the five power marketing administrations (PMAs) are the 
entities that make the federal government the nations largest producer of electric power. According to 
Douglas Houston, Professor of Business Economics at the University of Kansas, these electricity 
businesses, along with other federally subsidized cooperatives and municipal utilities, are inefficient, 
poorly managed and at risk in the environment of electricity competition. Houston argues that privatizing 
federal electricity and ending current subsidies would have the following benefits:<br><ol><li>
the sale of federal power enterprises would raise $15-30 billion to reduce the national debt; <li>$7-10 billion in direct subsidies 
to government-owned utilities and cooperatives would end; <li> privatization would lead to improved 
performance and efficiency and eliminate the political interference in management and investment 
decisions that government owned utilities have to face; and <li> putting the transmission grids of the TVA 
and the PMAs into the emerging competitive market would promote efficiency and lower prices for 
consumers.</ol> Overall, Houston concludes that ending electricity subsidies and privatizing is a win-win 
situation. 36 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA

Robert Poole, President of the Reason Foundation, writes that although Wisconsin has an excellent 
highway system, the majority of the states major highways will require reconstruction during the next 25 
years. Complicating matters, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation projects that current funding 
sources will fall $8.9 billion short of paying for the needed maintenance. As a solution to the shortfall, 
Poole proposes a public-private partnership to build toll roads in the state highway system. Poole believes 
that such a partnership has many benefits, including: highway innovations, new funding sources, risk 
transfer, new tax revenue, reduced operating costs, better-maintained roads, greater safety levels, 
congestion relief. Potential problems include: loss of public control, bankruptcy, labor issues and higher 
financing costs. Poole concludes with a description of what steps should be taken to bring about toll roads 
as a solution to Wisconsins highway maintenance problems including: a detailed feasability study and 
state and federal legislation to provide the adequate legal framework. 27 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy

According Transportation expert Peter Samuel, taxpayers are the biggest losers in American transportation 
policy. Samuel writes that although transportation policy is in need of reform in order to pay for its massive 
costs and to best serve the interests of commuters, entrenched interests stand in the way of meaningful 
reform. Those interests that directly influence transportation policy in Washington include: highway 
construction companies seeking more federally funded projects; social engineers seeking transit systems 
that conform to their ideals; and automobile organizations, such as AAA, who fight against such policy 
innovations as private toll roads that they feel threaten travel and commerce. Samuel illustrates the 
historical development of the transportation lobbies into what they are today and provides a history of 
government highway and transportation policy. Samuel concludes his report by saying that the first step of 
achieving reform is to realize that government monopoly in roads is not the solution. New technology and 
privatization are the answer, although it will entail taking on the entrench transportation lobbying forces 
inside the Beltway. 5 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th St., NW, 8th Floor, Washington,

Jerry Bowyer, President of the Allegheny Institute, criticizes a study prepared last year in the University of 
Pittsburghs &quot;Economic Benchmarks&quot; report, as well as other studies that suggest that racial prejudice is 
doing severe harm to the economic conditions of blacks, and that the city of Pittsburgh is worse in this 
regard than the rest of the nation. Bowyer provides evidence that economic disparity can almost entirely be 
attributed to a combination of distinct demographic patterns and behavioral factors within the black 
community and not racial prejudice. He notes that the University of Pittsburgh study does not take into 
account such factors as family structure and high school and college drop out rates. The researchers instead 
just measure disparity, and on this issue it is not even complete. Bowyer argues that it is irresponsible to 
report racial income disparity figures in a racially charged urban atmosphere, where the figures are likely to 
be misinterpreted, unless steps are taken to make sure that the results are properly understood. Bowyer 
concludes that these studies, because of their omissions, are more likely to further economic disparities 
than promote problemsolving. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, Suite 612, 7 Parkway

decline in median household or family size, and a shortening in the average workweekprovides a fairly

the President to correct the current drift away from free trade:<br><ol><li>the U.S. should fulfill all of its NAFTA 
obligations on schedule; <li> NAFTA should be expanded; <li> Mexico should be encouraged to adopt a 
currency board; <li> the Administration should offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexicos public sector 
foreign debt; and <li> the Administration should offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with 
Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking.</ol> Sweeney 
also proposes a free-market solution for Mexican monetary troubles, writing that Clintons $50 billion 
bailout of Mexico has not only failed to stop the trend of devaluation, depression and eventual default, it 
also ignored principles of free-trade. 14 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214

Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, suggests a strategy for Congress to get its budget 
and policy goals back on track. He argues that if Congress hopes to enact its legislative agenda this year, it 
should adopt a two-year budget and break down appropriations bills into more manageable pieces of 
legislation, noting that Clintons 1997 budget is already out, even though all the appropriations for 1996 
have yet to be passed. Utt also argues that Congress should not use last years strategy of waiting until the 
end of the year to present the president with an all-or-nothing appropriations bill. This strategy backfired 
and allowed President Clinton to avoid an open debate on the issue. If the appropriations process is broken 
down into smaller bills, contends Utt, Congress can directly debate policy on a program-by-program basis. 
This would expose the negative aspects of the Presidents defense of the status quo. Utt points out that the 
same strategy can be used on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and welfare. Reforms in 
these programs were vetoed at once when combined in one huge reconciliation bill. If they were free 
standing measures, however, there would be a better chance of conducting a substantive policy debate. 7

a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, or $306 billion more than the vetoed Balance Budget 
Act of 1995$3,155 more for every household in America; it raises a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues 
over seven years, $187 billion more than the BBA, and $1,927 more in taxes for every household in 
America; it allows $119 billion more deficit spending through 2002 than the BBA, which is equivalent to 
passing along $1,227 per household in debt to the next generation of America workers; it fails to eliminate a 
single program of any significance; it fails to eliminate even one Cabinet-level agency; it increases 
entitlement spending by $365 billion over the next seven years while failing to save Medicare from

The 17 percent flat tax plan sponsored by House Majority Leader, Dick Armey, and Sen. Richard Shelby, 
shows no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class Americans when compared with 
their current tax burden, according to William Beach, Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, and Dan Mitchell, 
Heritage McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy. In fact, a 17percent  flat tax, on average, would 
lower taxes on all income groups. Based on IRS income-tax files for 1991, under a 17 percent flat tax, 
households with less than $15,000 per year in taxable income will experience a nearly 50 percent drop in 
their tax burden. Moreover, About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no 
federal income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax, the analysts say, and nearly 
everyone else below $30,000 in taxable income will see their taxes fall. According to Beach and Mitchell, 
lower taxes will not mean higher deficits. The loss in individual income tax revenue under the Armey-
Shelby plan will be offset by increased revenue from middle-sized and big businesses. 7 pp. CONTACT:

Bruce Bartlett, Senior Fellow at the Alexis de Toqueville Institution, illustrates how the mortgage interest 
deduction has become the untouchable &quot;third rail&quot; in any discussion of a flat tax. This is despite the fact 
that homeowners would gain more from a flat-rate tax than they would lose if the mortgage deduction was 
taken away. Nonetheless, Bartlett points out, realtors have declared &quot;war&quot; against the flat tax. He 
dismantles the key study issued by the National Association of Realtors by DRI/McGraw-Hill, a private 
economic consulting firm, that concludes the Armey flat tax proposal would cause housing prices to 
collapse from the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction. According to Bartlett, not only would 
mortgage rates fall by about 18 percent as soon as the flat tax takes effect,  in the unlikely event that a flat 
tax caused housing prices to fall, the decline would only be temporary. Furthermore, the flat tax would benefit homeowners by eliminating the capital 
gains tax. 9 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N. Central Expy., Suite 720,

groups created to provide a smokescreen for lobbying; state bureaucrats using state offices to facilitate 
lobbying; and the selling of positions of authority. In the other article Thomas DiLorenzo, Senior Fellow at

Richard Vedder, Professor of Economics at Ohio University, argues that capital cities in the United States 
are &quot;parasite economies&quot; which drain resources from surrounding areas. According to Vedder, lawyers, 
lobbyists, legislators, bureaucrats, and government contractors take productive resources from the average 
taxpayer to fill their own pockets. Vedder uses statistical comparisons of factors such as income, 
population change, unemployment, and working conditions to illustrate how capital cities &quot;siphon&quot;wealth 
from other areas. He shows that the average annual pay for workers in the Washington D.C. area exceeds 
the national average by 48 percent. Furthermore, the per capita income in the capital cities of the poorest 
states are about 17 percent above the state averages. Vedder concludes by saying that it is not a coincidence 
that a majority of the state capitals that have gained the most in relative affluence are in the poorest states. 
According to Vedder, this shows that the taxes that finance affluent capitals crowd out private-sector 
activity that is usually more efficient and productive than government activity. 23 pp. CONTACT: Cato

political activities of special-interest groups. He shows that the agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend 
toward bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation. Griffin calls for the elimination of 
such slush funds. He examines each one and illustrates how they use the millions in federal funding to 
lobby for their special interests. Griffin concludes by calling for an end to federally subsidized political 
activism. 14 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue,

According to Heritage Health Care Policy Analyst John Lui, the National Governors Associations 
Medicaid reform plan ignores many of the biggest problems of the current system. He writes that the 
highly touted Medicaid reform plan drafted by the governors contains many needed reforms, but unless a 
final bill differs sharply in some critical details, the plan will be a disaster. The governors plan claims to 
scrap the Medicaid entitlement in favor of a system of block grants to the states, yet preserves a long list of 
benefits that must be provided to a large, entitled population. In addition, since the governors decision to 
guarentee Medicaid coverage to so many people will impose heavy burdens on state budgets, they also 
included an &quot;umbrella insurance&quot; provision that, in effect, &quot;entitles&quot; states to federal money. If states 
experience an unanticipated rise in the number of people eligible for Medicaid, the federal government 
would bear the cost, which almost certainly would increase the federal deficit. Liu recommends that 
Congress make the following changes to the governors plan:<br><ol><li>sharply limit the guaranteed populations 
and benefits of the entitlement; and <li>the umbrella should be a budgeted fund appropriated each year, not 
an entitlement to states.</ol> 3 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214

Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, criticizes the National Governors 
Associations welfare reform proposal for entirely ignoring the No. 1 problem that experts say perpetuates 
the welfare culture, illegitimacy. He also points out that the NGA plan repudiates most of the key elements 
of the Contract with America. The Contracts welfare reform was based on three themes: a national goal of 
reducing illegitimacy; national work requirements; and greater flexibility to state governments. The NGA 
plan, according to Rector, does not contain the first two principles of reform. Rector argues that the NGA 
plan is flawed in four aspects: <li>it abandons the welfare reform goal of reducing illegitimacy; <li>it 
eliminates all work requirements for AFDC recipients; <li>it has a pervasive anti-marriage bias; and <li>it 
embodies the Clinton Administrations &quot;reform&quot; structure, which penalizes states that pursue efficient plans.</ul> Rector concludes that bogus reforms, such as the NGA proposal, reduce public pressure for change 
and thereby helps encourage the existing system. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage

William Beach, Heritage Foundation Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, warns that the debate between 
Congress and the President on reforming Medicaid has not paid enough attention to the effect of the 
program on state finances. He writes that if significant reforms in Medicaid are not enacted, state 
governments will face a major increase in spending and a heavy increase in the proportion of their 
projected revenues that they must dedicate to the program. Beach shows that the cost of Medicaid to the 
federal government has grown at double-digit rates in recent years. Congressional Budget Office 
projections show annual federal Medicaid costs doubling by the year 2002. According to Beach there will 
be an estimated shift of $47.4 billion in mandated Medicaid spending from the federal government to state 
governments over the next seven years. He believes that states will respond in one of three ways:<br><ol><li>by 
enacting dramatic tax increases; <li>by reducing state spending on education, infrastructure, law 
enforcement, and other important state functions; or <li>by some combination of the first two.</ol> The National 
Association of State Budget Officers claims that Medicaid spending has already doubled from 
approximately 10 percent to 20 percent as a share of overall state spending since 1987. 5 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
David Tuerck, Executive Director of the Beacon Hill Institute, James Angelini, Professor of Accounting 
and Taxation at Suffolk University, and William OBrien, Resident Scholar at the Beacon Hill Institute, 
argue that the method by which the government funds welfare programs causes the taxpayer to have no 
incentive to take interest in how his money is spent. The taxpayer (who is a potential donor to charitable, 
nonprofit organizations) has no clear idea of how much of his tax money makes it to a welfare recipient, so 
he has no control over the tax dollar and therefore, argue Angelini, OBrien, and Tuerck, over the behavior 
of the welfare recipient. The authors propose that the same funds that now directly flow into government 
offices can instead flow into private charitable organizations. The tax credit they propose will allow 
taxpayers to deduct 100% of their contributions to eligible charities to up to 25% of their federal tax 
liability. This gives the taxpayer/donor control over where his dollar is spent. Angelini, OBrien, and 
Tuerck predict that such a tax credit will cause new organizations to respond to the increased opportunities 
presented to them. They conclude that competition will lead to efficiency and charitable organizations will 
be more innovative and successful than government in providing social services. 165 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
This study, by John Berthoud, Vice President of the Alexis de Toqueville Institution, reveals that if every 
item in the National Education Associations (NEA) Legislative Program for the 104th Congress were 
enacted, federal spending would increase by at least $702 billion annually. The study uses data on 
legislative proposals compiled by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation in their BillTally tracking 
system. The spending estimates for the different proposals come from non-partisan sources such as the 
Congressional Budget Office. One of the findings in this report is that the NEAs spending priorities are 
heavily skewed towards elderly Americans, despite NEAs claim that it is an educational organization with 
a primary focus on schools and children. The study finds that for each dollar in new spending on children 
and education that the NEA proposes (over $24 billion annually), it advocates $5.24 in new spending on 
Social Security. The report also claims that the taxes to fund the NEA agenda are probably politically 
impractical. According to the report, the NEA would need over thirteen times as much in taxes as was 
raised by the 1993 budget package. Berthoud points out, &quot;no organization that advocates this massive 
expansion of federal spending and probably massive increase in deficits can claim to be helping children. 
This agenda will break the financial back of Americas future generations.&quot; 31 pp.  CONTACT: The Alexis

Chester Finn, John M. Olin Fellow at the Hudson Institute, and Bruno Manno, Senior Fellow in the 
Education Policy Studies Program at the Hudson Institute, examine the state of American higher education. 
They point out that although American education has grown in the last fifty years in scale, wealth, allure, 
and stature, it is encountering public disapproval and consumer resistance. Productivity concerns, 
according to Finn and Manno, had been ignored because a college education use to pay off so well in the 
job market. Today, however, that payoff appears to be decreasing while the costs of higher education are 
increasing more quickly than inflation. Furthermore, funding is decreasing, consumers are becoming more 
conscious of costs, and the number of students available for enrollment is less. Finn and Manno claim that 
in order to solve these problems,  higher education must have a greater concern for productivity and a 
willingness to serve customers. They argue that administrators should cut costs, establish tougher entry 
requirements, and concentrate on serious academic subjects. However, they concede, the public will have 
to push them to do so. 16 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O. Box 26-919,

This article, published in Government Union Review, examines the little known scandal of teacher union 
bargaining. Myron Lieberman, Senior Research Scholar, and Charlene Haar, Research Associate at the 
Social Philosophy & Policy Center, examine the issue of education union contracts requiring school 
districts to pay for the pensions of union officials. They center on a case in the state of Rhode Island where 
officials of the National Education Association-Rhode Island, and the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers 
benefited from legislation enacted in 1987 which extended the benefits of the states retirement system to 
full-time employees of organizations representing employees of the state and/or any political subdivision 
thereof for the purpose of collective bargaining. Lieberman and Haar also cover the ensuing legal battle 
since the details of the legislation were exposed in the press and subsequently repealed in the Rhode Island 
legislature. They conclude by calling for the prohibition of this practice in other states and encourage 
school boards and state legislatures to adopt safeguards. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy

Raymond Keating, Chief Economist at SBSC, criticizes the federal government Superfund program by 
documenting the massive costs and inefficiencies of the Superfund program, which was designed to help 
clean up hazardous waste sites across the country. Keating illustrates how only 18 percent of the worst 
waste sites have been cleaned up at a combined government/private sector cost of roughly $90 million. 
According to Keating, Superfund turned essentially local or state problems into national problems and 
granted the inefficient federal bureaucracy jurisdiction over them. Keating offers a three-step reform 
process for Superfund:<br><ol><li> repeal the retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987, use science-
based risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis to determine required clean up remedies, and cap the 
number of Superfund sites to gain some control over costs; <li> to bring fairness and common sense, repeal 
the strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes altogether, and only assign liability to 
individuals and businesses who broke the law, and <li> eventually abolish Superfund entirelywaste sites 
are a local problem, not federal.</ol>  28 pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 18th

<P>
This issue of EPA Watch features an article on the conflict between EPA and industry over EPAs efforts to 
expand the breadth and depth of the toxic release inventory (TRI) and the controversial issue of material 
accounting. The TRI is the list of chemicals whose emissions certain industries must report annually to 
EPA. EPA is proposing to nearly double the size of this list. Material accounting would require industries 
to report not only emissions, but also the amounts of a certain chemical used at key intervals in the 
manufacturing process. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce led a group of forty companies and trade 
associations in blasting the proposal in a letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner. They claimed the goal 
of TRI is to provide information to the public so that they can make informed decisions about risk. 
Chemical use is not relative information because it is not a good indicator of risk. On top of that, EPA does 
not have the legislative authority to collect and make public chemical use information. This issue is even 
controversial in the agency itself, as many EPA scientists argue that better use can be made of resources by 
concentrating on more serious risks. 8 pp.  CONTACT: EPA Watch, 14140-L Parke Long Court, Chantilly,

<P>
Increasing incarceration rates since 1980 have led to a projected 294 percent increase in the prison 
population of the state of Pennsylvania. The funding for the states corrections department has grown at a 
similar rate. In order to afford new prison construction costs, The Commonwealth Foundation calls for 
privatizing the states prisons. According to this report, privatization saves money because government is 
simply not capable of delivering, running, and regulating services either as efficiently or as effectively as 
private firms. Various studies show that prison privatization would likely save at least 10 percent per year 
in operations costs. This report illustrates how private prisons save operational funds and construction 
costs. It is also shown that private prisons are constitutionally sound. The report concludes that 
privatization of the construction and operation of the new prisons needed in Pennsylvania as of the year 
2000, as well at the operations of existing prisons, is exceptionally attractive financially, and maybe even a 
necessity in times of financial belt-tightening. 20 pp. CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation, 600 N.

<I><font size=3>Briefing, Pacific Research Institute</FONT></I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">

<P> 
Vice-President of Research at the Pacific Research Institute Steven Hayward looks at the effects of punitive 
damages  in civil litigation, which are demanded in 27 percent of all cases where they are conceivably 
recoverable. Hayward uses lawsuit filing data to show that business and government defendants are four 
times as likely as an individual defendant to face a lawsuit that demands punitive damages. Lawsuits with 
punitive damage demands take one-third longer to resolve than suits without them. Punitive damages tilt 
the playing field towards the demanding parties, according to Hayward, and increase out-of-court 
settlement amounts. Hayward provides evidence against studies that claim the risk of receiving an adverse 
punitive damage judgment is remote. Closer scrutiny of data shows that the probability of punitive damage 
awards is vastly understated by such studies, partly because the data has been improperly qualified and 
mostly because the vast majority of lawsuites are settled out of court where punitive damage demands play 
a significant role. 14 pp. CONTACT: Pacific Research Institute, 755 Sansome St., San Francisco, CA

Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, examines what has been accomplished by 
Congress this session in closing unneeded and obsolete government agencies. He finds that Congress has 
done a respectable jobespecially in relation to past Congressesbut that there is much more to be done. 
They did better than most observers expected, closing over 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs 
of various areas of the federal government. Utt also looks at what actions Congress took in 41 specific 
agencies recommended for termination by the Heritage Foundation. Excluding the five independent 
agencies that are not subject to the annual appropriations process, Utt found that Congresss record of the 
remaining 36 was: 13 agencies terminated and $3.6 billion saved over the next five years; funding for 12 
agencies substantially reduced by 10 percent or more) and $2.2 billion saved over five years; and no 
change or only limited change (funding cut by 10 percent or less) at 11 agencies and up to $40 million 
saved over the next five years. Utt also shows that of the 11 agencies not significantly reduced in funding 
terminated, all but onethe Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission, whose funding was 
tripledsaw their funding either modestly reduced or frozen at 1995 levels. Despite Congresss proven 
effort to reduce government waste, Utt points out, President Clinton opposed many of these efforts by 
vetoing five of the appropriations bills put forth by Congress. He concludes by outlining termination and 
consolidation objectives for the FY 1997 budget. 20 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage

Paul Grant, an attorney in Parker, Colorado, examines the importance of citizen initiatives in that state. He 
reports recent instances of Colorados elected and appointed government officials retaliating against 
initiatives that they are not happy with, and argues that Colorados Secretary of State, General Assembly 
and Supreme Court have combined to weaken the power of initiative. According to Grant, this has been 
done through burdensome new regulations, petty and substantial interference from the Secretary of State, 
legislative attacks on the initiative process, and Colorado Supreme Court interferences. Overall the 
initiative process has been made more difficult, expensive and less effective. Grant looks at the methods 
and motives of attackers of the initiative process, and he considers legal analysis which might be useful in 
resisting and reversing damage caused to this &quot;vital check on runaway government power.&quot; 10 pp.

In this comprehensive study, Austin Fulk, Research Associate, and Stuart Nolan, Visiting Fellow at Capital 
Research Center, surveyed 1993 corporate contributions from the 250 largest American corporations to 
cover 300 nonprofit public interest and special interest advocacy groups. Using available corporate and IRS 
data, Fulk and Nolan were able to identify over $36 million in contributions by 166 corporations to groups 
across the political spectrum. They found that for every $1.00 that corporations gave to conservative and 
free market policy groups, $4.07 was given to liberal groups favoring increased government spending and 
regulation. The book also uncovers a development in public affairs during the Clinton Administration: 
Although many corporations are downsizing their operations, some of them are supporting nonprofit 
advocacy groups whose lobbying activities promote big government and undermine the free enterprise 
system. The guide also lists specific grants made by Forbes 250 companies, and includes a cross-reference 
to easily check which companies fund which advocacy groups. 193 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research

<b>CIR Wins Appeal Challenging Racial Preferences</b><p> CIR won a major victory in March when an unanimous panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held 
that the university of Texas Law Schools use of racial preferences in student admissions is unconstitutional. CIR represents Cheryl Hopwood and Douglas Carvell, white applicants to the 1992 incoming class of the University of Texas Law School who were denied admission on the basis of their race despite their superior qualifications. In its ruling, the Fifth Circuit declared that diversity is not a 
compelling state interest that would justify the use of racial preferences. The Court stated that [w]ithin the general principles of the fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity fosters, rather than 
minimizes, the use of race. It treats minorities as a group, rather than as individuals. The Fifth Circuit held that Justice Powells opinion in Board of Regents v. Bakke, in which he advocated the consideration of race 
to achieve diversity, never represented the view of a majority of the Supreme Court and, in light of more recent Supreme Court rulings, did not justify the law school race-based admissions program. The Fifth Circuit held further that the government may employ racial preferences only as a means of redressing past 
discrimination by a particular government unitin this case, UT Law School. Racial preferences may not be used to redress alleged discrimination by entire educational systems.  <p>
 
<b>Update on CIR's Case Against HUD Officials</b><p>CIR is representing the Berkeley 3, residents of Berkeley, CA who were targets of a prolonged 
investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  In response to an administrative complaint filed by a so-called fair housing organization that the residents exercise of their First Amendment rights to protest the governments proposed conversion of a nearby hotel to a homeless shelter constituted discrimination, HUD conducted a lengthy investigation of the residents activities.  CIR filed suit on behalf of the Berkeley 3 against various HUD officers, in both their official and individual capacities, last May.  <p>
 
The Court denied the defendants motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a violation of the First Amendment and that the individual defendants are protected by qualified immunity.  The Court found the defendants arguments that no investigation can violate the First Amendment striking 
in its audacity, and concluded that it would be premature to resolve the issue of qualified immunity solely on the allegations of the complaint.  The Court did grant defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs injunctive relief claims, but granted plaintiffs leave to replead (which they have done). <p>

<b>Defenders Tells State It Cannot "Have Its Cake and Eat It Too."</b><p>
Defenders has argued its Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposition to the States Motion to Dismiss 
before Judge Preece of the Ninth Judicial District in Clearwater County, Minnesota.  James Peternell owns 
2/3rd interest in an 112-acre Rice Slough, which the state, pursuant to legislation passed in 1979, classified 
as a public water.  That classification did not, in an of itself, however, change the rights of the property 
owner.  In 1994, the state had criminally prosecuted James Peternell for attempting to exclude from his 
portion of the Rice Slough an uninvited member of the public (who later turned out to be an undercover 
DNR agent) and for leaving duck decoys out overnight on public water.  Although the jury acquitted Mr. 
Peternell of both criminal counts in 1995, Defenders brought its lawsuit alleging that as a result of the 
prosecution, Peternell has lost his right to exclude others from his property in violation of the Fifth 
Amendment.  In response to this lawsuit for compensation, the state has now changed its position.  During 
oral arguments, the state agreed with Defenders that Peternell can exclude members of the public from his 
property.  Defenders is seeking a court order so holding which will force the state to obey the Constitution 
and prevent any further unwarranted criminal prosecutions of Mr. Peternell.   <p>

<b>Sixth Circuit Asks Feds to Respond to MSLF Rehearing Petition</b><p> 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has ordered the U.S. Forest Service to respond to a petition 
by MSLF fro a rehearing en banc.  MSLFs petition follows the decision by a three judge panel that private 
property in Michigan may be regulated by the Forest Service as a wilderness despite the provision of the 
Wilderness Act of 1964 that only federal land may be classified as wilderness. 
<p> 
Lake front property owners in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have been told by the U.S. Forest Service 
that their rights to use the entire surface of Crooked Lakea right recognized by Michigan Lawcan be 
denied by the Forest Service since it owns property abutting the southern portion of the Lake. The Forest 
Service claims the Property Clause of the Constitution gives it such authority over private property.

<b>Appeals Court Hears MSLF Challenge to Clinton Tax</b><p> 
A potentially precedent-setting challenge to President Clintons 1993 tax legislation, contending that the 
tax on transportation fuels violates the U.S. Constitution, was heard recently by the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Tenth Circuit.  In oral arguments before the three-judge panel, the Wyoming Trucking Association 
asserted that because the transportation fuel tax increase failed to originate in the House of Representatives 
(the House has passed a BTU tax), it violates the Constitutions Origination Clause. 
<p> 
The case is on appeal from federal district court in Wyoming where the Wyoming Trucking Associations 
lawsuit was dismissed when the court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case.  The district court 
ruled that any challenge to federal tax liability must first be heard by the Commissioner of the Internal 
Revenue Service.  The Association claims a hearing before the IRS would be futile since it cannot rule 
on challenges to the constitutionality of a tax.

<b>NELF Brief Aids in Major Win For Massachusetts CPAs.</b><p> 
In a case with national implications, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that the state can 
constitutionally prohibit unlicensed accountants (non-CPAs) from using any language that might mislead 
the public as to their qualifications. The court also held that the state can bar such unlicensed accountants 
from preparing and distributing audits and financial reports to clients or third parties. 
<p> 
The decision involved Mr. Volin, an unlicensed accountant supported by a national association of such 
people.  Volin argued that the First Amendment prohibited the state from preventing non-CPAs from 
claiming the title accountant.  He also claimed the right to use adjectives such as qualified, 
experienced and independent, although he was not licensed by any state or recognized national 
accrediting organization. 
<p> 
But the court agreed with an amicus brief filed by NELF which argued that the states rules promote the 
public interest by protecting clients, financial institutions, suppliers and others from the consequences of 
inaccurate or misleading financial data.  NELFs brief pointed out that every state in the nation has had 
such regulations on the books for decades and that a decision in Volins favor would cause financial 
institutions and suppliers to raise questions about the reliability of financial data regarding the states 
businesses which would harm their ability to engage in interstate and international trade. 
<p> 
The court held that Volin could use the bare word accountant to describe himself, but it barred use of 
modifiers which might imply licensure or special qualifica-tions, and it barred him from distributing 
financial reports.  By upholding the states rules, the court set back national efforts to weaken regulation of 
the accounting profession.

<b>NELF Supreme Court Brief Challenges Expansion of Corporate Liability Under 
Federal Pension Law.</b><p> 
Spink v. Lockheed Corporation involves Lockheeds effort to reduce its defense workforce as a result of 
post-Cold War cutbacks in the defense budget.  One element of Lockheeds effort was to offer workers a 
generous package of additional pension benefits if they agreed to take voluntary early retirement.  Sensibly 
enough, Lockheed coupled that offer with a requirement that workers who accepted enhanced retirement 
benefits must wave possible claims against Lockheed arising from termination of employment.  Lockheed 
added this proviso to protect itself against the increasingly common practice of workers accepting 
enhanced retirement benefits and then suing their former employer claiming violations of the age 
discrimination or other employment-related laws. 
<p> 
Spink refused to sign the waiver and so did not take early retirement. Instead he sued Lockheed, claiming 
that coupling enhanced benefits with a required waiver violated ERISA, the federal pension protection law. 
Spink argued that Lockheed was a fiduciary with respect to assets held under its retirement plan and could 
not use the promise of increased benefits to induce recipients to grant waivers that would protect it. While a 
District Court dismissed Spinks claim, the Court of Appeals in San Francisco reversed. 
<p> 
The case raises two key issues: 1) was the decision to award increased benefits in return for a waiver a 
prohibited transaction in violation of ERISA; and 2) is a corporate plan sponsor an ERISA fiduciary. 
Since Lockheed fully addressed the first issue, NELF only discussed the fiduciary issue. That issue matters, 
because, under ERISA, fiduciaries are subject to civil suits for compensatory damages and attorneys fees, 
while non-fiduciaries are generally subject only to regulatory orders to undo improper actions. 
<p> 
NELFs brief argued that it is irrational to treat plan sponsors as fiduciaries. Corporations are responsible to 
shareholders, not to retirees. While they must obey ERISA and other laws, they cannot put retirees 
interests above their own, as fiduciaries must. The history of ERISA recognizes that plan sponsors and 
fiduciaries, i.e. fund trustees, have different responsibilities. Consistent with pre-existing trust law, under 
ERISA fiduciaries are fully subject to civil suit, while corporations and those that aid them, such as 
accountants and third party benefit administrators, are subject only to regulatory constraints. 
<p> 
<b>NELF Files Amicus Brief in First Circuit Superfund Case.</b><p> 
NELF has filed an amicus brief with the Court of Appeals in a case in which the government seeks to make 
a company pay millions of dollars in Superfund cleanup costs without a chance to defend itself. United 
States v. Cooper Industries involves a Massachusetts site polluted 50 years ago. The Friedlands later 
bought the land and leased it to Cooper Industries. As part of a standard lease, Cooper promised to 
indemnify the Friedlands for costs which they might incur from its activities. Later, after passage of 
CERCLA, the Superfund law, the government sued the Fried lands and Cooper because they owned or 
worked on polluted land. The cleanup estimate was $42 million, with Cooper 22% responsible and the 
Friedlands 29% responsible. 
Then the government hit upon the idea of having the Friedlands use the indemnity provision to pass 
through cleanup costs. Although the clause predated passage of CERCLA, a judge held that it applied to 
CERCLA-related costs. The government then made the Friedlands the proverbial offer they could not 
refuse. If the Friedlands stipulated they were liable for the full $42 million in damages, the government 
would collect the money from indemnity proceeds, i.e., from Cooper. Thus the Friedlands agreed to an 
enormous fine so long as someone else would pay it.  Furthermore, since Cooper had to pay the money 
under the indemnity, not under CERCLA, it could not use any CERCLA defenses or argue that the costs 
were unreasonable or unnecessary. 
<p> 
Obviously, this is grossly unfair to Cooper which must pay millions of dollars in cleanup costs without a 
chance to protect itself. It will also lead to waste in administering CERCLA cleanups. By using the back 
door of indemnity, government can avoid having to prove its costs are reasonable.  Without that check, 
costs will continue to spiral.  A decision on Coopers appeal is likely by summer.

<b>PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION </b>
<p> 
<b>First Amendment Right to Language Diversity?</b><p> 
As a taxpayer, and ultimately the employer of government workers, do you have the right to set 
reasonable rules concerning the operation of the agencies you underwrite with tax dollars?  Conversely, do 
government workers have a constitutional right to promote their individual agenda by disregarding 
reasonable workplace policies?  More specifically, should state employees be allowed to drag their bosses 
into federal court because they are required to carry out their responsibilities in English?  These 
fundamental questions are at issue in a case in which Pacific Legal Foundation recently asked the U.S. 
Supreme Court to strike down a U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Yniguez v. Arizonans for 
Official Language that the free speech right of the public employees are offended by requiring them to 
conduct their jobs in the nations predominant languageEnglish. Should the U.S. Supreme Court accept 
this case, PLF will argue, among other things, that government bureaucrats have no right to turn every 
workplace disagreement into a federal case.  
 <p>
Last October the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared unconstitutional Arizonas Official Language 
amendment to the state constitution.  Enacted by Arizona voters in 1988, it declared English the states 
official language and requires the state and all political subdivisions to act in English and in no other 
language.  The amendment applies to all state government employees during the performance of their 
government business.  It is not and outright ban against conversing in a language other than English.

<b>Malibu Declares Moratorium on Constitution</b><p> 
In 1988, Diana Merritt-Shriner and her husband bought 16 acres in Malibu, California, with the intent of 
dividing the lot into three parcels.  They spent three years paying off the loans and formulating their plans 
to build one house on each of the lots.  The county granted tentative parcel approval of the plan in June 
1990, and they subsequently were granted permits buy the Coastal Commission. 
<p> 
All was going well until the creation off the City of Malibu in 1991, when the new city leaders passed a 
law imposing a moratorium on all new development so that it could create and adopt a general plan and 
zoning ordinances.  This turn of events left the Shriners with about $75,000 of incurred expenses and a 16-
acre plot on which no development would be allowed under the terms of the moratorium. 
<p> 
Hard-nosed city bureaucrats denied the Shriners permit request despite state and county rules that would 
have allowed for an exception under unfortunate circumstances.  Although the Shriners land was located 
in a residential neighborhood, the city designated the area as potential open space or parkland even though 
it had no funds with which to purchase the property for those uses!  Furthermore, the county placed a 
Road and Water Assessment Bond against the property in the amount of $279,000 for which the 
Shriners are liable, even though there have not been any water or road impacts since no homes exist on the 
property. 
<p> 
PLF argued to the California Court of Appeal that under circumstances like these, city bureaucrats must not 
abuse their powers in a way that imposes economic hardship on property owners when it is clear that no 
public health, safety, and welfare concerns are being advanced.

<b>36 Members of Congress Support Florida Suit on Immigration Costs</b><p> 
On behalf of itself and a bipartisan group of five United States Senators (Mack, Graham, DAmato, 
Hutchison, and Feinstein) and 34 Representatives, WLF filed a brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear 
the State of Floridas lawsuit against the federal government in Chiles v. United States.  Florida brought the 
suit to compel the federal government to compensate Florida for the fiscal burdens resulting from the 
federal governments failure to enforce its own immigration laws adequately. 
<p> 
WLFs brief focuses on the fiscal effects of federal mandates upon states to provide education of illegal 
aliens without federal assistance to offset those expenses.  According to WLFs brief, if the federal 
government fails to control illegal immigration adequately, the result is a massive unfunded mandate 
imposed upon the states to provide for the immigrants education and medical care.  Based on the Supreme 
Courts 1992 decision in New York v. United States, WLF argues that although the federal government can 
create incentives for a state to provide such services, it lacks the power to hijack state resources unilaterally 
in this manner. The constitutionality of the federal governments failure to provide reimbursement is not 
just the subject of Floridas suit but of pending litigation brought by other states across the country:  
<p> 
<b>Miranda Decision Superseded by Statute, 
WLF Contends</b><p> 
WLF filed a brief in a Utah bank robbery case, United States v. Nafka, arguing that incriminating 
statements by defendants must be admitted into evidence even if their Miranda right were technically 
violated. WLF pointed out the Miranda has been superseded in federal prosecutions by 18 U.S.C. 3501, 
which provides that statements shall be admissible as evidence if the confession was otherwise voluntary.  
In such cases, according to 3501, the totality of the circumstances should be examined by the trial court.  
Although the U.S. Justice Department has generally failed to invoke 3501 since its enactment in 1968, the 
United States Attorney prosecuting the Utah case has asked the court to consider WLFs arguments.

<b>Apple Growers Ask Supreme Court to 
Hear Appeal</b><p> 
On seventh anniversary of a controversial 60 Minutes broadcast that portrayed apples treated with Alar 
as carcinogenic, a group of Washington State apple growers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their 
suit against CBS for falsity of the broadcast.  The growers, represented by WLF, suffered losses of over 
$75 million from the broadcast, which called Alar  the most potent cancer-causing agent in the food 
supply.  Alar is an EPA-approved growth regulator for apples; according to eminent scientists, there is no 
reliable evidence that Alar causes cancer in humans. In fact, because fruits and vegetables contain 
anticarcinogens, eating them - including those treated with pesticides - is a good way to reduce cancer risk.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Understanding Corporate Government Relations
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>


	After nearly 34 years in the corporate world, I welcomed the opportunity to join <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> after the 1994 elections, when the prospect of a conservative revolution presented an 
irresistible second career challenge. I had always respected the conservative movement and 
supported its mission, even when I found my business colleagues on the other side of an issue.
	In my old job in the corporate community, I found that conservative analysts and activists are 
often suspicious of business. Indeed, in the interest of earning &quot;business value&quot; for 
their companies and shareholders, corporate government affairs offices often put narrow 
economic interests over the broader philosophical or political objectives that motivate 
conservatives. The business community cares less about ideology than about finding the power 
center and lining up advocates on its key issues. This may translate into support for a piece of 
compromise legislation that lifts a burden, lessens a cost, or lowers a barrier, even if it isnt the 
proposal conservatives took to the table.<p>
	The business communitys pragmatic approach to policy making is not very inspiring, but it can 
bring closure and progress on its objectives. My corporate experiences suggest that sometimes 
the beauty of an idea crowds out the importance of strategically implementing a focused plan to 
achieve your objectives. This most certainly is not to suggest compromise on principle, but 
rather the need for a system that is acutely aware of its environment, regularly takes stock of how 
its agenda items are proceeding, and makes necessary adjustments to its priorities, goals, and 
strategies. <p>
Although the commercial instinct for closure and moving on to the next priority often 
serves business interests business interests well enough, it does not always serve them best. 
When it began to appear in the fall of 1994 that conservatives could seriously increase their 
presence in the House and Senate, those positioned to take over the new leadership positions 
were proclaiming a sea change rollback of government.<p>
	The reality of governing, however, dictates that conservatives cannot expect to reform 40 years 
of liberal policies overnight: reinventing government is a slow, deliberate process. Take 
Superfund, for example. Business had pushed hard for meaningful reform of the burdensome 
program and at long last, in 1994, had a bill in committee that was acceptable, though not ideal. 
But conservative senators, sensing the probability of having a majority in Congress after the 
elections, defeated the compromise legislation, promising a &quot;better&quot; bill after the 
election. Business listened to its ideological friends and acted against its instinct for closure, 
deciding to wait for the &quot;better&quot; bill. Because business quickly adjusted to the 
changing political environment and acted against its natural instincts, it will likely see that 
&quot;better&quot; bill enacted some time this year.<p>
	Despite rhetorical victories and the perception that our ideological friends have taken over, many 
point out that the rollback theme has not substantively advanced either the conservative or 
business reform agendas. But should we realistically have expected to overhaul decades worth of 
bureaucratic growth overnight?. Insufficient strength in Congress, special interest tactics, and a 
demagogic White House have thwarted usso far.<p>
	The business and policy communities will  eventually see key components of their agendas 
enacted, however, if they make timely adjustments to strategy, focus on the most important 
goals, and a develop a keen awareness of changing legislative and poltical environments. From 
my perspective, we can have more success advancing the conservative agenda in 1996 if we 
learn to focus our energies on the most important goals by adapting more quickly and shrewdly 
to this volatile political environment, as business did with Superfund reform.<p>
	Management guru and author Tom Peters has said that even the best-run companies are only 18 
months from failure. In order to stay competitive, well-run companies gear their systems to 
anticipate changes in their environments and adjust plans accordingly. Policy making (or 
unmaking) is a complicated task worthy of the best thought and strategic planning. 
Conservatives need to sharpen their skills at anticipating changes in the debate, adjusting our 
marketing and message delivery, and building strategic coalitions. The movement may not have 
the luxury of 18 months to consolidate the revolutionfocus and closure are critical.<p>

Beware of Deploying U.S. Peacekeepers on the Golan Heights,

No. 1066, The Heritage Foundation</FONT>
<P>
Thomas Moore, Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and
Defense Studies at The Heritage Foundation, and James Phillips,
Heritage Senior Policy Analyst, warn against the possibility that
the Clinton Administration might bridge the peace negotiation
gap between Israel and Syria by offering U.S. peacekeeping forces
to monitor compliance with any agreement that might come about.
Moore and Phillips offer several reasons why such a deployment
of U.S. forces should not occur, among them:
<ol><li> the Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping
challenge than the existingU.S. peacekeeping mission on the Sinai Peninsula;
<li> terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops; 
<li> U.S.-Israel relations may be adversely affected;
<li> the cost to, and  drain on, U.S. forces.
</ol>
They call for Congress to press the Clinton Administration to rule out foreign aid
to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement and to maintain pressure on Syria
to halt its support of terrorism. Moore and Phillips conclude that Congress should
open debate on the Golan peacekeeping issue before it is presented with another
<I>fait accompli</I> like Haiti or Bosnia. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris

International Republican Institute
<P>
The Cuba Transition Commitee, chaired by Jeb Bush
and composed of 44 Cuban American and U.S.-Cuba policy experts,
has produced a resource guide that provides recommended initiatives
for a three phase process for a Cuban transition to democracy
and suggests what the U.S. might do to encourage such a transition.
The guide, which also lists 66 non-governmental organizations
and 37 foundations that could play a role in the process, will
be distributed to Cuban dissidents on the island, exiles in the
U.S. and abroad, U.S. government officials, and others. 90 pp.

<B>Unfunded Federal Mandates in Transportation: The
Case for Unilateral Devolution, <BR>
</B>by Tom McClintock
<P>
The Claremont Institute
<P>
Tom McClintock, Director, Economic and Regulatory
Affairs, at the Golden State Center for Policy Studies of the
Claremont Institute, illustrates the burden that unfunded federal
mandates have on the State of California.  McClintock suggests
that California might consider forgoing federal funds and not
be obligated to the mandates attached to them, pointing out that
while the federal assistance for programs is massive-so are the
costs of the mandates. McClintock argues that although the state
would forfeit revenues far beyond the unfunded cost of federal
mandates, there would be enormous savings from the more efficient
application of remaining revenues toward truly high-priority public
objectives. For example, McClintock concludes that if California
kicked the federal government out of state transportation policy,
it would lose $2.3 billion in federal funds. However, California
would save $1.9 billion in unnecessary mandated expenditures.
By recouping a portion of federal highway taxes, the missing $400,000
could be transferred from the federal government to the state
without an increase in the total tax burden. 12 pp. CONTACT: The

<B>Restructuring America's Water Industry: Comparing
Investor-Owned and Government-Owned Water Systems, </B>
by Kathy Neal, <BR>
Patrick Maloney, Jonas Marson &amp; Tamer Francis
</font><P>
Reason Foundation
<P>
The performance of investor-owned water companies
is compared with government-owned water companies in California
in order to gauge the potential benefits of restructuring the
industry. The study focuses on tax subsidization, the cost of
capital, water charges, operating costs, investment income, and
capital expenditures. Among the results of an analysis of the
data are: investor-owned water companies provide comparable water
services to consumers at the same price as government-owned water
companies even though they pay taxes and do not receive extra
income; government-owned water companies receive generous tax
subsidies that otherwise could be used to lower taxes or fund
other government projects with higher priorities; the net cost
of capital is higher for government-owned water companies than
for investor-owned water companies; investor-owned companies are
substantially more efficient in their operation than government-owned
water companies; and government-owned water companies receive
a substantial amount of non-operating income from excess cash
balances and investments. The authors conclude that the decision
to have government entities provide water to consumers should
be reconsidered, since investor-owned companies can provide this
same function at the same cost without subsidies or tax-exemptions.

Washington Institute Senior Research Fellow Elaine
Ramel Davis updates the status of regulatory reform in Washington
State. Davis summarizes the accomplishments of the Regulatory
Reform Act and compares them with the Institute's earlier recommendations.
Davis believes that the RRA was a good start to the process of
reducing the amount of government regulation in Washington state.
However she also illustrates that while the RRA &quot;slows the
flow&quot; of new and increasingly onerous state regulations,
more needs to be done to end overburdensome regulations. 5 pp.

enterprises  to the incentives of a sound legal system;<br><li>allowing
manufacturers to distribute information regarding off-label uses
of drugs, such as independent studies and journal articles;<br><li>
annual congressional scrutiny of the federal agency's enforcement
powers, as well as its processes and standards for determining

<B>Hazardous to our Health? FDA Regulation of Health
Care Products, </B>edited
by Robert Higgs
<P>
The Independent Institute


<P>
Robert Higgs, Research Director, The Independent
Institute, Ronald Hansen, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs
at the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration,
and  Paul Rubin, Professor of Economics at Emory University, examine
FDA's regulation of health care products. The book's introduction
and afterword place the activities of FDA into a larger perspective
by illustrating how the agency acquired its vast powers, how it
uses those powers, and what harm caused by FDA could be diminished
by abolishing the agency. Other chapters argue that FDA, largely
regarded as a scientific body devoted to protecting public health,
is in fact a highly politicized body, often harming the public
health. Another chapter focuses on the restrictions that FDA places
on the marketing of drugs. According to the authors, these advertising
restrictions assume that consumers should be treated as if they
are unsophisticated and easily misled, and that doctors are not
reliable judges of medicines. The authors conclude that the root
cause of the harm caused by FDA regulations arise from the enormous
discretion Congress has given the agency. 113 pp.  CONTACT: The

<B>The Truth About Income Inequality,</B>
<BR>
by John Hinderaker and Scott Johnson
<P>
Center for the American Experiment
<P>
John Hinderaker and Scott Johnson, attorneys in Minneapolis,
examine liberal claims that there is a widening income inequality
and a disappearing middle class in America. They illustrate that
these claims have been based, almost universally, on biased analyses
which manipulate and distort the underlying economic facts. Overall,
they conclude that basic economic data does not support the gloomy
picture promoted by liberals. Furthermore, Hinderaker and Johnson
write that the data shows that the last 25 years does not represent
an upward or downward trend for middle-and lower-income Americans.
The data also does not suggest that higher taxes, increased government
spending, or hyper-regulation of the economy will benefit middle-income
or lower-income citizens. 18 pp. CONTACT: Center for the American

<B>The Value of Fringe Benefits and Tenure in Wisconsin:
Public Versus Private, <BR>
</B>by Richard Cebula
<P>
Wisconsin Policy Research Institute
<P>
In this study, Richard Cebula, an economist at Georgia
Tech, examines the differentials in the levels of fringe benefits
provided to full-time workers between the public and private sectors
in Wisconsin. He also examines the value of tenure or its equivalent
in the Wisconsin public school system at the primary and secondary
levels. Cebula examines each major category of fringe benefits
and then all benefits combined, concluding that the overall fringe-benefit
value appears to be 36% higher in the public sector than in the
private sector. 16 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute,

<I>Heritage Lecture</I>
No. 552, The Heritage Foundation


<P>
Steve Hanke, Professor of Applied Economics at Johns
Hopkins University and an advisor to Argentina's Minister of Economy,
compares the currency policies of Mexico and Argentina. Argentina,
according to Hanke, appears to have committed itself to maintaining
a stable currency. Mexico's monetary policy, on the other hand,
is in disarray. Hanke points out that Mexicans have called for
a sound peso, but that politicians from the three major parties
and their technocrat advisors have not been able to agree on an
exchange rate policy. So far Argentina's currency reforms seem
to be working. Hanke lays out several specific areas where Mexico
can learn and benefit from Argentina's experience. 11 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>Why Colorado Should Drop out of Goals 2000, <BR>
</B>by Sheldon Richman
<P>
<I>Issue Paper</I>
No. 2-96, The Independence Institute

<P>
Sheldon Richman, Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute,
examines each of Goals 2000's &quot;goals.&quot; He finds that
each goal will lead to more intrusion by the federal government,
and ultimately to federal control of curriculum, teaching practices,
and even facilities. Although Goals 2000 supposedly has &quot;no
power,&quot; and purports to build upon existing local efforts
to improve education, Richman argues that achievement of its goals
will require a drastic expansion of federal control. Richman also
shows that non-compliance with &quot;voluntary&quot; Goals 2000
directives could lead to litigation by the federal government
against states and local school districts. Richman focuses his
attention on Colorado's experience with Goals 2000 and the ominous
trends that followed its entry into the program. He found that
local educators and elected boards are losing their freedom to
set agendas, teach in ways they find effective, and monitor their
own progress. Richman concludes that although Goals 2000 is supposed
to bring excellence to schools, in reality it enacts increased
federal intrusion into families, communities, local school boards,
and state legislatures. 17 pp. CONTACT: Independence Institute,

In this study, Lance Izumi, Senior Fellow in California

at the Pacific Research Institute, and Natalie Williams, Director
of Education Affairs at the Claremont Institute, examine the fine
print in Goals 2000 and look at how this program will affect California's
public education system. Izumi and Williams find that Goals 2000
threatens to dominate and control state and local school leaders
by concentrating decision making power with a few un-elected officials
in Washington. They conclude that Goals 2000 represents &quot;devolution
in retreat&quot; and a step backward, toward the centralization
of education authority and responsibility. 28 pp.  CONTACT: The

No. 138, Goldwater Institute

<P>
Tara Ellman, Education Consultant,
disputes some of the most widespread claims of those that oppose
school choice in this survey of participants in the Arizona School
Choice Trust (ASCT). ASCT is an organization that provides half-tuition
grants to low income parents who wish to send their children to
private schools. The survey found: low-income parents are willing
to subsidize the cost of their child's education; academics, not
religion, is the most frequently cited reason parents give for
choosing private schools; family structure  does not necessarily
dictate level of involvement in a child's education (about half
of the children participating in this program come from single
parent families); school choice programs do not result in &quot;white
flight&quot; (sixty-five percent of the participants are from
minority households); and school choice programs are not necessarily
expensive to administer (disbursement of funds for the ASCT is
done solely by volunteers, so that 100 percent of the money raised
can go to scholarships). 15 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute,

<B>Restoring School Board Options on <BR>
Contracting Out, </B>by
Myron Lieberman
<P>
<I>Briefings </I>No.
1995-48, The Claremont Institute


<P>
Myron Lieberman, Chairman of the Education Policy
Institute, examines the issue of &quot;contracting out&quot; or
&quot;competitive contracting&quot; concerning school boards'
decisions on how to provide certain school services. For example,
a school board might have to make a decision whether to hire school
bus drivers and buy school buses, or to make a contract with a
transportation company to transport its students to and from school.
Lieberman shows that school boards and school board organizations
are unprepared to deal with such decisions because there has been
a massive union effort to restrict or eliminate school board freedom
to contract services. He illustrates this point by outliningthe
efforts that the National Education Association, the American
Federation of Teachers and the AFL-CIO have put forth to prevent
school boards from using the option to contract out school services,
in an effort to protect their own self interests. Lieberman concludes
that school boards &quot;should make every effort to retain or
to expand their authority to utilize contracting out.&quot; 17

Burton Folsom, Senior Fellow in Economic Education

junior high or high school students; the other two are for fourth

today is that the textbooks used to teach Michigan history are
often times filled with distorted interpretations and omit important
historical events, figures or trends. He rates the textbooks from
one to four stars based on each text's clarity, organization,

<B>How to Dismantle the Interior Department, <BR>
</B>by Robert Nelson
<P>
Competitive Enterprise Institute
<P>
Robert Nelson, Senior Fellow in Environmental Studies
at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, proposes a radical reorganization
of the Interior Department and its functions, based on the following
four principles: 1) activities that can reasonably be carried
out in the private sector should be done privately; 2) activities
that mostly involve state and local concerns should be administered
by state and local governments; 3) the federal government should
limit its role to activities and concerns that involve major federal
interests and responsibilities; 4) administrative organization
at the federal level should place similar functions at the same
agency. According to Nelson, the result of applying these principles
would be the abolition of six of the ten current agencies located
within the Department of the Interior, and a sharp reduction in
the size of three others. Nelson estimates that the proposed reorganization
would save roughly $3.8 billion annually. 19 pp. CONTACT: Competitive

<B>The Smog-Reduction Road: Remote Sensing vs. The
Clean Air Act, </B>by
Daniel Klein <BR>

<P>
<I>Policy Analysis </I>No.
249, The Cato Institute
<P>
Daniel Klein, Assistant Professor of Economics at
the University of California at Irvine, and Pia Maria Koskenoja,
a doctoral student of transportation economics at UC Irvine, argue
that existing technology can make unpopular and burdensome vehicle
emission tests obsolete with no reduction in environmental protection.
Remote-sensing-mobile, roadside, emission sensing devices-would
prove more effective and less costly than current inspection-based
emission programs. Klein and Koskenoja point out that 20 percent
of cars on the road generate 88 percent of automobile air pollution,
and contend that current state inspection and maintenance programs
are inefficient in reducing emissions. Remote-sensing technology,
on the other hand can target the small percentage of polluting
motorists for citation by mail. The study, which is based on several
implementation plans of Los Angeles, notes that the costs of a
remote sensing system would be far less than current programs.
Klein and Koskenoja conclude by calling for amending the Clean
Air Act to allow localities to implement remote-sensing programs.

<B>The Misuse of Science in Environmental Management,
</B>by Hugh Ellsaesser
<P>
<I>Heartland Policy Study</I>
No. 70, The Heartland Institute
<P>
Hugh Ellsaesser, a retired scientist from the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, examines the problem of the misuse of science
when managing environmental problems. Ellsaesser illustrates such
misuse in the debates concerning air pollution, stratospheric
ozone, and global warming. Ellsaesser concludes that government
bureaucrats and small cliques of politically active scientists
are helping to implement public policies that are not based on
sound science, that impose huge financial costs on hundreds of
millions of people, and that may endanger the lives of billions
of people around the world. 31 pp. CONTACT: The Heartland Institute,

This issue includes a symposium on the issue of &quot;risk&quot;
in relation to how policy-makers interpret hazards in risk-assessment
in public policy issues. Participants in the symposium include:
Roger Bate, Director, IEA Environment Unit; John Adams, Reader
in Geography at University College, London; Fred Smith, President
of the Competitive Enterprise Institute; James Fanu, Medical Columnist
of <I>The Sunday Telegraph</I>; Niall Fraser, Director of Risk
&amp; Opportunity Intelligence Limited; and David Lascelles, Resources
Editor of the <I>Financial Times</I>. According to Bate, the papers
in this symposium cover enough areas of the subject of environmental
risk-from social anthropology to toxicology and climate science
to credit ratings-to give an assessment of the environment today.
Overall, the papers draw the conclusion that the public perception
of environmental hazards are distorted from the reality of the
hazards. 54 pp. CONTACT: Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord

<B>The State of Violent Crime in America</B>
<P>
The Council on Crime in America 
<P>
Despite a decline in crime rates in certain American
cities, according to this report the likelihood that Americans
will be victims of violent crime remains at an historic high.
The report illustrates a &quot;revolving door&quot; criminal justice
system in which one in three criminals are under the &quot;supervision&quot;
of the justice system when they commit their criminal act. It
is also shown that violent crime accounted for one-fourth of the
43.6 million criminal victimizations in America in 1993, and that
America potentially faces an explosion of juvenile crime that
will be more violent and random than anything Americans have experienced
to date. Within the next ten years the number of males aged 14-17
will increase by 23 percent, and according to the report, these
juveniles will be more crime prone than their predecessors; commit
more crimes with guns; and commit more crimes against strangers.

<B>Crime and Punishment in Texas: Update, <BR>
</B>by Morgan Reynolds
<P>
<I>Policy Report </I>No. 202, National Center <BR>
for Policy Analysis
<P>
According to this study by Morgan Reynolds, National
Center for Policy Analysis Senior Fellow, the reason behind the
sharp drop in the Texas crime rate is due to the increase in prisons
in which more criminals are serving more time. Reynolds points
out that the increased prison capacity in Texas means that criminals
imprisoned for serious crimes can now expect to be in jail for
a longer period of time. Reynolds finds that the overall rate
of crime in Texas has been cut by 30 percent since 1988, and compared
to 1991, the lower crime rate means that 1,140 fewer Texans will
be murdered in 1996 and 450,000 fewer serious crimes against persons
and property will be reported to police. Reynolds argues that
there is a direct link between expected punishment and the crime
rate. According to Reynolds, Texas can reduce crime even further
by continuing to raise expected punishment. 33 pp.  CONTACT: National

<B>Strengthening Volunteerism Through Wisconsin's
Welfare-Replacement Proposal: A Brief Examination of Time Dollars,

<P>
<I>Report</I>
Vol. 8, No. 10, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute
<P>
Michael Hartmann, Research Fellow at the Wisconsin
Policy Research Institute, examines the current welfare work-requirement
framework, including Wisconsin's new &quot;W-2&quot; welfare-replacement
program. He uses the ideas of  Edgar Cahn and Marvin Olasky, to
introduce the concept of volunteerism. Both Cahn and Olasky believe
that volunteerism is one of the keys to rebuilding the welfare
system and inner city decay. Hartmann concludes that Cahn's concept
of Time Dollars is something that should be used to help bring
people off of welfare rolls and into the workforce and that solutions
to social problems no longer revolve around traditional liberal
or conservative stances, but around new ideas. 35 pp.  CONTACT:

This paper examines the issue of no-fault divorce
laws in the state of Michigan. The study illustrates that although
children suffer in a divorce, the parents are no-less affected
by the breakup. According to the paper, studies have revealed
that divorced women and men suffer, to a significantly greater
degree than married persons, early death from cancer, cardiovascular
disease, strokes, pneumonia, hypertension, and suicide. The report
concludes that the divorce problem has its roots in both culture
and law, so finding solutions to the current divorce epidemic
needs to encompass both areas. 16 pp.  CONTACT: Michigan Family

<br>
<P>
Defenders of Property Rights has argued the case
of <I>Gayle Butcher v. Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals of
Highland Beach</I> before the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.
This appeal raises the issue of whether local government can,
through zoning reclassification, deprive an owner of the use of
a lot to build a single-family home in a fully developed subdivision.
The Butchers and another family bought adjoining lots, one with
a house and the other vacant but developable. The Butchers later
sold the developed parcel and assumed the undeveloped lot with
the intention of building a new home there. The city, however,
said that a zoning ordinance enacted after the lots were originally
purchased precluded them from building on the lot. A decision
is expected to be handed down from the court this Spring.<B>

The case filed by the Institute on behalf of Jon

as owners of &quot;public water wetlands&quot; overcame a big
hurdle on February 5, 1996. Interpreting a Minnesota statute that
appeared to give the public access to privately owned wetlands,
Anoka County District Judge Edward W. Bearse ruled that &quot;it
appears that the plaintiffs would be justified in posting their
land 'no trespassing' and/or 'no hunting,' in seeking the removal
and prosecution of any trespassers, and in actively enforcing
all of their rights as owners of private property.&quot; The judge
granted the defendant Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) motion
for summary judgement to dismiss the case, but on the grounds
that the DNR made concessions during the lawsuit that brought
the agency into agreement with the Bronczyks, thus eliminating
the controversy.<BR>

<B>National Right to Work Defends Against Compulsory Union Dues
for Politics</B>
<P>
After more than ten years of delay, the National
Labor Relations Board announced a key ruling in . <I>California
Saw and Knife </I>which undermines employees' legal protections
against the use of compulsory union dues for politics. The ruling
completes NLRB deliberation on over 100 charges filed by employees
against the International Association of Machinists (IAM). <BR>

<P>
The employees, some of whom initiated legal action
in October, 1985, objected to the union's use of their compulsory
union dues for politics and other activity unrelated to collective
bargaining. National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation attorneys
challenged IAM's forced unionism policy. Despite clear precedents
such as the Supreme Court's 1988 decision in <I>Communications
Workers v. Beck</I>, which allows employees to cut off the use
of their forced dues for activity unrelated to collective bargaining,
contract administration, and grievance adjustment, the NLRB developed
new legal standards governing employees in forced-unionism situations.
<BR>

<P>
Specifically, the NLRB ruled that IAM union officials'
annual &quot;notice&quot; in their internal propaganda magazine
was sufficient to satisfy an employee's right to have notice before
compulsory dues were extracted from a paycheck. In addition, the
Board held that the union can force workers to pay for activities
outside the workers' collective bargaining unit, in direct contradiction
to Supreme Court rulings in <I>Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Association</I>
and <I>Ellis v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship
Clerks</I>. <BR>

<B>Of Spanish Land Grants and Federal Government Takings</B>
<P>
SLF has appeared this month as <I>amicus curiae</I>
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a case
that combines unique historical perspective with potential landmark
legal significance. In <I>Beggerly v. United States</I>, the appellate
court will consider the question of the validity of a Spanish
land grant predating the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the U.S
Department of Interior's failure to disclose the existence of
the grant during its 20-year attempt to take the land in question
<BR>

<P>
Pursuant to 1971 congressional authorization to acquire
the land as a federal park, and the Department of Interior's subsequent
below-market price offer, the federal government filed suit in
1979, claiming that Mr. Beggerly's title to the land was void
because of the alleged absence of a valid patent. Over the next
ten years, Mr. Beggerly attempted to locate evidence of title
ownership, discovering at the National Archives an 1871 Spanish
land grant conveying the property to a private landowner filed
with the U.S. Land Commissioners in 1816. His appeal, based on
the recently discovered evidence of title, challenges the lower
court ruling that no such evidence existed, and that the federal
government therefore owed Mr. Beggerly nothing for his land. An
appellate decision is expected in early Fall.<BR>

a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision which held that public

<B>&quot;Official English&quot; Supported in Supreme Court</B>

WLF, joined by 21 Members of Congress, filed a brief asking the
Supreme Court to review the appeals court ruling in <I>Yniguez
v. Arizonans for Official English</I> that struck down Arizona's
&quot;official English&quot; law, which requires that the state
and local governments of Arizona must act in English. The law
contains exceptions allowing a government to act in a language
other than English to protect public health or safety, to protect
the rights of crime victims or criminal defendants, or to comply
with federal law, such as federal requirements that mandate bilingual
education. The appeals court held that the law was not justified
by the goal of encouraging unity and political stability, encouraging
a common language, and protecting public confidence in government
operations. WLF's brief before the Supreme Court argued that the
issue is of national significance and that states have the authority
to determine the language of government business.<BR>

<B>HUD Opposed in Attempt to Regulate Homeowner's Insurance</B>
<P>
In <I>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Cisneros</I>,
WLF filed a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development lacks the authority
to regulate homeowner's insurance under the fair Housing Act.
WLF noted that HUD's interpretation would undermine long-standing
and legitimate insurance practices, and force consumers to bear
higher costs, by exposing insurance companies to liability for
employing standards that are not intentionally discriminatory
but that have a disparate impact on minorities. For example, many
insurers refuse to insure a property for more than its market
value; a policy that disproportionately limits insurance availability
in low-income areas where the replacement value of a home is often
more than its market value. According to WLF's brief, Congress
never intended for federal regulators to intrude on this traditional
area of state regulation.<BR>

<P>
<B>Anti-Gang Loitering Law Defended</B>
<P>
On behalf of itself, Representatives Henry Hyde and
Philip Crane, and four Chicago neighborhood associations, WLF
urged the Supreme Court of Illinois to review a decision striking
down a Chicago ordinance that prohibits members of a criminal
street gang from loitering on city streets after being directed
to &quot;move on.&quot; The ordinance was adopted in response
to strong community pressure to reduce the presence of gang members
of city streets. WLF's brief rejected the defendants' arguments
that the ordinance is unconstitutional because it is overly vague,
violates the right to freedom of assembly, and criminalizes one's
status as a gang member.<BR>

philosophical sources. Applicants should possess an earned Ph.D.
in Philosophy, Theology, Economics or Social Thought, and have
a strong commitment to free-market ideas and Christian social
thought. The Center will pay all travel expenses, housing costs

<h3>February 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Environmental
Establishment: A Status Report</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>In 1996, Washington's environmental groups have reason
to congratulate themselves: they are large and influential &quot;inside-the-beltway&quot;
political organizations with very large budgets: 1994 revenues
for the Wilderness Society were over $15 million, National Audobon
Society-$36 million, Sierra Club-$43 million, National Wildlife
Federation<I>-</I>$101 million, Nature Conservancy-$307 million.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Despite setbacks in Congress, the environmental movement
remains a powerful force in American politics. The organizations
that lobby and litigate receive respectful hearings in the executive
branch, the courts and in the federal bureaucracy. Environmental
groups retain the power to frustrate industrial and commercial
development and slow economic growth. As author Marek Dowie notes,
&quot;It has become virtually impossible to build a dam, open
a landfill, fire up an incinerator, drill a deep injection well,
or store nuclear waste&quot; without prompting an environmentalist
objection.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>But environmental groups have seen their membership
levels stabilize or fall in the 1990s. Losing grassroots support,
they are diversifying their sources of revenue. Individual membership
dues and contributions have been supplemented by corporate and
foundation grants and by commercial sales. Increasingly, green
groups are also relying on government support.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Government funding has created a vicious circle:
Taxpayer dollars fund environmental groups that lobby government
for more programs that will fund more enviromental groups with
taxpayer dollars. Consider some environmental advocacy groups
that received federal grants in 1993, as reported in the Federal
Assistance Awards Data System: The Enviromental Defense Fund received
$236,000 from the EPA to support a national print and television
advertising campaign to promote recycling. The ad series slogan:
&quot;Buy Recycled and Save.&quot; The National Audubon Society
was awarded $75,998 by the EPA to run source reduction public
service announcements on television; The Natural Resource Defense
Council recieved $75,000 from the Department of the Interior to
support its Clean Water television and print advertising campaign,
which was timed to coincide with Congress's reauthorization of
the Clean Water Act; and The Nature Conservancy recieved $44,100
from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration
for a &quot;cooperative volunteer as outreach program&quot; to
build support for the proposed Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
Some of the funds were used to draft congressional testimony and
to pay for campaigns to block a local public referendum on whether
to establish the sanctuary.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Government legal fees and land sales are another
lucrative source of funds: Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund recently
was granted over $1 million in tax money to cover legal costs
for successful lawsuits it filed against the </FONT><font size=3>federal
government over management of public lands; and The Nature Conservancy
received over $476 million in 1993 from land sales to government
agencies. In past cases, lands have been sold at prices above
their appraised value. Such practices recently prompted property
rights activists in New York state to file a lawsuit against The
Nature Conservancy and the Adirondack Land Trust, charging that
both sold land to the state Department of Enviromental Conservation
at more than double its appraised value. </FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Federal law prohibits use of government funds for
lobbying. But money is fungible: when tax dollars go to nonprofit
enviromental groups; more private dollars can be shifted to lobbying.
Unfortunately, efforts to halt this practice were stalled in the
last session of Congress.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>The modern enviromental movement that has grown up
since Earth Day in 1970 has little in common with what it once
was. Groups of hunters and outdoors people once determined what
local conservation societies would do. Now Washington professionals
and full-time activists funded by government agencies and private
philanthropies set the agenda. Groups dedicated to<I> conservation
</I>and the wise use of natural resources have been replaced by
environmental groups dominated by an ideology of <I>preservation</I>.
And conservationists who saw themselves as stewards of both the
natural environment and builders of a modern industrial society
have given way to environmental activists who often disdain technology,
industrial organization, and private sector initiatives.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Still, the price of the movement's success has been
high and the likelihood of failure increases. One critic observed,
&quot;Most of these Washington organizations are paper-issue people.
They don't ask the grass roots, and they don't educate. They are
not accountable.&quot; Radical grassroots activists who are impatient
with Washington deal making are breaking away. Local property
owners are organizing their own groups to defend their rights
and fight harmful policies. Some in the media have grown skeptical
of environmentalist claims. And political candidates are running
and winning campaigns against evironmental extremism.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>An energetic advocacy for free market environmental
ideas offers the best answer to the bloated organizations and
failed polices of the current establishment. Americans want environmental
protection, but they also want a growing economy, secure property
rights, and a clear sense that they are in control of their lives.

<i>Land Rights: The 1990's Property Rights Rebellion</i><BR>
Edited by Bruce Yandle, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1995, 333 pp.
<HR>

<P>
&quot;Upon the sacredness of property, civilization itself depends.&quot; -- Andrew
Carnegie
<P>
 In <I>Land Rights:  The 1990s' Property Rights Rebellion</I>,
the authors remind us of the primary role of private property
in a democracy.  This nine essay collection describes how excessive
environmental regulation can infringe private property rights
and effectively violate the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that &quot;nor
shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot;
 In the first chapter, &quot;The Property Rights Movement:  How
It Began and Where It Is Headed,&quot; by Nancie G. Marzulla,
President of Defenders of Property Rights, the author presents
an interesting history of the modern property rights movement.
 Marzulla contends that the modern assault on private property
rights began in 1970 with two events:  the first celebration of
Earth Day and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.
 These two events helped spawn a regulatory nightmare for many
innocent property owners.  Marzulla recalls the story of a Florida
man, Ocie Mills, who was imprisoned for 21-months for dumping
sand on his <I>own</I> property.  The sand filled a wetland and
thereby violated the Clean Water Act -- even though a federal judge
later ruled that Mills' land was &quot;probably not&quot; a wetland
under the Act.
<P>
 Marzulla's most interesting point, however, is the following.
The property rights movement is not seeking less environmental
protection -- it merely asks that the few unfortunate landowners
who do lose their property to regulation will no longer be forced
to bear an unfair share of the burden.  Marzulla persuasively
argues that private property is not only not inconsistent with
environmental protection but can actually enhance respect for
the environment by avoiding the tragedy of the commons phenomena
that often accompanies public lands.

 In the essay, &quot;The Lucas Case and the Conflict over Property
Rights&quot; James R. Rinehart and Jeffrey J. Pompe explain how
an obscure developer became a poster child for the property rights
movement.  In 1986, David Lucas bought two oceanfront lots near
Charleston, S.C. for approximately $1 million.  At the time, there
were no regulations or laws that would have prevented Lucas from
building a single-family home on the property.  However, in 1988,
South Carolina passed the Beachfront Management Act.  The Act
created a new building setback line that completely prevented
Lucas from developing his property.  In sum, the Act, which did
not contain a grandfather clause, made the two lots worthless.
 Although the state did not officially seize title to Lucas' land,
like so many environmental regulations, it restricted the owner's
ability to use the land to such an extent as to constitute a &quot;taking&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment.  Finally, after four years of tortuous
litigation, $500,000 in legal fees, and an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Lucas won the case.  The state of South Carolina
was forced to buy the land for market value.  
<P>
 The Lucas case, the authors remind us, represents the key issue
in the environment movement.  When excessive government regulation
inflicts pain on some individuals while benefiting others, who
should bear the costs of the regulation?  The authors argue that
from an equitable perspective, a property owner like Lucas should
not be forced to bear the total cost of a regulation that benefits
everyone, even if the aggregate benefits exceed the property owner's
costs.  Ironically, when the state of South Carolina was forced
to buy Lucas' land, it was faced with a dilemma:  Either develop
the property and protect its expensive investment, or do not develop
property and own two worthless lots.  The state tried to force
the latter option on David Lucas.  Once it owned the property,
however, it hypocritically sold the lots to the highest bidder
for development-an option it denied David Lucas. 
<P>
 The book reminds readers of the importance of a Chief Executive
who is committed to balancing environmental protection with property
rights.  The authors recall how President Reagan appointed officials
who brought a cooperative, common sense attitude toward industry
and property owners.  In the authors view, Reagan officials such
as James Watt as Secretary of the Interior and Anne Gorsuch as
the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator maintained a
proper balance between environmental protection and property rights
that benefited all Americans.  The authors contrast the Reagan
Administration with the heavily regulatory and bureaucratic Bush
and Clinton Administrations.  For example, the book points out
that under Bush appointee William Reilly, the EPA broadened the
definition of &quot;navigable waters.&quot;  This regulatory change
redefined land that held water for only short periods of time
each year as &quot;wetlands&quot; -- doubling the land over which
the federal government exercises control from 100 to 200 million
acres.  This regulatory change vastly expanded the federal government's
control over private property under the Clean Water Act.

<font size=3>Heritage Policy Analyst John Hillen writes that NATO's
involvement in the peace operation in Bosnia is a clear signal
that the Atlantic Alliance has strayed far from its original mission
of preventing the domination of Europe by a hostile power. Hillen
argues that NATO should not reinvent itself to serve as a pan-European
alliance of collective security, and calls for a NATO Revitalization
Act to refocus the alliance and preserve American support for
the U.S. role in Europe. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The

<font size=3>This issue features a series of articles on the subject
of foreign policy in the '96 presidential race. The first, <I>The
U.S. Electoral Cycle since 1944</I> by David Eisenhower, argues
that U.S. foreign policy will not be a major issue in the 1996
presidential race. In <I>The Populist Revival and Foreign Affairs</I>
by A.J. Bacevich, it is argued that the political realignment
established in the 1994 elections, though not caused by foreign
policy issues, will have substantial implications for future American
diplomacy. Bacevich believes that a populist tide will oppose
a global agenda. In <I>Even Foreign Policy Is a Local Affair</I>,
author Patrick Lloyd Hatcher believes that foreign policy issues,
will indeed, play a large role in the 1996 campaign, as the free
trade/isolationism and downsizing/defense contracts issues will
be of interest to local constituencies. 52 pp.  CONTACT: Foreign

calls for Israel to give up U.S. aid so that it may establish
its economic independence. He argues that Israel's apparent economic
success is only a facade. The real story, according to Rabushka,
is that &quot;Israel is besieged by one economic crisis after
another: power failures, bankrupt kibbutzim, a perpetual housing
crisis, confiscatory taxation, trade restrictions, a massive trade
deficit in both goods and services, budget deficits, high interest
rates, one failed attempt after another at privatization, and
so on.&quot; Despite these chronic problems,  Rabushka notes that
Israel has been able to sustain unparalleled growth for one simple
reason, Israelis live off the money of others-totaling $9 billion
and equaling one-eighth of all goods and services that Israelis
consume. 8 pp. CONTACT: Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political

<P>
<font size=3>Allan Meltzer, Visiting Scholar at AEI, comments
on recent financial troubles in Mexico and reviews the chain of
events that have lead to Mexico's unstable economy. Despite positive
economic forecasts in 1994 with the approval of NAFTA, the year
ended with a damaged political structure, major devaluation of
the peso and an overall policy failure. According to Meltzer,
the major players in the tragic events in Mexico were high officials
in the Mexican and U.S. governments and the International Monetary
Fund. Meltzer outlines what Mexico should have done as well as
lessons to be learned from the events of 1994-1995. He concludes
that the role of governments and international agencies in international
finance should be reduced. &quot;Governments that know they must
bear the consequences of their mistaken policies will be more
inclined to moderate those policies.&quot;  6 pp.  CONTACT: American

<font size=3>The Consumer Federation of America issued a report
in October that claimed that the telecommunications bills in Congress
would cost American consumers billions of dollars. According to
Wayne Leighton, Regulatory Economist at Citizens for a Sound Economy,
this analysis is faulty and based on a misunderstanding of the
legislation and the effects of regulatory reform in telecommunications.
Leighton argues that deregulation and competition would save consumers
money, while overall efficiency gains could total $30 billion.

<font size=3>The American Legislative Exchange Council proposes
four principles for free market reform in telecommunications 
that should be adapted by each state to fit its own unique statutes,
circumstances and time frames: 1) competition, not regulation,
should shape the telecommunications industry; 2) where regulation
is necessary, it should be competitively neutral and equally applied
to all providers; 3) universal service should be preserved; and
4) all providers should be permitted to compete in all markets.
ALEC belivieves that these four principles are a way to ensure
that consumers get the greatest benefit from telecommunications
innovations by encouraging competition and opening markets. 8

<P>
<font size=3>This study looks at the strategy employed by labor
unions known as a &quot;corporate campaign.&quot; Capital Research
Center Senior Fellow Thomas DiLorenzo illustrates how a &quot;corporate
campaign&quot; organized by a group calling itself Consumers United
with Employees (CUE) was really a public relations ploy against
Food Lion backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).
 A tactic used by CUE to smear the reputation of Food Lion was
to use headline grabbing press releases that claimed that a &quot;study&quot;
of Food Lion had &quot;discovered&quot; instances of health violations
within the chain. The reports attempted to mislead the media by
only citing Food Lion errors-some legitimate, some questionable-while
omitting the fact that other grocery chains have similar lapses
in procedures. DiLorenzo writes that the tactics used by the UFCW
do not help the consumer as they claim, instead, they cause the
price of groceries to climb by running the low-price, non-union
chains out of business. 8 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center,

<font size=3>Richard Vedder, John M. Olin Visiting Professor of
Labor Economics at CSAB, and Lowell Gallaway, Distinguished Professor
of Economics at Ohio University, illustrate the racial implications
of the Davis-Bacon Act (which requires contractors of federally
funded projects to pay union scale, or &quot;prevailing&quot;
wages). Vedder and Galloway write that the bill was originally
crafted to protect northern white labor against cheaper black
labor from other regions. In addition, they suggest that the legislation
was not race-neutral in its impact, and very likely has caused
a lack of minority participation in the construction industry.
Vedder and Gallaway give a full historical background on the enactment
of the legislation, including the fact that in the two decades
before the passage of Davis-Bacon there was a significant  growth
in the number of black employees outside the South in major construction
crafts. The study concludes that Davis-Bacon, like other minimum
wage laws, has increased unemployment for all groups; but its
negative impact has affected black construction workers disproportionately.

<P>
<font size=3>In the state of Michigan, the worker's compensation
system was developed as a way for workers who suffer on-the-job
physical injuries to be quickly and fairly compensated for medical
costs and lost income. In recent years, however, an ambiguous
new area of law has developed under workman's compensation that
allows workers to claim injuries due to alleged on-the-job mental
stress. This has lead to complications in Michigan as how to judge
properly whether a claimant is worthy of compensation. This report
illustrates how the worker's compensation system works, its problems
with claims for mental stress injuries, the history of case and
statutory law regarding mental stress, and where the issue stands
today after a crucial 1994 Michigan Supreme Court decision. 36

<P>
<font size=3>Robert Poole, President of the Reason Foundation,
argues that cities could save millions of dollars and improve
response times to 911 emergency calls by privatizing Emergency
Medical Service. In Los Angeles alone, the cost to the taxpayer
for these services is $45.6 million a year. Reason estimates that
contracting with a private provider for certain EMS/paramedic
services would reduce the cost to taxpayers by two-thirds. Poole
concludes that cities and counties should reorganize their EMS
systems by creating a public-private partnership in which the
fire department provides first response service and private ambulance
firms provide all paramedic treatment and transport for all 911
medical calls. The results, according to Poole, would be reduction
of cost to the taxpayer, greater accountability, and quicker response
times. 18 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S. Sepulveda Blvd.,

<P>
<font size=3>This report is the transcript of testimony given
to the Senate Budget Committee by Reason Foundation President
Robert Poole. In his testimony, Poole advocates two forms of privatization
for the federal government, asset divestiture and infrastructure
partnerships. Poole illustrates how such federal enterprises as
the U.S. Postal Service and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
can be privatized, and lists federal assets, such as commodity
lands, defense reserves, the strategic petroleum reserve, and
government buildings and land that could be utilized better under
private ownership. Poole also discusses the subject of infrastructure
partnership and how the federal government can promote private
ownership and operation of infrastructure. He concludes his testimony
with five general principles for privatization and summarizes
the issues associated with implementing a privatization agenda.

<P>
<font size=3>Progressive intellectuals, according to trade attorney
Brink Lindsey, corrupted capitalism by convincing Americans that
bigger is best for labor, business, and government. However, Lindsay
argues that the triumvirate of Big Government, Big Business, and
Big Labor is collapsing. Big Labor has seen this change first,
as unionization of the private sector labor force decline from
36 percent in 1953 to only 11 percent today. Meanwhile, large
American corporations, argued to be immune from market forces
by intellectuals in the 1960s, have been &quot;restructured&quot;
or &quot;reengineered&quot; in the form of middle-management layoffs.
Now, writes Lindsey, it is Big Government's turn. 10 pp. CONTACT:

the effects, fiscal and economic, of eliminating the tax relief
elements of the congressional Balanced Budget Act. They found
the following: the congressional plan vetoed by the President
would add $112 billion more to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over
the next seven years than the same plan would without tax cuts;
furthermore, the cuts in taxes on capital (including the capital
gains tax cut) accounts for $66 billion of this additional GDP
and leads to a stronger economy in the long run. This report also
details the benefits of reducing taxes on family income. 5 pp.

<font size=3>Citizens for a Sound Economy Analyst Rebbeca Schaefer
argues that a flat tax would not negatively affect the housing
market. While real estate lobbyists claim that the housing market
would be hurt by a  flat tax because it eliminates the mortgage
interest deduction, Schaefer illustrates that families and individuals
do not buy homes because of the tax incentive of a mortgage interest
deduction. Instead, people buy homes for many other reasons: to
relocate, to have more living space, to downsize living space,
to find a better community, etc. Schaefer presents economic evidence
suggesting that a flat tax would bring a drop in mortgage interest
rates by at least 2 percentage points, more than compensating
for the loss of the interest deduction. 8 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens

<font size=3>Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at the
Hudson Institute, argues that economic progress is affected by
incentives, among the strongest being marginal tax rates on capital
and the way policy treats consumption and savings. Reynolds writes
that high, progressive taxes suppress capital formation, increase
inequality, and reduce real tax receipts. He calls for an increase
in the incentives to save and invest, with time and money, in
education and training. A low flat tax, according to Reynolds,
would increase the economy's stock of economic and human capital,
which would enlarge national wealth, decrease economic inequality,
and increase tax revenues. 12 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute,

of administration, cost-overrun reserves, social services, and
subsidies to bankrupt firms. He warns against the type of growth
that Israel had between 1993 and 1995, which according to Klein,
was due to excess consumption-driven largely by the government's
ever-increasing budgets. The results of this increase in government
spending has been a large trade deficit and foreign debt, high
inflation, and declining productivity, savings and competitiveness.

<P>
<font size=3>In this article, New York University Professor Lawrence
Mead examines why Wisconsin's welfare caseload declined 26% since
reforms and new programs were enacted in 1987. According to state
figures, welfare in the average Wisconsin county fell 42%, while
some small counties recorded decreases of as much as 66%. Mead
found that the decline in welfare recipients was due less to Wisconsin's
now thriving economy and more to the priority that reforms placed
on self reliance. Furthermore, Mead writes that Governor Thompson's
conservative, but not necessarily anti-government, policy was
successful in changing the attitudes of most welfare personnel.
Indeed, most welfare officials, according to Mead, appreciated
that the Governor challenged them with the responsibility of getting
recipients to work, rather than just handing out aid. 8 pp.  CONTACT:

Kopel and Richman point out that early proponents of compulsory

bad influence on children, particularly children of working-class
and immigrant families. Most people, according to Kopel and Richman,
are unaware that the compulsory education system was designed
to save children from the bad influence of their parents. The
paper shows that education in the days before government compulsion
produced high rates of literacy. Kopel and Richman point out problems
with compulsory schooling and how it harms education, as well
as dealing with the issue of irresponsible parents. 16 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
<font size=3>Unintended consequences of environmental laws, especially
the federal Superfund law, has led to the proliferation of so-called
brownfield sites in American cities. Brownfield sites are &quot;abandoned
or vacant commercial and industrial properties suspected of containing
at least low levels of environmental contamination.&quot; Such
sites have lost potential developers to fears that a consequence
of owning and cleaning up a site will be state or federal liability
and regulation. Therefore, &quot;lenders will not lend, developers
will not develop, and buyers will not buy.&quot; Citizens for
a Sound Economy Policy Analyst Michael Harrold calls for Superfund's
liability and cleanup standards to be fundamentally reformed.
Until then, concludes Harrold, neither the states and EPA, nor
developers and lenders, will have the assurances or authority

<font size=3>Despite vast improvements in air quality since the
1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, this paper reports that environmentalists
and the American Lung Association are quietly pressuring EPA to
establish a new standard for measuring safe levels of ozone<I>-</I>one
that will be more costly to meet, but may produce little, or no,
meaningful health benefits. Authors Kenneth Chilton, Director
of the Center, and Christopher Boerner, CSAB Fellow, note that
people are already frustrated under the current policy. Programs
such as centralized vehicle inspection and maintenance will increase
the hassle to drivers but may not be an improvement over existing
decentralized programs. Ozone requirements increase costs to individuals
via higher prices and taxes, and impact small businesses more
than large firms. Chilton and Boerner recommend that Congress
revisit the Clean Air Act and allow cost and benefits to be considered
in setting the ozone standard. They conclude: &quot;Unless chronic
effects of prolonged exposures to elevated ozone can be demonstrated
(and after two-and-a-half decades of research, they have not been),
the United States is already spending more taxpayer and consumer
dollars on reducing ozone than the public considers worthwhile.&quot;

<P>
<font size=3>Patrick Fagan, William H.G. FitzGerald Fellow at
Heritage, has found that nearly every major study on the impact
of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social
problems. He gives evidence that religious practice strengthens
the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people
move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal
moral judgement; and inoculates individuals against such social
problems as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime
and divorce. According to Fagan, Washington policy-makers should
consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving
America's major social problems. Fagan offers several steps that
Congress and the President can take to encourage religious practice,
including: the initiation of a national discussion on the need
to restore the role of religion in American life; passage of a
resolution affirming the census data on the extent of religious
practice; and the appointment of judges who are at least more
sensitive to the role of religion in public life. 29 pp.  CONTACT:

<font size=3>The Foundation for Florida's Future, as its first

the concerns and opinions of African-Americans in Florida. According
to the report, the ultimate intention of the survey was to take
the first step in the process of building bridges between whites
and blacks. The survey had three major findings: 1) to date, conservatives
have failed to communicate their message to the black community;
2) the political labels of &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot;
are meaningless in the dialogue, because action is what counts;
and 3) language and perception account for most differences, while
position on most issues are similar. 20 pp. CONTACT: Foundation

<font size=3>Former Ohio State Solicitor Richard Cordray describes
the Supreme Court's role in the uniquely American system of federalism.
He writes that the Supreme Court has been a reluctant and relatively
ineffective umpire on the issue of the allocation of political
power concerning federalism, commenting that it is itself an arm
of the federal government</FONT><I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">-</FONT></I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">so
state officials should not rely too heavily on the Court as the
ultimate guardian of state interests. Those interested in reviving

reconsider whether institutional changes could be made to strengthen
the authority of the states and establish a more balanced partnership
with the federal government. 23 pp. CONTACT: Council of State

<font size=3>Philip Burgess, President of the Center for the New

1) the recent American experience with federalism; 2) the forces
at work reviving federalism; and 3) a potential framework for
considering ideas about where the federalsim debate should go
from here. He concludes by writing that restoring federalism requires
at least major legislation, if not a constitutional amendment
to restore power and relationships destroyed by the seventeenth
amendment, which removed state legislatures' authority to elect
U.S. Senators. Burgess warns that whatever approach is taken,
the pursuit of principle-centered remedies and not quick fixes
is key. 10 pp.  CONTACT: Council of State Governments, 444 North

<font size=3>Roger Pilon, Director of the Center for Constitutioanl
Studies at the Cato Institute, argues that it is time to start
returning power to the states and the people, to relimit federal
power in fundamental law, and to restore constitutional government.
Pilon recommends that Congress take the following actions to achieve
this end: 1) declare that the Constitution remains a document
of limited federal powers; 2) declare that most of what the federal
government does today is done without constitutional authority;
3) identify the precise constitutional authority for doing so
before enacting any new legislation; 4) restore the Commerce Clause
to its original purpose; 5) restore the General Welfare Clause
to its original purpose; 6) restore the Necessary and Proper clause
to its orignal purpose; and 7)  restore those provisions of the
Bill of Rights and the Civil War Amendments that have fallen into
disregard-privileges and immunities, property rights, and economic
liberties. 24 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">In the 1993 book <I>Suedosclerosis</I>,
The Swedish economists Ingemar St&aring;hl and Kurt Wickman discuss
the factors that have contributed to the crisis in the Swedish
economy and introduce the terms &quot;relative price shock&quot;
and &quot;relative interest shock.&quot; In 1994's <I>Suedosclerosis
II</I>, St&aring;hl and Wickman argue that the Swedish crisis
is deeper and the adjustments slower than in comparable countries.
They conclude that political responsibility must be transfered
from the public sector to the private sector, and fundamental
changes in the welfare systems are necessary in order to abolish
the politics of high taxation. This particular publication contains

<B>Senators Challenge Executive Order</B>

Clinton's Executive Order that bars federal agencies from doing
business with companies which hire permanent striker replacements.
Through the brief, the two  Senators take the position that the
Executive Order violates the principle of separation of powers
in that the question of striker replacements involves labor policy
which is the prerogative of Congress to establish. In fact, Congress
years ago established such a policy in the National Labor Relations
Act in an effort to counter-balance the power of the labor unions
to call strikes. <BR>

<B>CIR Sues University for Speech Violation</B>

<font size=3>The Center and co-counsels, representing the Florida
ACLU and the Southeastern Legal Foundation, are representing Gerald
Gee, a professor at Florida A&amp;M University who was suspended
without pay for an in-class remark allegedly constituting discrimination
and harassment. In illustrating a point, the professor used the
term &quot;nigger&quot; although he did not direct the term at
any individual. At issue in this case is whether Gee's remark
to his students is protected under the scope of academic freedom.
After CIR brought a lawsuit in early 1995, asserting claims under
both the Equal Protection and Free Speech clauses of the U.S.
Constitution, and sought a preliminary injunction revoking the
suspension, Florida A&amp;M agreed to rescind the remaining portions
of Gee's suspension. Professor Gee's claims for damages and further
injunctive relief are pending before the district court.<BR>

This summer, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the

Court of Appeals held that the case should go to trial since the
pay raise was justified by a &quot;salary equity test&quot; that
failed to take into account such critical factors as teaching
performance, publications, and service to the community. However,

<B>Defenders Seeks to Protect Landowners</B>
<P>
<font size=3>For over a hundred years, the boundaries for some
parcels of land owned in Kamiah, Idaho have been established and
respected. Yet, it turns out that the title descriptions in their
deeds do not reflect these boundaries. At the turn of the century,
a county surveyor believed the original title descriptions to
be erroneous. Based solely on his affidavit-and without conducting
an on-the-ground survey-the U.S. patent office unilaterally amended
the title descriptions in 1901. The property involved in this
dispute, however, has recently become highly desirable for development.
Moreover, it was once part of the Nez Perce Indian Reservation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Last December, Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA) issued Trespass Notices to eight Idaho residents.
Many more stand to lose the land which they have maintained and
paid taxes on for a half century, for the heirs to the original
members of the Nez Perce Tribe are claiming that the error in
the fee patent means that they own the land-not the people (and
their predecessors on interest) who have owned it since 1953.
BIA agrees and is intervening on behalf of the Indian heirs, asserting
that the present owners are trespassing on Indian land.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">If BIA succeeds in removing
the current occupants, the Indians whose interests the government
claims to represent will not retain title. The land has already
been sold to a developer. If BIA does not remove the current owners,
however, the Indian Law unit of the Legal Services Corporation-which
is representing the Indians free of charge-will sue BIA for failure
to protect the Indian heirs' rights.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Defenders is asking Interior
Secretary Babbitt to exercise his discretion to amend the patents
to reflect the original and accurate 1873 descriptions, and the
actual use by all owners for an entire century.<BR>

<B>Defenders Attempts to Stop <BR>
Wetlands Witch Hunt</B>
<P>
<font size=3>Defenders has filed a brief <I>amicus curiae</I>
on behalf of itself and two dozen grassroots property rights organizations
asking the U.S. District Court of Maryland to dismiss criminal
charges against James L.Wilson and his company, Interstate General.
This case bears a remarkable resemblance to the criminal prosecution
of Bill Ellen, a wetlands consultant who spent six months in a
federal penitentiary in 1992 for filling wetlands without a permit.
Now, the same prosecutor is gunning for Mr. Wilson. Defenders
is working with the defendant's private criminal counsel to have
the prosecution thrown out on a variety of grounds. Defenders
argued that the criminal charges brought for the filling of isolated
wetlands in this case are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.

Inc. v. City of Burlington, Iowa</I>, arguing that a five-year
amortization period does not constitute &quot;just compensation&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment for the taking of private property.
At issue in this case is a 1988 city ordinance that outlawed the
construction of billboards within city limits. The city did not,
however, actually require Outdoor Graphics to take down its signs
until 1993. That grace (or &quot;amortization&quot;) period, the
city asserts, was the property owner's &quot;just compensation&quot;
for the destruction of the company's business.<BR>

<B>IJ Takes on Government Assault of Sanctity of the Home and

<font size=3>The Institute for Justice has filed a lawsuit against
the Village of Park Forest (a suburb of Chicago), for allowing,
under its housing code, government inspectors to conduct warrantless
searches of single-family rental homes without tenant consent
or notice. The suit was filed on behalf of several Park Forest
tenants seeking to vindicate their private property rights under
the Fourth Amendment. The resulting decision from the case could
set a national precedent to bolster protection for the right of
property owners to exclude outsiders from their property. Government
inspectors, wishing to enter a tenant's home, will need to ask
for and receive either the explicit consent of tenants or, if
consent is denied, a search warrant based on some reasonable belief
that the housing code is being violated.<BR>

The program provides, among other features, vouchers of approximately
$2,250 for about 1,500 low-income children in grades K-3 to attend
private schools. The program has attracted more than 50 schools
and 6,550 applicants-1,500 of whom were selected through a lottery
system. The lawsuit, styled <I>Gatton v. Goff</I>, challenges
the program on state and federal constitutional grounds. The primary
focus is establishment of religion. The Institute worked closely

<B>Federal Circuit to Rehear <I>Preseault</I> Case</B>
<P>
<font size=3>In an unusual action, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit has vacated and will now rehear the <I>Preseault</I>
case. This overturns a recent decision by two judges of that court
who had held that Paul and Patricia Preseault had no remedy for
the United States' action in converting an abandoned railroad
right of way across their land into a heavily traveled public
recreational trail. The now-vacated decision had severely undercut
landowners' rights to seek compensation from the federal government
for &quot;taking&quot; their property. The court held that a party
was required to sue the government immediately after passage of
any law that &quot;foreshadowed&quot; a future taking. In the
Preseaults'<I> </I>case, that meant that they would have had to
sue in 1920, 60 years before the trail was even built. The new
decision breaths life back into over a dozen takings cases which
are following in the Preseaults' tracks. It is a major setback
for the government's effort to obtain rights over private land
without having to pay for those rights.</FONT>

<P>
<font size=3>NELF will file a friend of the court brief for the
Connecticut Business and Industry Association in support of Yankee
Gas System's appeal of a decision ordering it to pay unemployment
benefits to striking workers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The case involves a 1992 labor
dispute. Yankee offered workers a small raise and reserved the
right to change its medical insurance program in the future in
a manner the workers opposed. Negotiations broke down and workers
went on strike. During the strike the company kept operating,
using managers and some replacement workers. Three months later
the strike ended and the workers returned.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">A state agency has now characterized
the strike as a &quot;lockout&quot; and ordered Yankee to pay
unemployment benefits for the duration of the strike. The agency
found that the company's final offer was inferior to the prior
contract under which the workers were willing to keep working.
Both points are dubious. The new contract offered a modest raise
as well as the health insurance change, Furthermore, the agreement
to keep working was illusory since Yankee's workers reserved the
right to strike at any time they found more tactically convenient.
NELF's brief will focus on the decision's impact in shifting the
balance in labor disputes toward labor.<BR>

<B>NELF Represents Maine Oil Dealer</B>
<P>
<font size=3>NELF will represent Conrad Thibeault, a Maine fuel
dealer who voluntarily cleaned up some spilled oil on his property
and now is being made to pay for his good deed. When he discovered
the spill, Mr. Thibeault notified the state Departmnet of Enviromental
Protection, negotiated a cleanup plan and then actually cleaned
up the site. Only then did DEP tell Mr. Thibeault that it would
not reimburse him for 70% of the cleanup costs which it now felt
had gone to improving the property as well as cleaning it up.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Maine has an Oil Clean-up
Fund which is derived from fees paid by oil dealers like Mr. Thibeault.
The Fund was created to reimburse people for &quot;any expenses
involved&quot; in oil spill cleanups. The law contains not a word
about denying reimbursement if a cleanup also has the incidental
benefit of improving the property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">NELF will appeal Mr. Thibeault's
case to the Fund Insurance Review Board and argue that when the
state approves the details of particular cleanup plans, it cannot
later renege and refuse to reimburse a person who in good faith

is shortsighted. It is not only unfair, but counterproductive.

<B>NELF to Support Punitive Damages Appeal</B>
<P>
<font size=3>For decades it has been a common practice in the
telephone industry for field workers to carry their lunches to
the job site. Workers were given 30 minutes to eat lunch on the
site, but were not paid for that time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The U.S. Labor Department
sued Southern New England Telecommunications, a Connecticut phone
company, claiming that its failure to pay workers for lunch breaks
violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. A federal judge agreed
and ordered the company to end the practice and to pay workers
over $4 million in back pay and overtime. The judge also held
that the violation was &quot;willful&quot; and therefore he doubled
the amount of damages to $9 million as a penalty<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">NELF will file an <I>amicus</I>
brief opposing the punitive double damages. The policy of not
providing paid lunches may not have been consistent with federal
law, but in light of the universal, decades-long practice in the
industry it cannot reasonably have been a &quot;willful&quot;
violation of the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York will
hear the case.<BR>

<B>Washington Supreme Court Gives Lip Service to Landowner's Rights</B>
<P>
<font size=3>Despite the U.S. Supreme Court's unequivocal ruling
last June in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, a Washington property
owner was unable to receive the benefits of that landmark decision
when the Washington Supreme Court applied <I>Dolan</I> in such
a manner as to render the precedent-setting decision meaningless.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Douglas County, Washington,
approved a 16-lot residential subdivision on the condition that
the owner dedicate various strips of land for future road widening.
Relying on the <I>Dolan </I>decision, the Court of Appeals found
the exaction to be an unconstitutional taking, since there was
no showing that the new homes would create any need to widen the
roads. The Washington Supreme Court thought otherwise.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Under <I>Dolan</I>, when government
requires the dedication of land in exchange for a permit, it must
<I>prove</I> that the particular land dedication at issue is &quot;roughly
proportional&quot; to any harm caused by the project being permitted.
Government has the burden of proof and must make an &quot;individualized
determination that the required dedication is related both in
nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">This case presented the first
opportunity for the Washington Supreme Court to consider this
&quot;rough proportionality&quot; test established in <I>Dolan</I>
and the type of information that is sufficient to justify an exaction
of land in return for a building permit. Unfortunately, the Washington
Supreme Court did not require any calculations of proportionality.
It simply upheld the land exactions based on the general increase
in traffic attributable to the development.<BR>

<I><font size=3>Ehrlich V. City of Culver City</FONT></I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">.
Since 1992, PLF has been supporting Richard Ehrlich as <I>amicus
curia</I>e to help invalidate &quot;mitigation&quot; fees imposed
on him as a condition for receiving a permit to construct a housing
development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">A ruling in favor of Mr. Ehrlich
could substantially limit local government's exactions of so-called
&quot;mitigation&quot; or &quot;linkage&quot; fees from private
development to finance unrelated public programs. PLF is striving
to achieve a ruling that conforms to the U.S. Supreme Court's
landmark decision in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">For several years, Mr. Ehrlich
operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial
success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most
of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a townhouse
condominium project on the property. The City Council approved
the project on condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which
the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis
courts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">PLF contends that the fee
is unconstitutional because it fails the rough proportionality
test laid down in the <I>Dolan</I> case.  The <I>Ehrlich</I> case
differs in that the property owner is being asked to come up with
cash instead of land.<BR>

against the Chelmsford, MA, School Committee and Hot, Sexy and

</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The suit stems from two performances
given at Chelmsford High School in 1992 by Suzanne Landolphi of
Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions. Landolphi performed sexually
suggestive skits and gave sexually explicit monologues to students
in the ninth through twelfth grade. Landolphi's performance discussed
breast and penis size and advocated oral sex, masturbation and
homosexual activity among minors. In spite of the performance's
shockingly graphic nature, the school did not warn parents in
advance or provide for students to &quot;opt out.&quot;<BR>

<B>National Attention Focuses on Parental Rights Lawsuit</B>
<P>
<font size=3>SLF is proceeding with its parental rights lawsuit
in <I>Earles v. Stephens County School District, et. al., </I>which
is currently before the U.S. District Court. Filed on behalf of
the parents of two teenage sisters, the lawsuit challenges the
constitutionality of the school administration's actions in transporting
the minor girls during school hours to a local public health clinic,
where the girls received HIV/AIDS tests, PAP smear tests, condoms,
and prescription birth control pills-all without parental consent
or notification. The parents have been denied access to the results
of the tests.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">National media attention has
focused on this case as a lightning rod for the parental rights
debate in this country. SLF attorneys testified before a joint
U.S. House and Senate committee, which is considering proposed
parental rights legislation, on the constitutional status of the
parental right to direct and control the education and upbringing
of children. SLF attorneys pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court
has established that parental rights are fundamental and, as such,
are entitled to the strongest legal protections against government
interference.<BR>

<B>Business Owner Liability Gets Helping Hand</B>
<P>
<font size=3>In a victory for Georgia businesses and property
owners, the Georgia Supreme Court overturned a state Court of
Appeals decision, which held that property owners were charged
with constructive knowledge of criminal acts previously committed
on their property as part of their duty of ordinary care. The
Court of Appeals decision had made businesses liable for every
criminal act committed on their property, whether reasonably foreseeable
or not.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">In <I>Sun Trust Banks v. Killebrew</I>,
SLF argued as <I>amicus curiae</I> that any relaxation of the
doctrine of ordinary care would exacerbate the plight of those
property owners and businesses who are least able to protect their
own property, let alone their patrons. The Georgia Supreme Court
agreed, pointing out that imposing a greater burden on business
owners by the government is an abdication of its &quot;paramount&quot;
constitutional duty to &quot;protect person and property.&quot;

<B>Challenge to State's Intangibles Tax</B>
<P>
<font size=3>SLF is representing a Georgia corporation in a lawsuit
challenging Georgia's imposition of a tax on out-of-state intangible
personal property, including stocks and bonds, owned by Georgia
residents. The state currently collects about $40 million annually
from the tax, which is distributed to counties.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">At issue is the extent to
which the state can exempt the taxation of stocks and bonds of
Georgia corporations while it continues to tax the stocks and
bonds of out-of-state corporations. The U.S. Supreme Court is
currently considering a challenge to a similar tax in North Carolina,
which legal analysts believe will succeed. SLF attorneys point
out that Georgia's tax is a more egregious violation of the Commerce
Clause of the U.S. Constitution than the North Carolina tax.

<B>New Jersey Welfare Reform Defended</B>
<P>
<font size=3>WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit supporting New Jersey's innovative welfare reform
program in <I>C.K. v. Shalala</I>, a suit brought by welfare recipients
who are represented by Legal Services of New Jersey, the ACLU
of New Jersey, and the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. Under
New Jersey's Aid to Families with Dependent Children system, a
single mother previously received an increase in her monthly cash
payment for each additional child born. New Jersey's reform program
eliminates the grant increase to mothers who have additional children
after joining the rolls. Seven AFDC recipients and their children
filed suit, alleging that the program violates the due process
and equal protection requirements of the United States and New
Jersey constitutions and that it violates federal statutes and
regulations governing AFDC, family planning services, and research
on human subjects. The case is before the Third Circuit following
the plaintiffs' appeal from their loss in the district court.

<B>EPA Sued Over Delinquent <BR>
Report to Congress</B>
<P>
<font size=3>On behalf of itself and nine Members of Congress,
WLF has sued the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to
provide Congress an economic analysis of the Clear Air Act. The
Clear Air Act of 1990 required the agency to file such a report
in November of 1991 and again in 1992 and 1994, but no report
has been filed-although businesses face civil and criminal penalties
if they fail to turn in timely reports to the EPA. The suit was
filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

supporting the state in its litigation over the constitutionality
of the federal &quot;motor voter&quot; law. In <I>Voting Rights
Coalition v. Wilson</I>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit had ruled against California's challenge to the law. In
its brief before the Supreme Court, WLF argues that the High Court
should hear the case and hold the statute unconstitutional.<BR>

Supreme Court Urged to Reject Discriminatory Enforcement Claim
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">WLF urged the U.S. Supreme
Court not to require prosecutors to explain themselves every time
the racial profile of those charged with a particular crime does
not match the racial profile of the population as a whole. In
a brief filed in <I>United States v. Armstrong</I>, WLF argued
that the Ninth Circuit had overstepped its authority in requiring
federal prosecutors to compile massive reports concerning its
crack cocaine enforcement efforts because blacks are disproportionately
charged with crack offenses. The Appeals Court had dismissed charges
against five defendants after the prosecutors refused to compile
the reports.<BR>

<h3>December/January 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>: 

<h4><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h4>
</center>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>, Vice President for Educational Affairs at The Heritage Foundation.<hr>
<p>
<I>Policy Review</I>, the magazine of The Heritage Foundation,
has a contemporary new look, a partial name change, and a historic
new mission: to restore the tradition of American citizenship
by repairing the institutions of civil society and returning to
the core political principles of our Founding Fathers.
<P>
Our new name is <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/toc75.html"><I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I></a>.
We'll be publishing six rather than four times a year. We will
focus on the institutions of civil society-families, communities,
voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations,
business enterprises, public and private schools, local governments-that
are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized,
bureaucratic government.
<P>
We think of our mission as &quot;Applied Tocqueville,&quot; in
honor of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French aristocrat who in 1832
wrote <I>Democracy in America</I>, still the best book about our
country ever published. Tocqueville described an America that
was the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most
prosperous, most charitable country on earth-with limited national
government and active citizen involvement in local government.
It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business
leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens
were better than politicians in addressing the problems of their
communities. <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>
will study the success stories of institutions and civic leaders
today who are carrying on this tradition.
<P>
We believe that the restoration of civil society is one of the
most important challenges and opportunities facing conservatism
over the next generation. Sixty years of liberalism have left
America's social fabric in tatters. The family, the building block
of a compassionate society, is collapsing. Crime is robbing America's
poor of hope and killing opportunity in vast sections of our cities.
Public education is preparing children neither for citizenship
in a free society nor for competition in a 21st-century economy.
<P>
Big Government is not the solution to these catastrophes. But
merely dismantling Big Government is not the answer, either. Conservatives
must rebuild families, voluntary associations, local governments,
and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills
left untreated by failed liberal programs. 
<P>
The return of political powers and responsibilities from Washington
to smaller units of government will not automatically bring this
about. Liberal ideas, interest groups, and bureaucratic structures
are even more entrenched in statehouses and city halls than in
the federal government. Nonprofit charities have been corrupted
by a heavy dependence on government money. Many leading charities
share the entitlement mentality of the welfare state and, as the
United Way and New Era scandals suggest, are often less accountable
than government.
<P>
Entirely new institutions will have to be created. Conservative
public policies can erase the welfare state's incentives for family
collapse, but they cannot put the family back together. Government
cannot build and sustain healthy marriages, nor teach children
to be hardworking, responsible, and virtuous. The family will
be restored not by public policy but by private, character-building
institutions that touch the souls of men and women and inspire
them to be more responsible husbands, wives, and parents. 
<P>
Lock-them-up policies in criminal justice are likewise necessary
but insufficient to address the catastrophe of crime. The root
cause of crime is spiritual, a hardening of the heart that makes
a man or woman indifferent to the rights of others. The most effective
institutions in criminal justice will therefore be those that
create moral communities and transform individual attitudes and
behaviors.
<P>
The second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century
saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs,
and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened
character and addressed the failings of their communities. America
is about to enter another such age, with conservatives at the
lead. <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>
will be at the forefront of this movement, chronicling its success
stories and describing its challenges and opportunities.

<i>Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution</i><br>
By Lee Edwards, Regnery Publishing 1995, 572 pp.<hr>

	Lee Edwards Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution is an insightful and important look at the man who is more responsible than any other for the growth and success of the conservative movement in America. This biography is all the more timely, given the conservative congressional sweep of November 1994. It portrays a Goldwater who is every bit as fiesty as legend tells, and quite a bit more complex.<P>
	Edwards, who was a veteran of the 1964 Goldwater campaign, provides a thorough examination of Goldwaters life, starting with his childhood and his days at Staunton Military Academy. Special attention, of course, is paid to Goldwaters career in the U.S. Senate, his Presidential campaign of 1964 (and the Draft Goldwater effort that drew him into it), his role in the making and unmaking of presidents from 1968 through 1976, and his more recent  pronouncements on social issues. <P>
	While Goldwater delivers a wealth of information, three particularly important and interesting points stand out. First, the reader is reminded that some things are so old that they seem new. The negative campaigning that journalists often decry today was pioneered by Lyndon Johnsons reelection campaignwith the tacit approval of the major media. Indeed, in three decades of presidential elections since 1964, no campaign of any party has matched Johnsons for sheer dishonesty, demagoguery, and meanness.  Edwards methodically reminds the reader of the infamous Daisy Girl advertisement, as well as the less-well-remembered but still devastating Ice Cream Girl and Social Security ads. Johnsons whole Anti-Campaign, complete with political espionage and possible misuse of the FBI, not only set a sad precedent for CREEP but almost certainly exceeded it in scope and (needless to say) efficiency.<P> 
	Edwards also reminds us that the savage and unwarranted attacks on Goldwater in the fall of 1964 were made more plausible by the drubbing he received at the hands of fellow Republicans during the nomination contest. While Edwards concedes that no Republican could have defeated Johnson in 1964 (a fact Edwards maintains was well understood by Goldwater himself throughout the campaign), he makes a powerful argument that the attacks of liberal Republicans like Rockefeller, Romney, and Scranton, helped turn a mere defeat into a landslide.<P>
	Second, Edwards thoughtfully illuminates the complexity of Barry Goldwater. Edwards argues that, far from being a recent phenomenon, Goldwater has always been torn between a traditionalist side and a libertarian side, the side that today surprises conservatives with exclamations of pro-choice and pro-gay sentiment. This split could be seen even in Goldwaters earliest political involvement: one of his first political acts was to urge the city of Phoenix to reject the evils of dog racing, yet one of his first votes after being elected to the Phoenix city council was to approve a liquor license for a supermarket 1200 feet from West Phoenix High School over the objections of local parents and religious leaders.    <P>
	Edwards argues that this complexity has been often intertwined with another factor: to Barry Goldwater, a personal connection often meant more than philosophical consistency. His lack of a deeply personal connection to Ronald Reagan, for example, may largely explain Goldwaters often-cool relationship with his heir as leader of the conservative movement. His recent stand on social issues may have been influenced not only by his latent libertarianism but by his daughters abortions and the homosexuality of a grandson and grandniece. Barry Goldwater is an intensely human figure, and the human relationships of day to day life have almost certainly affected his politics to a greater degree than most conservatives have understood.  <P>
	Finally, and most importantly, Edwards succeeds in reminding his readers of the unpayable debt that conservatives owe to Barry Goldwater, regardless of the meanderings of his latter years. Edwards catalogues a fraction of the multitude of individuals who began their political lives inspired by Barry Goldwater and who went on to carry forward the conservative cause. He imagines, plausibly, all the good that would not have happened without a Senator Barry Goldwater and a campaign of 1964, and imagines equally plausibly all the good that might have happened had he won. <P>  
	As Edwards shows, sometimes Goldwater himself was unaware of the potential impact of his actions: he did not anticipate how his 1957 Senate speech criticizing the Eisenhower budget would catapult him to leadership of the conservative movement, nor did he anticipate that Conscience of a Conservative would have any appreciable effect on the nations politics. At other times, especially in 1964, Goldwater understood well that he carried on his shoulders the aspirations of millions of freedom-loving Americans. Always, however, he made a difference. As Edwards concludes, Goldwaters 1964 presidential campaign marked the true beginning of a tectonic shift in American politics from East to West, from the cities to the suburbs, from big government to limited government, from containment to liberation, from liberal to conservative that continues to shape the nation, as the historic elections of 1994 attest.<P>

<B>Selected Foreign and Defense Policy Issues for the '96 Presidential
Campaign</B>, by Thomas Henriksen
<br>
<I>Briefing</I>, Pacific Research Institute

<P>
President Clinton has not only failed to craft a coherent international
mission for the United States, but he has also failed to resolve
a host of independent conflicts, according to Thomas Henriksen,
Senior Fellow &amp; Associate Director at the Hoover Institution.
This study surveys several foreign policy issues facing America
as it enters the 1996 national election campaign, including: the
proliferation of mass-destruction weapons; counter-terrorism;
the role of the United States in the new international order;
human rights; continuing trouble spots (e.g. North Korea &amp;
Bosnia); and defense cutbacks and pentagon reorganization. 22

<B>The Rising Threat of Revolutionary Islam <BR>
in Algeria</B>, by James Phillips 
<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1060, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
If the bloody civil war in Algeria is not halted, argues Heritage
Senior Policy Analyst James Phillips, the resulting political
chaos could destabilize the entire region. According to Phillips,
the only thing worse than the present situation would be victory
by Islamic radicals over the Algerian army. Such an outcome would
pose significant long-term threats to U.S. interests in North
Africa, the Middle East, and the Muslim world generally. Phillips
provides a history of Algeria's political breakdown and a view
of the current stalemate and grim future. He then points out how
a revolutionary Algeria would undermine U.S. interests and describes
a policy that he believes the Clinton administration should adopt.

<br>
<I>Heritage Lecture</I> No. 544, The Heritage Foundation

In a speech given at The Heritage Foundation, President &Aacute;rp&aacute;d
G&ouml;ncz asserted that Hungary must set off on the road to Euro-Atlantic
integration, including full-fledged membership in NATO and the
European Union. President G&ouml;ncz surveyed the history of his
country since the end of the Cold War, and concluded that Hungary's
speedy integration into a Euro-Atlantic alliance should continue
despite criticism that the change is occurring too fast.  The
President also stated that it is his country's responsibility
to avoid delays and &quot;to drop anchor as soon as possible,
and for good, in the safety of the developed democracies' haven.&quot;

<B>Holbrooke Horror: The U.S. Plan for Bosnia,  <BR>
</B>by Ted Galen Carpenter 
<br>
<I>Foreign Policy Briefing</I> No. 37, Cato Institute

<P>
Cato Institute's Director of Foreign Policy Studies, Ted Galen
Carpenter, contends that the Clinton administration foolishly
insists on maintaining the fiction of a united Bosnian state while
accepting a de facto ethnic partition.  Carpenter declares that
the inherent contradiction between those two objectives will doom
the peace agreement and pose a grave danger to the proposed U.S.-led
NATO peacekeeping force.  The author then lists specific problems
with <BR>
the peace plan and describes the multiple sources of danger  a
U.S.-led peacekeeping force will face. The paper concludes with
a recommended alternate plan of action advocating that the belligerents
themselves reach a durable agreement reflecting battlefield realities
and the balance of political and military forces.  Carpenter writes
that under no circumstances should the United States send troops
to enforce an inherently unworkable peace accord. 15 pp. CONTACT:

<B>How to Close Down the Department of Energy,</B> <BR>
by John Barry
<br>
<I>Backgrounder </I>No. 1061, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Heritage Foundation Research Assistant John Barry calls for shutting
down the Department of Energy (DOE) and outlines the Heritage
proposal to do so. Among the provisions of the plans are: selling
off DOE assets such as the Strategic and Naval Petroleum Reserves;
terminating unnecessary DOE programs, privatizing government owned
laboratories, and transferring all defense-related nuclear weapons
functions to a new agency within the Department of Defense. According
to Barry, closing down DOE and making the related reforms would
save American taxpayers more than $41 billion over the next five
years, including $16 billion in asset sales. 21 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>The Telecom Revolution: American Opportunity</B> 
<br>
The Progress and Freedom Foundation 

<P>
The United States should replace and modernize its existing telecommunications
regulatory policies, argue the authors of this comprehensive study.
The study notes that the telecommunications industry already constitutes
one-seventh of our economy and, by the early 21st century, the
global information industry is expected to be a $3 trillion market.
Furthermore, in 1995, one-half of all capital investment in America,
broadly defined, will be in computers and telecommunications equipment.
Despite these facts, the telecommunications industry must comply
with a  statutory and regulatory system erected in the 1930's.
The study outlines recommendations that, according to the authors,
would provide for a modern and effective government to complement
market forces, speeding the development of new products and services
for Americans. 111 pp.  CONTACT: The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,

<B>The Human Cost of Regulation: the Case of Medical Devices and
the FDA, </B>by David Murray
<br>
<I>Hudson Briefing Paper </I>No. 183, The Hudson Institute

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration's current system for approving
medical devices has been marred by regulatory snags that unnecessarily
delay the introduction of lifesaving and life-enhancing products
to the market, according to Hudson Research Analyst David Murray.
Meanwhile, the European Community's medical device approval system
allows new products that are no less safe than in the United States
to reach the market far more quickly. The author suggests that
the U. S. should adopt a system similar to that used by the European
Community for medical device approvals. Such a system would terminate
FDA's monopoly on the premarket approval of medical devices and
establish a mainly privatized process, based on a quality systems
approach to evaluation. 24 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman

<B>Regulatory Reform in the Electric <BR>
Power Industry,</B> by Vernon Smith
<br>
<I>Issues Analysis </I>No. 3, The Barry Goldwater Institute.

<P>
According to University of Arizona Professor Vernon L. Smith,
the public is finally challenging the notion that certain industries,
most specifically the electric power industry, are &quot;natural
monopolies.&quot; Smith looks at how various countries are seeking
to deregulate their electric power industries, and shows that
countries that only a few years ago were using a central planning
approach are now surpassing the United States in establishing
competitive electric power industries. The report concludes that
policy makers should begin thinking seriously about reforming
our approach to the electric power industry. 20 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>Dangerous Excesses: A Look at the Food <BR>
and Drug Administration, </B>by Jeffrey J. Pierce
<br>
<I>Issues Analysis </I>No. 13, Citizens for a Sound <BR>
Economy Foundation

<P>
Jeffrey Pierce, Regulatory Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy
Foundation, shows that the Food and Drug Administration-originally
designed to protect the health of U.S. consumers-has increasingly
become an obstacle to providing consumers with potentially life-saving
drugs and medical devices. Pierce notes that delays in approvals
by the agency are ballooning, as the new drug approval process
now takes some 13-15 years. At the same time, the agency has been
growing, with a budget nearing the billion dollar mark. Peirce
illustrates how FDA has dramatically enlarged its authority, and
cites several instances where it has dramatically delayed the
development of new medical devices and medicines. The paper also
shows that FDA has been expanding its limits on the speech of
pharmaceutical companies and food manufacturers. Pierce, concludes
with a comprehensive set of recommendations for improving FDA,
including: prioritizing functions, allowing private organizations
and laboratories to issue medical device approvals; and contracting
out testing to the private sector. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for

<B>The FDA vs. Recycling: Has Food Packaging Law Gone Too Far?</B>
<B>Part 1,</B> by Alexander Volokh
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 196, Reason Foundation

<P>
According Alexander Volokh, Assistant Policy Analyst at the Reason
Foundation, food packaging regulations enforced by the Food and
Drug Administration aimed at preventing contaminants from entering
our food may discourage the use of recycled materials. Volokh
writes that FDA operates under the assumption that all substances
diffuse over time, that everything that makes up your Coca-Cola
bottle will <I>eventually</I> become part of your Coke, and vice
versa. Therefore, FDA regulates the components of food packaging
as <I>indirect</I> food additives. Because FDA scrutinizes recycled
materials so closely, it usually takes a half a year or more and
costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to gain FDA approval for
recycled packaging material. Volokh suggests that deregulation
of the approval process would be a way to expand recycling markets.

<B>The FDA vs. Recycling: How RCRA has Recyclers Running Around
in CERCLAs, Part 2</B>, by Alexander Volokh
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 197, Reason Foundation

<P>
Part 2 of &quot;The FDA vs. Recycling&quot; shows that federal
hazardous waste regulations, such as the Resource Conservation
Recovery Act (RCRA) and Superfund, have burdened the hazardous
waste recycling industry, damaging the economic viability of recycled
products like lead batteries and used oil. For example, a company
that wants to get a permit to send their industrial waste, such
as car batteries or scrap metal, to be recycled faces a huge liability.
Under Superfund-which regulates the cleanup of toxic waste sites-if
a recycling facility is declared hazardous, whoever arranged for
the treatment or disposal of a hazardous substance can be liable
for the cleanup of the entire site. The paper concludes that if
products are heavily regulated after they are thrown out or in
the process of recycling, it should not be a surprise that people
will prefer to use virgin materials rather than recycle. 24 pp.

<h2>TAXATION &AMP; BUDGET

<P>
<B>What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to
the Economy,</B> by William Beach and John Barry
<br>
<I>F.Y.I. </I>No. 69, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Congress's balanced budget plan with tax cuts will lead, over
the next seven years, to greater business investment, higher earnings
per hour, and faster economic growth than under current law, according
to William Beach, Heritage Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, and
John Barry, Heritage Research Assistant. Beach and Barry conducted
an interim analysis of Congress's balanced budget plan with tax
cuts using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer
&amp; Associates, the same model used by the Clinton administration's
OMB and the Federal Reserve Board. Rather than cause an economic
downturn as some critics of the plan believe, the Heritage analysis
predicts that the following economic boons to American families
and businesses would result over the next seven years: an additional
$32.1 billion in real disposable income; an additional $66.2 billion
in consumption expenditures; an additional $88.2 billion in real
non-residential fixed investment; and an additional 103,700 housing
starts. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

<B>Direct Student Loans: Putting Taxpayers at Risk,</B> by Michael
Cannon
<br>
<I>Issues and Answers</I> No. 14, Citizens for a <BR>
Sound Economy
<P>
Through the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), the
federal government insures against defaulted loans made to students
by private lending institutions. According to Michael Cannon,
Citizens for a Sound Economy Policy Analyst, this program has
proven costly, forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for billions
of dollars in defaulted loans. The administration's response to
the problem has been to offer all loans directly to students-bypassing
traditional lending institutions. Cannon contends that government
control of student loans will not only cause default rates to
skyrocket but will also place all the risk on the shoulders of
taxpayers. The author suggests that the federal government limit
taxation and government spending so that students will have more
money to put toward college tuition and more private sector jobs
waiting for them upon graduation. Cannon concludes that Congress
must reject any plan to nationalize the student loan industry
if they are serious about protecting taxpayers from wasteful government
spending. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H

<B>Public vs. Private: Stadium Financing, <BR>
Operation and Development,</B> by Grant Gulibon
<br>
Allegheny Institute

<P>
According to Grant Gulibon, Allegheny Institute Research Assistant,
the power that professional sports teams are able to wield over
their local governments comes from overrated economic and psychological
value to the given municipalities. Gulibon demonstrates that professional
sports' economic contribution to local communities is exaggerated
and that only privately financed and owned stadiums remain a profitable
investment. His study also shows that government owned and operated
stadiums are rarely run efficiently and remain a taxpayer burden.
This theory is applied to Pittsburgh's current stadium situation
and threats by team owners to leave town if a new stadium is not
built. Gulibon concludes that if a new stadium is built it should
be a private venture and not be financed by public money or owned
by the local government. 20 pp.  CONTACT: Allegheny Institute

<B>Politics and the Power of the Purse,</B> by Dwight Lee
<br>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I> No. 75, Center for the Study
of American Business

<P>
In this essay, University of Georgia Economics Professor Dwight
Lee asks what the prospects of halting and then reversing federal
spending are. Lee points out that the problem of an excessive
and increasingly out-of-touch federal government is explained
by two interconnected problems. First, since the 1930's, political
power has become increasingly centralized in Washington, with
the federal government taking over more and more functions that
were not traditionally government responsibilities at any level.
Second, the federal tax system takes a large percentage of the
taxes paid by Americans. Lee writes that the type of reform necessary
to control the tax and spend power of the federal government cannot
be realized by congressional legislative fiat. This is serious
reform, according to the author, the type that has to be imposed
on reluctant politicians.  Lee calls for tax reform that is backed
by a constitutional amendment. 16 pp.  CONTACT: Center for the

<B>The Allegheny Regional Asset District Tax,</B> <BR>
by Jake Haulk
<br>
Allegheny Institute

<P>
This report analyzes the Allegheny Regional Asset District (RAD)
and the local option sales tax which funds it. RAD is a program
similiar to programs in large American cities that uses dedicated
tax revenue to subsidize cultural and recreational organizations,
usually stadiums for professional sports franchises. The report
details specific damage that the RAD tax has caused. Included
is evidence that the added sales tax will cause a shift of some
sales and jobs out of one county and into neighboring counties.
Furthermore, according to Allegheny Institute's Jake Haulk, a
supposed tax reform component of the RAD program is largely a
redistribution from better off suburbs to poorer municipalities.
By lumping this redistribution effort with the RAD program, the
opportunity for real tax reform as well as tax and expenditure
reductions by local governments has been largely foreclosed. 18

<P>
<B>Why Congress Must Reform Welfare, <BR>
</B>by Robert Rector
<br>
<I>Backgrounder </I>No. 1063, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
discusses why Congress must reform welfare. Rector begins by addressing
the claim often times presented to the public that the current
welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. Rector's
research shows that: 1) the 4.7 million families currently receiving
AFDC have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare;
2) when past and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined,
the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families
currently receiving benefits, is 13 years; and 3) among the 4.7
million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will
spend more than two years on the AFDC caseload. Next, Rector shares
the results of recent research by Congressional Budget Office
Director June O'Neill, which shows that increasing the length
of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by
as much as 20 percent. Rector writes that the more welfare income
received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower the
boy's earnings as an adult, even when compared to boys in families
with identical non-welfare income. Furthermore, Rector demonstrates
how receipt of welfare and living in a single-parent family during
childhood are strongly associated with criminal activity among
young men and having illegitimate children among young women.
Rector concludes by outlining the basic themes of the House/Senate
conference proposals to reform welfare. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris

<B>Reforming Medicare: Comparing the House <BR>
and Senate Legislation, </B>by John Liu
<br>
<I>Issue Bulletin </I>No. 220, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Heritage Policy Analyst John Liu illustrates why Medicare needs
serious reform if taxpayers are to be spared future tax increases
or deep cuts in Medicare benefits for the elderly. Liu believes
the current reforms being proposed in Congress are only stop-gap
measures to ward off fiscal disaster when the &quot;Baby-Boom&quot;
generation qualifies for Medicare. This paper compares the components
of the House and Senate Medicare reform proposals and identifies
the best policy in each area. For example, while both bills establish
consumer choice in health plans, Lui believes that they should
also expand the options available to senior citizens. Liu also
describes how certain provisions within the current proposals
could have harmful consequences for the healthcare market and
the elderly if they are not modified and recommends provisions
that he thinks should be included in a final bill. 20 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Charting Florida's Educational Future, <BR>
</B>by Jonathan Hage
<br>
<I>Outside the Lines</I> No. 3, Foundation for Florida's Future


<P>
Director of Research for Foundation for Florida's Future, Jonathan
Hage, supports charter schools as a way to solve the problems
facing Florida public education. Charter schools are independent
public schools formed under a &quot;charter,&quot; or contract,
made between <I>organizers</I> (e.g., teachers, parents, colleges,
local organizations, or others) and <I>sponsors</I> (e.g., local
school boards, state boards of education or some other legislatively
approved and publicly accountable body). Hage provides examples
of successful charter schools in other states and addresses several
concerns that communities might have about them. Among the concerns
Hage addresses are: &quot;Charter schools won't be regulated and
children will be hurt&quot;; &quot;Charter schools are just another
passing fad&quot;; &quot;Charter schools will take money from
traditional public schools&quot;; &quot;Charter schools will open
the door to religious involvement&quot;; and &quot;Charter schools
will serve the 'elite' students, not the poor at-risk.&quot; Based
on his research, Hage concludes that charter schools will empower
parents to have more control over their children's education and
that schools will be held more accountable for their performance.

<B>How Much More do We Have to Spend to Achieve a Totally Illiterate
Society?</B> <BR>
by Dwight Williams 
<br>
<I>Independence Issue Paper</I> No. 9, Independence Institute


<P>
Dwight Williams, Research Associate at The Independence Institute,
sheds light on the perplexing question: &quot;Why has academic
achievement declined or stagnated in Colorado and the rest of
the United States despite the tremendous increase in education
spending in recent decades?&quot; Williams shows that there is
no correlation between more school spending and higher achievement.
For example, total spending on education in Colorado grew 1730
percent from 1964 to 1994, despite this, over the same period

Also, because so much school revenue is spent on social conditioning
and other non-academic pursuits, only 41 percent of school days
are devoted to core academic work. Williams details steps which

<B>Making Schools Work: Spending and Student Achievement, </B>by
Eric Hanushek
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 68, The Heartland Institute

<P>
Eric Hanushek, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the
University of Rochester, found that real spending on public education
in the U.S. is rising rapidly.  Despite this, student-teacher
and student-staff ratios have fallen, and student achievement
is either flat or falling. According to the study, three problems
largely explain the inefficiency of public education today: 1)
disregard for efficiency and productivity; 2) absence of performance
incentives; and 3) public schools don't learn from experience.
Hanushek concludes that only when public educators focus on making
efficiency and productivity a priority among educators and administrators
will student achievement improve. 28 pp.  CONTACT: The Heartland

Emory University Clinical Professor Brenda Fitzgerald  writes
that while Congress tries to reform Medicare,  they should look
at the innovative ways that private corporations have cut costs

A book draft entitled <I>School Choice: The Cultural Logic of

much attention in newspapers and in education circles due to a
widely distributed Harvard press release. The book contains research
from nine different reports on school choice and includes an introduction
and conclusion by Harvard professors Richard Elmore, Gary Orfield,
and Bruce Fuller. Pioneer Institute has gathered responses to
the manuscript draft from several experts in the field of education
including: former Milwaukee Superintendent of Public Schools Howard
Fuller, President of Charter Schools Strategies Inc.; Joe Nathan,
Director of Center for School Change at the Hubert Humphrey Institute

<B>Natural Resource Damages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis,</B>
edited by Richard B. Stewart
<br>
National Legal Center for the Public Interest

<P>
This book addresses the emerging area of environmental law known
as &quot;natural resource damages&quot;(NRD), in a series of legal
and economic essays. Natural resource damages is a form of environmental
liability established by Superfund, the Oil Pollution Act, and
other federal and state statutes. These laws provide that public
(principally governmental) &quot;trustees&quot; can sue those
entities (principally private) held liable for damages to natural
resources.  As the monograph's Editor, Richard B. Stewart, former
head of the U.S. Department of Justice's Environment and Natural
Resources Division, points out that natural resource damages law
is an awakening &quot;sleeping giant.&quot; He writes that it
will become increasingly important for American businesses to
become aware of NRD's implications. According to Stewart, NRD
threatens U.S. business with potentially enormous liabilities
and massive transaction costs. This book attempts to identify
serious flaws in the existing system and suggests alternative
approaches that would protect natural resources without placing
an enormous liability upon U.S. businesses. 208 pp.  CONTACT:

In this comprehensive study, Peron concludes that people in such
population-control targeted areas as Africa are not victims of
overpopulation, rather, they are victims of inept governments
that have attempted to impose socialism and regulated economies
on countries that can't afford these wealth-destroying policies.

people to keep what they produce; and the people will produce.&quot;

<I>Positions on Property</I> Vol. 2, No. 2, The Property Rights
Foundation of America

<P>
Land trusts were originally a perfect vehicle for privatized environmental
protection, according to retired civil and environmental engineer
Carol LaGrasse. Today, however, colossal environmental land brokerage
organizations are a channel for innocent, environmentally minded
citizen donors to unknowingly pool their resources with the taxing
power of state and federal governments to wrest land from private
ownership. LaGrasse writes that land trusts are exempt from the
possible subjection to demands by citizens for information under
the Freedom of Information laws. So, these groups can, in effect,
perform government functions without public scrutiny or responsibility.
LaGrasse points out that non-profit land trusts are serving primarily
as real estate brokers for government and asks the question: &quot;why
should local citizens, economically restricted by land preservation,
grant a tax exemption to land trusts to absorb a tax shift caused
by their wholesale land acquisitions, contrary to the community
interests?&quot; 16 pp.  CONTACT: The Property Rights Foundation

<h2>CRIME &AMP; LAW

<P>
<B>How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff: The Bipartisan
Assault on Local Law Enforcement, </B>by Edwin Meese, III &amp;
Rhett DeHart
<br>
<I>Policy Review </I>No. 75, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Edwin Meese, III, former Attorney General under President Reagan,
and Rhett DeHart, Special Counsel to Mr. Meese, show how Congress's
massive federalization of crimes has served to undermine local
law enforcement. According to the authors, the case against federalization
of crime includes the following: nationalizing crime contradicts
constitutional principles; violates double jeopardy; incurs unnecessary
expense; undermines state experimentation; and shifts accountability.
The proper role of the federal government, according to Meese
and DeHart, can best be described by the word &quot;limited.&quot;
There are only two broad areas of criminal jurisdiction where
the federal government should be involved. The first, crime against
the sovereignty of the United States, is concerned with clearly
federal issues such as treason, counterfeiting, and national security
violations. The second area of federal criminal jurisdiction is
limited to narrowly defined, significant interstate, or international,
crime. Furthermore, the federal government is best suite to provide
local officials with technological assistance and a database of
crime statistics as well as criminal histories and fingerprints.
Although both authors recognize that crime is a problem that affects
the entire nation, they write that &quot;both constitutional tradition
and practical experience demonstrate that it is most effectively
fought at the state and local level.&quot; CONTACT: Brendan O'Scannlain,

by James Wootton

<I>Andrew Jackson Institute Policy Report</I> No. 104, Andrew
Jackson Institute

<P>
James Wootton, President of the Safe Streets Alliance, presents
a case for the policy known as &quot;Truth in Sentencing.&quot;
This policy seeks to fix the critical problem of early release
of violent offenders. Truth-in-Sentencing would abolish parole
and other early release programs for violent criminals and would
keep them incarcerated for at least 85 percent of their sentences.
Such an approach, similar to that in place in the federal prison
system, would greatly strengthen Tennessee's criminal justice
system by ending the current practice of allowing the majority
of violent offenders sentenced to prison to serve only a fraction
of their sentence, writes Wootton. The study illustrates that
the direct costs of allowing a violent criminal to remain on the
streets far outweigh the costs of keeping an offender in prison.

6, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute

<P>
This paper evaluates the prison expansion program which has been
underway in Wisconsin since the late 1970's. Among its findings:
1) increased incarceration is a major reason for an 18% cut in
Wisconsin's crime rate between 1980 and the end of 1994; 2) while
prison costs are a growing share of the state's budget, on a per
capita basis they were a modest $46 a year in 1994; and 3) more
unskilled youths, a continuing increase in unstable, single parent
families, and an apparent departure from the state's successful
prison expansion policy, all portend an increase in crime in Wisconsin.
The study concludes that Wisconsin's prison policy has been effective
and that it warrants review as the state decides whether additional
prison space should remain a priority. 32 pp.  CONTACT: Wisconsin

<B>Three Years of the Americans With Disabilities Act: Lessons
for Employers, </B>by Mark Parenti
<br>
National Legal Center for the Public Interest

<P>
The broad and far-reaching language of the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) left many employers uncertain and confused about its
requirements when it was first enacted five years ago, according
to former NLCPI staff member Mark Parenti. In order to determine
where the law has become more settled and clear, and where it
still presents employers with uncertainty, the first part of this
paper examines how the courts and the executive branch have applied
and enforced the ADA. The second part of the study addresses the
overlap and conflict between ADA provisions and other federal
laws governing the workplace. The paper concludes that the courts
are doing the job of staking out limits to the Act's uncertain
requirements and defining its vague language-a job that Congress
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission neglected. 67

David Forte, Professor at Cleveland State University, reflects
upon the past year in the Supreme Court, most notably, the emergence

developments during the 1994-95 term: 1) the constitutional rules
affecting race, free speech, religious expression, congressional
powers, and federalism were tilted sharply to the right; 2) Justice
Thomas's intellectual emergence was rooted in the thought of the
framers; 3) the four-justice liberal bloc looked wistfully to
the judicial activism that characterized the Court from 1937 on;
and 4) only 82 opinions were written last term, fewer than in
any year since 1956, but, comments Forte, they were among the
best-crafted in decades. 6 pp. CONTACT: <I>The World &amp; I</I>,

Several researchers reveal their findings that there is little

why the record on gun control is so poor. The paper concludes
that firearms are not the root of the problem of violence and
arguably are almost completely divorced from it. &quot;As long
as some people have little or nothing to lose by spending their
lives in crime, dispositions to violence will persist-and increasingly
strict gun controls will do little if anything to improve matters.&quot;

<P>
&quot;Society's Ills: Who's Responsible&quot; is the featured
theme in the Fall 1995 issue of <I>Impact</I>, and includes articles
on three different aspects of &quot;society's ills.&quot; The
first is a look at Floridians efforts to deal with the problems
of homelessness  Entitled &quot;Gone But Not Forgotten,&quot;
this piece compares the homeless programs of several different
Florida counties and examines to what degree they have been successful.
The article &quot;What to do About HRS,&quot; the Florida Department
of Health and Rehabilitative Services is scrutinized. <I>Impact</I>
asked several state opinion leaders and civic and community activists
the following question: &quot;If you held the purse strings and
the power to rebuild HRS from the ground up, how would you reform
it to best meet the needs of the people it is meant to help?&quot;
The third article is entitled &quot;Absentee Fathers Please Stand
Up,&quot; and considers the drastic effect the growth of out of
wedlock births has had on society and points out that the &quot;root
of much of the crime problem is the absence of involved fathers.&quot;

<B>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: One Philanthropy's Web of State
Health Care Initiatives, </B>by Genevieve M. Young
<br>
<I>Organization Trends</I>, August 1995

<P>
State health reform proposals were especially prominent during
the 1992 election campaign and again in 1993. The effect of those
high profile proposals created an impression in the media and
among the public that rhetoric concerning a &quot;crisis&quot;
in health care had an objective, verifiable reality. However,
Genevieve Young, a Washington, D.C. attorney, demonstrates that
this &quot;crisis&quot; was the creation of a well-funded, highly
organized campaign by special interests bent on imposing their
vision of health care on the rest of us. Chief among these special
interests was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Young sheds
light on the Foundation's activities, particularly its efforts
at the state level. She exposes a complex web of relationships
between the Foundation and various government entities, working
groups, commissions, and contractors-all designed to further the
cause of government-run health care.<I> </I>6 pp. CONTACT: Capital

<B>Justice Department's Efforts at Social Engineering Defeated</B>
<P>
ALF represented New Jersey firefighter candidates who had taken
a 1995 physical performance test to determine which candidates
were eligible to be hired as firefighters and in what order. The
Justice Department, however, did not like the results of the test
because not enough minority candidates did well and instructed
Newark to ignore the 1995 list and continue to hire from a list
generated by a 1992 exam.
<P>
The United States District Court of New Jersey agreed with ALF's
position and pointed out to the Justice Department that a test
had been devised several years earlier based on the best technical
advice and that that test had been approved by the United States,
the State of New Jersey and 12 cities of New Jersey which were
subject to an earlier consent decree concerning &quot;goals&quot;
for hiring firefighters. He further pointed out that when the
test had been given in 1992, the Justice Department had not objected
to the results. The <I>same</I> test was given in 1995, but because
the Justice Department did not like the results, it objected even
though the test was the one that it helped set up and approve.
The judge ordered that the State of New Jersey certify the 1995
list for hiring and scrap the 1992 list.

<B>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</B>

<P>
<B>Defenders Bring Suit Against City of Pacific Grove and State
of California for Violating Constitution  </B>
<P>
Defenders of Property Rights has filed suit in United States District
Court on behalf of Pacific Grove property owner Stephen J.L. Page.
The complaint alleges, among other things, that the City of Pacific
Grove, certain city officials, and the California Coastal Commission
denied him the approvals to build a home on residential property
in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.
Constitution
<P>
These constitutional violations stem from Mr. Page's 1989 decision
to purchase a 1.08-acre parcel of oceanfront property in a subdivided,
fully developed residential area of Pacific Grove.  He was forced
to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless hours
attending duplicative hearings and responding to unnecessary conditions
imposed upon his attempt to use his land.  Yet-six years later
-he still lacks the necessary government approvals to build his
home.  
<P>
Pacific Grove's desire to keep the land as &quot;open space&quot;
was evident when Mr. Page first intended to purchase the land,
and voluntarily agreed to delay his purchase for an entire year
in order to allow the city time to collect money to buy the lot
itself.  Having failed to raise the requisite funds to legitimately
acquire the land, the city deliberately schemed to maintain the
land as open space without paying for it by refusing to grant
a building permit.
<P>
Chief among the tactics employed by both the city and the Coastal
Commission was the imposition of multiple, onerous, and costly
conditions that must be met to obtain a permit.  For example,
Mr. Page must set aside eighty-five percent of his land as &quot;open
space&quot; (while paying taxes on 100% of the land).  Even if
he is allowed to build a home, he will not be able to: erect any
fencing on his land, including fencing to exclude trespassers;
erect any exterior light or even a flagpole without prior government
approval; repair his septic system; or remove any hazardous substance
or diseased plants from his yard.

<B>Defenders in Face Off with FAA over Proposed Taking in Farmland</B>
<P>
Defenders helped win a victory in a recent dispute involving the
Federal Aviation Administration in New Bloomfield, Missouri. The
FAA, in attempting to purchase air rights for a new radar tower,
was taking more than the air space: property owners were told
that their continued use of the underlying property could interfere
with the radar's well, although the FAA was not going to compensate
them for the loss of those rights.
<P>
After intense media scrutiny and public opposition, the FAA decided
that it did not need to purchase the air rights after all, and
have assured the property owners that the present and intended
future use of their farmland will not be restricted due to the
radar.
<P>
<B>Defenders Obtains Day in Court for <BR>
Property Owner</B>
<P>
In <I>Sudarsky v. City of New York,</I> Defenders argued that
the City of New York unconstitutionally took Peter Sudarsky's
property through zoning regulation, and urged the court to hear
the merits of the case. In 1986, Mr. Sudarsky attempted to develop
a seventeen-story building on prime commercial real estate in
Manhattan. The City of New York held up the development under
the guise of needing an easement to expand the subway, and in
the meantime downzoned the property, foiling Mr. Sudarsky's development
plans.
<P>
After several years and several courts, including a petition to
the United States Supreme Court (which was denied), the case still
has not gone to trial. Nevertheless, the New York Supreme Court
has just reversed a grant of summary judgment for defendants and
reinstated the claim. Mr. Sudarsky will finally get his day in
court and a chance to prove his takings claim.

<B>Consent Decree Allows Teen Challenge to Continue Faith-based
Healing</B>
<P>
Through a negotiated settlement engineered by the Institute for
Justice, the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA)
removed licensing requirements from Teen Challenge in San Antonio;
allowing the nationally acclaimed program to continue its healing
work on behalf of those addicted to drugs and alcohol. The consent
decree expressly recognizes Teen Challenge's right to continue
its current method of operation without a license or other state
imposed requirements that would interfere with Teen Challenge
ministry. Teen Challenge, which has an outstanding track record
in assisting addiction through a Christian faith-based program
was forced by the State of Texas to comply with secular credentialling
and training requirements which treat addiction as a disease that
can never be fully cured and that requires extensive psychological
counseling and therapeutic treatment.

<B>The Fight for School Choice in Milwaukee</B>
<P>
Opening briefs were filed in the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the
battle over expanded school choice in Milwaukee. Arguing on behalf
of parents and children, the Institute is aggressively defending
the program against challenges by the teachers unions, the American
Civil Liberties Union, and the People for the American Way. The
plaintiffs argue that the program violates the first amendment
and a variety of state constitutional provisions.
<P>
Last month the Institute successfully opposed the NAACP's motion
to intervene in the lawsuit, and has coordinated <I>amicus</I>
support for the program. Oral arguments are set for February 1996.

<B>Landmark Wins Key Education <BR>
Reform Victory</B>
<P>
In another victory for education reform, the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court has ruled in favor of Landmark's client, the Wilkinsburg
School District, and has allowed the continued private management
of the district's Turner Elementary School.
<P>
The school district is undertaking a remarkable effort to restructure
the education program at one small elementary school. Against
the backdrop of one of the most dismal educational achievement
records imaginable, the school board is allowing a private firm
to manage and operate the school.
<P>
Despite repeated attempts by the National Education Association
to prevent it, Turner Elementary School opened under private management
on September 5, 1995 pending review by the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court. This is believed to be the first time in the nation that
a public school has been totally privatized.
<P>
The state supreme court upheld the district's effort by dissolving
a preliminary injunction, dismissing contempt charges against
school board members and ordering the trial court to hold another
hearing on the union's pending motion for a permanent injunction.
However, in its remand to the trial court, the supreme court took
the unusual step of addressing certain constitutional issues prior
to the hearing. Agreeing with the position advanced by Landmark,
the majority stated that &quot;even if the School Code were to
be interpreted to prohibit subcontracting of teachers...there
may be other conditions, which the school district insists there
are, which would render this application of the Public School
Code unconstitutional.&quot;

<B>Court's Price of Admission too High</B>
<P>
In a petition for <I>writ of certiori </I>filed recently, MSLF
requested that the Supreme Court hear <I>Laguna Gatuna, Inc. v.
Carol M. Browner, et al., </I>a case in which a New Mexico man
has been driven out of business by a cease and desist order issued
by EPA following its determination that the man's land is &quot;waters
of the United States&quot; under the Clean Water Act.
<P>
For years, Larry Squires used his land to dispose of waters produced
by southeastern New Mexico's important oil and gas industry. Although
EPA had told Squires previously that his lands were not &quot;waters
of the United States,&quot; in 1991 it changed its mind. In 1992,
EPA served Squires with a cease and desist order preventing him
from using his land. When his company was driven out of business,
Squires asked MSLF to represent him in suing EPA.
<P>
Squires contended that EPA's decision that his land fell under
the Clean Water Act was illegal. EPA asserted that Squires could
not sue until he violated the cease and desist order. If Squires
violated the EPA order, he would face penalties of $25,000 and
three years in prison, administrative fines of up to $125,000,
and a &quot;knowing&quot; penalty of $50,000 per day, plus three
years in prison.
<P>
A federal district court agreed with EPA. An appeal to the Tenth
Circuit Court of Appeals yielded the following decision in June:
&quot;Laguna's policy argument that it should not be necessary
to violate an EPA order and risk civil and criminal penalties
to obtain judicial review is well taken. Nevertheless...we reject
Laguna's conclusion such a situation is constitutionally intolerable.&quot;
<P>
In asking the Supreme Court to hear Laguna's case, MSLF asserts
that the Tenth Circuit's decision conflicts with the Constitution's
Fifth Amendment requirement that &quot;[n]o person shall...be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law,&quot; as well as numerous Supreme Court decisions that &quot;individuals
must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the
Government deprives them of property.&quot;

<B>City of Tigard Rebuffs U.S. Supreme Court </B>
<P>
On August 29th, the Tigard City Council voted to reinstate the
same bikepath/greenway conditions on the Dolan's A-Boy plumbing
store building permit that the United States Supreme Court struck
down in the highly publicized landmark property rights case, <I>Dolan
v. City of Tigard</I>.
<P>
In June last year, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the city had
failed to prove &quot;rough proportionality&quot; between the
impact of an expanded plumbing store building and the city's requirement
that the Dolans give up 10% of their land for a public bikepath
and greenway along Fanno Creek. Although the U.S. Supreme Court
was skeptical that Tigard could meet the proportionality test,
it remanded the case back to the city to give it an opportunity
to do so. During the months of inaction on the part of the city,
it did not withdraw the unconstitutional conditions, revise them,
or try to justify them. The Dolans then filed a legal action in
circuit court for damages caused by the city's unconstitutional
actions.
<P>
The city eventually instituted proceedings in which they attempted
to establish the required connection between impact of the building
and the bikepath/greenway conditions.
<P>
The Dolans have tried to settle with the city by agreeing to conditions
that would accommodate the city's bikepath and greenway needs
as well as the building. In fact, the city's staff proposed virtually
the same compromise, but later the city decided to reimpose essentially
what it had imposed four years before.

<B>Texas Immigration Suit Supported on Appeal</B>

Joined by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Jack
Fields, WLF filed a brief in the Fifth Circuit in support of Texas'
position in <I>Texas v. U.S.</I>, the lawsuit brought to compel
the federal government to enforce immigration laws adequately
or to compensate Texas for the fiscal burdens resulting from inadequate
enforcement. WLF argued in its brief that if the federal government
fails to control illegal immigration adequately, the result is
a massive unfunded mandate imposed upon the states to provide

cannot impose without compensatory funding.

<B>Anti-Gang Injunction Supported in California Supreme Court</B>

WLF filed a brief in the California Supreme Court in support of
the City of San Jose's position in <I>People v. Carlos Acuna</I>,
a suit over the constitutionality of an injunction to stop gang
activity by the defendants.  The defendants were found to have
been part of two street gangs, the &quot;Varrio Surreno Treces&quot;
(VST) and &quot;Varrio Surreno Locos&quot; (VSL), that maintained
a reign of terror in the community of Rocksprings, a neighborhood
in San Jose. The City obtained an injunction to abate these activities
as a public nuisance. The state appellate court, however, struck
down many provisions of the injunction as a violation of the gang
members' First Amendment rights, WLF argued that the First Amendment
did not forbid an injunction to limit the congregating of known
gang members.

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi69.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #1</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,</b> by William Beach and John Barry. <BR>

<P>
See Taxation &amp; Budget page 6, 8 pp. (<I>F.Y.I. </I>#69)<BR>

<P>
<li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi76.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #2</a>: <b>Who Will Benefit From Cuts in Capital Gains Taxes? </b> by William Beach <BR>

<P>
Beach points out that there are three major reasons why adopting
capital gains tax changes as defined in the Balance Budget Act
of 1995 will benefit nearly every American. First, the benefits
of cutting capital gains taxes go mostly to lower and middle income
tax-payers rather than to the wealthy. Second, economists who
have analyzed the economic effects of balancing the federal budget
while simultaneously cutting taxes (including the capital gains
tax) have all concluded that these policy changes result in widespread
economic benefits through a stronger, more productive economy.
And third, reducing the tax rate for capital gains actually would
increase tax revenues from tax-payers who own most appreciated
assets. 4 pp. (<I>F.Y.I. </I>#76)

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi77.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #3</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Family College Costs,</b>
by John Barry <BR>

<P>
Among Barry's findings, the Balanced Budget Act developed by Congress
would mean the following: American families, over time, could
save an additional $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund
college education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax
credit; and an average student could save more than $414 over
the life of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest
rates. 3 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I> #77)

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi75.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #4</a>: <b>The $500-per-Child Tax Credit Means One Month's Food and Mortgage For a Typical American Family</b>
by Scott Hodge <BR>

<P>
Scott Hodge, Heritage Foundation Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs,
points out that a $500 tax cut for each child in working families
is not an insignificant amount of money, as many liberals believe.
Hodge shows that this tax cut would pump over $22 billion per
year into family budgets across the country. According to Hodge
millions of families will benefit, and Congress's $500-per-child
tax credit would eliminate the entire income tax burden for 3.5
million taxpayers caring for 8.7 children. 19 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi78.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #5</a>: <b>Clinton's $300-per-Child Tax Cut Plan Denies Tax Relief to 23 Million Children,</b> by Scott Hodge<BR>

<P>
Hodge shows that the Balanced Budget Act vetoed by President Clinton
on December 6th (with its $500-per-child tax cut for all children
in families earning up to $110,000) compared with Clinton's budget
(with its provision for a $300-per-child tax credit for dependent
children below age 13 in families with annual incomes below $75,000)
would benefit 5.4 million more low-income working families with
children earning below $24,000 per year, who would be denied the
$300 child tax credit under the Clinton plan. 8 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>

<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi79.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #6</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Current and Future Retirees,</b>
by John Barry
<P>
Barry has found that under the congressional balanced budget plan
current retirees would gain additional after-tax income from a
reduction in the capital gains tax; and retirees have a significant
increase in real purchasing power over the next ten years due
to decreased inflation. Future retirees would benefit under the
Congressional proposal with the proposed &quot;super IRA&quot;
compared with saving the same amount in a conventional IRA; a
young couple raising one newborn child could save significantly
for their retirement by saving the $500-per-child annual tax credit,
while a young couple buying a home could save more for their retirement
from decreased monthly mortgage payments. 6 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>

<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi80.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #7</a>: <b>What Congress's Balanced Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Housing,</B> by William Beach <BR>

<P>
According to an econometric analysis by William Beach, adoption
of the spending and tax policy changes contained in the Balanced
Budget Act of 1995 would likely lead to: 104,000 additional housing
starts worth $11 billion over the period 1996 through 2002; new
or improved housing for 1.8 million Americans; a drop in mortgage
interests rates, with total payments on a $100,000 mortgage about
$10,000 less in today's dollars over 30 years than a mortgage
purchased under current budget and tax law; and a 4 percent drop
in the cost of housing by 2002 (principally through decreases
in the cost of capital and lower interests rates), with the value
of existing housing maintained at or near current levels by the
growing demand for new homes. 3 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I> #80)

<h2>November <i>Insider</i>: On the Docket: A Look Ahead at the Supreme Court</h2></center><p>
by Roger Clegg, Vice President, National Legal Center for the Public Interest  <br>
<hr>
<br>


Following its usual practice, the Supreme Court commenced its new term on the first Monday in October. Decisions in the cases argued before the Court should be handed down before the 1995-96 term is completed at the end of next June. Here is a brief overview of the cases to watch.
<P>
One of the most controversial cases is Romer v. Evans, where a Colorado state constitutional amendment barring protected status for homosexuals is being challenged as a denial of "equal protection of the laws," in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. When the case was argued last month, the Colorado official defending the law got a chilly reception from the Court. But it can be risky to predict a case's outcome based only on how the oral argument goes.
<P>
Another case that was recently argued is BMW of North America Incorporated v. Gore, which spotlights out-of-control jury damage awards. An Alabama jury awarded $4 million to a doctor who complained about his new car's paint job. The state supreme court cut it back to "only" $2 million, which understandably enough did not satisfy the defendant. The Court has taken a number of punitive damage cases in recent years, but has yet to offer clear guidance to the lower courts on how to tell when an award is unconstitutionally "excessive."
<P>
Last term the Court handed down a number of important civil rights cases, most of them conservative victories, as a slender majority of the justices insisted that racial preferences of all kinds be given strict scrutiny. This term's most important cases in this category_Shaw v. Hunt and Bush v. Vera_involve voting rights, and in particular the practice of drawing district boundaries with an eye toward "politically correct" racial outcomes. With the Clinton administration committed to racial preferences, and Congress so far unwilling to act, the Court appears to be the only branch of the federal government willing to resist racial balkanization.
Another important civil rights case, which the Court just recently 
agreed to hear, is United States v. Virginia. This is the "VMI case," challenging the constitutionality of single sex, state-run military academies, namely the Virginia Military Institute and the Citadel. This controversy drew a great deal of attention last summer when Shannon Faulkner briefly attended the Citadel.
<P>
Two other cases likely to generate publicity are Bennis v. Michigan, in which a wife is challenging the forfeiture of the family car when her husband used it to pick up a prostitute, and Lewis v. Casey, in which Arizona's state-prison libraries were ordered by a federal judge to provide inmates with a variety of amenities. Bennis is important because law-enforcement agencies have been very aggressive recently in using forfeiture laws, especially against drug dealers. Lewis provides the Court with a chance to cut back on the federal judiciary's micromanagement of state prison systems_just as it cut back on its micromanagement of school systems last term in Missouri v. Jenkins.
<P>
Other important cases which the Supreme Court will hear this year involve Indian gambling casinos, whether there is a jury-trial right in patent cases, claims against the manufacturers of Agent Orange, whether the federal census illegally undercounted members of minority groups, the First Amendment implication of limits on liquor advertising, the extent to which some computer software can be copyrighted, the sentencing in the Rodney King case, and whether telephone companies can be prevented by the federal government from getting into the cable television business.
<P>
Finally, keep in mind that the Court has so far scheduled relatively few cases to be heard this term, even considering the fact that its docket has shrunk dramatically from just a few years ago. Consequently, the Court is expected to add quite a few cases to its agenda over the next few weeks and months.

<b>Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law</b><br>
by David J. Armor, Oxford University Press (1995)
<P>
In his new book, <i>Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law</i> (Oxford University Press), David J. Armor, Research Professor at the Institute of Public Policy at George Mason University, offers his readers a thoroughly professional overview of one of the most controversial areas of public policies of the last forty years -- school desegregation. A conservative, Armor writes in a non-threatening, academic style that allows him to tread in controversial academic waters and reach conservative conclusions without scaring away the ideologically liberal reader. One suspects that even the most defiant apologist of forced busing and race-conscious education policies will, upon reading this book, be forced to admit that the world is a more complicated place than it appeared to be in 1954 when the Supreme Court rendered its decision in Brown v. Board of Education.
Brown undoubtedly contributed to the sea change in popular opinion on racial issues in this country, as illustrated by polling data that shows the steady upward movement in the percentage of whites who believe that black and white students should attend the same schools -- from about one-third in 1942 to 95 percent in 1990. But the decision also legitimized one of the most pernicious legal developments of our time, the judicial use of social science theory in deciding important constitutional law cases. In this case, the Court accepted the questionable "harm and benefit" thesis, which Armor defines as the notion that: 
<P><bq>
"school desegregation is harmful to the social, psychological, and educational development of children, both minority and white, and that school desegregation is beneficial for undoing or at least ameliorating the damages from segregation and discrimination." 

</bq><P>
Have the last four decades been kind to this thesis? After an exhaustive review of the research literature, Armor concludes that academic achievement among blacks is most strongly related, not to whether the student sits in a desegregated classroom, but to the "educational and economic characteristics" of his family and even to federal compensatory programs such as the Chapter 1 program. Armor also summarizes the research findings on the question of whether desegregation enhances black self-esteem, another key element of the harm and benefit thesis, and concludes: 
<P>
The research on black self-esteem over the past thirty years not only fails to support the harm and benefit thesis, then, but indeed seems to turn the thesis on its head. First, school segregation appears not to harm self-esteem of black students in the first place...and in many cases segregated black students have higher self-esteem than white students. Second, desegregation not only fails to improve black self-esteem but may in fact <b>lower it</b>. (emphasis added)
<P>
If, in 1954, the Court had resisted the temptation to substitute shaky social science for sound constitutional principles, how many young schoolchildren, both black and white, might have been spared those long and painful bus rides to distant schools to fulfill the social engineer's dream of perfect racial integration in the schools?  
<P>
What does the research literature tell us about whether whites abandon public school systems that are implementing court-ordered desegregation plans, the so-called phenomena of "white flight"? As Armor describes it, in 1975 social scientists began to suspect that "desegregation was accelerating white flight above and beyond that caused by other demographic processes." Armor himself conducted a comprehensive study of fifty-four court-ordered plans and found:
<P><bq>
"In central-city school districts with higher percentages of black enrollment, I found mandatory busing to raise white loss rates by three to five times that due to underlying demographic processes...[T]his study estimated that over a five-year period about half of the total white enrollment loss was due to the busing plans and the other half was due to normal demographic processes such as declining birth rates and net out-migration rates."
</bq><P>
Armor suggests that inconvenience, rather than racial prejudice, may account for much of this result: "the highest no-show rate is for Los Angeles, which had the longest average busing distance of any of the plans [55 minutes for a one-way bus ride]." Elsewhere, he points to data that parents weigh the quality of the individual school, rather than race, most heavily before deciding to move their children to other schools.
<P>
Try as he might to present both sides of a rather complicated argument, Armor nonetheless leaves the reader feeling quite frustrated with the current state of affairs, both politically and in the courts.
<P>
Thanks to David Armor, we now have a better understanding of the strengths and (mostly) weaknesses of school desegregation.

The House-Senate Conference Should Agree to Rapid Deployment of Missle Defenses</b>, by Baker Spring<br>
Backgrounder No. 1054, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Baker Spring, a senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, recommends that the members of the House and Senate military oversight committees who make up the conference committee should not settle for a weak bill that postpones deployment or takes the US ballistic missile defense program down a dead-end road. Spring recommends the committee adopt the following in order to send a clear message to the administration: deploy affordable and highly effective theater missile defense systems as soon as possible; deploy at the earliest possible date an affordable and highly effective national missile defense system that can be augmented to provide a layered defense; and improve existing cruise missile defense capabilities. This paper includes an appendix detailing recommended changes to the House and Senate versions of the bill as well as outling recommended goals for the conference committee, broken down into the following areas: statements of policy; theater missile defense; national missile defense; the future of the ABM Treay; interpreting the ABM Treaty; reporting requirements; and funding for missile defense. 11 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Lee Hoskins and James Coons, respectively the CEO and vice president of the Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, point out that for the fourth time in the past 20 years, the Mexican economy is in financial distress, largely due to the poor monetary policies pursued by Mexican officials. The authors suggest that the consistent American practice of lending money to the Mexican government has created a set of perverse incentives which ensure the "crisis" will reappear on an even larger scale. Hoskins and Coons suggest that the best course for the future is to encourage market forces, stronger private property rights, price stability, and a floating exchange rate for the peso. The authors write, "The United States should pass legislation that eliminates the Treasury's ability to make foreign loans and that removes the ability of the Federal Reserve to extend credit to foreign central banks directly or indirectly by funding the Exchange Stabilization Fund." 18 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Ukraine: Back from the Brink, </b> by Taras Kuzio
<br>
European Security Study No. 23, Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies
<P>
Taras Kuzio, research fellow for the Centre for Russian and East European studies at the University of Birmingham, argues that Ukraine, more so than any other former Soviet Republic, was left with one of the most difficult legacies. According to the author, Ukraine is divided between an eastern region with a large population of Russian speakers and culture and a western area in which traditional Ukrainian language and culture predominate. Kuzio presents his analysis of the tenure of the Ukraine's president, Leonid Kravchuk and describes his efforts to handle the early stages of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, stressing reconciliation and consensus and thus avoiding ethnic tension and social instability. The author then presents a look at how the new president, Leonid Kuchma, has been able to address the problems that Kravchuk did not deal with effectively: economic and social stagnation and an increasing drift in Ukrainian foreign policy. The latter half of this paper addresses three lingering problems for Ukraine: 1) the building of a truly democratic political system is still inhibited by electoral apathy and the weakness of political parties; 2) while regional tensions have abated, the evolution of a generally accepted Ukrainian identity will be necessary; and 3) progress towards the settlement of the Crimean issue and Ukraine's general security might  be threatened by a more aggressively nationalistic Russian leader in the future. Kuzio concludes, "Western support for an independent Ukraine confident within its borders will ensure European security and stability at a crucial moment in the post-soviet transition process." 37 pp. CONTACT: Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies, St. George's House, 14/17 Wells Street, London, W1P 3FP ENGLAND, 0171-637-2152, or fax 0171-637-2155.

America's Stake in Hong Kong, </b> by Brett C. Lippencott
<br>
Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 137, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Brett Lippencott, policy analyst in The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, argues that the strong showing of pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong's October legislative elections is a clear signal that the people do not trust Beijing's pledges to respect their autonomy and freedoms. Lippencott demonstrates that Hong Kong is America's 12th largest trading partner, with 1994 two-way trade in excess of $21 billion. The paper maintains that the US has a direct interest in Beijing's compliance with its pledges to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Lippencott suggests the following conditions of the Basic Law which Beijing must respect after 1997: continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity; the existence of a free market; commitment to such democratic and open institutions as a free press; preservation of Hong Kong's apolitical, independent civil service; the rule of law built upon the inviolability of human rights and civil liberties; maintenance of Hong Kong's independence in fiscal and taxation matters; and cooperation between Hong Kong and foreign law enforcement authorities. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

How to Close Down the Department of Labor</b> by Mark Wilson
<br>
Backgrounder No. 1058, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Mark Wilson, Heritage's Rebecca Luken's Fellow in Labor Policy, reveals that the Department of Labor has become one of the most pervasive regulatory agencies in the federal government.  Wilson advocates closing this Cabinet-level department and moving key national functions to sub-Cabinet agencies or other departments. Wilson recommends that Congress take the following steps: 1) devolve financing and funding for the Unemployment Insurance Services to the states; 2) consolidate all job training programs for the economically disadvantaged into a state block grant; 3) consolidate all other job training programs into a state workforce development block grant; 4) reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and combine it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA); 5) transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration to the Social Security Administration; 6) repeal and nullify outdated labor laws, executive orders, and regulations; 7) combine the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau in a newly created sub-Cabinet agency, the Bureau of National Statistics; and 8) close down the Office of the American Workplace and nullify Executive Order 12954 (striker replacement). Wilson writes, "The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to initiate fundamental reforms in the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. The primary objectives of this effort should be: reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety, and improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employee protections." 29 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Saying Goodbye When the Job is Done: The Coming Privatization of Government-Sponsored Enterprises, </b>by Thomas H. Stanton
<br>
IPI Policy Report No. 133, The Institute for Policy Innovation
<P>
Tom Stanton, a fellow of the Center for the Study of American Government at the Johns Hopkins University, states that government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Sallie Mae pose a needless $1.5 trillion liability to taxpayers and should be privatized. Stanton writes, "Today, Farmer Mac is requesting changes to its charter that would increase taxpayer risk, and give it advantage over its private competitors. As proven by the Savings and Loan debacle, such massive taxpayer liabilities are not risk-free." The report addresses the individual situations of the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac), and the Farm Credit System. Stanton concludes that, if the GSEs are not privatized, the taxpayer liability of GSEs will continue to grow at a rapid rate, and will only add to the total hidden taxpayer liability that lurks beyond the national debt. 22 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

Archer Daniels Midland: A Case Study in Corporate Welfare</b>, by James Bovard
<br>
Policy Analysis No. 241, Cato Institute
<P>
James Bovard, an associate policy analyst with the Cato Institute, reveals that the Archer Daniels Midland Corporation (ADM) has been one of the most prominent recipients of corporate welfare in recent years, funding both political parties with millions of dollars of handouts in return for billion dollar windfalls from taxpayers and consumers. Bovard writes, "Thanks to federal protection of the domestic sugar industry, ethanol subsidies, subsidized grain exports, and various other programs, ADM has cost the American economy billions of dollars since 1980 and has indirectly cost Americans tens of billions of dollars in higher prices and higher taxes over that same period." This paper demonstrates how ADM has received at least 43 percent of its annual profits from products heavily subsidized or protected by the American government. Bovard puts these figures in perspective with the current debate over corporate welfare, examining the dynamics of corporate welfare by investigating ADM as a classic case study of how those subsidies are obtained, how the welfare state encourages such "rent seeking," and how such practices fundamentally corrupt the political life of a nation. 48 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Constraints Upon Privatization: A Case Study of the Israeli Experience, </b> by Avi Naider
<br>
Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs
<P>
Avi Naider provides a short history of the rise of state-owned enterprises throughout the world in the post-World War II era, and the general trend of governments subsequently to divest themselves of those interests. Naider then presents a case study of privatization efforts in Israel, an example of an advanced industrial country which has generally failed to meet its own goals and standards, according to the author. This paper suggests that the most significant constraints on Israel's privatization program have been political and social, and, although technical constraints have contributed to delays, they are unable to account for the fact that despite the government's stated commitment to privatization, the number of state owned enterprises in the 1990s have actually increased. Naider probes several obstacles to reform: 1) Israel's fragmented and contentious political system; 2) the maneuvering of ministers and bureaucrats to "protect their turf;" 3) the power of the country's federated labor union; 4) the preoccupation with national security; and 5) the country's socialist legacy. To further illustrate Israel's unique experience, a chapter is dedicated to a case study of Israel Chemicals, Ltd., a pivotal divesture failure. 68 pp. CONTACT: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Beit Milken, 13 Tel Hal Street, Jerusalem  92107, ISRAEL, fax 972-2-619112.

This report, developed by the Urban Research Center of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, examines the impact of the recent economic growth in Wisconsin's largest metropolitan areas. The report, which uses jobs data from the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations, reveals several significant trends: Kenosha expands by creating jobs through small compaies, while its neighbor, Racine, remains stagnant; metropolitan Milwaukee continues to develop jobs, but at a slower rate than other large metropolitan areas; and smaller areas are experiencing a far more significant rate of job creation than the larger metropolitan areas. This report analyzes which industries grew most rapidly, whether single-site employers added more employment than establishments associated with multiple-site employers, whether existing employers are universally responsible for most employment gains in all regions, how important to overall growth employers are that added large numbers of employees, which size employer added the most employees, whether suburban areas are growing at the expense of the central cities, how much firm migration is occurring, and what are the earnings patterns. 32 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 N.

At the cost of the consumer, the FDA, according to Keating, has stifled growth in many areas, including entrepreneurial medical devices, vitamins, and foods. Keating recommends bold reforms for the FDA: 1) the FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education; 2) efficacy should be left to the marketplace; 3) manufacturers and approval enterprises should be subject to the incentives of a sound legal system; 4) FDA bans on information about off-label uses of drugs should be lifted; 5) the US should negatiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug and medical device approvals; and 6) incentives for investment in dynamic industries, like pharmaceuticals and medical devices, need to be enhanced. 25pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 Eighteenth Street, NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036, 202/785-0238.

Which Tax Reform Plan is Best for America? </b>, by Daniel J. Mitchell

Backgrounder No. 1055, The Heritage Foundation

Daniel Mitchell, McKenna senior fellow in political economy at The Heritage Foundation, analyzes and grades the six current proposals for major tax reform: the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Specter flat tax, value-added tax, national sales tax, Nunn-Domenici USA tax, and the Gephardt 10 percent tax. Mitchell evaluates the tax proposals on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly. This paper concludes that the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution senior fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest; direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. 16 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Eating Out Our Substance: How Taxation Affects Saving, </b> by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<br>
Policy Report No. 131, The Institute for Policy Innovation in cooperation with Center for the New West
<P>
Gary Robbins, John M. Olin senior research fellow at IPI, and Aldona Robbins, Bradley senior research fellow at IPI, find that in order to stimulate economic growth by increasing private savings, America's tax policy must be changed to remove the penalties on saving and investment. This report confirms that America's private saving rate has declined precipitously in recent years: between 1947 and 1994, private savings averaged 12.9 percent of aftertax income; today the savings rate hovers around 7 percent. The authors report that there is a significant historical relationship between the private saving rate and the tax treatment of capital: specifically, a 10 percent increase in the aftertax rate of return to capital will result in a 7-11 percent increase in saving. The authors conclude that reducing the difference between average and marginal tax rates will reduce the adverse effect of taxes on the economy, and moving to a system that ends the multiple taxation of capital will lead to higher rates of saving, labor productivity, and economic growth. 27 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, and John Silvia, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, examine the historical experience with the capital gains tax in the United States, as well as the finding of more than 50 economic studies on capital gains taxation. The authors conclude that a capital gains tax cut would: 1) substantially raise tax collections and increase tax payments by the rich; 2) increase the rate of capital formation, economic growth, and job creation throughout the year 2000; 3) unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of unrealized capital gains, thus promoting more efficient allocation of capital; and 4) expand economic opportunities for the most economically disadvantaged workers by bringing jobs and new businesses to capital-starved areas, such as America's inner cities. Finally, the study argues that the capital gains tax is so economically inefficient_because of its punitive effect on entrepreneurship, thrift, and investment_that the optimal economic policy for the United States would be to abolish the tax entirely. 63 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

John Tottie, policy analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, writes, "The Medicare Preservation Act of 1995 proposed by the House leadership provides just what President Clinton's trustees of the Medicare program recently called for, `prompt, effective, and decisive action' to save Medicare." Tottie lists the following nine aspects of the House plan as major improvements in the Medicare plan: 1) the plan saves Medicare from bankruptcy by reducing the rate of spending increases; 2) it offers many private-sector alternatives, including medical savings accounts; 3) it would make it possible to provide more benefits at no extra cost; 4) it would allow beneficiaries to limit their out-of-pocket spending; 5) it allows insurers to offer beneficiaries financial incentives to spend wisely; 6) it  reduces fraud, waste, and abuse in several different ways; 7) it reduces government subsidies to Medicare recipients who do not need them; 8) it reduces unnecessary bureacracy and high administrative costs; and 9) it enable beneficiaries to escape the rationing in government-run Medicare. The author contends the House plan results in a "win-win" proposition: a better Medicare system for beneficiaries and increased savings for taxpayers. 9 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

Under this plan, individuals would have to choose between the Medicare program and a private voucher system. For those who choose to opt out of the Medicare program, the voucher amounts could be used to purchase private health insurance coverage such as a managed care plan, a medical savings account (MSA), or any new product the market develops. Any remaining voucher balance would be deposited into an MSA and the balance could be withdrawn to pay for routine medical care, or saved for long-term care expenses.

FDA Inhibits Free Flow of Information On Medical Products, </b> by Alan R. Bennett and Mark E. Boulding

Alan Bennett and Mark Boulding practice food and drug law with Fox, Bennett & Turner, a Washington, DC health care and technology firm. Bennett and Boulding criticize the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approach to regulating information that manufacturers convey to purchasers on the comparative cost, value, and effectiveness of drugs and other medical therapies. The authors argue that the FDA's excessive control on this growing field, known as "pharacoeconomic analysis," threatens to chill innovation and prevent care providers from obtaining the best available products. 4 pp.

OSHA's New Litigation Strategy: How Employers Should React, </b> by Charles M. Chadd and Jerome K. Bowman
<br>
Charles Chadd and Jerome Bowman are partners in the Chicago law firm of Ross & Hardies, with a practice focusing on representing employers in OSHA enforcement matters. Chadd and Bowman examine changes in OSHA's approach to regulatory enforcement, which includes targeting more "bad actors," identifying certain cases early in the process for litigation, and requiring that the alleged law violators make changes in all their business locations. The paper also provides suggestions and strategies for how employers can adjust to the new policy. 4 pp.

Federal Court Upholds Protections Against Criminalization of Health Care Laws, </b> by Daniel Marino

Daniel Marino is a partner in the Washington, DC office of the law firm Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather & Geraldson specializing in civil and criminal trials. Marino argues that a federal appellate court decision positively affirms the general notion that one should not be held criminally liable for unknowingly or unintendedly violating vague laws. The author also notes that the case, which involved a prosecution under the anti-kickback laws, is especially significant for the health care industry because it offers some guidance on what actions are permissable under the law. 4 pp.

CIR Challenges Racial Quotas at UT Law School</b>
<br>
The Center is representing non-minority applicants to the University of Texas Law School in the first substantive constitutional challenge to racial preferences in student admission since Board of Regents v. Bakke (1978). In August 1994, a federal district judge in Austin, Texas held that certain aspects of the law school's admission process were unconstitutional. Specifically, the court held that the consideration of minority applicants by a separate minority admissions subcommittee deprived the plaintiffs of equal protection of the law. The court also noted in dicta that separate cut-off scores for minority applicants violated the equal protection clause. However, the court failed to award meaningful monetary or injunctive relief and the case is now pending on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.

CIR Sues Cornell University for Sexual Harassment Witch Hunt</b>
<br>
The Center has filed a complaint in Tompkins County court on behalf of James Maas, a respected psychology professor of 31 years at Cornell University. Four of Professor Maas' former students interpreted Maas' conduct towards them as sexual harassment and submitted complaints to the university. After five days of hearings and months of deliberation, the college's Professional Ethics Committee branded Maas as a sexual harasser. The Center seeks just compensation for, inter alia, the university's breach of its promise of confidentiality by conducting an all-out publicity campaign smearing Maas' reputation and the University's violation of its duty (under Title IX) to provide a fair and equitable resolution of student harassment complaints.

CIR Sues HUD Officials for Violating First Amendment</b>
<br>
The Center has filed a complaint in federal district court in the Northern District of California on behalf of residents of Berkeley, CA who were targets of a prolonged investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Berkeley residents had exercised their First Amendment right by opposing the government's proposed conversion of a nearby hotel to a homeless shelter. In response to the residents' constitutionally protected activities of publishing articles and circulating a newsletter explaining the problems with the project, HUD unleashed a lengthy investigation of the residents' activities. At one point, HUD offered to close the investigation in return for the residents' agreement not to engage in similar activities in the future. At issue in this case is whether the government's actions chilled the residents' First Amendment rights.

CIR Wins Sex Discrimination Appeal Before 4th Circuit</b>
<br>
The Center is representing five male professors at Virginia Commonwealth University who claimed sex discrimination when the school gave over $400,000 in raises to female professors in 1992. The school justified this special salary increase for women by pointing to the results of an internal "Salary Equity Study" which indicated that women made $1,900 per year less, on average, than men if one fails to take into account such factors as teaching performance, publications, teaching load, and service to the community. Last year, the U.S. District Court in Richmond granted summary judgment to VCU and dismissed the case in the eve of trial. However, on August 24, 1995, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision and ruled that the case should be heard by a jury.

Gayle Butcher v. Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals of Highland Beach, Maryland</b>

This appeal to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals raises the issue of whether local government can, through zoning reclassification, prohibit an owner from building a home on a lot in a fully developed subdivision. The zoning re-classification occurred two-and-a-half years after the Butchers purchased the property.

Thomas A. Ryan v. Golden Valley, Minnesota</b>

Defenders alleges that the refusal to zone Mr. Ryan's land as "commercial" has, in effect, "taken" his property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Mr. Ryan's land, currently zoned for residential use, is sandwiched between a commercial property and a recently constructed highway that handles an average of 100,000 vehicles per day. Although this makes the property ideal for light commercial uses, the local planning board is sticking with its 1915 residential designation. The only purpose served by keeping the current zoning is to provide a cheap, uncompensated way to create a "buffer zone" between the surrounding residential area and a nearby commercial district. Mr. Ryan's attempt at selling the property for residential development have been futile.  a

Landmark Representing Polly Williams and Low-Income Families in Milwaukee</b>
<br>
In a case promising to be ultimately decided by the United States Supreme Court, the Wisconsin Supreme Court is preparing to rule on the validity of religious school participation in the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. The program, the nation's first court-approved school choice plan, was expanded earlier this year to include religious schools. Landmark Legal Foundation represents Wisconsin state representative Polly Williams, the Milwaukee program's architect, and a group of families and students wishing to attend religious schools.
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently remanded the Miller case back to the trial court with instruction to vacate its earlier decision against Landmark's families. The Seventh Circuit order noted Landmark's "victory in the legislative forum" gave Milwaukee families "exactly what they sought" in the litigation.

NELF to Help Immigrant Workers in New Hampshire</b>
<br>
NELF will represent a group of New Hampshire women who sew garments in their homes. The Department of Labor (DOL) says these women are "employees" not "independent contractors." If DOL wins, these women will lose their jobs.
The case involves Gale River Designs ("Gale River"), a small clothing maker, located in Franconia, N.H. which makes garments for catalogue retailers such as Orvis and Motherwear. Gale River employs about 20 to 25 people at its offices and factory. In addition to 8 to 10 in-house workers, it contracts out sewing to about 16 at-home "sewers" in New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts.
Gale River ships unassembled pieces to the sewers who finish the garments and ship them back to Gale River. Sewers are paid on a piece-work basis. They estimate that their compensation works out to $12-15 per hour spent sewing, well above minimum wage. Most are women, some refugees, who simply cannot work outside the home because they live in remote locations or care for small children or elderly relatives. Home work for Gale River is their only employment option.
After a lengthy investigation DOL charged Gale River with $38,000 in minimum wage and overtime violations. If DOL succeeds, Gale River's costs will increase and it will have to use only in-house sewers. That will mean unemployment and a return to poverty for the sewers.

 NELF Brief Supports WalMart's Right to Enter Vermont</b>
<br>
NELF is filing an amicus brief with the Vermont Supreme Court challenging the Vermont Environmental Board's rejection of an application to construct a new WalMart in St. Albans, Vermont. The Board overruled local approvals of the project in order to impose on St. Albans its view of how the local economy should grow.
WalMart has secured a site in St. Albans already zoned for commercial use. It has obtained all required state and local permits, except the one required by ACT 250, Vermont's strict land use law. The citizens of St. Albans voted 7-1 in favor of WalMart in a recent, non-binding referendum. Nonetheless the state Environmental Board denied WalMart the needed Act 250 permit. The Board's main objection to WalMart is that the new store would have a negative "net economic impact." The Board credited two economists' testimony that WalMart's superior service and prices would cause the failure of nearby retailers. WalMart vigorously contests that projection. Even if true, that kind of impact is not within the Board's mandate nor is it a decision a state-wide agency should be making.
The Environmental Board was created to weight traditional environmental issues like wetlands or endangered species. By rejecting WalMart, the Board is seeking to transform itself into a super economic planning agency. Without any statutory authority, the Board wants the power to decide a new business is "negative" and bar it. NELF's brief will rebut the Board's right to impose its views on the local community. The people of St. Albans can use their zoning and planning powers to select the mix of large and small stores they want in the town. They have decided in favor of WalMart and the Board has no business second-guessing that decision.

 Court of Appeals Decides Preseault Case</b>
<br>
After almost two years of deliberation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. decided Paul Preseault's precedent-setting "takings" case. By a 2-1 vote, with a very strong dissent, the court held that Mr. Preseault was not entitled to compensation from the United States for the federal approval of a bike trail over an abandoned railroad line across his Vermont property.
The court relied on a 1920 law which, it held, put purchasers on notice that federal law might "someday" be changed to allow such conversions. Since trains continued to run over the Preseaults' land for 55 years after the 1920 act, the court seems to be, as the dissent put it, attempting to duck the constitutional issue. When this case was last in the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested Mr. Preseault was entitled to compensation. NELF is drafting a petition to return the case to the Court, the only forum where the appeals court's error can be corrected.

Tight Restrictions Sought on LSC-Funded Representation in Drug Evictions</b>
<br>
In one city after another, efforts by public housing managers to stop drug dealing and drug abuse in low-income housing projects have repeatedly been frustrated by federally-funded legal services attorneys, who have used the courts to prevent evictions of tenants engaged in drug activity. In response to a recent Legal Services Corporation proposal to restrict the ability of legal services attorneys to represent public housing tenants who are being evicted for drug activity, WLF argued that the LSC's proposal did not go nearly far enough. WLF pointed out that the proposal would prohibit such representations only in cases where (1) an actual criminal prosecution for drug activity has been initiated, (2) the particular drug activity forming the basis of the prosecution threatened the health or safety of public housing residents or workers, and (3) the leaseholder is the person being prosecuted, not another member of the leaseholder's household (such as a relative or boyfriend). WLF argued that these limitations should be removed from the proposed rule because they make the overall prohibition essentially toothless.

On behalf of itself, the Center for Equal Opportunity, and the Allied Educational Foundation, WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court opposing a Texas redistricting plan for congressional seats in Texas v. Vera. WLF argued that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from intentionally drawing district boundaries along racial lines. The evidence indicates that the Texas plan was drawn based on racial considerations to segregate black, Hispanic, and so-called "Anglo" voters. The Court's decision in the Texas case is expected to answer questions left open by the racial gerrymandering decisions of last June.

In Faverty v.

The lower court had agreed with the plaintiff's argument that McDonald's should have known the 18-year-old employee would be too tired to drive home safely after the shift. WLF argued that an employer is normally not liable for the off-duty, off-premises acts of its employees.

OSHA Encouraged to Recognize Privilege for Self-Evaluations</b>

WLF filed a petition for rulemaking with OSHA urging the agency to adopt a policy against seeking employers' internal evaluations or audits of workplace conditions. WLF argued that OSHA policy should reflect that these self-evaluations are indispensable to improving the health and safety of American workers. OSHA has created a powerful barrier to such initiatives by failing to recognize a privilege of confidentiality for employers' self-critical audits of workplace conditions. The petition also points out that OSHA has extensive record-keeping requirements and inspection powers with which to identify violations, without the need to deter self-evaluations.

<title>Heritage Foundation - September Insider - Hammering Out Welfare Reform in the Conference Committee</title>

<h2>October <i>Insider</i>: Hammering Out Welfare Reform in the Conference Committee</h2></center><p>
by Rick Dearborn, Director of Congressional Relations, U.S. Senate at The Heritage Foundation<br>
<hr>
<br>

Last week the U.S. Senate passed a welfare reform package that was solid on creating strong work requirements, but was weaker than the House of Representatives' version on the debate over curtailing the rampant illegitimacy rate. Both bills will now go to a conference, possibly lasting well into November, between both houses in order to iron out the differences.
Unless the Senate accedes to the House on its provisions denying additional monies to teenage welfare mothers who continue to have children, the bill that comes out of conference is likely to do little to discourage illegitimacy. On the flip side of the coin, it will be in the best interests of the U.S. taxpayer for the House to adopt the Senate's position on work requirements for able-bodied individuals on the public dole. <P>
The Senate provisions on work contain an important provision not currently found in the House bill, known as pay for performance.This provision states that welfare recipients may not receive their direct cash benefits until completing the work requirements. Under current law, if welfare recipients worked 80 percent of their required hours there would be no commensurate reduction in benefits. Special hearings to bring hours paid in line with hours worked nearly always favor the welfare recipients. The Senate bill does away with this problem by forcing welfare workers to do their work first and then be paid on the basis of how many hours they have completed. The House bill lacks the same commitment to stricter work requirements.<P>
Despite efforts by Senators Faircloth, Gramm, and Ashcroft, the Senate welfare reform package did not incorporate House reforms intended to ameliorate the problems of illegitimacy (many of which were first proposed by Heritage senior analyst Robert Rector). These three Senators fought hard for the inclusion of many of their bill's provisions. Among the amendments offered by the Faircloth/Gramm/Ashcroft team, expected to be issues in the conference committee, were policy proposals to cut off additional funds for teenage welfare mothers who continue to have children out-of-wedlock; provisions to deny only federal funds, not state funds, to minor mothers who are currently eligible to receive direct cash benefits in the mail or down at the social welfare center on the condition that they have children out-of-wedlock; a provision known as the illegitimacy ratio, that would provide an additional block grant to reward those states who curtail their ever-rising illegitimacy rate without increasing the rate of abortions within their state; and applying a four-day a-month work requirement to single, able-bodied males who currently receive food stamps and do not do any work.<P>
Although the illegitimacy ratio was adopted in the Senate bill, and a modified amendment regarding work requirements for food stamp recipients offered by Senator Jesse Helms was accepted, the denial of federal cash benefits to unwed teenagers, and the denial of federal cash benefits to welfare mothers who continue to have additional children (family cap) were not accepted by the U.S. Senate. <P>
The House conferees will be fighting to include their family cap provision. The Senate appointees appear unlikely to support the family cap but are likely to fight for stricter versions of workfare.<P>
 
Because of the many contentious items in both the House and Senate bills, the key to getting a strong reform proposal will be the appointment of conferees to the welfare Conference Committee. The House leadership plans to appoint members who are strong on both the work and illegitimacy issues. If Senator Dole places reform-minded individuals committed to solving America's welfare dilemma on the conference committee, he will help ensure that the end result will be a solid welfare reform package.

<b>Fatherless America</b>, by David Blankenhorn<br>
234 pp. BasicBooks, 1995
<P>
In <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn does not just list the repercussions of an ever-widening void of fathers in this country, he explains in frightening detail how society now regards fathers as superfluous. America  now has a society where the nuclear family is a rarity and divorce and single motherhood are commonplace. Now, children of fragmented families represent today's young generation. And unless this trend is reversed, nothing will repair the damage of fatherlessness. No amount of economic growth, welfare reform, prison construction, or school reform can cure the deeply rooted problems of male violence and lack of child well-being. Domestic policy reforms will fail when enacted upon a weak family structure. What can be done to restore and encourage strong two-parent families? Blankenhorn first discusses how the choices Americans made over the last few decades have denigrated traditional fatherhood. Then he elaborates on how these often selfish choices have not only affected society's perception of fatherhood, but have made them acceptable -- if not ideal. <P>

According to Blankenhorn, the fatherless crisis began during and after World War II when draft quotas could no longer be filled by only single men and married men without children. The Selective Service had to turn to fathers (approximately 6 million men) to fulfill their needs. During the war years,  fathers left home out of duty and loyalty to their country, and their memories were kept alive in a more positive light. Today's fathers, however, are largely absent from the home by choice. When fathers die due to illness or are killed at war their presence still looms over their children. The 1940s child could say: "My father had to leave for a while to do something important." The 1990s child must say: "My father left me permanently because he wanted to." This fatherless crisis did have  negative effects on the family, because many men came home feeling ill-prepared for fatherhood (in some cases the children were born while they were away) and many women had to find work in factories in order to survive. These circumstances sometimes led to tensions in the home, separation, or divorce. But this was only the first tier of problems that brought us to our situation today. The second fatherless crisis is more of "an unorganized dispersal of men for private purposes, regrettable but acceptable."<P>

Blankenhorn gives analysis of several types of fathers as viewed in academia and described by the media: the Deadbeat Dad, the Visiting Father, the Sperm Father, the Stepfather, and the Nearby Guy. Mr. Blankenhorn devotes the most insightful evaluation of the deadbeat dad in the wake of his notorious villain status in society that began in the late 1980s. Yet, as Blankenhorn points out, the deadbeat dad is really a caricature of the traditional male role. Even though he is absent, he is expected to be a provider. However, the new father (the cultural experts' ideal father) repudiates the traditional male role because he is more concerned about being a partner than worrying about monetary gain for his family. The descriptions of the new father and the deadbeat dad, as defined by the scholars and perpetuated in the media, obviously contradict one another. The distinct message coming from the "wanted: deadbeat dads" signs is that absent fathers can still be fathers as long as they write the checks. The deadbeat  dad is essentially the unnecessary father who refuses to pay. And "from the child's perspective, child-support payments, even if fully paid, do not replace a father's economic provision. More fundamentally, they do not replace a father." The necessity to hunt for deadbeat dads is tragic. What is even worse is the fact that we just want their money, not everything else that fatherhood provides for children. The money will allow for some things the children need and places they want to go, but only mothers and fathers can help shape children's character.<P>

 The danger in the status quo is making these lowered standards permanent. Mr. Blankenhorn illustrates that defeatist attempts to solve the problems of single motherhood lack an understanding of the root causes of fatherlessness in this country. The most important aspect of parenthood, "development of competence and character in children," needs to be understood first before any policy is initiated. One parent cannot do that alone: "If fatherhood has anything to say to men, it is that human completion is not a solo act."<P>

Blankenhorn offers a dozen initiatives to help inject the value of fatherhood back into communities. He suggests: the President should give an annual report on the state of fatherhood; communities should ask married fathers play a part in transforming public housing; Congress should pass a resolution stating that the first question of policymakers regarding all domestic legislation is whether it will strengthen or weaken the institution of marriage; well-known professional athletes could be drafted to promote the virtues of fatherhood; and prominent family scholars could write new textbooks for high school students about marriage and parenthood. Blankenhorn admits that his proposals are not answers, but attempts to ask a new question: "Does our society wish to recover the fatherhood idea?" If the answer is no, then proposals like his will go nowhere. But if the answer is yes, then his proposals will at the very least lead us  away from "a culture of fatherlessness" to a culture of fatherhood.<P>

 by Andy F. Messing, Jr. and Allen B. Hazelwood<br>
Issue Alert, National Defense Council Foundation<P>

The National Defense Council Foundation re-issues this updated report on why and how America should support democratic insurgencies, based on the premise that efforts in the 1980s were predominately failures. The report examines several insurgent movements, America's commitment considerations, and the dynamics and logistics of insurgency welfare. Additionally, the authors address the implementation of insurgent conflict and how its phases affect an insurgent effort. 39 pp. CONTACT: National Defense Council Foundation, 1220 King Street, Suite 230, Alexandria, VA 22314, 703/836-3443,  fax 703/836-5402.

<b>Dirty Tricks or Trump Card: US Covert Action and Counterintelligence</b><br>
 by Roy Godson<br>
National Strategy Information Center, Inc.<P>
Roy Godson, professor of government at Georgetown University, contends that covert operations are the missing element in the discussions about the future of US intelligence. Godson traces the history of US covert action and counterintelligence as well as its successes and failures. This volume suggests that the potential uses of covert action and counterintelligence amid new security challenges have rarely been discussed. Godson states that, although controversial, covert operations can be seen as simply one among many instruments of foreign policy_that they are neither "exceptional tools nor magic bullets." 342 pp. CONTACT: Kelley Beagher, Brassey's, 1313 Dolly Madison Blvd., Suite 401, McLean, VA 22101, 703/442-4535,  fax 703/442-9848.

<b>How to Close Down the Department of Commerce</b><br>
 by Joe Cobb<br>
Backgrounder No. 1049, The Heritage Foundation<P>

Joe Cobb, Heritage's John M. Olin senior fellow in economics, notes that the 1996 budget resolution's call for the elimination of the US Department of Commerce is both symbolic of the change in philosophy in Congress and a practical proposal to restructure a collection of programs and agencies that have little reason to share a common organizational structure. Cobb supports Congress's idea of closing the Department of Commerce, suggesting that the Department is "little more than a collection of disparate programs" which are beyond reinvention. This paper notes that the Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet departments. Cobb's recommendations include the following: a) close down the Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration; b) consolidate the Bureau of the Census and other federal statistical agencies, including the Economics and Statistical Administration, within a single new independent agency; c) transfer trade functions to the Treasury Department, including the International Trade Administration; d) close the domestic offices of the US and Foreign Commercial Service; e) establish the Patent and Trademark Office as an independent corporation; and f) privatize the National Technical Information Service. Cobb supports allowing the Department, which would be the first in history to be dismantled, three years to terminate programs, reassign civil service personnel, and dispose of surplus property. 23 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>How to Privatize Orange County's Airports</b> by Robert W. Poole, Jr.<br>
Policy Study No. 194, Reason Foundation<p>

Robert Poole, president of the Reason Foundation, cites two major problems with Orange County's decision to sell John Wayne Airport: 1) the potential of serious competition from a future airport at El Toro, which might prematurely draw traffic away from John Wayne; and 2) the likelihood of litigation by the airlines who contend that a municipality may not legally make use of the proceeds from the sale of an existing federally aided airport. This study identifies several different types of airport privatization, including contract management, lease, and sale, and outlines the legal status of each with respect to federal grants and constraints. Poole recommends two types of privatization, in a coordinated fashion, to solve Orange County's dilemma_the county should seek a single firm that will enter into two separate agreements: 1) a long-term contract to manage John Wayne airport and 2) a purchase or lease agreement under which the firm will develop a commercial airport at El Toro. The author notes that development of the latter will be closely coordinated with future activities at the former, to ensure the continued financial viability of John Wayne Airport through the years needed to retire its outstanding bonds. 15 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>Designing a Comprehensive State-Level Privatization Program: How-To Guide #1</b><br>
 by William D. Eggers<br>
Washington Institute for Policy Studies<P>

William Eggers, director of the Reason Foundation's privatization center, presents this guide as the first in a series of seven  on the topic of state government privatization. Eggers recommends that states develop comprehensive, forward-looking privatization programs rather than adopting piecemeal approaches. This paper offers nine basic steps for designing a systematic, comprehensive program: 1) develop the institutional structure for privatization; 2) set up a program of adjustments and incentives for public employees; 3) identify privatization techniques; 4) identify state services and assets that offer opportunities for privatization; 5) determine the legislative and executive barriers to privatization and revise or rescind these; 6) consider introducing mandatory competitive incentives into the delivery of certain state and local services; 7) evaluate the feasibility of privatizing identified privatization opportunities; 8) determine the potential cost savings from privatizing services and assets selected for privatization; and 9) prepare a plan for implementation. 28 pp. CONTACT: Washington Institute for Policy Studies, 999 Third Ave., Suite 1060, Seattle, WA 98104, 206/467-9561.<P>


<b>A National ID System: Big Brother's Solution to Illegal Immigration</b><br>
 by John J. Miller and Stephen Moore<br>
Policy Analysis No. 237, Cato Institute<p>

John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, and Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, describe the efforts by some legislators in the House and Senate to create a national computer registration system for all American workers as "Orwellian." Miller and Moore write, "The computer registry and national ID card, which would confer on the federal government vast new police-state powers, is highly incompatible with the Republican theme of expanding freedom and reducing government." This paper cites three major problems with the current proposals: 1) the identification system could be easily expanded to include other purposes beyond deterring illegal immigration, such as implementation of Clinton-style health security card, conducting background checks on individuals, and enforcing affirmative action laws and other government regulations; 2) the system would cost the federal government between $3 billion and $6 billion per year to administer; and 3) error rates that are commonplace for government databases would lead to hundreds of thousands of Americans being denied legal access to the workforce. The authors conclude that a computer registry would impose large costs on American citizens in terms of both dollars and lost liberties. 23 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.<P>

<b>How to Solve Mandatory Auto Insurance</B><br>
 by John Semmens<br>
Issue Analysis Report No. 5, Goldwater Institute<P>

John Semmens, winner of the Goldwater Institute's Reinventing Government competition in 1994, proposes privatizing automobile registration and driver's licenses. In this plan, private insurance companies license drivers and register automobiles, allowing drivers to deal with a single, private agency. Semmens also proposes requiring full insurance for drivers that insurance companies choose to cover, stating that private registration, along with full coverage of drivers, is likely to do a better job of taking irresponsible drivers off the road and make those who cause accidents fully liable for the dollar damage they cause. The author criticizes the current system for allowing underinsured and uninsured motorists to escape liability for much of the damage they cause to others and their property. Semmens contends that uninsured motorists will be easy to identify since they will have no privately issued license tag. 10 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

<b>Taxpayer Choice: A Common Sense Solution to the Crisis of the Welfare State</b><br>
 by John C. Goodman<br>
Issue Analysis Report No. 4, Goldwater Institute<p>

John Goodman, the 1995 John M. Olin winter fellow at the Goldwater Institute, offers evidence that the only way to reform welfare is to end the federal government's monopoly on welfare tax dollars. In order to combat the perverse incentives inherent to the current welfare programs, Goodman recommends allowing individual taxpayers to give up to 40 percent of their personal income taxes (the amount currently spent on federal welfare programs) to any qualified charity, public or private. According to the author's plan, the government would then be required to subtract a dollar from public welfare programs for every dollar given. 51 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

<B>Combatting Illegitimacy and Counseling Teen Abstinence: A Key Component of Welfare Reform</B><BR>
 by Joseph J. Piccione and Robert A. Scholle<BR>
Backgrounder No. 1051, The Heritage Foundation<p>

Joseph Piccione and Robert Scholle, both former policy analysts in the Office of Population Affairs in the US Department of Health and Human Services during the Bush administration, address the role of soaring illegitimacy rates in America's social fabric. The authors recommend abandoning the pragmatic "contraceptive approach" to adolescent pregnancy. Instead the authors support the "abstinence approach," which incorporates the basic cultural and psychological realities of the transition to adulthood. Piccione and Scholle support a three-pronged approach for young people to avoiding poverty and dependency: complete high-school; get a job, even a low paying one; and have children only within marriage. The authors recommend funding education for such a program with $200 million in block grants to the states through the Maternal and Child Health Services. 21 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>What Welfare Should Be</b><br>
 by Larry P. Arnn and Thomas G. West<br>
California Journal July 1995, The Claremont Institute<p>

Larry Arnn, president of The Claremont Institute, and Thomas West, a senior fellow at The Claremont Institute, posits the question, "What should be the welfare system of California 25 years from now?" The article answers the question with ideas that support family and work, respect for education and marriage, disdain for illegitimacy and compassion for the deserving poor. The authors write, "It [California's welfare system] must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and organizations; in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy. In short, it must be everything the current system is not." 4 pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825.<P>

<b>Reforming Medicaid</b><BR>
 by James R. Cantwell<br>
Policy Report No. 197, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>
James Cantwell of the Congressional Budget Office argues that any attempt to balance the budget will be futile without reforming Medicaid. Cantwell presents six steps to achieve Medicaid savings of $185.4 billion over seven years without any reduction in benefits for needy people: 1) changing incentives for recipients through Medical Savings Accounts and/or managed care would produce a $37.2 billion savings in acute care programs and $64 billion in long term care; 2) enforcing estate recovery provisions would produce savings of $35 billion; 3) redirecting and capping disproportionate share hospital payments would produce savings of $13.9 billion; 4) reducing administrative costs would produce a savings of $3.7 billion; 5) making Medicaid the payer of last resort would produce savings of $31.5 billion; and 6) reducing waste, fraud, and abuse through greater state vigilance would produce savings of an unknown but substantial amount. This paper presents statistical evidence and analysis for each of the points, concluding that the savings for seven years would total at least $185.4 billion. 14 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>FDA Censorship Can Be Hazardous to Your Health</b><br>
 by David R. Henderson<br>
Policy Brief No. 158, Center for the Study of American Business<p>

David Henderson, adjunct fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is censoring valuable information about drugs that could help doctors treat their patients more effectively. Henderson reports that the FDA routinely challenges drug companies that distribute articles from medical journals reporting positive, but not necessarily FDA-approved, uses of their drugs. According to the author, no matter how close the recommended off-label use is to an approved use, the FDA's Division of Drug Marketing will stop a drug company from sending out medical journal articles that recommend, or even mention such an application. Henderson notes that 40 to 50 percent of all drugs are prescribed for off-label uses. This paper suggest that this new, expanded role of the FDA is the result of bureaucratic ingenuity, not congressional action, which could result in the loss of life. Henderson endorses eliminating the role of the FDA as a censor for advertising, returning this function to the Federal Trade Commission, which was responsible for this regulation before 1962. 17 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.<P>

<b>Outcome-Based Education: Miracle Cure or Plague?</b><br>
 by Brunno V. Manno<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy and Hudson Institute<P>
Brunno Manno, a senior fellow in Hudson's education policy studies program, attempts to explain why enormous conflicts over outcome-based education exist, suggesting that the original intent of outcome-based education was productive. Manno maintains that when states began efforts to institute these programs, they turned over the crucial task of defining outcomes over to the very education establishment figures threatened by the process. Having adopted in principle the focus on results (originally intended to be academic results), the educators presented lists of outcomes that emphasized values, attitudes and behavior, and often reflect quasi-political or ideologically correct positions. Dr. Manno shows how this process occurred in various states, then proposes a twofold policy strategy that provides a way out of the dilemma: establish high, uniform academic standards and a system of accountability with real consequences for success and failure; and create greater diversity in the kinds of schools we finance, how we pay for them, and the ways educators provide solid academic achievement, with parents free to choose the schools that best meet their needs. 24 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b>Teacher, Inc.: A Private-Practice Option for Educators</b><br>
 by Janet R. Beales<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy and Reason Foundation<P>
Janet Beales, policy analyst with the education studies program of the Reason Foundation, discusses private-practice teacher contracts as an option to schools and communities looking for new ways to provide education. Beales describes private-practice teachers as professional educators who provide their services to schools or other entities, on a contract basis, helping school officials strengthen accountability, cut costs, and increase flexibility. In turn, according to the author, the contract arrangement elevates the professional status of teachers, allowing teachers to take control of their own careers, negotiate their own compensation, and make their own decisions about how to use time, resources and methodologies. This study profiles the experiences of a number of private-practice educators and discusses the benefits that schools may realize by contracting for instruction. In addition, this study presents results from two national surveys about the legal authority of school boards to contract for instruction and also provides a chart to help administrators identify the fully allocated costs of in-house and contract service. 23 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b>Where the Connoisseurs Send Their Children to School</b><br>
 by Denis P. Doyle<br>
Hudson Briefing Paper No. 181, Hudson Institute<P>

Denis Doyle, president of his own education research organization, an analyst at The Heritage Foundation and formerly associated with the Hudson Institute, asserts that public school teachers and administrators are in a unique position to assess the quality of public education for their own children. Doyle writes, "The data is clear: in the largest urban areas, public school teachers are more likely than the population at large to enroll their children in private schools. By and large it is the poor and dispossessed, particularly in large, troubled urban areas, who are forced into the nation's public schools. But these schools are so unattractive that the teachers pay significant sums of money to send their children elsewhere. 12 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>The Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195): Key Changes Will Improve Potential for Serious Agriculture Reform</b><br>
by John Frydenlund<br>
Issue Bulletin No. 211, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
John Frydenlund, director of Heritage's Agriculture Policy Project, praises the Freedom to Farm Act as a good first step toward reforming agricultural policy. Frydenlund points out that the bill accomplishes several significant goals: replacing traditional payments for commodity programs with transition payments that decline over a period of seven years; eliminating supply controls; and extricating the federal bureaucracy from the decision-making process of planting requirements. Frydenlund, however, makes several recommendations to strengthen the Act and to dramatically reform the current system:1) specify an exact date when programs will end, preferably no later that the year 2001, by deauthorizing current law; 2) prevent transition payments from becoming an unjustified windfall by specifying a trigger or price level for each commodity that would reduce or eliminate transition payments for a given year; and 3) eliminate the Conservation Reserve Program or at least drastically reduce the number of acres in the program. He suggests two methods for assuring that reforms embodied in the Freedom to Farm Act and other proposals are not circumvented: cap annual Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) spending at levels provided in the budget resolution and reduce CCC borrowing authority from $30 billion to $15 billion. Frydenlund forecasts that these changes will greatly improve and provide long-term reform for the agricultural system in America. 5 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>A Contract with Rural America</b><br>

Dennis Avery, director of Hudson's Center for Global Food Issues, and Dave Juday, an agricultural businessman, observe that increasing budget restraints no longer allow Washington to hand prosperity to America's farmers by way of farm subsidies. The authors write, "Changes in US agricultural tax, trade, and regulatory policies could enhance the nation's rural prosperity quickly, not only for farmers but for off-farm rural residents who have too often been driven from their communities by cropland setasides." In order to correct the problems created by current agricultural policies, the authors  suggest that Congress broaden the focus of farm policy by passing an eleven point Contract with Rural America. The eleven points would focus on regulatory and tax relief and expanded trade opportunities. 8 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>Turning a Profit on Public Forests</b><br>
 by Donald R. Leal<br>
PERC Policy Series No. PS-4, Political Economy Research Center
<P>
Donald Leal, senior associate at PERC, suggests that the Forest Service could save money by following policies similar to those those that govern the operation of county and state forests. Leal presents the findings from his studies of the economic and environmental performance of county and state foresters in Minnesota and Montana compared with that of Forest Service lands in the same region. Leal made comparisons between Superior National Forest and the St. Louis County forestlands and found that the county made more than $2 million from timber sales while Superior lost over $5 million on timber sales. Independent experts rated the county's environmental practices higher than that of the Forest Service. 26 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Ave., Suite 211, Bozeman, MT 59715, 406/587-9591.

<b>Cleaning Up Superfund: The Case for State Environmental Leadership</b><br>
by J. Winston Porter<br>
Policy Study No. 195, Reason Foundation
<P>

Winston Porter, president of the Waste Policy Center, describes the Superfund program as one of the nation's most visible site remediation programs. Since the inception of Superfund in 1980, the program has received many criticisms, especially given that only 150 of the 1,300 designated sites have been cleaned in 15 years. According to the author, an undeservedly large portion of the funds have been used for legal proceedings. Porter examines an alternative approach to Superfund; the author recommends allowing the states to deal with the sites_at a fraction of the time and costs. Currently states are spending about $700 million annually working on about 11,000 sites, while the EPA spends approximately $1 billion annually dealing with about 1,000 sites. In this study, the author briefly reviews Superfund and the similar programs of the states; presents how-to steps to turn much of Superfund over to willing and able states; and recommends methods of state certification, funding provisions, EPA's continued role, and modification of the Superfund statute. 14 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>Superfund Unplugged</b><br>
by Wayne T. Brough<br>
Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy
<P>
Wayne T. Brough, director of research for Citizens for a Sound Economy, contends that the Superfund program_created in the wake of public concerns over toxic wastes at Love Canal_imposes billions of dollars in costs on consumers and local communities while providing few benefits in return. Brough suggests that the program's liability rules delay the clean-up process and impose inequitable costs on businesses and communities. Brough states, "The Superfund program requires fundamental reforms that implement sound risk management practices and a more cost-effective allocation of resources. At the same time, liability rules should be changed to eliminate perverse incentives that divert resources from environmental cleanups." This paper outlines the basics of Superfund reform as follows: allow states to play a greater role; privatize as many sites as possible; repeal retroactive liability; reform joint and several liability; institute no new taxes for Superfund; utilize risk based management and sound science; and create new mechanisms of public finance. 19 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

<b>Progressive Environmentalism: Principles for Regulatory Reform</b><br>
by Kent Jeffreys<br>
Policy Report No. 194, National Center for Policy Analysis
<P>

Kent Jeffreys, senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, argues that the solution for current environmental problems requires the government to act in accordance with certain pre-defined rules before enacting environmental legislation or approving any environmental regulations. The author suggests the following guidelines: 1) The Federalism Rule, which would require that all regulatory decisions be made by the smallest possible government entity; 2) The Cost-Benefit Rule, which requires that objective studies weigh the benefits against the costs of new regulations; and 3) The Compensation Rule, which requires the government to compensate innocent property owners for the loss of property rights or non-negligible losses of value. This study examines abuses of the three rules cited above in specific federal environmental programs and explores solutions that would bring the programs into compliance with the rules. 44 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Making Government Work: How Congress Can Really Reinvent Government</b><br> by Donald J. Devine<br>
Backgrounder No. 1050, The Heritage Foundation<P>

Donald Devine, former director of the US Office of Personnel Management and adjunct scholar at Heritage, recommends that the federal government should "return to the pre-Carter system of decentralized authority." Devine describes several problems with the administration's current proposals to reinvent government, writing that the plan: will weaken policies on hiring, promoting, and rewarding federal employees based on individual merit and performance; will eliminate presidential standards for job performance; will enhance federal agency and union control over setting salary levels; will weaken long-standing "veterans preference" standards; and will create a new role for federal unions that would undermine management authority for defining and assigning work. Devine makes specific recommendations for defining government's proper functions: devolve power to the states; define agency missions; privatize government functions; protect the merit system; establish responsibility; clarify rules; re-establish merit selection; make the hiring process rational; re-establish pay for performance; rationalize federal benefits; end duplication stop Clinton's devaluation of management responsibility; and consolidate the management of federal resources. 18 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>Campaign Finance Regulation: Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences</B><br> by Bradley A. Smith<br>
Policy Analysis No. 238, Cato Institute<P>

Bradley Smith, assistant professor at Capital University Law School in Ohio, acknowledges that while efforts to limit political contributions and spending are extremely popular, no evidence exists that campaign finance regulation has achieved or will achieve its goals of reducing the influence of money, opening up the political system, and lowering the costs of campaigns. The author maintains that efforts to limit contributions and spending have been based on two faulty assumptions: that candidates spend too much per vote (total spending for candidates for all offices is less than $10 per eligible voter every two years) and that large donations are undemocratic (most challenges to the status quo and most working-class political movements have been financed by wealthy donors). Smith argues that, "Our current campaign finance regulations favor incumbents, stifle grassroots activity, distort and constrict political debate, and infringe on traditional First Amendment freedoms. There is little reason to believe that still more regulation and public funding will yield positive results." 26 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.<P>

<B>Microcosm of the Movement: Local Term Limits in the United States</b><BR> by Danielle Fagre<br>
Term Limits Outlook Series Vol. IV No. 2, US Term Limits Foundation<P>
Danielle Fagre, research director of the US Term Limits Foundation, questions why municipal term limits are the least documented, yet most prevalent component of the term limit movement. The author uses municipal term limits, which date back to 1851, as an example of the longevity of the term limit movement, despite opponents claims that the movement is a fad. This paper examines the municipal term limits in New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, San Francisco, Kansas City, New Orleans, Denver, Cincinnati and suggests that these local limits are a microcosm of the national term limit movement. 16 pp. CONTACT: U.S. Term Limit Foundation, 1511 K St., NW, Suite 540, Washington, DC 20005, 800/733-6440, fax 202/393-6434.

<B>Only A Piece of Paper?: The Social Significance of the Marriage License and The Consequences of Cohabitation, Divorce and Stepfamilies</b><br> by Glenn T. Stanton<br>
Focus on the Family<P>

Glenn Stanton, a social research analyst for the public policy division of Focus on the Family, presents a compilation of statistical data, gathered since the 12th century, which reveals that marriage matters in the lives of children, adults, and societies. The results consistently show that marriage improves the physical and mental health as well as the  longevity of men and women. On the whole, this data shows that married people do better in every measure of specific and general well-being than their unmarried counterparts. The research reveals information about the benefits of marriage, the disadvantages of cohabitation, and the effects of remarriage and stepfamilies. Stanton concludes that, based on the statistical evidence, it is critical to rediscover a cultural norm for family life in America and hold it up as an ideal. Stanton writes, "The ideal should be the traditional two-parent family where mother and father strive for a healthy marriage and both participate in the daily care and nurturing of their biological or adopted children." 36 pp. CONTACT: Focus on the Family, 8605 Explorer Dr., Colorado Springs, CO 80920, 719/531-3400.<p>

<b>Multiculturalism and Economic Growth</b><br> by Gerald W. Scully<br>
Policy Report No. 196, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>

Gerald Scully, senior fellow of the National Center for Policy Analysis, contradicts conventional wisdom by acknowledging that the work of most anthropologists identifies cultural diversity as a universal source of social conflict and often as a barrier to economic progress as well as personal freedom. Scully finds that cultural relativism has made the study of the role of culture in human progress controversial, but he points out that intergroup enmity is widespread in culturally heterogeneous societies. This study shows that cultural diversity and a lack of economic freedom go hand in hand. Scully writes, "For all its problems, the West has managed cultural conflict better than the rest of the world because it has free economic, civil and political institutions...despite this success, we are moving away from the notion of individual freedom to that of group rights in the United States." Based on his study of cultural conflict and economic progress, Scully recommends that the Third World move towards freer economic institutions and a reduction of cultural heterogeneity to transform its economic progress. 19 pp., CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>How Hollywood Typecasts Blacks, Families and Christians</b><br>
National Minority Politics, September 1995<p>

The September issue of National Minority Politics offers its readers a series of articles by Gwen Richardson, Stanley Crouch, and Gary Bauer on how Hollywood portrays blacks, families, and Christians. Richardson cites the bias with which Hollywood portrays blacks, usually as crooks, pimps, informers, or persons needing assistance from the government. Furthermore, an examination of attempts to discredit the family finds that Hollywood usually puts a positive spin on homosexuality, premarital sex, illegitimacy, parental disrespect, and anti-Christian bigotry. Stanley Crouch examines the historical evolution of black images in films and television, from the early 1900s to the present. Gary Bauer dissects Hollywood's typecasting of traditional families and Christians. CONTACT: National Minority Politics, 5757 Westheimer Rd., Suite 3-296, Houston, TX 77057-9764, 713/444-4265.<P>

<h3>Defenders of Property Rights</h3>

<B>Defenders Moves Forward with an Aggressive Litigation Program</B><P>

Defenders has been engaged by the United Property Owners of Washington (UPOW) to serve as co-counsel in the case of United States v. Washington. At issue is an 1850s treaty between the then-territorial governor and sixteen Indian tribes regarding the harvesting of shellfish. Even though most of the tideland area of Washington is privately owned (it is one of only a few states with such private ownership) and has been tended and enhanced over the years by its owners, the tribes and the federal government believe that certain Indian tribes share the right to harvest the shellfish. In an interim order, a federal district judge awarded the tribes the ability to take half the harvest. The tribes and the government, however, are seeking a larger take of the shellfish and full access to the tidelands. UPOW has intervened in the hope of protecting their right of "exclusive possession and clear title" to their property.<P>

<b>Defenders Fights Charge of Hunter Harassment</B><P>

Defenders has also filed a complaint in a state court in Minnesota seeking just compensation on behalf of a property owner. In James F. Peternell v. State of Minnesota, the private property owner was criminally prosecuted for attempting to exclude state officials from his property. Mr. Peternell bought 160 acres of land in 1972, 140 of which are considered wetland. A 1984 state law designated the wetland area as a "protected water basin," making it "public waters." Although he had previously been told by the Department of Natural Resources that his land was still privately-owned, he was later indicted on charges of "hunter harassment" when he tried to remove uninvited hunters--including an undercover DNR official--from his land. While the criminal charges against Mr. Peternell were dismissed by a jury, a court did find that his land can now be considered public domain under the 1984 law.<P>

<B>Defenders Supports Rights of Hog Farmer</B><P>

In City of Chesapeake v. Earl Warren, Defenders represents a hog farmer in Virginia. The city officials have now decided that his hog farm constitutes a "public nuisance", even though his land has been used for over 120 years and he follows sound industry practices on his farm. At stake in this case is the extent to which local governments can characterize historically typical and productive uses of land as a "nuisance" (as the city has in this case by passage of an ordinance directed at his activities) and thereby destroy that use of land without incurring the constitutional duty to pay the owner just compensation for that taking. On September 8, 1995, the court rejected the government's request for a permanent injunction that would have shut down the hog farm and instead offered to work with the property owner in an attempt to remedy the situation short of closing down the farm. Another hearing has been set for December 7, 1995.<P>

<B>Defenders Challenges Gas Company</B><P>

In Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation v. Deana Wingfield Drain, Defenders is challenging in federal court the utility company's practice of unilaterally expanding its right-of-way from 8 inches to 50 feet without compensating property owners for that taking. In this case, Columbia Gas forced the property owners to move their mobile home and shed (both of which were anchored to cement foundations) out of the newly-claimed right-of-way, at their own expense. Moreover, the enforcement of the right-of-way has been selective; in fact, one home actually sits atop the gas line but those home owners have not been asked to move the house. Discovery is underway in the case.
On September 20, 1995, Defenders will be filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, asking the court to review the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court. At issue in the case, United Employer Benefit Corporation v. Department of Insurance and Finance (Oregon), is whether personal property is protected to the same degree as is land against uncompensated takings and also whether threats which have the effect of destroying an ongoing business trigger the duty of government to pay for the taking.
Defenders will also file a brief on behalf of itself and other co-amici curiae in the case of Stubblefield v. City of Sand Bernardino on September 20, 1995, in the United States Supreme Court. At issue in this case is whether government actions which were clearly arbitrary and designed to target a small developers project violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

<h3>Institute for Justice</H3>

<B>Runstrom, et al. V. City of Kalamazoo</B><P>

On September 7, 1995, the Institute filed a constitutional challenge to the City of Kalamazoo's housing inspection law that allows government inspectors to enter apartments without tenant consent or a validly-executed search warrant. The Institute for Justice filed the lawsuit on behalf of 13 Kalamazoo apartment tenants. The case came to the attention of the Institute for Justice when landlord Jerry Speedy was brought up on criminal charges for refusing to provide access to rented apartments unless the tenants consented to the building code inspections.
The constitutional rule that the Institute for Justice seeks to establish in this lawsuit is: If government inspectors wish to enter tenants' homes, they must ask for and receive their explicit consent. If the tenants do not wish to grant inspectors access to their homes, the government must obtain a search warrant based on some reasonable suspicion (probable cause) that the housing code is being violated.<P>

<B>Teen Challenge of San Antonio Wins Battle Against Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA)</B><P>

The Institute represents Teen Challenge of San Antonio, in its effort to continue its faith-based drug and alcohol treatment program, which was threatened with the secular requirements imposed by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse licensing requirements.
Teen Challenge, a thirty-five year old program with an excellent track record of success, believes the key to solving chemical dependency problems lies in the spiritual dimension of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It accepts no government funding for treatment and all participants come to this program voluntarily.
TCADA views addiction as a disease of the body that can be treated, but never cured. TCADA's secularized, disease-based model for addiction and treatment--and the regulations that implement this model--did not allow Teen Challenge to carry out its salvation, Christ-centered model of treatment. Based on this incompatibility, Teen Challenge objected to being forced to meet the licensing and regulatory requirements of TCADA. The Institute for Justice, working with the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, is providing legal representation to Teen Challenge in ongoing negotiations with Texas and is prepared for litigation if necessary.<P>

<B>Battle for Expanded Choice Continues in Milwaukee</B><P>

Despite substantial disruption as a result of the Wisconsin Supreme Court's injunction of the recently expanded school choice program, most students have received privately funded scholarships through Parents Acquiring Values in Education (PAVE) to allow them to enroll in their chosen private schools. This resulted from the generous contributions made by caring individuals, parents, schools, and the business and philanthropic communities.
Over the next month, the lawyers in this case will meet to determine whether there are factual issues in dispute. Assuming the Wisconsin Supreme Court does not remand the case to the trial court, the Court could (a) rule in favor of the IJ on all issues, (b) rule against the IJ, but decide that the religion clauses of the Wisconsin Constitution are the same as the First Amendment, (c) rule against the IJ, finding that the Wisconsin Constitution is more restrictive than the First Amendment, (d) rule against the IJ on the other grounds under the Wisconsin Constitution. Under the first two scenarios, an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court would be possible, but an appeal would be precluded under the third and fourth scenarios. The Institute was granted intervenor status on behalf of Parents for School Choice and eight individual families, and will continue to play an active role throughout the litigation.

In response to a lawsuit by the Wyoming Sheriff's Association challenging the constitutionality of the Brady Act, the U.S. Government filed a motion to dismiss asserting that it will not enforce the law against sheriffs. Despite the clear provisions of the Brady Act, the U.S. Government filed a motion to dismiss asserting that it will not enforce the law against sheriffs.

<B>Boston Taxi Medallion Fight Returns to State Court</B><P>

Nine years after beginning a seemingly quixotic struggle to drive his own taxi in Boston and four years after his precedent-setting victory in Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Robert Lynch, represented by NELF, has returned to the Massachusetts courts in order to try to reap the fruits of his struggle.
Robert Lynch is a partially disable man who has supported himself for years by driving taxi cabs in Boston. Ten years ago, he tried to acquire a taxi "medallion", the legal right to operate his own cab, rather than just drive cabs owned by others. Since World War II, the number of Boston medallions had been fixed at 1525 and their price had risen over $50,000, far in excess of his resources. The resulting shortage of taxis led to higher fares and reduced taxi availability, particularly in minority and low income areas which are more dependent upon taxi service than other parts of the city.
Mr. Lynch went to the public library and found a 1934 law, never before use, which gave a state agency the power to require Boston to issue new medallions and he appealed to the agency. In 1990, it ordered Boston to issue hundreds of new medallions "immediately." The order was appealed by taxi owners to Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court, but Mr. Lynch, represented by NELF, prevailed in 1991.
Since then, NELF and Mr. Lynch have negotiated with Boston in an effort establish reasonable ground rules for issuance of the 300 new medallions called for by the agency's order on remand. Gradually, Boston hardened its position and finally decided that it could legally ignore the state agency order.
NELF has now filed a mandamus action on Mr. Lynch's behalf. While Mr. Lynch concedes that Boston has the right to establish reasonable rules as to who shall be permitted to operate taxis in the city, it cannot simply flout its legal obligation to issue new medallions. Issuing the new medallions is not only required to comply with the city's legal duty but also it will begin the opening of a rigid and inefficient system to competition and free enterprise, which will benefit the taxi-using public.<P>

<b>NELF Supports High-Tech Manufacturer</b><P>

The New England Legal Foundation has filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, supporting Houghton-Mifflin Company's effort to retain its status as a "manufacturing" company for purposes of state tax law. The basic issue in the case is whether a state should use its tax law to encourage or discourage a business' effort to move away from traditional labor intensive "manufacturing" in the direction of more modern high-technology, knowledge-intensive operations.
For over thirty years, Massachusetts has classified Houghton-Mifflin Corporation, a nationally-known book publisher, as a "manufacturing corporation," which entitles it to a tax credit for new equipment purchases and other tax benefits. In 1991, the state Department of Revenue notified Houghton-Mifflin that this classification had been revoked, retroactive to 1986. The basis for that action was that Houghton-Mifflin no longer printed its textbooks in the state, having shifted that aspect of its business to independent contractors while retaining in Massachusetts its more intellectual activities including writing, editing, preparing art work, designing and preparing computer materials and compact discs.
Houghton-Mifflin appealed the Department's action. The state Appellate Tax Board ruled in Houghton-Mifflin's favor, holding that its operations in Massachusetts continued to meet the state's statutory tests for constituting "manufacturing" as well as the Department's own regulations on that subject. The Department appealed to Massachusetts' highest court, arguing that, as a matter of law, Houghton-Mifflin's operations could not constitute manufacturing.
NELF's amicus brief argued that the Board had been correct. When the legislature originally amended the state's tax laws to encourage "manufacturing", it had n o intention of binding business into a straightjacket irrevocably tied to then-current technology. Rather, its obvious goal was to use the tax laws creatively to encourage businesses to take actions that would benefit the wider community. In today's economy, Houghton-Mifflin's actions in shifting its operations in the direction of cleaner, high wage, high technology jobs are precisely the sort of positive transformation that Massachusetts should be encouraging.

<h3>Pacific Legal Foundation</h3>

<B>Bureaucratic Land Grab Averted</b><P>

State of California ex rel. State Lands Commission v. Superior Court (Lovelace). In a key victory for property rights, the California Supreme Court agreed with Pacific Legal Foundation arguments and thwarted a major land grab by the State Lands Commission. As a result, the private ownership, use, and enjoyment of properties along the banks of rivers, streams, or lake shores in the state have been preserved.
In California, as in all other states, new land that is formed by slow accretion to a shoreline or riverbank becomes the private property of the adjacent upland owner. Accretion is the gradual and imperceptible accumulation of land by natural causes. This process can occur either by the washing up of sand or soil from a body of water, such as the sea or a river, or by the gradual subsidence of water which leaves land uncovered. Thus, if a river gradually shifts its course by the accumulations of silt, sand, grave, and other sediment, and land is created where there was once only river bottom, the owner of the adjacent upland gains title to the newly formed land.
During the mid to late 1800s, hydraulic mining both enriched the economy of the state and wreaked havoc on the downstream reaches of the San Joaquin and Sacramento River watershed by depositing vast amounts of gravel, sand, and silt into the waterways. As this material worked its way downstream, it was deposited in the slower reaches of these waterways causing the river bottoms to gradually rise by many feet, creating dry land where there once was river bottom.
Richard Lovelace owns property which includes a 12-acre parcel that was created by accretion when the river bottom rose between 12 and 15 feet during the heyday of California's hydraulic gold mining era. The State Lands Commission tried to snatch that property from Mr. Lovelace on the theory that the accretion was the result of "artificial" rather than natural causes.
The California Supreme Court agreed with PLF's arguments and held that title to land formed in the last century as a partial result of the sediment washed downstream by hydraulic mining would be determined according to the rule of accretion. That is, if it was deposited slowly and imperceptibly over time, title would inure to the adjacent upland riparian owner onto whose land the accretion occurs. Had the state bureaucracy gotten its way, the settled status of thousand of acres in California would have been destroyed.<P>

<b>Defending Voters' Right to Cut Back Government Spending</b><P>

Atiyeh v. Oregon. In this case, PLF is defending Ballot Measure 8, enacted by Oregon voters to roll back lavish pension plans for state workers.
Oregon law has long required that public employees contribute 6% of their gross pay toward their retirement pension plan. However, in 1979, the state Legislature enacted a Pension Pick-Up Law requiring the government employer (i.e., the taxpayers) to "pick up" the 6% tab. Thus, since 1979 most Oregon government workers have not actually contributed to their annual pension premiums, although "on paper" they have been credited with making a 6% contribution! Under the Pension Pick-Up Law, Oregon taxpayers not only bear the full pension cost for public employees, but also guarantee a minimum 8% return on pension investments. In addition, pension benefits can be increased by unused sick leave.
Recognizing that this generous pension plan was not akin to most private sector pension plans, Oregon voters enacted Ballot Measure 8. A major objective of this initiative is to reverse the 1979 Pick-Up Law by amending the Oregon Constitution to require public employees to contribute 6% of their salary toward their pension plan. To ensure that taxpayers no longer pick up the 6% tab, Measure 8 prohibits government employers from contracting to relieve public employees of their contribution duty or to increase their salaries or benefits as an offset. Among other restrictions, Measure 8 also bars government contracts from guaranteeing the interest rate on public pensions funds.
The Pacific Legal Foundation filed a friend of the court brief in the Oregon Supreme Court opposing a lawsuit seeking to block Ballot Measure 8. The suit does not challenge the substance of the measure, but the legality of the whole initiative process as applied to Measure 8.

WLF argued that the Act is not within the power of Congress to determine the "Times, Places and Manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives." Among other mandates, the Act requires a state to offer assistance in completing a voter registration form to all clientele visiting welfare and unemployment agencies. <P>

<b>Supreme Court Urged To Limit Abusive Class Action Suits</B><P>

In a brief filed in the Supreme Court in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Epstein, WLF argued that a corporation should not have to defend against more than one class action suit based on alleged violations of securities law where the different lawsuits arise from the same transaction. When a corporation settles with one group of plaintiffs who purport to represent shareholders, another group of plaintiffs should not be permitted to extort additional settlement funds by claiming to represent the same shareholders, WLF argued.<P>

<b>Limits On Judicial Campaign Contributions Proposed</B><P>
WLF filed a petition with California Bar authorities recommending that trial lawyers be prohibited from making judicial campaign contributions. Studies cited by WLF show that in California and elsewhere, plaintiffs' trial lawyers have contributed enormous amounts to judges before whom they practice, creating the impression that justice can be bought. Fifteen top California trial lawyers gave almost $1 million to candidates for judicial office.<P>

<B>FDA Requested To Ease Rules on Direct-to-Consumer Ads</B><P>
A citizen petition filed by WLF with the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to adopt a policy recognizing that direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs can play a helpful role in providing consumers with truthful information about prescription drugs and also recognizing that truthful, non-misleading advertising of prescription drugs receives significant protection under the First Amendment. WLF recommended that the agency replace its current case-by-case review of such advertising with rules setting out "a very limited, very clearly-defined" set of improper advertising practices, giving manufacturers fair notice of what advertising is impermissible.

<html><title>No Free Lunch for Lobbyists -- Heritage</title>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"></center>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h2>September Insider : No Free Lunch for Lobbyists</h2><br></center>
  by Charles P. Griffin, Deputy House Liaison at the Heritage Foundation<p><hr><P>

The best-kept "dirty little secret" in Washington these days may be the millions of taxpayer dollars that are siphoned off each year to fund welfare for lobbyists. Over the past forty years, Congress has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<P>
Almost every interest in America from agriculture to zoology has one or more organizations receiving government funding. Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar Association, which received $2.2 million. This subsidy forces the taxpayer to foot the bill for a range of ideologically driven organizations.<P>
The coercive power of the federal government should not be used to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or other government entities.Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong fiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return to the American people. It is morally wrong for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the advocacy activities of an elite few. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. <P>
Every federal dollar frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy activities. Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private contributions. For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives more than $70 million 96 percent of its funding from the federal government. While enjoying a generous federal subsidy, this proponent of big government actively engages in a broad range of overtly partisan political activity.<P>  
Unfortunately, the NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds. The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 million from the federal government in FY 1994, 22 percent of its budget. In addition to opposing economic development nationwide, the Trust recently sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to "vote no" on a possible amendment in the House to reduce their taxpayer subsidy. It is no wonder that this nation has a multi-trillion dollar debt when federally-funded organizations can so blatantly lobby Congress for more money.<P>
Existing auditing of federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed to root out abuse. The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to curb current abuses:<P>
To solve this problem, no advocacy organization that receives federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status. The consequences for violating the prohibition on federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage organizations from violating the standards. Under no circumstances should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the prohibitions receive further federal funding.<P>
In addition, to shed more light on this "dirty little secret," witnesses testifying before Congress should be required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount. This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate light<P>.
It's time for this Congress to end welfare for lobbyists. Taxpayers should no longer be forced to subsidize political activity with which they disagree. Thomas Jefferson anticipated this debate over two hundred years ago when he correctly stated, "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."<P>
Mr. Jefferson must be spinning in his grave.<P>

<b>NATO's Role in European Stability</B>,edited by Stephen A. Cambone
<br>The Center for
Strategic & International Studies<p>

The Center for Strategic
and International Studies addresses the current political debate
over the redefinition and transformation of NATO, which dates
back to the very beginnings of the post-Cold War era. The report
examines the question of how to restructure the transatlantic
partnership in light of the recent discussions surrounding the
future membership of Eastern European nations into NATO. The report
also considers how NATO should have responded to the situation
in Bosnia. CSIS compiles the opinions of various academics and
foreign policy experts on the rightful course for NATO during
its transformation period. Walter Slocombe, US undersecretary
of defense for policy, lists four basic principles that must be
kept in mind during NATO's expansion: &quot;First, NATO is an
effective alliance, not a system of paper guarantees. Second,
it is an alliance of free nations and is committed to the principles
of liberty. Third, it works by consensus. Fourth, NATO is ultimately
a military organization.&quot; 67 pp. CONTACT: The Center for

<b>The
B-2 Bomber: Failure to Buy More Could Compromise Security in the
Next Century</B>, by Jim Courter and Loren Thompson
<br>Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution<p>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution presents the
case for why the production of the B-2 bomber, popularly know
as the stealth bomber, should not be curtailed as it is essential
to the maintenance of US security. The report warns against terminating
the production of the B-2 after the government has committed over
$20 billion to its development since the last decade of the Cold
War. The study concludes that it would be more cost effective
to continue the production of the bomber, despite its high price
tag, because the cost of every available alternative that can
achieve future military objectives is considerably higher. Courter
and Thompson also espouse the belief that possession of the B2
is critical to US security in light of the trend towards the globalization
of advanced technologies; this suggests that the present generation
of US aircraft will be outdated by early next century. 53 pp.

<b>From
Shadows to Substance: an Action Plan for Transatlantic Defense
Cooperation</b><br>The Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies<p>

The
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies issues a conference
report from their February 1995 conference held to discuss the
prospects for transatlantic defense cooperation in today's political
environment. Policy makers, industrialists, and academics met
to investigate the possibilities of establishing cooperative measures
between the US and Europe in the areas of military research, development,
and production. In this report, CSIS attests to the positive gains
made toward establishing transatlantic partnerships for future
US defense programs, to enable more programs to come to fruition.
The conference did conclude, however, leaving some ambiguity:&quot;the
interoperability argument for transatlantic defense cooperation
has shifted from enabling allied forces to meet a possible joint
threat in a cohesive and efficient manner to enabling alliance
members to undertake multinational operations outside NATO's area.&quot;

<b>The Purposes of Russian Aid: Supporting Democratic
Capitalism</b>, by Ariel Cohen
<br><a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1041.html">Backgrounder No. 1041</a>, The Heritage
Foundation<p>

Ariel Cohen, a Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian
Studies at The Heritage Foundation, advocates re-examining the
aid that the US plans to give to Russia and the Newly Independent
States in FY 1996 and in FY 1997 which will be up for a vote in
the Senate shortly. Cohen points out that US-Russian cooperation
is ebbing due to the following: Russia's intervention in Chechnya,
Moscow's refusal to end the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran,
and the lack of free-market reforms that have been enacted, since
Gorbachev's perestroika began ten years ago. The author recommends
that the Senate preface the allocation of the aid based upon six
contingencies: &quot;1) demand that the Administration suspend
negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western
creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is
completed; 2) condition US support for IMF credits to the Russian
government on a cease-fire in Chechnya; 3) create an independent
board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS; 4) reprogram $225 million
to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities
Import Program and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program; 5)
make democratic development a top priority; 6) target grants directly
to democratic institutions in Russia and the NIS.&quot; 13 pp.

<b>The United States and Future Bosnias</B>,
Jonathan G. Clarke
<br>Foreign Policy Briefing No. 36, Cato Institute<p>
Foreign
policy studies research fellow Jonathan Clarke of the Cato Institute
equates the importance of US foreign policy towards Bosnia as
setting the precedent for future policy towards other Eastern
European nations where conflict is erupting. Thus, according to
the author, the manner in which the US proceeds is paramount.
The author advocates a policy of nonintervention towards Bosnia
based on three main arguments: 1) the war in Bosnia is an intracommunal
dispute and is not an aberration from past, present, or future
conflicts that comprise Europe's history; 2) unlike Nazi Germany
and the Soviet Union, conflicts such as Bosnia do not pose a threat
to US security; 3) intracommunal conflicts make it difficult for
the US to distinguish between the aggressor and the victim. Clarke
concludes that &quot;failure to draw the appropriate lessons from
the Bosnian debacle will cause the United States to end up repeating
the same mistakes elsewhere in Europe.&quot; 12 pp. CONTACT: The

<b>More Military Bases Need to be Closed</b>, Baker Spring
<br><a href="/heritage/library/catagories/natsec/bg1042.html">Backgrounder
No. 1042, The Heritage Foundation</a><p>
Baker Springs, a senior policy
analyst at The Heritage Foundation, attests that more base closings
are still needed despite the latest round of base closing, which
insufficiently reduced the size of military forces, personnel,
and budgets down to the size recommended by the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Commission. The author explains that insufficient
base closings pose a very grave threat to US security; moneys
spent maintaining excessive bases only detract from vital military
readiness and modernization programs. Thus, the author advocates
extending the base closure process for another two rounds to ensure
that base infrastructure, which has only been reduced by 15 percent
since 1985, approaches the 25 percent cuts in military personnel
during the same time period. The paper also recommends that additional
oversight be made in any upcoming base closings so that the procedure
does not become politicized by the upcoming presidential race;
the electoral map and presidential politics should not influence
which bases are selected to be closed. 8 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis,

<b>Venezuela:
The Quiet Crisis Deepens</b>, by Mark Falcoff
<br>Latin American Outlook,
American Enterprise Institute
<p>Venezuela has long since passed its
days of economic prosperity that it enjoyed in the 1960s and 70s.
Mark Falcoff, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute,
outlines the causes of  this collapse and the political, social,
and economic policies that continue to sabotage efforts to put
Venezuela back on track. The author reveals that President Caldera
has supported dangerous economic reforms that include the following:
1) price controls that will increase shortages of basic foodstuffs
and articles on necessity; 2) foreign exchange controls that hurt
businesses by creating shortages of needed raw materials and parts;
3) and finally, a deliberate effort to stall any effort that move
towards privatization. These policies do not bode well for the
Venezuelan economic crisis that continues to worsen, fostering
even more support for a military coup that could truncate Caldera's
presidency. 4 pp. Contact: American Enterprise Institute, 1150

<b>How to
Close Down the Department of Transportation</b>, by Ronald D. Utt
and Wendell Cox
<br><a href="/heritage/library/catagories/bugettax/bg1048.html">Backgrounder No. 1048, The Heritage Foundation</a>
<P>
Ronald
Utt, visiting Heritage Fellow, and Wendell Cox, director of state
policy and legislation for the American Legislative Exchange Council,
present the process through which the Department of Transportation,
created in 1966, has grown into the enormously inefficient bureaucracy
that exists today. Utt and Cox state that this fiscal year's budget
allocates $39 billion to the DOT, with nearly $19 billion going
to highways. According to this study, much of the department's
spending is derived from the Highway Trust Fund, which is replenished
by the federal fuel tax paid by motorists at the gas pump, and
the Aviation Trust Fund, financed largely by a passenger ticket
tax and several lesser aviation taxes. Utt and Cox demonstrate
that the DOT has remained mostly unchanged in its structure and
purpose since 1966; however both the Congress and the White House
now agree that major reform is necessary. Even modest reform proposals
have met opposition with House Republicans, but the Senate Republicans
have proven their commitment to fundamental reform, urging greater
privatization and federalism in transportation issues. This report
argues that the reforms emerging from conference are not enough,
further reforms in the following areas are necessary: surface
transportation; the end of federal mandates which have inflated
state transportation costs and deterred the development of creative,
low-cost transportation solutions; and urban mass transit. This
paper suggest the elimination of the Federal Transit Administration;
privatizing Amtrak; privatization of air traffic control and the
devolution of federal control to the states; and the transfer
of Coast Guard responsibilities to the Department of Justice.

<b>Five Hundred LifeSaving Interventions
and Their Cost Effectiveness</b>, by Tammy O. Tengs, Miriam E. Adams,
Joseph S. Pliskin, Dana Gelb Safran, Joanna E. Siegel, Milton
C. Weinstein, and John D. Graham<br>
Risk Analysis Vol. 15 No. 3, Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis<p>
The team of experts who produced this
important paper gathered information on the cost-effectiveness
of life-saving interventions in the United States from publicly
available economic analyses. &quot;Life-saving interventions&quot;
were defined as any behavioral and/or technological strategies
that reduce the possibility of premature death among a specified
target population. This paper defines cost effectiveness as the
net resource costs of an intervention per year of life saved.
The 587 interventions identified in this work ranged from those
that saved more resources than they cost, to those costing more
than $10 billion per year of life saved. This paper finds the
median intervention costs $42,000 per lifeyear saved; the median
medical intervention costs $19,000 per life-year saved, the median

<b>Time to Reopen the Clean Air Act: Clearing Away the
Regulatory Smog</b>, by K.H. Jones and Jonathan Adler<br>
Policy Analysis
No. 233, Cato Institute<p>
K.H. Jones, president of Zephyr Consulting
Company, and Jonathan Adler, associate director of environmental
studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, maintain that
the national policy on the control of urban smog is misguided
because it fails to account for current pollution trends and is
based on the anomalous meteorological conditions of 1988. This
misguided policy, according to this paper, has led to &quot;regulatory
overkill&quot; by the Environmental Protection Agency. Jones and
Adler state that this particularly affects the Ozone Transport
Region, the twelve states from Virginia to Maine, imposing emissary
control strategies that are not only unnecessary, ineffective,
and expensive, but are also scientifically insupportable. The
authors write, &quot;control for control's sake pollution control
strategies pursued by the EPA and the OTC are largely inappropriate
because they are neither costeffective nor equitable means of
achieving emissions reductions, even should such reductions be
necessary.&quot; The authors conclude that legislative action
is necessary to alleviate unneeded and costly regulatory mandates.

This
paper, prepared by the staff of the Roe Institute for Economic
Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, recommends a substantial
package of tax relief to help families with children and to stimulate
economic growth as the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate
Finance Committee fill in the details of the $245 billion tax
relief plan. The Roe Institute staff suggests using the $354 billion
House plan as a menu from which to craft a tax relief package,
including such items as: a $500 per child tax credit; a reduction
of the capital gains tax; and an IRAPlus plan. This paper demonstrates
why both tax and spending reductions are necessary to effectively
move control of spending out of Washington and into the hands

No. 178, Hudson Institute<p>

Alan Reynolds, the Hudson Institute's
director of economic research, has adapted his testimony before
the House Republican Joint Economic Committee and House Republican
Policy Committee Briefing on the Dollar to produce this paper.
Reynolds gives a &quot;graphic&quot; demonstration of how the
federal government's policies are driving the US economy toward
a new boat of stagflation. This paper compares the state of the
current economy with the conditions of 197475, 197982, and 199091.
Current actions by the federal government point towards stagflations:
America's increasingly hostile tax climate for domestic savings
and foreign investment. Reynolds suggests that the decline of
the dollar is not the result of budget deficit or the Federal
Reserve's interest rate; but that the steady decline may be halted
with appropriate tax and monetary policies, including tax incentives
for savings and investments. 8 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute,

the fact that the earned income tax credit (EITC) was designed

the budget. Kosters suggests that, while a review is certainly
in order, a more comprehensive assessment of the EITC is needed.
Kosters argues that the program has not achieved the success its

finances and how these finances affect Canada's &quot;public sector
economic maladies.&quot; The author uses a technique called generational
accounting to look at the future stream of government taxes, transfers,
and expenditures. The findings suggest that Canada's current fiscal
policies are unsustainable. Good explains why the Canadian government
sector, with enormously higher unfunded future liabilities is
overspending at a vastly greater rate than the US. The paper recommends
a &quot;freeze and growth through productivity&quot; policy, which
means that at each age, an individual's taxes are increased at

<b>A Guide to Medicare Reform Proposals</b>,
by John C. Liu<br>
<a href="/library/categories/healthwel/fyi57.html">F.Y.I. No. 57, The Heritage Foundation</a><P>
Heritage policy
analyst John Liu describes the need for action in Medicare when
Congress returns from its summer recess. Liu writes, &quot;To
avoid the collapse of program, Congress has only two choices:
1) Do not change significantly the way Medicare is run by the
government, and assure future new revenues through higher payroll
taxes and other taxes or by diverting money from other programs;
or 2) Fundamentally change the way Medicare is run so that benefits
are delivered more efficiently, thereby avoiding future tax increases
or a diversion of money from other programs. This approach would
aim to slow the rate at which costs are anticipated to grow. This
paper assesses the proposals from the Clinton administration,
Brookings Institution, Heritage Foundation, National Center for
Policy Analysis, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security
and Medicare, United Seniors Association, and major organizations
representing health care providers. Liu presents the approach
of the various groups' proposals, and shows how they address the
reforms necessary to change Medicare. 21 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis,

<b>Why

Patrick
Fagan, the William H.G. Fitzgerald Senior Fellow in Family and
Cultural Issues at The Heritage Foundation, argues that adoption
must be part of any plan to reform welfare. Fagan cites statistics
which show outofwedlock births reaching nearly 40 percent by the
year 2000 and 50 percent by the year 2012, and he questions why,
out of the 500,000 children in the foster care system, only 50,000
were cleared for adoption each year. Fagan suggests that adoption
addresses many of the current problems with the welfare system:
unwed mothers, children in abusive homes, children in foster care,
and costs to the state and federal governments. Fagan argues,
&quot;Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive
capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life
chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money
for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents.
It is good for all involved. Adoption works.&quot; 30 pp. CONTACT:

<b>Should
We Worry About Ozone</b>, by Jane S. Shaw and Richard L. Stroup<BR>
Policy
Report No. 191, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>Jane Shaw and
Richard Stroup, senior associates with the Political Economy Research
Center, challenge the theory held by some scientists that the
depletion of stratospheric ozone is substantial and will grow
to alarming levels unless the use of CFCs and some related chemical
compounds is eliminated. The authors argue that the theory of
largescale depletion caused by human use of these chemicals is
not yet supported by solid scientific evidence. This paper presents
five areas of unresolved issues regarding the ozone: 1) it is
not clear that stratospheric ozone is being significantly depleted
worldwide, or that any depletion that may have occurred is permanent;
2) if the ozone layer is being depleted, it is not clear that
CFCs are the major cause or that reducing their use now will stop
or even slow depletion; 3) it appears that the &quot;ozone hole&quot;
above Antarctica is caused by unique conditions, and it is uncertain
whether additional or reduced chlorine from CFCs would affected
it; 4) even if ozone depletion does occur, there is no reliable
evidence that it will represent a grave threat to living things
on earth; and 5) the cost of eliminating CFCs for refrigeration
and cooling are higher than most people realize, with estimates
reaching nearly $100 billion over the next 10 years in the United
States alone. The authors conclude that the Montreal Protocol
banning CFCs should be changed to make the phaseout more gradual,
and the costs (including such social costs as the loss of safety)
of halting CFC production should be weighed against the small
and uncertain benefits. 21 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy

<B>Progressive Environmentalism: Principles for Regulatory
Reform</b>, by Kent Jeffries<BR>Policy Report No. 194, National Center
for Policy Analysis<P>

National Center for Policy Analysis senior
fellow Kent Jeffries suggests that any regulatory reform bill
approved by Congress will only be a first step toward removing
governmental abuses without sacrificing overall environmental
quality. Jeffries argues that Congress must still reauthorize
or review a host of environmental programs individually, including
Superfund, pesticide regulations, the Endangered Species Act,
the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. This paper recommends
three guiding principles with which to examine these programs:
the federalism rule, which requires regulatory decisions to be
made by the smallest possible government entity; the costbenefit
rule, which considers whether the costs of a proposed regulation
reasonably reflect it benefits; and the compensation rule, under
which property owners are compensated for their losses if property
rights are taken or diminished by a regulation. Jeffries writes,
&quot;The regulatory reform bill is important, but if Congress
is to make the reform truly meaningful, it must define a role
for government in environmental regulation that gives people the
right incentives, that protects property rights, and that spends
the public money wisely.&quot; 44 pp. CONTACT: National Center

<B>Beyond the Grazing Fee: An Agenda for
Rangeland Reform</b>, by Karl Hess Jr. and Jerry L. Holecheck<BR>Policy
Analysis No. 234, Cato Institute<P>
Karl Hess, Cato senior fellow
in environmental studies, and Jerry Holecheck, professor of rangeland
studies at New Mexico State University, argue that the results
of more than a century of grazing on public land are testimony
to the failure of landuse socialism. This paper asserts that taxpayers
have paid for federally supervised and subsidized grazing, and
ranchers, the intended beneficiaries, have gained little except
debt, insecurity, and mountains of regulations, while environmental
quality has suffered. Hess and Holecheck address Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt's plan, arguing that &quot;it ignores the institutional
impediments that have made overgrazing and land abuse official
programs of the federal government, and it leaves unchanged the
federal policies that discourage rancher stewardship and pay stockmen
to overgraze and reward them for poor management practices.&quot;
This article presents four methods of reform: 1) placing the fiscal
burden of maintaining these lands on the ranchers; 2) opening
access to these lands for purposes other than grazing livestock;
3) decentralizing control over federal lands in selected areas
on a trial basis; and 4) extending the local control and opening
debate on partial or full divestiture of public rangelands. 27

A Half Step in the Right Direction</b>, by William H. Lash III<br>
Contemporary

William
Lash, adjunct fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business,
finds that Congress, fearing an &quot;economic apocalypse where
millions of fleeced investors withdraw from securities markets
that fail to adequately protect them&quot; is reluctant to pass
pending legislation that would provide some protection to companies
facing groundless securities litigation. Lash proposes six aspects
of reform: 1) institute a loser pays all court cost provision;
2) require a meaningful investment by plaintiffs in strike suits;
3) require specific allegations of actual fraud or recklessness;
4) abolish RICO liability for securities suits; 5) limit the number
of lawsuits that may be brought by professional plaintiffs to
five cases in a three year period; and 6) require the Securities
and Exchange Commission to adopt rules providing a &quot;safe
harbor&quot; for corporations making positive, forwardlooking
statements in their corporate reports, so that companies are not
forces to play down bright prospects to investors simply to protect
the firm from possible frivolous securities lawsuits. Lash concludes
that the constant specter of groundless securities litigation
deters many worthy individuals from joining corporate boards and
wastes corporate resources while rewarding a handful of unscrupulous
attorneys. 20 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business,

by Jarett B. Decker<BR>
Policy Analysis No. 229, Cato Institute<P>
Jarett
Decker, a Minnesota attorney, accuses the new Republican Congress
of fighting crime by expanding federal power, just like past Democratic
Congresses. Decker argues that, despite the April 26 Supreme Court
ruling on the Lopez case, the 1995 GOP crime bill continue the
trends of recent years by making every local crime a federal crime.
According to this paper, federal prosecutors would be given even
more power under the GOP crime bills, while the rights of defendants
and the powers of judges would be curtailed. The authors demonstrates
that &quot;both the House and Senate bills give a green light
to government lawlessness,&quot; weakening constitutional protections
against invasions of private homes, raids on businesses, and detentions
of citizens in the course of criminal investigations. Decker concludes
that the 1995 crime bills are a step in the wrong direction, further
removing the US from constitutional checks and balances toward
a regime of unchecked power. 33 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000

<B>Orphanages:

Center

Economist Richard McKenzie presents
his preliminary findings from a survey of several hundred former
orphans, all of whom are now middleaged or older. Despite the
claims of child care professionals who condemn orphanages, the
survey found that when compared to their counterparts in the general
population, the orphans have: a lower divorce rate; a higher level
of education; a higher mean income; a far lower unemployment rate;
a far lower poverty rate; a minuscule rate of reliance on public
assistance; a minuscule arrest rate; a substantially lower rate
of mental and emotional disorders; and a higher rate of participation
in elections. McKenzie also reports that the majority of orphans
state that they prefer the way they grew up to the way they would
have grown up in foster care or in their own families. The author
contrasts the success of the orphans with the lowered expectations
of child care professionals for those growing up in orphanages.

<b>Cornell Professor
Sues Over Harassment Conviction</b><br>
The Center for Individual Rights
has filed a lawsuit against Cornell University on behalf of Professor
James B. Maas.  The lawsuit demands $1.5 million in damages for
Cornell's actions in finding Maas guilty of alleged &quot;sexual
harassment.&quot;<p>
Jim Maas, a professor of psychology, is one of
Cornell's most prominent faculty members.  He has a record of
31 years of distinguished service to the Cornell community.<P>
The
lawsuit, filed today in Tompkins County Supreme Court, demands
redress for a yearlong, ruinous witch hunt against Maas.  In a
proceeding over sexual harassment charges filed by former students
in May 1994, Maas was convicted as a &quot;sexual harasser&quot;
on stale and unproven charges; was subjected to an adjudicatory
&quot;process&quot; that was administered by fanatical faculty
members devoid of even the most basic elements of procedural fairness;
was forced to watch helplessly as unsubstantiated rumors and halftruths
were peddled to the local, national, and international press,
besmirching his reputation and severely damaging his ability to
function as a teacher and a scholar; and was ignored by Cornell's
feckless administrators when he protested the egregious violations
of Cornell's established procedures and of the confidentiality
rules that were supposed to govern the proceedings in his case.<P>

<b>Oral
Arguments Made in Hopwood v. State of Texas</b><br>
On Tuesday, August
8, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard oral arguments
in the case of Hopwood v. State of Texas.  The case was brought
by Cheryl Hopwood and three other unsuccessful applicants for
admission to the University of Texas Law School.  The plaintiffs,
who are white, claim that the law school discriminated against
them by maintaining a racebased admissions system that was intentionally
biased in favor of black and Mexican American applicants.<P>
The case
is an appeal from a decision handed down by US District Court
Judge Sam Sparks in August 1994.  The judge found that the Law
School had indeed operated a racially discriminatory admission
system in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection
clause, noting that the school had maintained separate admissions
committees to evaluate applications from members of different
racial groups.  The judge also observed that blacks and MexicanAmericans
were presumptively admitted with test scores and college grade
point averages lower than those set for the presumptive rejection
of whites.<P>
Nevertheless, Judge Sparks refused to order the plaintiffs'
admission to the law school because they failed to prove that
they would have been admitted except for the unconstitutional
program.  Moreover, the judge refused to award damages of more
than one dollar, finding that the law school had acted in &quot;good
faith&quot; when it violated the plaintiffs' rights.  And because
the judge found the law school's admission program no longer to
be in violation of the equal protection clausebecause it had discarded
the segregated admission tracks and separate admissions committees
by the time the case went to trialhe refused to order any change
in the school's admissions procedures.<P>
The law school, however,
has never disavowed the use of race as a factor in its admissions
process; indeed, it continues to treat an applicant's status as
black or MexicanAmerican as a &quot;plus.&quot;  Such preference
is given automatically, without regard to the applicant's socioeconomic
background, and to both Texas residents and nonresidents.<P>
During
the oral argument, the plaintiffs asked the Fifth Circuit to order
the law school to offer them admission.  In addition, the plaintiffs
asked the appellate court to remand the case so that they may
seek an award of nontrivial monetary damages.  Most significantly,
however, the appeal asks that the law school be prevented from
using race as it currently does as a criterion in student admissions.
 In this respect, the case presents the Court of Appeals with
an opportunity to clarify the meaning of University of California
Regents v. Bakke, a 1978 Supreme Court ruling having to do with
the constitutionality of racebased admissions procedures at a
statesupported medical college.<P>

<b>Institute
Comes to the Defense of School Choice</b><br>
The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and the Milwaukee Teachers Education Association
(MTEA), joined by People for the American Way and Americans for
the Separation of Church and State, filed lawsuits in early July
in state court in Madison challenging the constitutionality of
the recently expanded Milwaukee Parental Choice Program.<P>
The Institute's
petition to intervene as defendants on behalf of the grassroots
group Parents for School Choice and eight lowincome families who
will participate in the program, was granted Friday, August 4.
 Landmark Legal Foundation will represent another group of lowincome
families from its previous lawsuit.  On August 17, the Wisconsin
Supreme Court granted the Governor's petition for original action
jurisdiction and will promptly consider the plaintiffs' motion
for preliminary injunction.<P>
The ACLU lawsuit challenges the program
under the religion clauses of the United States and Wisconsin
constitutions.  The MTEA lawsuit adds claims under the &quot;private
or local&quot; bill provision of the Wisconsin Constitution and
the &quot;Public purpose&quot; doctrine.  The suits have been
consolidated and the plaintiffs are seeking injunction before
the school year starts.<P>

<b>Freedom Hits the Streets of Denver</b><br>
The Institute's
efforts to break through the taxicab monopoly in Denver bore fruit
on August 1st with the grand opening of Freedom Cabs.  Run by
Leroy Jones, Ani Ebong, and Girma Molalegne, Freedom Cabs is the
first new cab company to open its doors in Denver since 1947.<P>
 The entrepreneurs first challenged Denver's taxicab monopoly
in January 1993 when they joined with the Institute to file a
lawsuit against the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which
regulates taxis in the state.  Later, due to the lawsuit's high
visibility, the Colorado legislature passed a law opening the
Denver taxi market.<br>This lawsuit is part of a comprehensive effort
by the Institute for Justice to restore judicial protection for
&quot;economic liberty&quot;the basic civil right of every American
to pursue a business or profession free from arbitrary or excessive
government regulation.<p>

<b>Institute Files Amicus Opposing Civil Forfeiture<br></b>
The
Institute filed an amicus in Bennis v. State of Michigan, fighting
the government's ability to forfeit the property of wholly innocent
owners.  The state forfeited Ms. Bennis' interest in her automobile
because her husband used the car for prostitution.  Ms. Bennis
committed no wrong and had no knowledge of the illegal use of
her property.  Nevertheless, the State of Michigan provides no
recourse for innocent owners.<P>
The Institute's brief critiques civil
forfeiture from a property rights perspective and argues that
forfeiture of property held by truly innocent owners is unduly
oppressive and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.  Furthermore, the law should not place affirmative
obligations on individuals to police the actions of third parties.
 Rather, the burden should be on the government to demonstrate
that an owner negligently entrusted property to another in order
to expose that individual to civil forfeiture.  The Institute
will also fight the forfeiture of Ms. Bennis' rights in the automobile
on the ground of taking of private property without just compensation.<p>

<h3>National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation</h3><p>
<b>Virginia Supreme Court Upholds Redskins' Right
to Work</b><br>
The Supreme Court of Virginia refused a petition for appeal
by National Football League Player Association (NFLPA) union officials
to overturn a lower court's ruling barring the NFLPA from seizing
forced dues from sixteen current and former Washington Redskins
players, National Right to Work Foundation attorneys announced
today.<p>
The ruling upheld a lower court decision by Loudoun County
Circuit Judge Thomas D. Horne.  Horne last year ruled that it
is a violation of Virginia's Right to Work law for NFLPA union
officials to force Redskin players to pay union dues as a condition
of employment.<p>
Horne's ruling permanently barred player union officials
from requiring former Redskins tight end Terry Orr and other players
to pay union dues.  Orr and fifteen former and current Redskins
players were represented in their legal action by attorneys from
the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation.<p>
  &quot;This
is another enforcement action to guarantee employee rights under
Virginia's Right to Work law, &quot; said Foundation VicePresident
Timothy McConville.  He added, &quot;Every step of the way in
this case, we've prevailed and protected employees' right not
to pay compulsory union dues just to keep their jobs.&quot;<P>

In
December of 1993, NFLPA union officials nearly forced the Redskins
to forfeit their final regular season game by threatening to have
the players who exercised their Right to Work suspended.<p>
The union
claimed that the Redskins were employed in Washington, DC, where
they play their home games, and therefore not covered by Virginia
law.<p>
But the lower court declared that because the Redskins spend
the overwhelming majority of their work time at Redskins Park
in Loudoun County, Virginia, they are Virginia employees, protected
by the state's Right to Work law.<p>
In contrast, players typically
spend only 60 hours before, during, and after home games working
in the District of Columbia.<p>

<h3>The Rutherford Institute</h3><p>
<b>Supreme
Court Allows Student Initiated Graduation Prayer</b><br>
On June 26 the
Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals in Harris v. Joint School District.  The court's decision
effectively upholds the right to studentinitiated prayer at public
high school graduations.  The Rutherford Institute represented
students in the case.<P>
The case began in 1991, when the ACLU filed
suit against the public high school in Grangeville, Idaho, for
allowing studentinitiated prayer at their graduation ceremony.
 The high school gave complete control over the ceremony to seniors
who voted to include a benediction and invocation.  Initially,
a federal district court ruled in favor of the school, but the
court of appeals reversed the decision, holding that graduation
prayer violated the first amendmentregardless of whether or not
the prayers were studentinitiated.  The Ninth Circuit's decision
was in direct conflict with an earlier decision from the Fifth
Circuit upholding student-initiated graduation prayer.<p>
&quot;The
Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case on the merits means that
the uncertainty over the legality of student-initiated prayer will
continue,&quot; said Rutherford staff attorney Mark Beutler. 
&quot;I am pleased nonetheless that the Court vacated the Ninth
Circuit's decision.  Now students in western states can once again
decide to include prayer in their graduation ceremonies.&quot;<p>
<b>Rutherford
Sues California Superintendent Delaine Easton</b><br>
California State
Superintendent of Schools Delaine Easton as well as a half dozen
other school superintendents have been named defendants in a lawsuit
against the state of California regarding administration of the
California Learning Assessment Systems (CLAS) test.  Despite Governor
Pete Wilson's veto on funding for the controversial CLAS tests,
schools continue to administer test materials without parental
consent or notice.<p>The complaint was amended on Monday, June 19,
to argue that the state violated not only parental rights guarded
by the Constitution, but also federal civil rights laws.  A court
date has been set for October 23, 1995.<p>The original suit, filed
April 21, 1994, sought a temporary restraining order to stop six
San Bernardino County School districts from giving the CLAS test.
 The test requires children to answer personal questions about
their family values, practices, and beliefs as well as questions
pertaining to their relationship with their parents.  Children's
answers may then be referred to Child Protective Services without
ever notifying parents how the test results are being used.  Not
only parents, but also state senators, school board members, and
teachers were denied the opportunity to examine the test before
it was administered.  The defendants in the lawsuit continue to
assert that they have done nothing wrong, insisting that parents
have no right to shield their children from questionable materials
found in public schools.<p>
&quot;This battle will not end until the
State Department of Education is forced to recognize the rights
of parents to guide the education of their children,&quot; said
Frank J. Mistretta, Jr., an attorney handling the case, adding,
&quot;Now is definitely not the time to drop the ball on defending
parents' rights.&quot;<p>
<b>Rutherford Institute Defends School Against
ACLU Suit</b><br>
On June 30, The Rutherford Institute filed a posttrial
brief on behalf of Upshur County Board of Education and Superintendent
Lynn Westfall in response to a lawsuit brought against the school
by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The ACLU sued the
school administration for allowing a citizen group to place a
box of free Bibles for students on school property.<p>
The posttrial
brief filed by The Rutherford Institute requests the court to
rule in favor of the school.  The brief argues that the school
acted neutrally by permitting religious materials to be made available
on the same terms and under the same conditions as nonreligious
materials.<P>
The case began on December 6, 1994, when the school
board voted to permit a citizen group comprised of local businesses
to place boxes of Bibles in the Upshur County Public Schools on
February 27, 1995, for students to pick up on a voluntary basis.
 As a result, on February 23, 1995, the ACLU on behalf of several
parents, sued the school and obtained an order forbidding the
school from permitting anyone to make Bibles available to students
while the case was pending.<p>
&quot;We are hopeful that in light
of the Supreme Court's decision in Rosenberger and Pinette, the
court will not require the school to treat private religious speech
occurring during the school day differently than nonreligious
speech,&quot; said Dean Whitford, The Rutherford Institute attorney
handling the case, along with Attorney Michael D. Lorensen.<P>

<b>Employee Drug
Testing Supported in California Supreme Court</b><br>
WLF filed a brief
on behalf of itself and a group of California State Senators in
the California Supreme Court in support of the constitutionality
of an employee drug testing program adopted by the City of Glendale,
California.  The city adopted the program in response to the results
of a pilot project that showed 21 percent of job applicants tested
positive for drug use.  The program requires those who have received
job offers to undergo drug testing as a condition of taking the
job.<P>
<b>Supreme Court Asked To Review Decision on &quot;Green&quot;
Ad Ban</b><br>
WLF filed a brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear
National Association of Manufacturers v. Lungren, a challenge
to a California law that virtually bans many types of truthful
environmental claims in advertising.  For example, no product
may be labeled or advertised as &quot;recyclable&quot; unless
convenient recycling facilities for the product exist in every
urban area of the state.  A federal appeals court upheld the ban.<P>

<b>Protection
of Civil Liberties In OSHA Investigations Sought</b><br>
A petition for
rulemaking filed by WLF with the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) argued that the agency should adopt procedures
for protecting the civil liberties of employers during inspections
and investigations.  The petition urged OSHA to provide a &quot;statement
of employers' rights and responsibilities&quot; prior to every
inspection.  Currently, OSHA does not require its inspectors to
inform employers of any of their rights.  WLF's proposed statement
explains employers' rights, including the right to refuse an inspection
that is not authorized by a warrant or its equivalent, to consult
one's legal counsel, and to accompany the inspector throughout
the inspection.  The petition is in response to the results of
WLF's research into OSHA inspection procedures, which disclosed
that OSHA lacks adequate regulations or internal rules for protecting
civil liberties.<p>
<b>Brief Seeks Dismissal of ACLU Prison Library Case</b>
In

felons by failing to provide (among other things) trained bilingual
legal assistants for illiterate and nonEnglishspeaking prisoners.
 WLF filed the brief on behalf of itself and the Arizona Constitutional
Defense Council, an independent board created by Arizona law to
protect the state from federal intrusion.<P>

<title> Robbing Peter to Pay Grandma

<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- Robbing Peter To Pay Grandma</h2>
<i><b>by John Liu</i></b>
<hr>

<p>Sunday, July 30, 1995, marked the 30th birthday for one of the federal government's largest and most costly programsMedicare, the huge national health insurance program that covers over 37 million elderly and disabled Americans. Medicare was heralded by proponents as both "historic" and "fiscally responsible." Now, however, Medicare is essentially bankrupt, and its ability to maintain the quality of its services is in doubt. What is not in doubt, is the harsh reality that liberals must face up toMedicare is anything but a fiscally responsible program. The hospitalization insurance (HI) trust fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2002. Equally important, the cost of the Medicare Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program is exploding. 
Furthermore, U.S. demographics guarantee enormous future burdens on working families. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted, there were almost six workers to every retiree. Today, there are only four. And by 2030, when the nation's 77 million "baby boomers" are well into their retirement, there will be only two workers for every retiree.
<p>
There is a solution to this looming crisis. A solution based on free market principles allowing for consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits. One prominent model for the reform of the Medicare program, recommended by Heritage scholars, is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the system that currently serves 1.6 million retired Members of Congress and federal workers.
<p>
<br>
<h3>Planning and Price Controls</h3>
<p>
While federal government officials have not been successful in accurately projecting the true costs of the Medicare program, they have had even less success in controlling them. Government bureaucrats have embarked on a quest to find the "right price" for thousands of different medical procedures and treatments or specialists and other providers. In some instances, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals and other health care "providers" too much; in other cases, "too little." Such a system encourages doctors and hospitals and other medical "providers" to engage in more or less elaborate attempts to "game" the price control system. Given its current structure, taxpayers should not be surprised that Medicarecannot control costs. The incentives of the current Medicare system conspire to drive costs up.
<p>
Just how expensive will it be to fund Medicare fully under the current system? The 1995 Medicare Trustees (a federal government board) Report provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat without reform. "To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the first 25 years," a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be added to the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this would raise payroll taxesand hence the cost of employing Americansby an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven years. A worker earning $45,000 would have to pay an additional payroll tax of $585 per year. To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without reforming the programthat is, to put it on a permanently sound footingan immediate additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise taxes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per year.
<p><br>
<h3>A New Model</h3>
<p>If Members of Congress want to retain the single payer, government-run structure of the Medicare program, then they must resort to either much higher taxes or even more draconian controls on doctors and hospitals, including a direct limitation of available services, in a fashion not unlike the British National Health Service.
<p>
If private employer-based insurance is not the best model for the reform of the Medicare system, Members of Congress can always examine their own system, the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This is the option proposed by The Heritage Foundation as a model for reform. It is also the model now proposed by the American Medical Association (AMA). 
Unlike Medicare, congressional and federal retirees do not have a government standardized benefits package imposed on them with the FEHBP program, but can pick and choose from a wide variety of plans and options. Medicare, on the other hand, offers almost no meaningful choices. And, in terms of economic efficiency, Medicare's bureaucratic and highly centralized system cannot even begin to compete with the market-based system that currently covers retired Members of Congress and federal employees.
<p>
While Medicare costs have been rising almost 11 percent per year, this year's overall private sector costs rose just 4.4 percent and FEHBP premiums costs actually declined by 3.3 percent. Since the free market forces have proven to work well for Members of Congress and retired Members of Congress, there is no reason why the FEHBP model can't work for our nation's elderly.

Book Review: Martin Malia: The Soviet Tragedy
 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review</h2>
<I>by Elizabeth Edwards Spalding</i>
<hr>
<b>
The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917-1991<br>
Martin Malia (New York: The Free Press, 1994)</b>
<p>
While good books on American history and domestic politics continue to multiply, the same cannot be said of international politics and American foreign policy. For those who are interested in the central conflict of the twentieth century -- the Cold War -- there is good news in the form of Martin Malia's The Soviet Tragedy. A respected, former professor of history at Berkeley, Malia may be best known as Z, the author who exposed the distortions of revisionist Sovietologists and analyzed the potential for the crumbling of the Soviet regime in his 1990 article "To the Stalin Mausoleum." Now Malia offers a masterful study of Western Sovietology and its translations of the Soviet regime and its practices.
<p>
Two models have dominated the field of Soviet studies: first, the totalitarian school that was pioneered in the 1950s, which argued that the Bolshevik revolution was communist and imposed in fact by an intellectual elite and that Lenin and Stalin established and extended a totalitarian state; second, the anti-totalitarian school, which, as it gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s, maintained that pluralism, consensus building, and compromise characterized the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin's successors. The revisionist anti-totalitarian model has influenced several generations of scholars, students, journalists, and policymakers, many of whom continue to contend that the Cold War ended with Stalin or, certainly, under Khrushchev. They foresaw and generally applauded a convergence between democracy and socialism, and they adduced dtente under Brezhnev as evidence. In this view, Ronald Reagan caused a second Cold War, and Mikhail Gorbachev deserved every accolade as man of the decade. Noteworthy exceptions to revisionism --such as Robert Conquest, Richard Pipes, and Malia-- constitute a pilloried minority.<P255D>
<p>
According to Malia, the totalitarian model is more correct than the anti-totalitarian model. To qualify as a totalitarian dictatorship, the classic definition requires an elaborate ideology, a single mass party, terror, a technologically conditioned monopoly of communication, a monopoly of weapons, and a centrally controlled economy. Malia never disputes the totalitarian nature of the Soviet system. But he qualifies his approval of the totalitarian model, since the rigidity of this model does not explain well "the obvious mellowing of the Soviet system in the decades after Stalin's death."
<p>
Malia suggests that Eastern European intellectuals, such as Poland's Adam Michnik, and other survivors of communism supply the deficiencies of the totalitarian model. Eastern Europeans applied totalitarian to a regime in which total control was the basic aspiration, while realizing that such a regime did not have to (and could not) exercise total control over its population. Explains Malia: "It did not mean that such regimes were omnipotent in performance, but rather that they were omnicompetent in their institutional structure. In short, it was not Soviet society that was totalitarian; rather, it was the Soviet state." While seeing the whole of the totalitarian objective, it is possible to distinguish between the "high totalitarianism" of Stalin and the routine totalitarianism of Brezhnev.
<p>
Malia imparts a lucid history of Soviet domestic and foreign policies, which is especially detailed where newly released information bolsters his argument. Throughout his discussion, he threads a sophisticated analysis of the Hegelian and Marxist foundations to socialism. Academic or not, readers will benefit particularly from his assessments of 1939-1953, 1982-1988, and 1989-1991. Unlike most other Western Sovietologists, Malia grasps that the Cold War began in 1917, that the Soviet Union made great gains during World War II, and that the East-West conflict then hardened in the postwar era. He also verifies the impact of Reagan's policies on the USSR, including SDI as a "technological and economic challenge the Soviets could neither ignore nor match." To explain the death throws of the USSR, Malia draws the important distinction between the profound and proximate causes of the great crash of 1989-1991. He does not make the mistake of attributing the demise of the USSR only to internal economic factors; rather, he assays that economic decline and its discrediting of ideology are the most important proximate causes. It is crucial to see these proximate causes of the Soviet collapse as "parts of a pattern arising from the nature of that system itself." As Malia concludes, socialism was founded on the profound Myth of radical egalitarianism and then transformed into the Lie: "In sum, there is no such thing as socialism, and the Soviet Union built it."
<p>
For those not embroiled in the ongoing academic warfare over the Cold War, Malia's points may seem manifest. The documents that are now available vindicate his position. To date, however, Malia's book --with its combined understanding of the Soviet regime and its practices, its rise and fall, and its interpretersis unique in the study of the Cold War.

<i><h3>National Security and Foreign Policy</h3></i>
<p>
<b>Clinton's ABM Treaty Muddle,</b> by Kim R. Holmes and Baker Spring<br>
<i>Committee Brief No. 16</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p> 
Heritage vice president Kim Holmes and policy analyst Baker Spring focus on the inconsistencies in the Clinton administration's approach to the ABM Treaty. This brief, presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee on July 7, suggests five steps to overcome the confusion in the administration's policies: 1) Recognize that maintaining the ability to confront, and if need be destroy, the means of attack that may be used against the American people, their territory, their forces overseas, and their vital interests, will be the cornerstone of strategic stability in the post-Cold War world; 2) Recognize that the distinction between strategic and theater defenses is an arbitrary one; 3) Recognize that missile defense is an indispensable part of an effective counterproliferation policy; 4) Seek a cooperative approach with Russia and others for transcending the ABM Treaty; and 5) Seek genuine cooperation with Congress regarding missile defense and the future of the ABM Treaty. Holmes and Spring maintain that these steps will resolve the contradictions in the President's approach to the ABM Treaty. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>The Mystery of Japanese Growth,</b> by Ramesh Ponnuru<br>
<i>Rochester Paper No. 4,</i> Centre for Policy Studies and American Enterprise Institute
<p>
Ramesh Ponnuru, a student at Princeton University, examines the cause of Japan's economic strength and why, according to the author, America and Europe falsely believe this strength threatens their own economies. Ponnuru writes, "Neither a concern about trade imbalances nor fear of Japan's potential to surpass the economic might of other nations justify the adoption of self-destructive policies by those nations. America and Europe should refrain from raising their drawbridges against Japanese commerce, setting targets for trade in specific sectors, or indeed for overall trade balances, or forcing Japan to cut its savings rate." The author argues that many critics of Japan falsely credit Japan's success with the interventionist policies of its government. Ponnuru unequivocally believes that, on balance, interventions in the Japanese marketplace have hindered rather than helped Japan's economy. 47 pp. CONTACT: Centre for Policy Studies, 52 Rochester Row, London SW1P 1JU, 071-828-1176.

<b>Soviet in Public, Azeri in Private: Gender, Islam, and Nationalism in Post-Soviet Azerbaijan,</b> by Nayereh Tohidi<br>
<i>Working Papers No. I-95-9,</i> Hoover Institution
<p>
Nayareh Tohidi, research fellow and visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution, focuses on the intersection of gender, state socialism, nationality, and religion in Soviet and post-Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. The interplay between the Soviet state policy towards the "national question" and the "woman question" is demonstrated in the Muslim Azerbaijani context. It shows that, although Muslim Azeri women have accomplished an impressive level of emancipation, their overall status remains flawed with contradictions and duality. Similar to women of several other countries in the Muslim world confronting colonial domination or semi-colonial intrusion, Azeri women's liberation has been held hostage to their assigned responsibility as the primary repositories of tradition, ethnic, and national identity. In conclusion, gender dynamics of recent changes and a new search for national identity in the ethnically contested and war-stricken context of newly independent Azerbaijan is briefly explored. 30 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA 94305-6010, 415/723-3373.

<b>Keeping America Great: Toward a New Foreign Policy Doctrine,</b> by Malcolm Wallop<br>
<i>Heritage Lecture Series No. 526,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Former Senator from Wyoming and distinguished fellow at The Heritage Foundation Malcolm Wallop describes, in his remarks to Heritage's Annual Board Meeting in San Diego, how America, since the Bush presidency, has allowed her role as world leader to slip away. Wallop describes the effects of the "utter vacuum of [foreign] policy." The administration's focus on the economy led to further cuts in the military and lack of policy definition, and Wallop states, "No great nation can remain great, free, and prosperous without strength, purpose, and courage. Today America has the latter, some of the former, and none of the middle." To reconcile this situation, Wallop names six essential components of a new doctrine: "First, the safety of the homeland is the paramount obligation. Second, America has an interest in a world at peace, if only for economic reasons. Third, we are a trading nation needing markets as well as access to supplies. Fourth, we are a communicating nation, and that means access to space. Fifth, we are a nation of travelers and scholars. Sixth, we are a nation of conscience and freedomnot to impose it, but surely to support it." 5 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Do Sanctions Work? Economic Sanctions as a Tool of US Foreign Policy</b>
<i>Conference Summary,</i> American Enterprise Institute
<p>
This summary provides the comments of two separate panels, the first entitles "SanctionsImportant or Ineffective Tool of Foreign Policy." Shaun Donnely, deputy assistant secretary for energy, sanctions, and commodities for the US Department of State, described sanctions as the answer to situations where diplomatic initiatives are insufficient, but military action is not justified. Julius Katz, president of Hills & Company, points out that sanctions, in their historical context, have rarely worked. Zalmay Khalilzad, director of the Program for Strategy, Defense and Force Structure for RAND Project AIR FORCE, clearly regards sanctions (including the embargo of military technology) as an important instrument foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. Richard Perle, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute uses the reasons to support sanctions which had been presented by Shaun Donnely and argues that they are exactly the reasons to oppose sanctions. Perle suggests that the US resorts to sanctions rather than a military effort is when it is not prepared to "bear the costs of real and effective action." The second panel, "The Efficacy of SanctionsThe Iraq, Iran, and Cuba Cases" examines the results of sanctions in these three countries. Micheal Eisenstadt, military fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy; James Kinnear, former president and CEO of Texaco Inc.; and Otto Reich, director of the Brock Group offer their differing views. 8 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th St., NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/862-5800.

<b>Commerce, Infrastructure & Regulation</b>
<b>Fair Lending Enforcement: How the Government Micromanages Banking,</b> by David J. McPherson<br>
Washington Legal Foundation
<p>
David McPherson, a banking and real estate attorney, argues that the recent fair lending enforcement campaign by the Department of Justice sets a disturbing precedent of the executive branch legislating by consent decree. This monograph discusses the legal basis for the Department of Justice enforcement actions and describes how, by prosecuting lending institutions for alleged discriminatory lending practices and forcing these institutions into consent decrees, the Justice Department has gone far beyond what is required by the federal fair lending laws and has confused sound lending practices with racial discrimination. McPherson advocates the cessation of attempts by the Justice Department to micromanage lending institutions and the encouragement in careful and consistent regulation and voluntary fair lending compliance by the lending community. 41 pp. CONTACT: Washington Legal Foundation, 2009 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/588-0302.

<b>The Menace of Regulation,</b> by Michal Tosovsky<br>
Klub Mediator
<p>
Michal Tosovsky, president of the Czech Government Office for Standards, Metrology and Testing, defines the problems of regulation, focusing on Czech legislation since 1989, developments in the European Union, and experience gained from over-regulation in the United States. Tosovsky cites examples of excessive Czech legislation in the last five years: the Trading Act, Construction Act, Act on Authorized Architects and Engineers, Consumer Protection Act, Act on Czech Business Inspection Bureau, and the Act on State Testing. This paper examines these pieces of legislation and demonstrates the precedent they set for future increased regulation. The author concludes by recommending improvement of private legal mechanisms, implementation of EU regulations, coordination of deregulation measures and increased private deregulation initiatives. 23 pp. CONTACT: Klub Mediator, Box 115, 110 01 Praha 1, CZECH REPUBLIC, 42 2/539 568.

<b>The Myths and Realities of Trade Deficits,</b> by Bryan T. Johnson<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1039</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Heritage policy analyst Bryan Johnson argues that the driving force behind the Clinton Administration's threat of trade sanctions against Japan and its other managed trade policies is a misguided belief that trade deficits are harmful to the economy. Johnson states that the administration's managed trade policies are based on a number of faulty assumptions and myths about trade deficits including: trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial; trade deficits cost jobs; Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies; since the US is unable to sell some goods and services in Japan, their markets must be closed; and trade sanctions to redress imbalances will protect American jobs. Johnson challenges each of these assumptions and others, proving that trade retaliation, in most cases, has failed to open markets while costing American consumers billions in higher prices. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Reinventing the Regulatory System: No Downsizing in Administration Plan,</b> by Melinda Warren and Barry Jones<br>
Occasional Paper No. 155, Center for the Study of American Business
<p>
Researchers Melinda Warren and Barry Jones question the administration's call for $16.6 billion in spending for regulatory programs in fiscal year 1996. Warren and Jones point out that this represents a 3.3 percent real increase, even after adjusting for inflation. This report also predicts that staffing figures will reach a new peak in 1996132,000 regulators. Warren and Jones conclude that the Clinton budget for 1996 appears to ignore the public's desire for less regulation and the administration's talk of reinventing government and streamlining the regulatory system has yet to be translated into action. 36 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

<b>Trade Policy Ahead: Three Tracks and One Question,</b> by Ernest H. Preeg<br>
Center for Strategic and International Studies
<p>
Ernest Preeg, the William M. Scholl Chair in International Business at CSIS, asserts that the structure of world trade has changed fundamentally in three ways since the early 1980s: 1) international trade in goods and services has become increasingly related to the international flow of capital, technology, and laborthe factors of production; 2)national economies and corporate strategies are increasingly dependent on international markets due largely to information-based technological change; 3)the polarization of the global industrialization process into three regions (Western Europe, North America, and East Asia) has intensified, one-half of world trade now takes place within these three regions. Preeg demonstrates that the changed structure has been reinforced by another change in the international trading systemfrom a multilateral yet, according to the author, narrowly drawn GATT to a system of multilateral commitments, regional free trade agreements, and selective bilateral accords.<i> Trade Policy Ahead </i>poses the question of how to manage the three tracks in a consistent, mutually reinforcing way toward broadly established goals. Preeg writes, "The time is finally ripe to include international investment policy within the framework of the multilateral trading system . . . and a central objective should be to launch negotiations for expansion of the WTO to a WTIOa World Trade and Investment Organization." 75 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K St., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20006, 202/887-0200.

<h3><i>Taxation and Budget</i></h3>
<p>
<b>The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans,</b> by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Small Business Survival Foundation
<p>
Raymond Keating, chief economist for the Small Business Survival Foundation, evaluates the current tax system and the leading proposals for reformthe flat tax, national retail sales tax, consumed-income tax, and the value-added tax (VAT). Each tax plan is analyzed according to eight criteria: ability to promote economic growth, rate of capital taxation, inflation factor, clarity of the tax system, simplicity, limits to bureaucracy and intrusiveness, minimized incentives for tax avoidance, and limitations to government spending. Keating offers a simple scoring system, assigning one point for each criteria fulfilled, a half point for each partially met, and zero points for those not met at all. From highest to lowest, the plans scored as follows: flat tax, national retail sales tax, VAT, consumed income tax, and the current income tax. The author concludes by recommending reducing the size of the federal government substantially and moving to a low, flat income tax of 10 percent, with no taxation of capital gains, dividends, interest from savings, or business income. Keating ultimately suggests repealing the 16th Amendment and replacing the income tax with a nation retail sales tax of less than 10 percent. 38 pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 18th Street, NW, Suite 2000, Washington, DC 20036, 202/785-0238, fax 202/822-8118.

<b>A Citizen's Guide to the State Budget Mess: A Menu of 217 Proposals to Reduce State Government Spending,</b> by Tom McClintock<br>
<i>Briefings</i>, The Claremont Institute
<p>
Former California Assemblyman Tom McClintock presents 217 specific reductions that could be made in the 1995-1996 California budget. Total savings from these proposals, which include contracting out services, abolishing obsolete agencies and programs, controlling the growth of the bureaucracy, and operation reforms, amount to more that $11.7 billion, including $1.2 billion in proposals by the Legislative Analyst's Office in 64 items. This work breaks the budget down into ten areas, from state and consumer services to health and welfare to youth and adult corrections. The author identifies many of the smaller, less costly programs that often get "lost" in the process of compiling large budgets. The savings amount to 13 percent of all funds proposed to be spent in the Governor's budget, or 18 percent of General and Special Funds. These proposals would also eliminate $725 million in fees to California citizens. 51 pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 2012 H St., Suite 101, Sacramento, CA 95814, 916/446-7924.

<p>
<b>What To Do About Medicare,</b> Stuart M. Butler, Robert E. Moffitt, and John C. Liu<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1038</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Stuart Butler, vice president and director of domestic and economic policy studies, Bob Moffitt, deputy director of domestic policy studies, and John Liu, policy analyst, demonstrate that for the Medicare system to achieve long-term actuarial balance without reform, the trust fund would require an immediate payroll tax increase of 3.52 percent, which would raise taxes by $711 billion over the next five years. This increase would only fund the hospital program, not the fund for physicians' services. This paper suggests, "Instead of trying to tighten current controls on deregulation, the proper reform is to create a very different dynamic and set of incentives to drive the Medicare program. Specifically, the bureaucratic, standardized, command-and-control structure of today's Medicare must be replaced with consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits." Butler, Moffit, and Liu recommend offering the a plan modeled after the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. The major difference between this and the current system is that the government would make a defined financial contribution to the plan of the retiree's choice, rather that reimbursing Washington-approved service according to a fee schedule. This paper concludes that if Congress fails to institute fundamental reform, either the elderly will be faced with a dramatic reduction in health service or working families will be forced to pay sharply higher payroll taxes. Reform would provide a new Medicare system based on consumer choice, with security for both today and tomorrow's retirees. 22 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Medical Savings Accounts: Answering the Critics</b>, by Michael Tanner<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 228</i>, Cato Institute
<p>
Michael Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at Cato, seeks to answer the concerns of the critics of consumer-based health care. Tanner addresses four questions often raised by those who oppose MSAs: claims that health care has become so complex that consumers are unable to make cost-conscious decisions about their treatment; claims that consumers will forgo necessary or preventative care to save money in their medical savings accounts; claims that MSAs would attract the healthy, while the sick remain in conventional insurance programs; and claims that MSAs are regressive, providing benefits primarily to the wealthy. This paper provides the information that supporters of MSAs require to rebut the arguments of those opposing reform. The author admits that MSAs are not perfect, but maintains that they represent a significant step toward solving the cost and access problems of our health care system. 18 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<b>The Private-Sector Health Care Revolution: How It's Controlling Costs Across Florida and America,</b> by Melanie S. Tammen<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 16</i>, James Madison Institute
<p>
James Madison Institute research associate Melanie Tammen reveals that, despite the failure of Medicare and Medicaid, Florida Governor Lawton Chiles and President Clinton continue to promote plans which will force more and more people into government-intermediated health care programs. This paper maintains that Chiles' Florida Health Security Plan would dramatically expand the scope of the state's 11 new regional purchasing alliances by having them sell government subsidized health plans to low and middle-income residents. Tammen recommends reforms that facilitate universal coverage and affordability in marketplace, rather than plans to provide universal coverage along with large, expensive, taxpayer-financed programs. Tammen encourages Florida legislators to oppose Florida's new health care bureaucracy, the Community Health Purchasing Alliances, and pursue measures to further development of private sector reform. 16 pp. CONTACT: The James Madison Institute for Public Policy Studies, P.O.

<b>Managing Doctors</b>, by Allan Bruce and Sandra Hill<br>
The David Hume Institute
<p>
Allan Bruce and Sandra Hill, both of Glasgow Caledonian University, focus on how health care moneys are to be managed and acknowledge the conflict between the managerial and clinical goals of the National Health Service in Scotland. This paper surveys opinions and beliefs of health managers and doctors in the West of Scotland. Bruce and Hill demonstrate that future reforms will require the input of both managers and doctors, in order to define a common agenda. This work begins the process of discovering the views of doctors, managers, and consultants towards research, management, medical direction, clinical direction, and training and preparation of doctors for management. The authors conclude by assessing the value of doctors as full-time managers, part-time managers, and as advisors. 49 pp. CONTACT: The David Hume Institute, 21 George Square, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, SCOTLAND, 0131/650-4633 or fax 0131/667-9111.

<b>Government in Health Care: Lessons from the UK</b>, by W. Duncan Reekie<br>
The Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies
<p>
Duncan Reekie, the Bradlow Professor of Business Economics at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, criticizes, as one who grew up under Britain's National Health Service (NHS), the Clinton administration's approach to health care. The proponents of NHS used the same arguments used by the Clintons, and the author investigates these arguments, revealing their flaws from 1948 and now. Reekie recognizes that the Clintons' plan is substantially different from the NHS and that most of the alternate plans in Congress are subject to market-based objections as well. The author discusses why he believes a Clinton health care program, like the NHS, would lead to a politicized health care system dominated by special interests, "fostering not trust but distrust between patient and physician." Reekie demonstrates that once a government-dominated health care system is in place, it is nearly impossible to abolish. This paper warns the American electorate of the perils of national health care and urges Americans to learn from the mistakes of the UK. 116 pp. CONTACT: The Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies, School of Business and Economics, California State University, Hayward, CA 94542, 510/885-3275, or fax 510/885-4442.

<b>Waiting Your Turn: Hospital Waiting Lists in Canada,</b> by Cynthia Ramsay and Michael Walker
<i>Critical Issues Bulletin</i>, Fraser Forum
<p>
The current<i> Critical Issues Bulletin </i>attempts to document the extent to which lines are being used as a means of adapting to the conflict between limited budgetary allocations and potentially unlimited demand for free health care in the Canadian health system. Ramsay and Walker compiled data based on the waiting time in hospitals across Canada. The results suggest, based on the increased waiting times and the increased concern of the government to continue to supply the norm of health care services, that waiting lists have become an alternative to rising prices by restraining health care expenses in a system where prices have been systematically eliminated and neither physicians nor patients have any economic incentive to consider the costs of their decisions. 50 pp. CONTACT: The Fraser Institute, 626 Bute St., Vancouver, BC, CANADA V6E 3MI, 604/688-0221.

<b>Welfare Reform: Allow Welfare to Wither So Charities Can Bloom,</b> by Stuart Anderson<br>
<i>Issue Brief</i>, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution
<p>
Stuart Anderson, policy director at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, suggests that public policy analysts should pose two questions: in what areas are charitable organizations superior to the government in providing sevices to those less fortunate? and how can American society put more resources into the hands of charitable organizations to provide those services? This paper recommends that these decisions be made at a local level, and therefore the federal welfare system must give states flexibility to design their own approaches without interference from Washington. This study presents three significant findings: 1) the non-profit group Community for Creative Non-Violence spent $365,000 in 1992 to house 1400 homeless individuals on a nightly basis, while the DC government spent $26.4 million to house 2280 homeless people nightly in government shelters; 2) over a period of years, the city government paid the Pitts Hotel the $12.48 per person, per day for food, which amounted to 78 times the cost of three meals provided by the charity-run DC Central Kitchen (with donations and food purchased from local food banks, the DC Kitchen can serve meals at a cost of 16 cents per person.); and 3) advocates for the poor are restricted by regulations that  limit flexibility and creativity. 8 pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22201, 703/351-4969, or fax 703/351-0090.

<i>Briefing Papers No. 23,</i> Cato Institute
<p>
Milton Friedman addresses the immediate need to reconstruct the education system at both the elementary and secondary levels to offset the growing wage differential crisis in the United States. He recommends privatizing a large segment of the school system, allowing for the creation of a for-profit education industry. This plan would offer effective competition to public schools by creating a free-market for choice in education. The system he proposes enables parents to select the schools their children attend by means of a universal voucher system that would be sufficient to cover the costs of a high-quality education. 7 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<b>School Choice: Its Time Has Come,</b> by Allyson M. Tucker and William F. Lauber<br>

<p>
Allyson M. Tucker, policy council director at the National Policy Forum, and William F. Lauber aid to Representative Chris Cox (R-CA); both former Heritage Foundation analysts, report strong evidence that concludes that the school choice movement is gaining ground at the state level. Their argument originates from the strong results pro-school choice candidates had at the polls in the 1994 elections, indicating that 1995 could be the year that school choice legislation will make significant gains. Lisa Graham was elected for state superintendent of schools in Arizona, with 59 percent of the vote, on a platform centered on school choice. At the gubernatorial level, candidates such as George W. Bush of Texas, George Pataki of New York, and John Rowland of Connecticut won as advocates of school choice. Proponents of choice can also expect action from Congress in 1995. Debate is going on in both chambers on "how the federal government can help states implement choice." Discussion is expected to focus on using funds from Chapter One for vouchers. Chapter One is the largest federal aid program for poor elementary and secondary students. Other articles address the tax status of the NEA and deregulating schools. 3 pp. CONTACT: The Heartland Institute, 800 East Northwest Highway, Suite 1080, Palantine, IL 60067-6516, 708/202-3060, or fax 708/202-9799.

J. Stanley Marshall, Chairman and CEO of The James Madison Institute, and Acting Director of Floridians for Educational Choice, provides another chapter in the fight for the school choice movement in America. Marshall advocates the theory that parents, as opposed to government bureaucrats, are more able to select the schools their children attend based upon: the values they embrace, the teachers they employ, and the curriculum they uphold. The author also provides an in-depth section in his paper devoted to rebutting the attacks school choice opponents most commonly use to halt the movement. He debunks fifteen myths surrounding the school choice debate, including: 1) school choice is unconstitutional at state and local levels; 2) choice carries a heavy price tag; 3) school choice will wipe out the gains made in desegregation; and 4) choice will relegate poor children to the worst schools. 52 pp. CONTACT: Floridians for Educational Choice, P.O.

John E. Berthoud, vice president of The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, presents his case for eliminating the U.S. Department for Education. While debate continues on the educational benefits of returning control of education to state and local governments, Berthoud's paper makes the case for the potential cost savings of such decentralization. Terminating the department would eliminate the cost of maintaining a separate bureaucracy and the interest group pressures to increase spending. Alexis de Tocqueville Institution also reported the following findings: 1) eliminating the U.S. Department of Education would save taxpayers $15.7 billion dollars over a five-year period; 2) since education became the 12th cabinet department in 1979, the department's spending has risen three times as fast as the non-defense discretionary budget; and 3) taxpayers would have saved 5 billion dollars since 1979, if federal education spending had grown at the same rate as non-defense discretionary spending. 17pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22201, 703/351-4969, or fax 703/351-0090.

B. Delworth Gardner, professor emeritus at Brigham Young University, explores the consequences and incentives of current agricultural policies. Gardner asserts that farm subsidies reduce the national standard of living and redistribute income from taxpayers and consumers to farmers and landowners. This book shows how consumers pay for agricultural products twice, first in taxes to provide subsidies and then in retail stores with higher prices caused by the subsidies. Gardner also focuses on the environmental damages caused by farms subsidies. The book concludes by recommending the elimination of the agricultural subsidy process and increasing the sale of American agriculture abroad. 348 pp. CONTACT: Pacific Research Institute, 755 Sansome St., San Francisco, CA 94111, 415/989-0833.

<b>Superfund: This Time Let's Get It Right,</b> by Richard J. Mahoney<br>

<p>
Richard Mahoney, a distinguished executive in residence at CSAB, acknowledges that Superfund, due to its perverse and conflicting incentives, encourages litigation and delay among conflicting parties rather than the clean up of Superfund sites. As Congress attempts to repair the damage of Superfund legislation, Mahoney suggests Ten Points of Resolution: retroactive liability should be retained as in the current law; insurance issues should be left to settlement by the parties involved; joint and several liability would be replaced by proportionate liability; the highest priority is the completion of Superfund's Emergency Removal program; no new additions should be made to the Superfund NPL list during the life of the Emergency Removal program; Superfund sites should be divided into two categories, those where containment is satisfactory and those whose future use is yet undetermined or unlikely to be industrial; a substantial amount of Superfund moneys would be allocated to proposals to develop cost-effective, neighbor-friendly permanent remediation; communities should be empowered and funded for full participation in the Superfund Trust; minor participants at sites should be relieved from all future liability upon payment of a nominal share; and minority and/or poor communities would receive preferential priority. Mahoney suggests that these Ten Points of Resolution represent an outline for Superfund reform and provide a basis for tradeoffs among the various parties' interests. 9 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

<b>Time to Reopen the Clean Air Act: Clearing Away the Regulatory Smog,</b> by K.H. Jones and Jonathan Adler<br>
<i><b>Policy Analysis No. 233</i></b>, Cato Institute
<p>
K.H. Jones, president of Zephyr Consulting Company, and Jonathan Adler, associate director of environmental studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argue that the national policy on the control of urban smog is misguided because it fails to account for current population trends and is based on the anomalous meteorological conditions of 1988. This paper describes how this is particularly important in the Ozone Transport Region, the 12 states from Virginia to Maryland. The regulatory programs being proposed resemble the low-emission vehicle standards in California. The authors write, "The sort of control for control's sake' pollution control strategies pursued by the EPA and the Ozone Transportation Commission are largely inappropriate because they are neither cost-effective nor equitable means of achieving emissions reductions, even should such reductions be necessary." This paper recommends alleviating unneeded and costly regulatory mandates under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. 47 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

Wittman and Griffin write, "Taxpayer funding of advocacy groups is wrongfiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return to the people. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures."

Defenders of Property Rights has come to the aid of Pennsylvania farmer Bob Brace, who is being prosecuted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He has been accused of violating federal wetlands statutes. Defenders has filed an amicus brief in support of Mr. Brace's petition to have his case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The government claims Brace violated Section 404(f) of the Clean Water Act when he upgraded his farm's drainage system in 1977. This improvement, which allowed him to farm thirty acres of land that was previously useful for little more than pasture, was cited as an unpermitted discharge of fill. The EPA ordered him to remove the drainage system to allow the land to return to its alleged "natural state" as a wetland. Failure to do so could subject him to fines as high as $25,000 a day.
Mr. Brace contends his changes to the property are permitted by the Clean Water Act. Section 404(f) states that discharge permits are not required for "normal farming activity," specifically stating "the maintenance of drainage ditches...is not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation under this section."<br>
Brace can expect word from the high court as to whether whey will hear his case sometime this fall.

Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Strikes Down Scheme that Raised Utility Costs
In a case in which the New England Legal Foundation filed a friend of the court brief, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court struck down an ordinance enacted by the city of Somerville which required utilities to pay a single contractor chosen by the city to do all excavation and paving work on city streets. The chosen contractor had used its government-created monopoly to charge utilities twice the rate it charged for such work in neighboring towns.<br>
The "City Contract Representative" was chosen by the city but paid by any utility that had to do street work. Bid specifications were so narrowly drawn that only one contractor qualified for the job. Utilities which refused to use the Representative were denied needed permits. The Representative had no incentive to work quickly nor, because its pay is based on the amount of asphalt used, efficiently. Because the city instructed the Representative to put the street into better condition than it was before being opened, it was able to make utilities and, ultimately, their customers pay for routine street work.<br>
An <i>amicus  </i>brief filed by NELF argued that the Somerville ordinance was not only unwise but that it exceeded the city's legal authority to maintain public streets and conflicted with state's supervisory power over utility regulation. In effect, NELF argued, Somerville had imposed an unauthorized and illegal tax on all utility customers. The Supreme Judicial Court has now agreed.

A Superior Court judge in Connecticut threw out the case; the thief is appealing.<br>
NELF will file an<i> amicus </i>brief supporting the lower court. In this case, as in other recent Rhode Island and Vermont cases, NELF will argue that the traditional common law rule, that landowners are not obliged to spend money making their property safe for trespassers, is both good and sound public policy. Furthermore, NELF will argue that a state PUC rule, which requires utilities to take reasonable precautions to ensure that consumers and others are not endangered by company equipment, did not require anything more than the clear and visible warnings which the company did post.<br>

City of Culver City.</i> In June, PLF filed a friend of the court brief in the California Supreme Court in one of the most important "regulatory takings" cases to come before the state justices in 17 years. Since 1992, PLF has been supporting Richard Ehrlich's attempt to invalidate "mitigating" fees imposed on him as a condition for receiving a permit to construct a housing development.<br>
For several years, Mr. Ehrlich operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a town-house condominium project on the property. The City Council approved the building project on the condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis courts.<br>
PLF contends that the fee is unconstitutional because it fails the rough proportionality test laid down last June by the U.S. Supreme Court in<i> Dolan v. City of Tigard.</i> In<i> Dolan,</i> The Supreme Court invalidated a condition by the City of Tigard, Oregon, that a landowner give 10% of her property for public use in exchange for a permit to expand her plumbing supply store. Such conditions for a permit are justifiable only if local officials can show that there is a reasonable connection or essential "nexus" between the conditions and any harm caused by the project being permitted. The extent of the exaction must also be "roughly proportional" to the project's impact on the community.<br>
PLF helped Mr. Ehrlich win an order from the U.S. Supreme Court that 1) vacated a Court of Appeal ruling upholding the city's fees, and 2) sent the case back to the appellate court with instructions to reconsider in light of the <i>Dolan</i> decision. The Court of Appeal affirmed that development fees must meet the high level of scrutiny required by <i>Dolan.</i> Unfortunately, it misapplied the<i> Dolan </i>test to the facts of this case and held that the fee was related to the impacts caused by a change in land use designation needed for the construction of the condominiums.<br>
PLF also will assist Mr. Ehrlich's attorney in preparing for oral argument before the state Supreme Court.

<b>U.S. Supreme Court Strikes Down Congressional Ballot Access Restrictions</b><br>
<i>U.S. Term Limits v. Thorton.</i> In a major setback for term limit proponents, the U.S. Supreme Court held on May 22, that voter-enacted ballot access restrictions on members of Congress are unconstitutional. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the Justices held that the qualifications for congressional services set forth in the Constitution are "fixed" in that they may not be supplemented by Congress or the states. PLF, on behalf of Citizens for Term Limits filed friend of the court briefs in the case urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case and arguing in support of Arkansas' ballot access measure, Amendment 73.<br>
Amendment 73, an amendment to Arkansas' constitution, prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for Congress form appearing on the general election ballot if that candidate had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate. That person could run as a write-in candidate, however. PLF attorneys argued, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution permits states to regulate the "time, place, and manner" of elections. They asserted that measures like Amendment 73 do not bar anyone from running for office, but only restrict ballot access in certain circumstances.<br>
The High Court ruled that the Constitution is the exclusive source of qualifications for members of Congress and that states may not add qualifications. Even though Amendment 73 allows congressional candidates to run as "write-in" candidates and serve if elected, the Court nevertheless considered this to be an indirect attempt at evading the Qualifications Clause's requirements.
The ruling has absolutely nothing to do with term limits on state officeholders. But according to recent news stories some term limit opponents are claiming the decision may open the door to a renewed challenge to term limits imposed on state legislators and constitutional officers. PLF successfully represented the proponents of California's Proposition 140 (state term limits) before the California and United Sates Supreme Courts. Any attempt to relitigate and overturn that settled victory will be met by a forceful defense by PLF attorneys.

<b>Important Rent Control Victory in New York Upheld</b><br>
<i>Manocherian v. Lenox Hill Hospital</i>. Late May, the U.S. Supreme Court denied review and let stand a key property rights decision by New York's highest court. Last October, the New York Court of Appeals struck down a provision of the state's rent control law relating to the subleasing of rent-stabilized apartments as applied to nonprofit hospitals. PLF filed a friend of the court brief in support of the property owner.<br>
Lenox Hill Hospital leases rent-stabilized apartments in New York and subleases them to its nurses as an employee benefit. Ten years ago, Lenox Hill Secured passage of a law that required apartment owners who lease apartments to the hospital to offer lease renewals directly to Lenox Hill rather than to the individual nurses who occupy the apartments. Because Lenox Hill has a perpetual corporate existence, this law has the effect of denying the owners any expectation of being able to reoccupy their property, as they could if their primary tenant was a natural person. <br>
New York's highest court declared the law to be unconstitutional for "not substantially advancing a closely and legitimately connected State interest."<br>
In its majority opinion, the Court of Appeals returned again and again to <i>Nollan's </i>requirement that property regulations be closely related to the advancement of a legitimate governmental interest. <i>Nollan </i>and other recent Supreme Court cases are seen to lay down "a constitutional minimum floor of protection which this Court lacks authority to diminish under the Supremacy Clause."<br>

<b>ACLU Sues School for Making Bibles Available to Students</b><br>
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Upshur County Board of Education and Superintendent Lynn Westfall because they agreed to allow a citizen group to place a box of free Bibles for students on school property. The Rutherford Institute represented the school board and the superintendent in the case tried before U.S. District Court Judge Irene M. Keeley.<br>
The case began on Dec. 6, 1994 when the school board voted to permit a citizen group comprised of local businesses to place boxes of Bibles in the Upshur County Public Schools on Feb. 27, 1995, for students to pick up on a voluntary basis. As a result, on Feb. 23, 1995, the ACLU on behalf of several parents, sued the school and obtained an order forbidding the school from permitting anyone to make Bibles available to students while the case was pending.<br>
The Rutherford Institute asked the court to recognize that a public school's decision to permit outside groups to make free written materials available to students does not violate the Establishment Clause merely because the outside group chooses the Bible as the material to make available.
<p>
<b>Red Cross Retracts Attack on Religious Freedom Law</b><br>
The Red Cross has amended its motion to dismiss a religious discrimination case against it to exclude its prior argument that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is unconstitutional. The Red Cross had included this argument in its April 1995 motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed against it in Federal District Court by Herbert Hall, A Rutherford Institute client denied Red Cross instructor certification in a government funded AIDS awareness program because he is involved in a Christian ministry.<br>
Because Hall was denied instructor certification in February 1993, The Rutherford Institute filed a complaint in February 1995 against the Red Cross in the Central District Court of California. In response, the Red Cross moved to dismiss the case, stating that RFRA is unconstitutional.
<p>
<b>Valedictorian to Deliver Religious Speech at Graduation</b><br>
DeSoto, Texas, May 22, 1995--Late yesterday, the DeSoto Independent School District agreed to allow valedictorian Shannon Leigh Welch to deliver an unedited graduation speech containing references to God and to religion. Gregory P. Gorman, a participating attorney with The Rutherford Institute, represented Welch. <br>
On May 18, 1995, Welch submitted her speech to the school's English Department for grammatical editing. As a result, school officials informed Welch that school policy required her to remove religious references and the words "God" and "Jesus Christ" from her speech. School officials also advised Welch to rewrite her speech.<br>
The Rutherford Institute, on May 21, 1995, hand delivered opinion letters to the school board, superintendent and principal, informing them that they were violating Welch's constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights by forcing her to remove religious references from her speech. In response, the school district reversed its position.

<b>United Artists Theaters Reimburses Employee Fired for Religious Beliefs<br></b>
United Artists Theaters agreed to reimburse Shawn DeArmond for lost wages yesterday after they fired him last December for refusing to work on Christmas day.<br>
The case began in December 1994, when DeArmond requested to have Christmas day off because of his religious beliefs. DeArmond's supervisor at the U.A. Aptos Theater told him that if he didn't work, he would be fired. DeArmond refused to work and was fired.<br>
As a result, The Rutherford Institute contacted United Artist's director of human resources and negotiated a settlement which reimbursed DeArmond for his lost wages.<br>

<b>WLF Assists Texas in Death Penalty Case</b><br>
At the request of the Texas Attorney General's Office, WLF filed a brief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas supporting the state's effort to carry out the death sentence imposed on a murderer who argued, in a <i>habeas corpus</i> petition, that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to execute him after his 12 years on death row. WLF's brief in the case, <i>Lackey v. Scott,</i> pointed out that his argument has no basis in the text of history of the Eight Amendment and that the inmate himself is responsible for creating the delay by availing himself of state and federal review procedures.
<p>
<b>Federal Court Asked to Dismiss Suit on "Three-Fifths" Rule for Tax Votes</b><br>
WLF filed a brief on behalf of itself and 22 Members of Congress urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to dismiss <i>Skaggs v. Carle, </i>a suit filed by Democratic Members of Congress to invalidate new House Rules that would make it more difficult for Congress to raise taxes. House Rule XXI (c)requires a three-fifths vote to raise taxes, and House Rule XXI (d) prohibits consideration of retroactive tax increases. WLF argued that the case is not justifiable and that each House of Congress has the power to set the rules of its own proceedings. WLF further pointed out that by the plaintiffs' reasoning, numerous long-standing congressional rules and practices would also be unconstitutional, including the Senate's cloture rule.
<p>
<b>WLF Supports Landowner in Fight Against Confiscatory Regulation</b><br> 
In <i>Ehrlich v. Culver, </i>WLF urged the Supreme Court of California to reverse a lower court decision that allowed a city to require a developer to pay for the construction of public tennis courts as a condition for letting the developer erect townhomes on his property. The city argues that because the developer was closing his private tennis club, the city needed money from him to replace his tennis courts. WLF argues that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last year in<i> Dolan v. City of Tigard </i>allows a municipality to consider only the future effects of a development in assessing development exactions, not the property's prior use.<br>
<p>
<b>Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Supports AFDC Residence Rule in Court</b><br>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on behalf of itself; David Prosser, Jr., Speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly; and a bipartisan group of federal and state legislators and Wisconsin citizens in support of a Wisconsin welfare reform measure in<i> V.C. v. Whitburn.</i> Under benefits for the first six months of their Wisconsin residence as if they were in their former state. WLF's brief opposes the suit brought by Legal Action of Wisconsin, which claims that the program violates the recipients' constitutional right to travel and that federal statutory and regulatory requirements governing research experiments on human subjects require Wisconsin to obtain the consent of all welfare recipients who are affected by the program.
<p>
<b>Constitutionality of "Official English" Defended in Ninth Circuit</b><br>
In <i>Yniguez v. State of Arizona, WLF </i>filed a brief on behalf of itself and the Center for Equal Opportunity in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in support of Arizona's "Official English" 1988 ballot measure, which amended the Arizona Constitution to require that the state and local governments of Arizona must act in English (with exceptions to protect public health or safety, to protect the rights of crime victims or criminal defendants, or to comply with federal law, such as federal requirements that mandate bilingual education). Following passage of the measure, Arizona was sued by a state employee who claimed she has a First Amendment right to continue to practice conversing with Spanish-speaking malpractice claimants in Spanish and to continue filling out release-of claim forms in Spanish--a language that her supervisor did not understand, leaving him unable to review the forms. WLF's brief was filed before the Ninth Circuit sitting en banc, which will review the panel decision that accepted the employee's position and struck down the amendment in its entirety.<br>

<p><b>Retreat or Reform? Russia's Struggle for Democracy,</b> by Robert Halfon<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 62,</I> Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies
<p>Robert Halfon, director of research at Market Access International, a leading public affairs consultancy in the UK, points out that the re-emergence of hardline communism as a significant political force is a matter of great concern. He suggests that the real danger lies in the way in which Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic party justify Russian "sabre-rattling" in Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, for the purpose of intimidating the West into accepting policies which may prove detrimental to its interests. Halfon cites the military-industrial complex and the former KGB leaders as other areas where communists still present an obstacle to liberalization. Therefore, the author concludes, western democracies have a crucial role to play in identifying and promoting Russian democratic groups and leaders and encouraging their political programs. 50 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies, St. George's House, 14/17 Wells Street, London, ENGLAND, W1P 3FP, 0171/637-2152, or fax 0171/637-2155.

<p><b>The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act: Helping to Create a Free and Prosperous Cuba,</b> by Bryan T. Johnson<br>
<i>Issue Bulletin No. 208,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Policy Analyst Bryan Johnson examines the possible effects of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, which is currently before the Senate. He encourages the Senate to take this opportunity to strengthen the bill which passed the House by including several measures: 1) strengthen the provision prohibiting international financial institutions from providing loans and guarantees to Castro's Cuba; 2) create a provision designating as a hostile act any move by Castro to unleash a mass exodus of illegal emigrants; 3) restore Cuba's share of US sugar import quotas to near its 1958 level once Castro is gone and a democratic transition government is in place; 4) eliminate language authorizing the President to provide government-subsidized financing and other programs to a post-Castro Cuba; 5) direct the President to seek a free trade area agreement with a post-Castro Cuba; and 6) require that the President begin processing the 25,000 refugees at Guantanamo for controlled entry into the US. Johnson proposes that these measures will tighten the existing embargo and help end Castro's 40 year nightmare in Cuba. 10 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>NATO and US Interests, </b>by W. Bruce Weinrod<br>
<i>Commonsense, Vol. 2 No. 1,</i> National Policy Forum
<p>W. Bruce Weinrod, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy in the Bush administration, outlines and addresses the serious questions being raised about the relevance and future of NATO. As the United States and its European allies enter a new era in international politics, NATO must decide how its role and membership reflect this new era. Weinrod writes, "The best way for NATO to help assure a Europe 'whole and free' is to bring the democratic nations of Europe closer to NATO, with the objective of making them members." In order to clarify these decisions for NATO, the US must first clarify many of the foggy points of its own foreign policy, and the current administration must be willing to exert its leadership over this process. 13 pp. CONTACT: National Policy Forum, 229<P8M><$E1/2><P255D> Pennsylvania Ave., SE, Washington, DC 20003, 202/544-2900.

<p><b>Do We Need the IMF and the World Bank?,</b> by Sir Alan Walters<br>
<i>Current Controversies No. 10,</i> The Institute of Economic Affairs
<p>Before embarking on any new initiatives for either the IMF or the World Bank, Walters suggests, these two powerful institutions are overdue for a performance re-examination. Walters, having formerly served as an economic advisor to the Prime Minister, points out that attempts to downsize the Fund and the Bank always end up making them larger. The author also acknowledges that both institutions, besides outgrowing their original purposes, have become increasingly political particularly in the case of Russia, where normal conditions have been relaxed. Walters concludes, "ideally the Bank and the Fund should be abolished. If central banks want a central bankers' bank they (not governments) should control it."

<p><b>About-Turn in Hungarian Foreign Policy,1990-1994, </b>by Ivn Bba<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 2,</i> Windsor Klub
<p>Once known as the Happiest Barracks in the Camp, Hungary did more than any other ex-Warsaw Pact state after 1989 to undo the legacy of the international order created by the Cold War. Guided by the statesmanlike vision of Prime Minister Jzsef Antall, Hungarian foreign policy between 1990 and 1994 consistently pursued the aims of Euro-Atlantic integration and regional co-operation. Despite the break-up of no less than three neighboring countries (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union), Hungary remained an important source of stability and pro-Western resolve. In this study, the deputy state secretary at the foreign ministry for these years assesses the successes and failures of his country's policies and considers the impact that last year's electoral victory by the Socialist Party will have on Hungary's acceding to such institutions as NATO and the EU. 29 pp. CONTACT: Johnathan Sunley, Windsor Klub, Falk Miksa utca 12.I.1a, Budapest 1055, HUNGARY, 361/112-3701

<p><b>Red Tape In America: Stories From The Front Line,</b> by Craig E. Richardson and Geoff C. Ziebart, The Heritage Foundation
<p>The Heritage Foundation's report on American bureaucracy reveals the horror stories that result from a regulatory system that has become not merely ineffective but harmful. This study begins by reviewing the general impact of government regulation and then examines specific federal agencies and statutes. Among these are the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Endangered Species Act, the Internal Revenue Service, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Americans with Disability Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The cases documented in this report provide irrefutable proof of the degree to which government regulation has harmed both individuals and businesses, stifling creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit. 110 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>Fixing the Roads: A Blueprint for Michigan Transportation Infrastructure Policy,</B> by John C. Taylor<br>
The Mackinac Center for Public Policy 
<p>This comprehensive analysis of Michigan's transportation argues that policy makers must fundamentally reinvent the planning, funding, construction, and maintenance procedures for the state's roads. The federal government returns to Michigan about half the revenues the state sends to Washington from the federal fuel tax. The author projects a savings of over $170 million in the state's department of transportation budget if the state adopted various reforms, including more privatization, tort reform, and relaxation of unrealistic environmental regulations. This study will prove useful to transportation analysts in most other states, as well. 40 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<p><b>The Minimum Wage: No Way to Help the Poor,</b> by Deepak Lal<br>
<i>Occasional Paper 95,</i> The Institute of Economic Affairs
<p>Deepak Lal, a professor of International Development Studies at UCLA, examines the controversy among economists about the effects of a minimum wage. Despite the many recent studies which apparently support the views of politicians in Britain and the US, minimum wages would have widespread effects on labor markets: they would, for example, reduce human capital formations because they would compress the wage structure and undermine incentives to acquire skills. Thus, support for a minimum wage is "at odds with the desire to promote skill accumulation by unskilled workers particularly the young and females. The author suggests that those who fear a situation where workers do not properly market their skills should still be wary of the minimum wage since "there is not obvious technocratic solution which would be better than that discovered by the market." 38 pp. CONTACT: Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord North St., London, England  SW1P 3LB, 071/799-3745.

<p><b>A Higher Standard of Living in Right-to Work States,</b> by James T. Bennett<br>
National Institute for Labor Relations Research
<p>James Bennett's study reveals that residents of Right-to-Work states have higher real incomes on average than the residents of states where workers are forced to pay union dues. In his report Bennett shows that after adjusting for state and local taxes and inflation, the average family in a Right-to-Work state has $2,852 more in purchasing power than a family in a forced-unionism state. The author writes, "In states without Right-to-Work laws high taxes and the high cost of living erode the purchasing power of income so much that families in states with Right-to-Work laws are, on average, better off." This study compares 1993 state and local taxes, as well as the cost of living, in those metropolitan areas in Right-to-Work states to those in forced-unionism states. 12 pp. CONTACT: National Institute for Labor Relations Research, 8001 Braddock Rd., Suite 510, Springfield, VA 22160, 703/321-9606, fax 703/321-7342.

<p><b>The Urgent Need to Finish Farm Trade Reform,</b> by Thomas J. Duesterberg<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 177,</i> Hudson Institute 
<p>Senior Fellow and Director of the Competitiveness Center Thomas Duesterberg demonstrates that the developing world is experiencing a tremendous growth in demand for bulk foodstuffs and processed foods, as the economies of these countries continue to prosper. Duesterberg forecasts that the US agricultural industry is one of the few in the world that can meet this growing demand in an environmentally friendly way. Despite considerable obstacles in much of the developing world including outright bans on many Asian countries, severe restraints, and high tariffs US agricultural exports achieved record sales in 1994. This paper concludes that the US, in order to take advantage of the coming increase in worldwide food demand, must unshackle US producers, and US trade negotiators must take aggressive steps to remove barriers to worldwide trade in bulk and processed agricultural products. 12 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p>Adam Thierer, Walker Fellow in Economic Policy examines why the leading telecommunications deregulation bill in the Senate misses the opportunity to benefit consumers by opening the industry to real competition. This paper explains that the Senate must make several major changes to the current bill, since it currently does not address several issues: some elements of the destructive Cable Act will remain in effect; foreign ownership rules are relaxed only for a portion of US industry and could be enforced retroactively after repeal; no serious effort is made to eliminate the FCC or specific bureaus of the agency; no serious reform of the electromagnetic radio spectrum to encourage increased wireless competition; and the current bill maintains and expands telecommunications entitlements that discourage industry competition. 17 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b><p>Jobs, Growth, Freedom and Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax,</b> by Daniel J. Mitchell<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1035,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>The Armey flat tax proposal has been wildly popular with American taxpayers, not only due to its simplicity but also because of its fairness and potential for producing economic growth. But many taxpayers are not aware of other positive effects of the flat tax: 1) the flat tax would boost national wealth by $1 trillion, since investments would be guided by profitability rather than tax status. 2) a flat tax would treat people equally, no longer penalizing taxpayers based on success or income. 3) Armey's plan would end micromanagement and political favoritism, ridding the tax code of all deduction, loopholes, credits, and special preferences. 4) the flat tax would increase civil liberties by increasing the rights of a taxpayer under IRS investigation. 5) the flat tax would increase tax collections from the wealthy, since the proposal includes incentives to earn and report taxable income. Mitchell concludes that the most important benefit from the flat tax proposal is the reduction of the power of the federal government in taxpayers' lives and businesses. 35 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>Who Really Gains from the Capital Gains Tax?,</b> by Alan Reynolds<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 175,</i> Hudson Institute
<p>Director of Economic Research Alan Reynolds demonstrates why the capital gains tax is an extremely inefficient method of raising revenue. Reynolds claims that  the capital gains tax is easy to avoid, and reporting and monitoring costs are high. The paper reveals that an even worse effect is that the tax decreases the market value of investments and real estate and hinders the economy's allocation of capital assets to their most effective uses. The paper contends that reducing the captial gains tax to to no more than 15 percent, and indexing the basis, would make many people better off (particularly workers) without making anyone worse off. 16 pp. CONTACT: The Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>Why You Can't Trust the IRS,</b> by Daniel J. Pilla<br>
Policy Analysis No. 222, Cato Institute
<p>Daniel Pilla, a tax litigation consultant, forecasts that some 40 million Americans will have had an adversarial confrontation with the IRS by the end of this year. In a rising number of cases, the taxpayer is right, and the IRS is wrong. This study finds that despite a doubling of its budget over the past 10 years and a nearly 20 percent increase in enforcement personnel, the IRS is increasingly incapable of administering and enforcing the nation's tax law. This report cites several reasons the IRS can no longer be trusted, including: 1) the IRS telephone taxpayer assistance program provides about 8.5 million Americans the wrong answers to even the most basic inquiries about tax laws; 2) this year roughly 10 million Americans will receive correction notices from the IRS assessing about $4 billion in fines and penalties about half of these notices will be wrong; 3) about 40 percent of the revenues the IRS collects through penalty assessments are abated when citizens challenge the penalties in 1993 taxpayers were overcharged $5 billion; and 4) a General Accounting Office audit of the IRS in 1993 found widespread evidence of financial malfeasance and gross negligence; the IRS could not account for 64 percent of its congressional appropriation. Pilla reasons that since the IRS fails to meet the standards of financial accountability that it imposes on the citizenry, it can no longer be trusted with the authority to police American businesses and taxpayers. 32 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

<p><b>The Coming Taxpayer Bailout of Social Security,</b> by Gary and Aldona Robbins<br>
<i>IPI Policy Report No. 130,</i> The Institute for Policy Innovation
<p>This study argues that the disappearance of the Social Security Trust fund is due to two factors. First, the US economy has performed more poorly than expected. The last recession, combined with expectations of slower future growth, has caused almost one-quarter of the payroll tax base to evaporate. Second, the Social Security program is making promises it cannot keep, committing to replacing about 42 percent of the average worker's salary in retirement, as contrasted with the one-third of salary replacement promised during Social Security's first three decades. Meanwhile, Medicare benefits are also growing at an even more alarming rate. The authors point out that the revenues necessary to support this rapid growth in Social Security and Medicare will claim almost 15 percent of the US economy within the next 35 years, giving the federal government even greater control over the productive resources of Americans than it already has. The report states that the only way to secure the retirement of the baby boomers is to boost US economic growth and slow the rate of benefit growth. 24 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

<p><b>The Pension Funds Bail-Out: The Biggest Boondoggle Ever,</B> by Steven Plaut<br>
<i>Policy View No. 12,</i> The Shalem Center
<p>Plaut, a professor of Business Administration and Economics at the University of Haifa, analyses the Israeli government's proposed bail-out of the Histadrut Labor Federation's collapsed pension funds and how to solve the problem. Plaut asserts that passage of the deal would be an unprecedented blow to the Israeli economy: the price tag is estimated at $33 billion, about 40 percent of Israel's annual GDP. This is roughly 15 times the size (proportionally) of the American saving and loan bailout of the 1980s. This study shows that the worst part of the bail-out is the plan's inability to address the causes of the crisis. The bail-out leaves the management of the pension funds in the hands of the very people who oversaw the creation of the present actuarial deficits. It does nothing to change the monopolistic, uncompetitive structure of the pension industry in Israel, nor does it address the lack of independent supervision of the pension industry. Plaut recommends that free entry and competition should be allowed among pension plans; issuing subsidized government bonds to the pension funds must end at once; actuarial solvency must be made mandatory, and an independent supervisory body must be established to shut down plans not in compliance. 17 pp. CONTACT: The Shalem Center National Policy Institute, 5 Eliash St., Jerusalem, ISRAEL, 02/254-185, or fax 02/256-720.

John Berthoud, Adjunct Scholar at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, outlines the role of excise taxes in the state budget and questions the economic consequences on Indiana. Berthoud discusses why, despite the myth that excise taxes are "painless," they cause states such as Indiana substantial and widespread economic harm.

This lecture describes the costs and benefits of several different types of welfare reform currently under consideration and analyzes them based on their ability to reduce the welfare system.

<p><b>Integrated Systems in Frontier Health Care Delivery: The Unique Needs of Wyoming,</b> 
edited by Sheryl R. Fox and Alexander T. Hunt<br>
The Center for Strategic and International Studies
<p>This report provides an overview of frontier health care delivery issues from varying perspectives and suggests possible technological and structural solutions to reform health care delivery systems in rural and frontier states. Specifically, the report examines the potential for telemedicine to improve rural health care systems and assesses both the economic implications of telemedicine for health care providers as well as obstacles to its implementation. Contributors raise several key points: First, national health care reform, by its very nature, will be anti-rural, transferring rural wealth to urban areas through whatever taxes are used to extend coverage to the uninsured. Second, in reforming health care, states like Wyoming will most likely need to develop networks based on providers to maximize access to health services. Third, telemedicine, the transmission of image and data via communications technology used by health care providers for treatment, diagnosis, and education of patients irrespective of distance, offers a way to bridge the health care gap in frontier states. This report is the summary of the CSIS Health Care Forum Series. 39 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K St., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC  20006, 202/887-0200.

<p><b>Medical Savings Accounts: A Building Block for Sound Health Care,</b> by Stephen Barchet<br>
The Evergreen Freedom Foundation
<p>Stephen Barchet, chairman of the Washington Medical Savings Account Project, presents his findings from a study to evaluate whether Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) are a viable health care alternative. The study was completed through on-site investigations of companies using MSAs, and their research revealed the following facts: 1) reduced health care expenditures to both the sponsor/employer and employees; 2) wiser use of health services by consumers; 3) greater use of preventative services; 4) increased consumer involvement in health care decisions and purchases; and 5) strong employee participation and satisfaction. Barchet also finds that the sick and poor are better served than in many "managed-care" programs, since they have the same access to health care as everyone else. This study confirms that people controlling their own health care dollars with MSAs do not need huge central bureaucracies to make intimate health care decisions for them. MSAs allow patient choice, high quality medical service, and lower spending all of the benefits government plans promise without the costly, inefficient invasion of a centrally run bureaucracy. 54 pp. CONTACT: The Evergreen Freedom Foundation, P.O.

<p><b>SSI: The Black Hole of the Welfare State,</b> by Christopher M. Wright<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 224,</i> Cato Institute
<p>Christopher Wright examines why the current reforms of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program fall far short of the dramatic overhaul that the open-ended entitlement program needs. The author states that the ultimate goal should be to privatize disability insurance programs. In the meantime, any serious attempts to reform the system, according to Wright, should include the following: 1) ending automatic cost-of-living adjustments; 2) eliminating retroactive lump sum payments; 3) abolishing all SSI assistance to drug addicts and alcoholics; 4) establishing an enrollment cap for SSI. This study concludes that unless the program's costs are brought under control, by the year 2000 SSI will be larger than Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, subsidized housing, the earned income tax credit, and all other forms of public assistance except Medicaid. Major reform, and ultimately privatization, are needed to rein in this costly and corrupt entitlement program. 35 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

This report call for a departure in the way America administers its social welfare programs, stating that what most poor people want are opportunities and responsibilities, not just rights and entitlements. As a result of their findings, the task force has found three principles fundamental to turning the tide of poverty: first, funding and authority for designing and providing services to the poor should be devolved not just from the federal government to the state level, but to the community-based organizations that demonstrate success in dealing with the problems of poverty. Second, individuals and communities must be empowered to create their own solutions through policies that emphasize personal and financial asset development. Third, the present maintenance-focused welfare system must be replaced by policies that promote strong families and emphasize personal responsibility and the development of self-sufficiency. 25 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1367 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1103.

by Jed L. Babbin and Thomas Earl Patton<br>
<i>Critical Legal Issues: Working Paper Series No. 63,</i> Washington Legal Foundation
<p>This working paper argues that the Clinton Administration's bid protest reform proposal is flawed in its reliance on faulty statistical analysis and its failure to recognize the importance of bid protests in the government procurement process. The authors demonstrate how the flaws in the data underlying the administration's recommendations include overstatement of the number of contract awards actually protested and exaggeration of the amount of time protested contracts are delayed. This paper claims that the Administration's opposition to these recommendations overlooks the General Services board of Contract Appeals process, which allows judges dealing with a complex information technology protest to be experienced in technical issues, providing a suspension mechanism to compel and agency to stop performance of the contract during the protest period. The authors suggest some solutions to bid protest problems, including the imposition of liability for frivolous protests, disallowing protest costs for protests that are not granted in their overhead pools, and requiring alternative dispute resolution before proceeding with protests to the General Services Board of Contract Appeals or the General Accounting Office. 23 pp. CONTACT: Washington Legal Foundation, 2009 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/588-0302.

<p><b>The Case for Fundamental Tort Reform,</b> by Michael J. Horowitz<br>

Contingency fees, the near-uniform means of compensating tort claim attorneys, can provide risk-free windfall of profits to lawyers while harming defendants, plaintiffs, and the economy as a whole. Horowitz demonstrates that true reform of the US tort system should include early offer reforms, which seek to ensure the settlement of large numbers of cases before expensive trials and pretrial proceedings, and contingency fee reform, which protects clients from having to pay their attorneys windfall fees far out of proportion to the work performed and the risks assumed in taking a case. 8 pp. CONTACT: The Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<i>Occasional Paper 150,</i> Center for the Study of American Business
<p>Richard Mahoney, a distinguished executive in residence at the Center for the Study of American Business, states that, under certain limited conditions, granting punitive damages can have merit. However, the author warns, the current practice of allowing punitive damages to be awarded over and over again to different plaintiffs against the same defendant for essentially the same issues is illogical. Mahoney presents the results of an informal survey conducted among a large group of American firms: a representative group of 43 large corporations reported that in the past five years a total of $4.4 billion was involved in settlements driven by punitive damages. Mahoney suggests the most practical answer available is legislation at the federal level, like the Hatch bill, that would forbid the repeated award of punitive damages for the same issue. In addition, in order to protect potential claimants against a single punitive award foreclosing a later, larger amount, judges would be empowered to permit punitive damages a second time if the first award was held to be an "insufficient deterrent." 14 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, One Brooking Drive, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5682.

<p><b>Politically Correct: Censorship in American Culture,</b> by John W. Whitehead<br>
Faith and Freedom Series, Moody Bible Institute
<p>John Whitehead, a constitutional attorney and president of the Rutherford Insititute, questions where to draw a line between the wordly call for political correctness and God's call for "biblical" correctness. This booklet gives its readers four ways to fight religious censorship: 1) fully understanding one's religious beliefs; 2) supporting freedom of expression for all; 3) asserting one's rights and those of others; 4) teaching values to children. Whitehead writes, "In a society where secularism rules and tolerance is the greatest value, Christianity has become a target." This book encourages  its readers to take a stand on issues and act on them. 63 pp. CONTACT: Moody Press, c/o MLM, Chicago, IL 60610.
<p><b>Individualism Before Multiculturalism,</b> by Glenn C. Loury<br>
<i>Unum Conversation No. 3,</i> Ethics and Public Policy Center
<p>This edited version of a paper that Loury, a professor at Boston University, presented to a conference of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, states that for America to progress America must define herself. Loury writes as a "veteran of the academic culture wars" and describes a balance between fulfilling the expectations of others and living with integrity. The author explores various philosophical aspects of the racial debate both on American campuses and in America and describes victimization as the one constant, uniting feature of minority Americans. Loury unequivocally states that "whites do not need to be shown how to fear black youths, they must be taught to respect them." And, most importantly, according to Loury, black youths must be worthy of respect. 8 pp. CONTACT: Ethics and Public Policy Center, 1015 15th St., NW, Washington, DC  20005, 202/682-1200.

<p><b>Father Facts,</b> by Wade Horn<br>
The National Fatherhood Initiative
<p>Horn, director of the National Fatherhood Initiative, describes, with overwhelming statistical support, the disturbing increase in father absent fathers. This volume chronicles in stark detail the three-decade slide toward fatherlessness. The author discusses the personal and social consequences for children of father absence. This work takes issue with those who argue that families are merely evolving with little consequence for children. The data presented here lead to the conclusion that if American will ever improve the well-being of her children, America will first have to decrease the number of children who are missing their fathers. 42 pp. CONTACT: National Fatherhood Initiative, 600 Eden Road, Building E, Lancaster, PA 17601, 717/581-8860, or fax 717/581-8862.

<p><h2><i>Legal Action</h2></i>

<b><p>INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE
<p>New Jersey Family Cap Found Constitutional</b><br>
On May 4, 1995, a federal judge ruled in favor of New Jersey's family cap welfare reform experiment.  The lawsuit filed in 1993 by Legal Services of New Jersey and others had asked the judge to block the cap and vacate the federal waiver that permitted it, on the grounds that the federal waiver was unlawful and the reform violated procedural and consitutional rights. The judge stated in his decision that the cap "does not violate any statutory or constitutional mandate," thus upholding the validity of the federal waiver and the program. 
The Institute for Justice filed an amicus brief on behalf of American Legislative Exchange Council, Independent Women's Forum, The Empowerment Network, and five New Jersey AFDC recipients; and played an active role in defending the program. 17 states are currently pursuing similar programs to reform their welfare systems.

<p><b>Institute Challenges Barriers to Interracial Adoption</b ><br>
On April 13, 1995, the Institute for Justice launched a nationwide challenge to "race matching" by state agencies to establish a rule of law that racial discrimination in adoptions is unconstitutional. Its first two test cases are in Texas and Tennessee. In Austin, Texas, the Institute filed a class action lawsuit against the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services, the agency charged with protecting abandoned and neglected children. In Memphis, Tennessee, the Institute joins as co-counsel in an ongoing federal class action, Reisman v. Tennessee Dept. of Human Services. In Reisman, the plaintiff class of minority children in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Human Services challenges the use of racial classifications in the adoptive placement process. Joining the Institute as co-counsel in Texas will be Harvard Law Professors Elizabeth Bartholet, Randall Kennedy, and Laurence Tribe.

<p><b>Repealing the Davis-Bacon Act: Round I</b><br>
In an order released on May 8, federal judge William B. Bryant denied the government's motion to dismiss a constitutional challenge to the Davis-Bacon Act, filed by the Institute for Justice on behalf of minority contractors and public housing tenant groups on the ground that the law is racially discriminatory. The law, which requires "prevailing wages" on nearly all federal contracts, was passed in 1931 and aimed at restricting minority entrepreneurs and workers from competing with mainly white construction unions. The US Department of Labor, which is defending the law, argued that the law was not enacted for discriminatory purposes and asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit. In a one page order, the court refused to do so, allowing the case to proceed.

<p><b>Opening Round Victory for Property Rights in Minnesota</br></b>
On Tuesday, April 4, Anoka county judge William Bearse rejected the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' motion to dismiss the Institute for Justice's lawsuit on behalf of John and Josephine Bronzyk. The Bronzyks are fighting for their right to exclude trespassers from their land that has recently been labeled "public water" by the state. The case will now proceed to trial.

<p>University of Virginia Restores Conservative Student Magazine's Funding</b><br>
A conservative student magazine at the University of Virginia won its appeal of a decision to defund the publication because it was a "political organization." With the assistance of Landmark Legal Foundation, students who publish <i>The Virginia Advocate</i> fought the student council decision citing their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection of the laws.</i> The Virginia Advocate</i> is the only conservative student publication at the University of Virginia.
The students' appeal was heard on May 3, 1995 by the University's Student Activites Committee, whose chairman is dean of students Robert Canevari.<i> The Virginia Advocate</i>'s editor, Ellen J. Riegel, argued the magazine's appeal. Landmark's attorney, Pete Hutchison, provided a legal memorandum to the committee outlining the constitutional infirmity of the decision.
Landmark told the committee that the student council's decision "violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws to the students who publish<i> The Virginia Advocate </i>through viewpoint discrimination." The Foundation also pointed out student council funding of such groups as Straight and Gay for Equality, which promotes candidates and legislation advancing a liberal agenda, and a wide range of other organizations promoting a liberal agenda.

<b><p>NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION, INC.

<p>Foundation Sues Clinton to Enjoin Strike Order</b><br>
National Right to Work attorneys filed a lawsuit to halt enforcement of a Clinton executive order prohibiting federal contractors from hiring permanent replacement workers during a strke. The order enacted the policies of the so-called "Anti-Striker Replacement" legislation which Congress has twice rejected.
"The President trampled on the rights of workers by unilaterally enacting policies to punish workers who choose to work during a strike. He's sweeping the Constitution under the rug so he can please his Big Labor friends," said National Right to Work Foundation Vice President Timothy McConville.
Attorneys from the Foundation filed the suit in US District Court in Washington, DC, on behalf of Representatives John Doolittle (CA), David Funderburk (NC), Ernest Istook (OK), and Harris Fawell (IL). The complaint charges that by issuing the executive order, President Clinton has usurped the constitutional authority soley vested in the Congress to make laws and regulate commerce.
"Most observers agree the result will be more strikes, McConville said. "Union officials would call any strike they want and win every strike they call as easily as pushing a button. With more strike powers, the union officials will have more power to force workers to pay union dues, busting holes in state Right to Work laws."

<b><p>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION

<p>NELF Coalition Wins Complete Victory in RI Tidal Land Litigation</b><br>
Four years ago the Rhode Island Supreme Court released an opinion which implied that land ever below the median high tide mark ("tidal land") might be subject to a "public trust." That decision raised the threat that the state might be allowed to charge fees or impose public access requirements for use of such land. Because the commercial heart of Providence is tidal land, the implications of the court's decision on the state's economy were troubling. Title insurance and mortgage for this land became difficult to purchase.
NELF responded to this challenge over the next four years by organizing a coalition of the state's major landowners. The coalition decided that the best way to resolve the uncertainty brought about by the court decision was to initiate a second, test case which would give the court a chance to clarify and, hopefully, minimize the scope of the public trust. NELF helped prepare the test plaintiff's brief and filed its own amicus brief on behalf of a number of major Providence landowners.
The first major development in the case came last year when the state conceded that the most important part of the Providence tidal land, the "cove," was free from trust. Last month the Rhode Island Supreme Court decided the remaining issue, the status of the remaining "harbor line" tidal lands. This final decision is a complete victory landowners. The court held that all land which a landowner has filled out to a legislatively established harbor line becomes completely free from any trust. Downtown Providence's landowners have now been confirmed in the full ownership rights they thought they had possessed all along.
<p><b>Connecticut Court Joins Chorus Striking Down Ban on Phone Companies' Entry into Cable TV</b><br>
In a case in which NELF filved an amicus brief on behalf of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA) and the New England Council, the US District Court in Hartford, Connecticut has joined the growing number of federal courts which have struck down the ban on local telephone companies' entering the cable television industry. NELF, CBIA, and the Council argued that the ban violated the first amendment rights of not only the local telephone company, Southern New Telecommunications, but it also unconstitutionally limited the television choices that should be coming available to consumers. As the entertainment and communication industries grown ever closer, NELF intends to work to ensure that local telephone companies can become major sources of innovation and competition in the telecommunications industry.
<p><b>NELF to Enter Massachusetts Employment Sex Harassment Case</b><br>
NELF will file an amicus brief in the Massachusetts Appeals Court supporting the dismissal of an employee's sex harassment case. The case was dismissed because of the plaintiff's failure to have used the comprehensive procedures of the Massachusetts employment discrimination act, Mass. G.L. c. 151B. A Superior Court judge held that this failure precludes her suing her employer on any "corollary claim" arising out of the same facts. In this case that meant that the employee's claims of statutory sexual harassment, violation of equal rights, negligence, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress were all barred. the court's reasoning followed closely two Massachusetts Supreme Judiciial Court cases in which NELF was involved last year.

<p><b>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION

<p>Supreme Court Lets WLF Civil Rights Victory Stand</b><br>
On May 22, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would not review the pathbreaking Fourth Circuit decision in favor of WLF's client, a Hispanic student, in his suit against the University of Maryland's black-only scholarship program.  The Court had been urged by the Clinton Administration and more than 60 interest groups and universities to reverse WLF's victory, which calls into question the legality of race-based scholarship programs at public universities across the country.  The suit was part of WLF's effort to oppose government programs that classify citizens by race.

<p><b>WLF Appeals in Challenge to Texas IOLTA Program</b><br>
WLF has asked the Fifth Circuit to strike down Texas's Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts (IOLTA) program, which requires attorneys to turn over interest generated by their clients' trust accounts to fund legal services organizations.  In 1992, more than $150 million was raised by IOLTA programs nationwide, nearly $10 million in Texas alone.  WLF argued that the program violates the First Amendment by forcing Texans to associate with political causes with which they disagree and that it violates the Fifth Amendment by taking their property without just compensation.  WLF's suit, now on appeal, was rejected by a federal district judge in January.

<p><b>WLF Supports Virginia Against EPA</b><br>
WLF has filed a brief in the Fourth Circuit supporting Virginia's lawsuit against the EPA over the agency's requirement that Virginia change its rules for standing in its state courts.  The EPA has ordered Virginia to allow third parties the right to obtain judicial review of emissions permit approvals, whether or not the parties would have standing to sue under state law.  The EPA's position, if upheld, would enable groups such as the Sierra Club to impede the expansion or modernization of plants even where the state has given its approval.  WLF argued that Congress never intended the Clean Air Act to require this radical expansion of the availability of third-party standing in state courts.

<b><p>WLF Brief Opposes Racial Gerrymandering</b><br>
WLF, representing Congressman Gary Franks, urged the Supreme Court in Miller v. Johnson to strike down Georgia's redistricting plan on the grounds that it improperly drew lines so as to segregate black and white voters into separate congressional districts.  Under pressure from the Justice Department, the Georgia legislature created a district in 1992 with a strange layout, having uninhabited "land bridges" as little as a mile wide to connect black sections of urban areas.  WLF argued that such racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional and also pointed out that black candidates such as Rep. Franks have won elections in majority-white districts.

<b><p>WLF Urges Court to Recognize Constitutional Limits On Punitive Damages</b><br>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the Court should strike down an Alabama court's $2 million punitive damages award against BMW.  The suit was brought by a physician who learned that BMW had refinished the car to repair slight paint defects incurred during shipment to the United States. WLF argued that the award, which was 500 times the amount of the economic damage suffered by the car buyer, was clearly excessive and violated due process.<br>

<b>The Return of George Sutherland: Restoring a Jurisprudence of Natural Rights<br>
Hadley Arkes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994)
</b>
<P>
   Conventional histories of the Supreme Court
describe George Sutherland, who was seated at the Court from 1922
to 1938, as a mainstay of the "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"
 a sinister reactionary whose blunt, ideological dissents were
blindly devoted to business interests but failed to engage or
accept the emerging reality of the New Deal constitutional revolution.
Hadley Arkes's remarkable intellectual history, "The Return
of George Sutherland: Restoring a Jurisprudence of Natural Rights,"
reveals a far more subtle and textured portrait of Sutherland:
a sophisticated political thinker who was able to intellectually
outflank his philosophical adversaries and was willing to follow
the logic of his principles even when they drove him outside of
the respectable opinion of his day. Arkes's book is a compelling
portrait of a life animated by ideas, ideas that inspired Sutherland,
at the age of twenty, to copy paragraphs of natural rights theory
into his commonplace book (one of its pages is reproduced as Arkes's
frontispiece) and, at a more advanced age, to import its abstractions
into the often dry details of the law.     But the law, and the
controversies that it raises, are anything but dry when Arkes
describes them. He discusses a hidden Sutherland, one who led
the fight in the Senate for women's suffrage by making Lincolnesque
arguments about natural rights. On the Court, Sutherland reading
the categorical language of the First Amendment argued that the
Constitution categorically barred Congress from placing any limits
on the freedom of the press. In short, for a reactionary, he was
surprisingly progressive even, in some respects, radical.    
<P>
 Arkes sketches a compelling profile of Sutherland and the philosophical
tradition that he represents, demonstrating how the opinions of
the preRoosevelt Court that are generally held to embody a reactionary,
probusiness agenda turn out to benefit employees and the general
public as much or more than they benefit employers. The Old Court
struck down Arizona's law requiring that 80% of a business's workers
be nativeborn; without Court action, Mike Raich  an Austrian immigrant
 would have been out of a job. Sutherland's opinion, in a case
in which a minimum wage for women (but not for men) was struck
down, permitted women to hold onto their jobs, rather than being
displaced by men legally empowered to work for less money. But
the key to understanding Sutherland's jurisprudence is precisely
that he avoided making judgments of constitutionality on utilitarian
grounds, insisting that a coherent theory of natural rights would
lead to a compelling constitutional vision. Sutherland steadfastly
refused to take judicial notice of the happy coincidence that
his constitutional theories would also benefit the public.   
<P> Arkes, through his examination of Sutherland, makes plain what
the reserved language of Sutherland's judicial opinions are sometimes
only able to hint at: that the intellectual foundations of the
modern welfare state rest only on thin air. The knowledge of the
details of complex commercial enterprises that its regulations
presume are rarely to be found in those who would draft them.
The justice of the benefits and burdens that price regulation
attaches arbitrarily to various activities is difficult to justify
or discern. Arkes's description of Brandeisian jurisprudence,
an almost perfect foil to Sutherland's work, is penetrating, even
withering, especially when Arkes sketches how painfully oblivious
Brandeis is to contrary arguments.
  <P>
   Arkes also demonstrates
how Sutherland's fidelity to the bounded nature of the concepts
and texts judges must work with determines his decisions in the
cases before him. Sutherland's strict attention to the history
and meaning of such terms of constitutional art as "commerce,"
"delegation," and "general welfare" and, more
generally, to the necessary implications of the structure of the
Constitution guards against an interpretive slippage that leads
to unlimited government discretion. His method is a refreshing
change from much constitutional law today, which uses crucially
unmoored concepts like "dignity" to get the Court where
its judges want it to go. A problem with this approach  one which
Sutherland's more formal approach solves  is that, without careful
attention to the meaning and limits of words in the law, they
function much like Rorschach inkblots, revealing more about the
way their witnesses think and what they want to do than anything
else.
<P>
      Arkes's book makes a persuasive case that we need more
of Justice Sutherland's radicalism in the world today  a radicalism
that Arkes sets against both the common law's remnants of sympathy
for regulation as well as its continuation in the modern New Deal
state. It is a radicalism that should find many sympathizers.
Those who are deemed unfit to provide for themselves and for their
families because of the terrifying dangers of unregulated taxicabs,
haircuts, and shoeshine stands  as well as other victims of the
regulatory state would likely be sympathetic to Sutherland's views
that people have natural rights to occupational freedom.  
<P>
   It
is difficult in a brief review to give more than a glimpse of
this powerful book, but its fascinating mixture of political theory
and constitutional law provides an intellectual drama that is
rarely seen in books about the Court. Those who seek a model to
get today's Court back on track and in philosophical trim will
benefit from Arkes's readable study.

 Introduction</b></center>
<p>
In 1996 the Congress may vote on a "campaign finance reform" bill designed to eliminate political action committees (PACs) from the American political system. On this issue, liberals have found peculiar allies. Some Americans who generally favor maximizing economic and political freedoms say political action committees (PACs) are irredeemably evil and should be abolished.
<p>
President George Bush repeatedly said he wanted to abolish PACs. As described below, he subsequently narrowed his focus to the abolition of a certain type of PAC, the "<i>connected</i>" PAC. But the hue and cry against PACs-has risen anew. Senator John McCain, Congresswoman Linda Smith and presidential candidate Pat Buchanan have joined the liberal media establishment's drumbeat against all PACs.
<p>
Very few Americans have a good understanding of what PACs are or what they really do.
<p>
Public disclosure of PAC financial activity has not helped public understanding very much.
<p>
Yes, financial data on the activities of all PACs at the federal level is available at the Federal Election Commission (FEC). And some helpful FEC staff do their best to assist researchers. But the mass of data is too great for easy comprehension.
<p>
PAC financial data the public sees most often are bits and pieces selected by reporters and activists looking for scandal or attempting to discredit opponents.
<p>
No wonder PACs rate down there with used car salesmen in mistrust by the public.
<p>
<b><center>
The Attack on PACs
</b></center><p>
It was not always so. Before the early 1970s, labor unions had a virtual monopoly of PACs. And very effective PACs they were. But there was little agitation against PACs in those days.
<p>
Upon the rise in the 1970s of corporate and association PACs and, to a lesser extent, of conservative PACs, liberals in the news media and elsewhere in the public policy process began to complain bitterly about PACs. Only when the Left's near monopoly of PACs was broken did liberals begin to see PACs as a public nuisance.
<p>
Today most liberal activists would be delighted to abolish all PACs.
<p>
This <i>would</i> mean the end of labor union PACs, all of them liberal. But eliminating all PACs would work to the net benefit of organized labor.
<p>
PAC abolition would destroy the organized campaign participation of business interests and conservative groups while leaving untouched the vast majority of political expenditures by labor unions. Most union political spending is not through PACs but in categories not significant for business interests. The unions bosses' greatest political clout comes, not from their PACs, but from two types of political effort not reported to the Federal Election Commission:

<ul><li> huge "in-kind" expenditures of (largely compulsory) union dues money in election-related activities such as selective voter registration, campaign mailings and get out the vote activities

<li> massive deployment of paid union staff in the campaigns of their chosen candidates.
</ul>
Neither of these forms of support would be adversely affected by the complete abolition of PACs, which would leave organized labor, including the teachers unions, the only major players in politics outside of the political party organizations and the news media.
<p>
<b><center>
What PACs Really Do
</b></center><p>
For many years there was a general belief that labor unions supported liberal and Democratic candidates and that business and association PACs supported conservative and Republican candidates.
<p>
Conventional wisdom was right about labor union political contributions but not about business and association political giving.
<p>
According to the Federal Election Commission records, the 254 active labor union PACs gave $41,867,393 to Federal candidates in the last election cycle, 1993-94. Of this sum, 95.4% went to Democrats and 4.2% to Republicans.
<p>
This Leadership Institute study found that in 1993-94 the 864 largest corporate business PACs and trade association and professional PACs gave a total of $ 118,709,400 in contributions to Federal candidates, 51.6% of it to Democrats.
<p>
These largest 864 business PACs accounted for close to 90% of the donations of all business-related PACs.
<p>
The FEC assigns a separate category to labor union PACs, but it doesn't compile exact, aggregate numbers for PACs tied to businesses or to professional or trade associations. Business related PACs are mixed by the FEC in categories which also include many ideological, ethnic and cause-oriented PACs. It's no easy job to sort them out, as has been done in this study by looking individually at all non-labor union PACs which gave contributions totaling $25,000 or more in the 1993-94 period.
<p>
I have followed trends in the political action community for a long time. In 1972 I founded one of the earliest independent conservative PACs, which is still in operation. In the 1970s I published studies of the donations of business and association PACs in the election cycles of 1975-76 and 1977-78. In late 1980 and early 1981, I served on the Transition Team for the Federal Election Commission
 for President-elect Ronald Reagan. In 1989 I published a study of giving patterns of the 775 then-largest business and association PACs in the 1987-88 election cycle.
<p>
The corporate, professional and trade association PACs vary individually in their behavior much more than do the labor union PACs. Many business- related PACs are consistent donors to liberal and Democratic candidates.
<p>
From the mass of data filed at the FEC, this study extracts key facts about all the major business PACs in the 1993-94 election cycle and puts information before the public about each PAC studied in context with the activities of the other major such PACs.
<p><b>
<center>
PAC Behavior Changes
</center></b><p>
Here's a quick summary of business PAC developments in the past twenty years or so.
<p>
The Federal Election Commission was formed in 1974 to supplant the previous system of campaign finance disclosure, which had required reporting of campaign finance activity to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of the Senate and the General Accounting Office.
<p>
Business PACs began in earnest after the famous 1975 SUNPAC advisory opinion in which the then-new Federal Election Commission determined that businesses could organize PACs just as labor unions had done for many years.
<p>
In the middle 1970s the new business PACs shocked conservatives and Republicans by giving a lot of money to liberals and Democrats. Public exposure of these giving patterns caused many of the business-related PACs to change their ways.
<p>
By 1978 and 1980, most business PACs were squarely in the conservative Republican camp.
<p>
And no doubt the increasingly conservative congressional election results in those years were caused in part by the business PAC donations.
<p>
But in 1981 -82, then-Congressman Tony Coelho, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, embarked on an extremely aggressive approach to raise money for Democrats from the business community.
<p>
Pointing out that Democrats controlled the House of Representatives, he warned the business PAC community in private meetings that strongly anti-business legislation would be passed if the business PACs didn't give more money to Democrats. He went beyond general threats and pointed out to business leaders specific kinds of hostile legislation which might be passed to hurt them.
<p>
Most political observers at the national level agree that Representative Coelho's pressure tactics worked.
<p>
By the 1988 elections, many business-related PACs were giving much more to Democrats than in the past. Republicans lost their former edge in business PAC donations. In recent election cycles, business PAC growth slowed, and Democrats got half or more of business PAC contributions.
<p>
Nevertheless, the drumbeat against PACs in the news media is now almost deafening, perhaps because of reports that business PAC contributions to Republicans have increased since the GOP won majorities in the U.S. House and Senate in 1994.
<p>
Liberal activist groups attacking PACs receive enthusiastic coverage by reporters and commentators. Over the years, some business organizations reacted to the general criticism of PACs by reducing their political activity.
<p>
Many conservative movement PACs have found it harder to raise funds in recent election cycles. Some have disappeared.
<p>
With these trends in mind, the time has come for another serious, systematic look at the reality of political action committees associated with the business community: business corporation PACs and PACs associated with professional organizations, trade associations or other business interests.
<p>
<b><center>
Just What is a PAC?
</center></b><p>
At the Federal level, a political action committee is an organization which receives voluntary contributions and makes expenditures intended to influence the outcome of elections to either branch of the United States Congress or the presidency and vice-presidency. 
<p>
Corporations and labor unions may not contribute to PACs. But business corporations, professional groups, trade associations, labor unions and other existing organizations may, under current law, organize and pay all operating expenses of their own PACs. Such organizations are called "connected" PACs. Here are the major differences between connected and non-connected PACs:
<ul>
<li> Non-connected PACs must pay all the costs of their operations from voluntary contributions from U.S. citizens. They may solicit contributions from any American.

<li>Connected PACs may have their operating expenses (staff salaries, lawyers' fees, fundraising costs, etc.) paid by their parent organizations. They may solicit contributions only from people affiliated as members or employees of their sponsoring organizations. They may not legally give or spend corporate or union resources for a candidate for Federal office.
</ul>
By law, all contributions by a PAC to candidates for Federal office must be drawn entirely from voluntary donations to the PAC from individual United States citizens.
<p>
Two attributes are common to all PACs, whether corporate, professional association, labor union, independent, ideological, connected, non-connected or whatever:
<ul>
<li> All donors to each PAC are American citizens voluntarily participating together in the democratic process.

<li>There is full public disclosure of names, employers, addresses and amounts given of all donors of who cumulatively give more than $200 to any PAC, as well as how each PAC spends and donates its money.
</ul>
In Federal elections, the law limits individual and PAC contributions:
<ul>
<li> Individuals may give a candidate up to $1,000 per election. A primary counts as a separate election.

<li> Individuals may give up to $5,000 per year to a single PAC and up to a grand total of $25,000 per year to all Federal candidates and PACs.

<li> PACs may give a candidate up to $5,000 per election.
</ul>
Desirable or not, these are significant limits on citizens' rights to voluntary political participation. These financial limits are not indexed for inflation. And they are probably very close to the outer limit of restrictions the Supreme Court would allow.
<p>
In the 1976 <i>Buckley v. Valeo</i> decision, the Court struck down some serious, further restrictions pushed through Congress in the first wave of legislative attacks on citizen participation through PACs.
<p>
<center>
<b>Why PACs are Formed</b>
</center><p>
Public opinion pollsters work hard to discover the different preferences of voters. Voters' motives may be guessed at, but the secret ballot is a legal right. Even the best-paid pollsters are sometimes embarrassingly wrong.
<p>
Similarly, the motivations of citizens who organize and give to PACs are varied and hard to analyze.
<p>
Many who would abolish PACs make a seldom-spoken presumption that all who participate in PACs are ill-motivated. But given the occasion to reflect, even anti-PAC zealots would probably concede that most people participate in PACs for about the same range of reasons which motivate them to vote.
<p>
Prominent among the many reasons why people vote and give to PACs are:
<ul>
<li>political philosophy
<li>self-identification with one kind of candidate

<li> dislike of another kind of candidate

 <li> perceived self-interest

<li> the recommendation of a trusted friend
</ul>
Do motives which are acceptable if held individually by voters become unacceptable if held by groups of voters voluntarily participating together in politics? That would be a tricky case to argue from a constitutional perspective.
<p>
But those who would abolish or cripple PACs simply avoid discussing in this context the subjects of freedom of speech and freedom of association.
<p>
Should Americans have the freedom to try to persuade others in the political process? That is the key question. But anti-PAC activists use the full arsenal of demagogy. Their arguments rely mainly on pejoratives, name calling. And many of these activists are long-time liberals who kept silent about PACs until conservative and business-oriented PACs arose.
<p>
To what extent is anti-PAC activism motivated by a desire to run conservatives and the business community out of politics?
<p>
One might deny people in the business and professional community the right to organize themselves voluntarily in politics because one does not like what they do in election campaigns.
<p>
But that could be compared to the former practice of denying blacks the franchise because many did not like the way they would vote.
<p>
<b><center>
The Current Threat to Citizen Participation
</b></center><p>
Any plan to abolish PACs necessarily involves prohibiting Americans from voluntarily associating with others to support candidates and causes of their choice.
<p>
Recently, much of the world threw off 1 system which denied citizens the right to participate voluntarily in political activity. It is ironic that "the land of the free" is seriously contemplating further restrictions on citizens' political rights.
<p>
I was present during discussions President Bush had, soon after his election, with conservative leaders on the topic of "campaign finance reform." President Bush quite clearly described what "reform" legislation he would sign.
<p>
He described a package of legislative changes which he promised the conservative leaders would be passed as a package or not at all.
<p>
Most gratifying to those present was his pledge to veto any bill to abolish the "ideological" PACs, a matter certainly important to those in that meeting. The White House announcement of the President's proposal June 29, 1989, stated, "It appears that freedom of association guarantees under the First Amendment make it impossible to eliminate these independent PACs."
<p>
Thus President Bush would have preserved citizens' rights to join together to support causes and candidates important to them.
<p>
So, for example, citizens opposing legalized abortion, as well as citizens advocating it, would retain their freedom to form and fund political action committees.
<p>
Having given this firm pledge to important members of the political coalition who elected him, President Bush guaranteed, for his time in office, the survival of ideological PACs.
<p>
His "reform" package did include, however, the abolition of most of the corporate, association and labor union PACs, at least in the form they now exist.
<p>
To do this, President Bush proposed simply to outlaw the <i>connected</i> PACs, which the White House estimated as having given "nearly 90% of the approximately $160 million contributed in the 1987-88 election cycle."
<p>
In the words of the June 29, 1989 White House statement, the effect of enacting this one of the President's proposed reforms would have been:
<br><blockquote>
Eliminating political action committees (PACs) supported by
corporations, unions or trade associations, and prohibiting such entities
from paying for the overhead or administrative cost of any independent
PAC.
</blockquote>
<p>
"Connected" corporate and union PACs and most trade and professional association PACs have their operating expenses paid by their parent organizations. Abolishing connected PACs would force most of these PACs to shut down. Many of these PACs simply couldn't afford to pay their own operating costs.
<p>
After such a change in the law, the surviving PACs of labor union interests and business-related interests would have to pay all PAC operating costs out of voluntary citizen donations, as nearly all ideological, conservative movement and liberal activist PACs do now.
<p>
Some conservatives find charm in the idea of the government shutting down the business-related PACs. After all, many of these PACs support mostly liberals and all but a handful support some liberals. But conservatives of this mind may be making the perfect the enemy of the good, increasing the political power of the generally liberal news media and paving the way for greater bureaucratic control of the political process.
<p>
As limited government advocate Barry Goldwater pointed out many years ago, "A government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take everything you've got."
<p>
Linked to the principle of limited government is the prudential question of whether or not to allow the political participation of the economically productive sectors of our society. Two hundred years ago, British statesman and political philosopher Edmund Burke warned against destroying participation of any major element in the public policy process. Burke wrote:
<p><blockquote>
The opposed and conflicting interests, which you considered as so great a blemish in our old and in our present Constitution, interpose a salutary check to all precipitate resolutions. They render deliberation, not a matter of choice, but of necessity; they make all change a matter of <i>compromise</i>, which naturally begets moderation; they produce <i>temperaments</i>, preventing the sore evil of harsh, crude, unqualified reformations, and rendering all the headlong exertions of arbitrary power, in the few or in the many, forever impracticable.
</blockquote>
<p><b><center>
PACs Will Survive, at Least for Now
</b></center><p>
The vast majority of organized labor's great political power is due to currently unreported, in-kind contributions and expenditures, including selective voter registration drives, targeted voter turnout programs and the salaries of uncounted thousands of union staffers poured each year into election campaigns.
<p>
Union payrolls total approximately $10 million per day.
<p>
Democrats in Congress would never vote to curtail the political uses of compulsory union dues. A reform of this nature would surely be vetoed by President Bill Clinton. The current Republican majorities in Congress would never vote to eliminate PACs without curbing the other ways in which unions alone impact on election campaigns. So an outright abolition of PACs is unlikely to become law any time soon. And a law simply abolishing all PACs would almost certainly be declared by the Supreme Court to be an unconstitutional restriction of political freedom.
<p>
From the government, therefore, nothing more than tinkering with current campaign finance law is likely now.
<p><b><center>
Knowledge about PACs is Useful
</center></b><p>
Although business and association PACs seem certain to survive any current attempt to destroy them, abundant experience proves they are far more easily influenced than are any other types of PACs.
<p>
Labor union bosses have such tight control over their organizations that few of their decisions, about their PACs or anything else, are ever effectively challenged from within. Ideological PACs, right or left, usually have very predictable, clear and unshakable ideas of what is in their interest.
<p>
But business corporations and professional and trade associations are, shall we say, more flexible in their PAC decisions. They are responsive to any of the following possible influences on them: 
<blockquote><p>
stockholders, employees, customers, boards of directors, clients, members, partners, colleagues, politicians, news media and the general public.
</blockquote>
Often those who make decisions in business and association PACs are the Washington lobbyists have who have risen in life by trying to make almost everybody happy.
<p>
They tend to be non-confrontational. They love to be loved and fear to be hated.
<p>
As this study amply demonstrates, their PACs tend to contribute to incumbents rather than to challengers or candidates for open seats. Most are more interested in influencing incumbents, or at least in having access to incumbents, than they are in influencing the outcome of elections.
<p>
Prudent or not, the business and association PACs have every right to act as they do, as all the money they dispense is voluntarily given to them.
<p>
But their very nature makes them responsive to many sources of influence on their behavior.
<p>
One purpose of the FEC's legally-required public disclosure of PAC financial data is undoubtedly to give citizens knowledge they can use to influence a PACs future decisions.
<p>
Without advocating any course of action, this study makes public the giving patterns of the largest business and association PACs, 864 PACs which each contributed a total of $25,000 or more in the last election cycle, 1993-94.
<p>
Armed with this information, stockholders, employees, customers, boards of directors, clients, members, partners, colleagues, politicians, news media and the general public will be better able to decide for themselves what actions, if any, they should take regarding business and association PACs in which they are interested.
<p>
In 1979, after publication of my PAC study of the 1977-78 election cycle, I was visited by two, three-piece suited officials of the National Forest Products Association. They came to my office to explain why a forest industry PAC just <i>had</i> to give to the re-election campaign of a famous, very liberal congressman from Illinois.
<p>
Those forestry industry officials were sweating because conservative members of their association had chewed them out. In subsequent election cycles they, and others, changed their behavior significantly.
<p>
In another case that same year, a major stockholder of a big supermarket chain got so hot she nearly peeled the paint off the wall at the corporate headquarters because she didn't like what she learned about their PACs giving pattern. They too changed their behavior.
<p>
<b><center>
PACs in Context
</center></b><p>
The records of political fundraising and expenditures at the Federal Election Commission are open to the public. Staffers there do their best to help inquirers. But even their computerized data base of financial data is not 100% reliable.
<p>
An avalanche of regular financial reports pour into the FEC from candidates, PACs and party committees.
<p>
These detailed reports sometimes contain accidental errors from the thousands of organizations required to file reports. Computer data entry of these reports by the FEC is another source of error. For example, a $ 10.00 donation may, by a data entry error, appear on the FEC computer record as a $ 1000 donation.
<p>
I mention the inevitable, if rare, errors to caution readers of this report. The extraordinary bright, dedicated and careful researchers, Francis Schaeffer and Terry McIntyre, who prepared and rechecked the tabulations in the body of this study were entirely dependent on information from the FEC, which is known to be imperfect.
<p>
Nonetheless, the FEC data, usually reliable, is the best available.
<p>
Here are some aggregate totals for political activity at the Federal level in the 1993-94 election cycle, according to the FEC reports:
<ul>
<li>There were 2,414 candidates for U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives .

<li>They received from all sources a total of $740,474,131, up from $477,608,990 for all congressional candidates in the 1987-88 election cycle. Republican candidates received from all sources $385,332,893, up from $267,959,244 in 1987-88. Democratic candidates received 350,291,422, up from $267,959,244 in 198788. Independents and others received $4,849,816, up from $1,318,782 in 1987-88.

<li>A total of 437 Republican and Democratic party committees reported financial activity to the FEC.

<li>These party committees received an aggregate of $440,837,137. Republican Party committees received $266,472,079, or 60.4% of the total.

<li>There were a total of 2,978 Federal PACs of all kinds active in the 199394 cycle, down from 3,308 in 1987-88. They received a total of $391,760,117, little changed from $384,617,093 in 1987-88.

<li> They contributed, to all candidates for the U.S. House and Senate, a total of $189,631,119, compared to $147,846,057 in 1987-88.

<li>To Republican candidates, PACs gave $71,633,571, or 38%, compared to $56,267,883 and 38% in 1978-88. To Democratic candidates, PACs gave $117,683,963, 62%.

<li>Individuals personally gave U.S. House and Senate candidates a total of $402,534,070, up from $232,605,508 in 1987-88.

<li> Republicans received $219,470,179, or 54% from individuals, up from $115,853,176 and 50% in 1978-88. Democrats received $180,678,908, or
45%, up from $115,870,844 in 1987-88.

<li> There were 254 labor union PACs active in 1993-94, down from 256 in 1987-88. Not counting the unreported, election related expenditures of
union dues money, the labor union PACs contributed, to congressional
candidates for both houses of Congress, a total of $42,867,393, up from
$32,460,094 in 1987-88.

<li> To Republican candidates, union PACs gave $1,763,842, or 4%,
compared to $2,477,718, or 8%, in 1987-88. To Democrats, labor union
PACs gave $39,947,651, or 95%, compared to $29,982,676, or 92%, in
1987-88.
</ul>
As mentioned above, PACs related to business corporations and professional and trade associations are mixed together with ideological, ethnic and other PACs in the FEC's system of categories. So any analysis of the business-related PACs must involve picking, one by one, those PACs really linked to business, trade and professional interests.
<p>
To keep this study manageable, we focus here on the 864 largest (contributions totaling $25,000 or more) of the "economic interest" PACs, which include the business corporation PACs and the professional and trade organization PACs. Also included were the large ($25,000 or more) PACs which we judged to have primarily economic or professional reasons for being.
<p>
In some cases, inclusion was a close decision. PACs of law firms were included. PACs organized by gun owners to support the right to keep and bear arms were not included as they are primarily non-economic in their purpose.
<p>
But the PACs of both the Boat Owners Association and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, in a close decision, were included because their interests were deemed largely based on their economic interest. 
<p>
All 864 PACs were those we found to be business-related and which gave or expended $25,000 or more in the 1993-94 election cycle.
<blockquote>
In sum, these 864 largest business and association PACs gave $ 118,709,400 to Federal candidates, up from $97,084,426 from business PACs which gave $25,000 or more in 1987-88. They gave $61,204,865 or 52%, to Democrats, up from $47,846,163, or 49.3%, in 1987-88 and $57,529,107, or 48%, to Republicans, compared to $49,243,263, or 50.7%, in 1987-88.
</blockquote>
The business and association PACs studied here accounted for the great majority, close to 90%, of business and association PAC giving in the 1993-94 election cycle.
<p>
The 864 PACs studied ranged in size from the United Parcel Service PAC, based in Atlanta, Georgia, total given $2,646,113, to the Advertising Mail Marketing Association PAC, based in Washington, D.C., total given, exactly $25,000.
<p>
The average given by the 864 PACs was $137,395, up from $125,270 for the average business PAC giving $25,000 or more in 1987-88. The median in size among the 864 studied PACs in 1993-94 was the Union Camp Corporation PAC, of Wayne, New Jersey, which gave $66,175.

Content of this Study
</center></b><p>
The main body of this study lists, in alphabetical order, the 864 business-association PACs which gave or spent $25,000 or more in 1993-94.
<p><i>
Name, Address, Size and Rank by Size
</i><p>
Included is each PACs mailing address as filed with the Federal Election Commission.
<p>
The amount each PAC gave in 1993-94 and its rank in size, by dollar amount, among the 864 PACs are also given.
<p>
Take, for example, Abbott Laboratories Better Government Fund. This PAC is listed on page 1.
<p>
Abbott's PAC gave candidates $145,169 in 1993-94. This PAC ranked 211th in size among the business PACs.
<p>
<i>Giving to Republicans and Democrats
</i><p>
The next two columns list the respective percentages of each PACs donations to Republican candidates and its rank among the 864 PACs in the percentage of its contributions which went to Republicans.
<p>
Note that Abbott gave 54.3% to Republicans and ranked 329 in the percentage of its total contributions which went to Republicans. (The asterisk (*) indicates Abbott tied with one or more other PACs in this ranking for partisan giving.
<p>
Next is listed the percentage of donations going to Democratic candidates and its rank among the 864 PACs in the percentage of its money going to Democratic candidates.
<p>
Abbott gave 45.5% of its total contributions to Democrats and ranked 535th highest in percentage of its giving to Democrats.
<p><i>
Giving to Incumbents and to Non-Incumbents
</i><p>
In the next column is listed the percentage of each PACs money which went to incumbents. The balance went to challenger candidates or candidates for open seats.
<p>
Abbott gave 77.5% of its funds to incumbents.
<p>
Next is the rank of each PAC as measured by the percentage of its money which went to incumbents. Abbott ranked 512th highest in giving money to incumbents.
<p>
Number one in rank in the category of giving to incumbents was an eleven way tie. Eleven of the 864 PACs gave 100% to incumbents.
<p>
The lowest in percentage given to incumbents (and therefore the highest percentage given to challengers and candidates for open seats) was Precision Metalforming Association PAC, which gave only 3.1 % of its donations to incumbents.
<p>
By and large, the business and association PACs gave <i>overwhelmingly</i> to incumbents.
<p><i>
Giving to Conservatives and Liberals
</i><p>
The final four columns in the main part of this study relate to each PACs giving in the principal liberal versus conservative contests of 1993-94.
<p>
To measure each of the 864 biggest business and association PACs giving to conservative candidates and to liberal candidates, it was necessary first to devise a method of determining which candidates could be properly be described as conservatives and which could be described as liberals.
<p>
The best available way to determine which candidates were conservative was to identify the candidates who received contributions from a variety of known, philosophically conservative PACs.
<p>
The following method was used:
<ol>
<li> A dozen different politically knowledgeable conservatives were each asked to list all those PACs which they believed to be the most representative of the conservative cause, broadly considered.
<p>
We asked them to name PACs they believed most notable for their commitment to any or all of the following generally-understood conservative principles:
<ul>
<li>Limited government
<li>Free enterprise
<li>Strong national defense
<li>Traditional Family Values
</ul>
The resulting list of 21 conservative PACs included representation from the major elements of the conservative winning coalition in the presidential races of 1980, 1984 and 1988 and the congressional races of 1994. The PACs included were:
<p><ul>
<li>ACU-PAC
<li>America's PAC
<li>Business and Industry PAC
<p>
<li>Citizens for the Republic
<li>Conservative Campaign Fund
<li>Conservative Leadership PAC
<p>
<li>Conservative Victory Committee
<li>Conservative Victory Fund
<li>Eagle Forum PAC
<p>
<li>Free Congress PAC
<li>Funds for A Conservative Majority
<li>Gun Owners of America Political Victory Fund
<p>
<li>Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association
<li>Justice PAC
<li>Mid-America Conservative PAC
<p>
<li>National Federation of Independent Business PAC
<li>National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund
<li>National Right to Life PAC
<p>
<li>Public Service PAC
<li>Right to Work PAC
<li>Ruff PAC
</uL>
<li> From FEC records, the list of all candidates supported by each conservative PAC was obtained.

<li> Any candidate supported by any three of these 21 conservative PACs was <i>defined</i> as a conservative candidate for the purpose of this study. There were 198 conservative candidates selected by this process.

<li> Any candidate who ran against one of the defined conservative candidates was defined, for the special purpose of this study, as a liberal (non-conservative). (Except in the very few cases where, in a primary, two candidates defined as conservatives were opposing each other.)
<br>
There were 1,110 opponents to conservative candidates identified in this way. It might seem that 1,110 is a large number, but it included all other candidates (primary, general election, minor party and independent) running in races for seats sought by the specified conservative candidates. Very few of the 1,110 who were not major party candidates, received any business PAC contributions.

<li> The next step was the most difficult. Each contribution of each of the 864 PACs was examined to see if it went to a candidate on either the conservative list or the liberal list. The financial support each PAC gave to all the conservative candidates was totaled, as was each PACs support of the liberal candidates.

<li> Then each PACs combined amount given to all candidates in these selected, liberal versus conservative races was totaled.

<li> Each PACs total giving to all candidates in the selected liberal versus conservative races was then calculated as a percentage of its total giving.
<br>
Look again on page 1. Abbott gave 61.3% of all its donations to candidates in the selected, liberal versus conservative races.

<li> Then each PACs percentage of giving respectively to liberals and to conservatives within the selected races was calculated.
<br>
Of its 61.3% Abbott gave in the liberal versus conservative races, 61.0% went to conservatives and 39.0% to liberals.

<li> Finally we calculated each PACs rank among the 864 PACs as measured by its percentage of giving to liberal candidates in the selected races.
<br>
Abbott ranked 528th highest in giving to liberals in the selected races.
</ol>
Four of the business and association PACs gave 100% of their contributions in the selected races to liberals. Seven of these 864 PACs gave conservatives 100% of their contributions in the selected races. Measured by the ranking of what the 864 PACs gave in the liberal versus conservative races, the median business and association PACs gave 45% to liberal candidates.
<p>
In aggregate, the business PACs were no bastions of conservatism.
<p><br>
<b><center>
 Six Top Fifty Lists
</b></center><p>
Starting on page 49, ranked by percentage of donations given in different categories, are six lists of the TOP FIFTY business and association PACs. The categories are:
<ul>
<a name="list">
<li><a href="repub.html">PAC Donors to Republicans</a> 
<p>
<li><a href="demo.html">PAC Donors to Democrats</a> 
<p>
<li><a href="inc.html">PAC Donors to Incumbents</a> 
<p>
<li><a href="nonin.html">PAC Donors to Non-Incumbents</a> 
<p>
<li><a href="cons.html">PAC Donors to Conservatives</a> 
<p>
<li><a href="lib.html">PAC Donors to Liberals</a>
</ul>
<p><b><center>
Using this PAC Study
</b></center><p>
Federal law prohibits use of information obtained about individual contributors from the Federal Election Commission for fundraising or "any commercial purpose." But an FEC publication points out, "This restriction applies only to the use of individual contributor information, not to the use of names and addresses of political committees." 
<p>
Data from the FEC regarding PACs may be used freely by anyone, including news reporters, scholars and the general public. Among the obvious uses are: to publicize, to study, to praise or to condemn.

<title> THE TEN WORST MISTAKES OF LOSING CANDIDATES & WINNING CANDIDATES
</title>

<img src="/lead-inst/li-logo.gif"><br>
<h3> THE TEN WORST MISTAKES OF LOSING CANDIDATES & WINNING CANDIDATES
</h3>

</center>
<p>LOSING CANDIDATES<p>
<ol><small>
<li>
Failure to develop in advance a comprehensive campaign plan, including a timetable and a realistic budget. In politics you can start late, but you can' t start too early. Losing campaigns almost always misorder priorities, putting too much effort on things which can have little effect on the election outcome.</LI>

<li>Managing their own campaigns.</LI>

<li>

Spending too much time at headquarters rather than going out personally to solicit votes or raise money.</LI>
<li>
Hiring consultants who personally absorb too much of their campaign budgets.</LI>
<li>
Spending too much of the campaign funds on paid media and polling and not enough on building an organization of large numbers of people in campaign activities.</LI>

<li>
Adopting (and sometimes changing) positions on issues because of pressure from major contributors or the results of public opinion polls. Polls can be useful to determine which of their personal positions on issues should be stressed in their campaigns.</LI>


<li>Misreading public opinion polls, which usually measure preference but seldom measure intensity. Intensity, not preference, motivates people to act in politics.</LI>

<li>Failure to stress properly the issues which motivate the core elements of their supporters.</LI>

<li>Responding to every minor criticism rather than focusing on the carefully considered issue thrust o~ their own campaigns. Campaigns lose when too much on the defensive.</LI>

<li>Failure to respond properly to continuing negative information, whether from an opponent, the news media or both. Ignoring a continuing negative issue won't make it go away.</LI>
</small></ol>

<P>





<p>
WINNING CANDIDATES
<ol><small><p>
<li>Hiring staff who don't personally share their policy agendas. Personnel is policy. Staff who lack enthusiasm for their bosses' priorities prevent elected officials from doing what they intended to do in office.</LI>

<li>Not keeping campaign promises. These days voters have little tolerance for incumbents who break their word.</LI>

<li>Not paying attention to the interests of the coalition which elected them. Incumbents lose their allies when they don't vote right, sponsor key legislation or sign allies' fundraising letters and aren't there when their friends need them.</LI>

<li>Seeking approval of their enemies, particularly their media enemies. Many incumbents start craving to have everyone love them and no one hate them. But trying to make friends of their enemies makes enemies of their friends .</LI>

<li>Failure to handle constituent relations effectively. All politics is personal. Service can be as important to voters as policy. They appreciate prompt, personal service when they contact those elected to serve them.</LI>

<li>Succumbing to temptations newly present when one achieves some power. Election to office tests anyone' s strength of character, family ties and personal morality.</LI>

 <li>Getting greedy for money or higher office.</LI>

 <li>Becoming arrogant. Many people, constituents who request help and especially the officials' staff, treat incumbents with deference bordering on obsequiousness. A consequent loss of humility can destroy a politician ' s base.</LI>

 <li>Accommodating opposition incumbents who now are "distinguished colleagues."</LI>

<li>Excessive collegiality is a trap for incumbents who really want to accomplish things</LI>.

<li>Not helping to nominate and elect allies in their home states and elsewhere. A well-run team takes care of its own. Serious politicians work hard to elect others who share their public policy agendas.</LI>

<h1>THE LIFE OF THE PARTY</h1><p>

<b>by Morton C. Blackwell<br>
Adapted from a speech at the<br>
1993 Conservative Leadership Conference<br>
Washington, D.C., November 12, 1993
</b></center>

<hr>
You can be the life of the party.<p>

Speaking to you from a non-partisan conservative organization, I will not presume to advise you as to your choice of party. What follows is advice for conservatives of whatever party.<p>

Step by step, here's how you can be a party leader, even if you're starting from scratch:<p>

1. Volunteer to work in the election campaigns of your party's nominees. Under-promise and over-perform.<p>

2. Donate to your party's good candidates. Financial contributions put you on the political map. Attend party fundraising events. Give to your state and local party committees.<p>

3. <i>Then</i> attend party committee meetings. There you will get to know the existing party activists and leaders. And they will get to know you.<p>

If your local party committee has a vacancy, accept it if offered. But modestly keep your eyes and ears open and your mouth shut as you learn the ropes.<p>

Most such meetings are not very exciting. Always take with you something to read or write during the less interesting parts of party meetings.<p>

4. If you are not now familiar with the organizational structure and rules of your party, get copies of the state and local party committee rules. Study them and the applicable rules of procedure, usually <i>Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Reused</i>.<p>

5. Participate in some party auxiliary group activities: youth groups, women's groups, etc. If there is none in your area, volunteer to start one.<p>

 6. In most areas there is a fairly rapid turnover of party officers. Don't push yourself for party office. If you do good work in the local party, others probably will ask you to take on some responsibilities. Accept these tasks. Perform them well. Soon you may be drafted into local party committee office.<p>

But you don't have to hold a party office to play a leading role from time to time in a party committee.<p>

7. In some areas, local party committees are moribund or dead. For a variety of reasons the party officers may be unsatisfactory. They may be lazy. They may be incompetent. They may be fine people burned out from years of good work. They be hanging on to power for its own sake. They may be actively hostile to your conservative principles.<p>

If party leaders <i>are</i> unsatisfactory, you should work to see to it that they are reformed or replaced.<p>

8. Build strong working ties with any other conservatives you meet in party activities.<p>

9. Build strong working ties with leaders of <i>conservative</i> non-party activity in your community, such as:<p>

<ul>
<li>Taxpayer associations
<li>Veterans groups
<li>Ethnic organizations
<li>Right to work groups<p>
<li>Right to keep and bear arms groups
<li>Civic associations
<li>Church groups
<li>Traditional values groups concerned about one or more issues such as abortion, drugs, education, pornography, etc.</ul><p>

10. Make contacts with national conservative groups to locate and involve their local activists in your party.<p>

11. Learn the principles of effective direct mail and start to assemble lists of addresses and phone numbers of local conservative activists and donors.<p>

12. Party committees often have influence in the <i>election</i> of candidates for public office, but in some cases they have decisive power over the rules and therefore the outcomes of the <i>nomination</i> contests.<p>

Find out the role of your state and local party committees in the nomination process and the schedule of their required activities before upcoming elections.<p>

13. Party committees must renew themselves periodically, usually on two-year or four-year cycles.<p>

New party committees may be elected by primaries, conventions or mass meetings. Newly elected committees usually elect their new party officers. local party units usually send delegates to state party conventions.<p>

Sometimes membership on party committees and delegate slots to party conventions are available just by filing properly for openings.<p>

Find out how these processes work in your party. Among the things you'll need to know:<p>
<ul>
<li>When are the next party primaries or conventions? <br>
<li>What party officers are to be filled and for what public offices are party nominees to be chosen?<p>

<li>What are the deadlines for filing, dates of conventions and dates of primaries? And how does one file? 
<li>How are the dates set, by law or party decision?<p>

<li>What are the requirements for party committee membership? For eligibility to be a convention delegate? 
<li>If your party has an executive committee, who serves on it? How are its members chosen?
</ul><p>
14. Because all local part committee elections and party primaries are open at the bottom, <i>he who gets the most people to participate wins</i>. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to organize a sufficient number of conservatives to win primaries, conventions and party committee elections. It is simple but not easy.<p>

15. Sometimes local party committees fail to run candidates for public offices. This is almost always a bad practice. A major party should run candidates for <i>every</i> available office, whether or not there seems to be a good chance to win.<p>

If there appears to be no strong candidate available, <i>run someone who would act responsibly as a candidate and who, if elected, would do a good job</i>. Those are the <i>only</i> requirements.<p>

Run a candidate even if the other party has an "invulnerable" incumbent, even if your candidate is unknown, even if your candidate can't raise enough money to make a serious race. That's how to build a strong party over time.<p>

16. A leader is someone who has a following, someone with influence over others. Review your list of conservative leaders you now know in your area, those active in your party <i>and those who should become active</i>.<p>

17. Invite from your local area several of the best, key conservative leaders to a confidential meeting, perhaps one evening at your home, to discuss the future of your local party. Serve simple refreshments. Points to be discussed at this meeting should include:<p>

<ul>
<li>The level of effectiveness of the local party committee and its officers<p>

<li>The strength of conservatives as compared to non-conservatives on the party committee and among the committee's officers<p>

<li>The schedule and process by which the party committee renews itself and elects new officers<p>

<li>The schedule and process by which delegates are chosen by the local party to any party conventions at the local, congressional district, and state or national levels<p>

<li>Upcoming opportunities for the party to nominate candidates for public office<p>

<li>The feasibility of increasing conservative strength on the local party committee, among party officials, at party conventions and in the nomination process for public offices.
</ul><p>

18. If there is general agreement at your meeting that conservatives should work together to increase their strength in party activities, ask those present for suggestions of <i>other local conservative leaders who should be invited to a follow-up meeting, also confidential</i>.<p>

The second meeting should be held in a different location, to make clear that this is a coalition, not just your personal project. But you or someone else reliable should do the inviting.<p>

19. The second meeting should also be informal. Pass around a sign-in sheet to get names, addresses and phone numbers of all present. (Later, get copies of the list to all present.)<p>

Begin with a review of the discussion at the first meeting. The new people will probably have new information to share. Then discuss what should be the group's goals. Among the possibilities:<p>

<ul>
<li>Get more conservatives on the party committee
<li>Elect conservatives to party offices
<li>Elect conservative delegates to party conventions
<li>Nominate conservatives for upcoming general elections
<li>Assist conservative elected officials
</ul><p>

20. The number of subsequent such meetings will depend on how long you have before the local party renews itself by selecting new party committee members or elects officers or when the next primary election is.<p>

At each meeting, ask for suggestions of other leaders who should be invited. Keep in mind, though, that all those invited should be trustworthy, principled people who have political or financial resources. Invite new participants by consensus of current participants. Focus on honorable people who, if they choose to do so, can make things happen. For these meetings, you want leaders.<p>

Regardless of their individual main interests, all those you invite should be willing to work with economic conservatives <i>and</i> with social issue conservatives.<p>

21. At the third meeting or at a later meeting, discuss how the group will make its decisions. Then the group should select a person or a subcommittee to draft simple, written rules of procedure by which the coalition can decide whom to support for <i>party committee membership, party committee of office, parry convention delegate or parry nomination for public office.</i>.<p>

Your opportunities will vary with your local circumstances. For example, in some areas the party committee is huge and almost anyone wishing to serve on it can do so. In other areas, the party committee is small and elections to it usually well-contested.<p>

22. At the fourth meeting or at a later meeting, by a majority vote,<i> adopt the rules </i> by which your coalition will make its decisions as to whom to endorse and support.<p>

Generally, the rules will include a secret ballot, with a runoff if no one gets the majority required for endorsement by your coalition.<p>

To receive the coalition's support, anyone must agree in advance to be a candidate and to accept your support.<p>

Most important, the rules should require that <i>all who participate in your coalition's balloting meeting must solemnly promise to work hard to elect to party position or to nominate for public office all those who win the majority vote in your endorsement meeting</i>.<p>

At this time, set the date of your decision-making meeting and agree, unanimously if you can, as to the exact list of those who will be invited.<p>

23. Your coalition's decision-making meeting (balloting) should be <i>a month or more before the filing deadline</i> for the upcoming party convention or party primary.<p>

Start the meeting by having everyone present pledge to support vigorously all those whom the coalition decides to back.<p>

If more than one kind of party office, delegate or party nomination is up, conduct votes on each kind of position. Brief "nominating" speeches are a good idea, because not all those present will know enough about your potential candidates to make informed decisions.<p>

At the close of this meeting, remind everyone that all have committed to work hard for the success of your coalition's candidates.<p>

24. <i>At the same, decision-making meeting,</i> organize your effort to make sure your endorsed candidates win. Here are appropriate items to decide or plan for:<p>

<ul>

<li>Pick a descriptive, simple name for your <i>ad hoc</i> coalition, something like: Conservative Leadership Coalition, Conservative Unity Ticket or 199_ Action Team.<p>

<li>Appoint a finance chairman and a finance committee. <p>
 Take up a collection at the meeting to start your coalition's campaign fund. Everyone present should contribute. Raise additional funds as needed, by direct mail to likely donors, by phone and by personal visits. You might want to schedule one or more fundraising events.<p> 
Set up a temporary bank account to receive contributions to pay for mailings, literature production and other predictable costs such as convention activities. If party nominations for public office are at stake, make sure you comply with applicable financial reporting laws.<p>

<li>By phone or mail, recruit a distinguished list of endorsers for your coalition. They would be those who participated in your meeting plus other party activists, party donors, public officials and well known leaders of community activities. People like to be asked. <p>
The endorsers can be listed on your coalition letterhead or on your printed literature.<p>

<li>Generate a mailing to likely participants in your upcoming party primary, local party election caucus or party convention. Introduce your ticket. Explain why it's important they win. Ask for support. People <i>do</i> like to be asked. Be specific in your letter about when and where to vote, etc. Include filing forms if applicable, and make sure they are filed on time. <p>
Enclose a return envelope and a reply card or a reply form by which people can people can pledge their political support <i>and</i> make a financial contribution.<p>

<li>Some members of your coalition should have mailing lists. Leaders should send special, personal letters to their lists, urging participation in the convention, caucus, mass meeting or primary in which the party will pick its leaders or nominees. These letters should ask for support for your whole ticket. <p>
Don't worry about duplication of effort. People respond best if asked in more than one way.<p>

<li>Have lists of possible supporters called and asked to vote for your ticket in the election meeting, convention or party primary.<p>

<li>As your mailing and phone calls create a list of those pledged to support your coalition, make careful plans to remind supporters by phone the day before the election meeting or primary. Arrange car pools etc. as necessary to make sure everyone gets to where you want them when you want them there.<p>

<li>In a convention or a primary you must make sure all your identified supporters actually vote and that the vote counting is honest. <p>
Whether the voting will be by paper ballot or voting machine, make sure your side is represented in the set up of the voting, certification of voters' eligibility and the counting of the ballots. Unfortunately, no party is entirely free of people willing to cheat if you let them do so.<p>

<li>If the voting will be done at a convention, your coalition must designate a floor leader, whom all delegates who support your coalition should follow during the convention. <p>
Positioned beside the floor leader should by your floor parliamentarian, someone who can give advice on procedural matters. <p>
For a big convention, make large, colored signs to let your supporters know whether to vote yes or no on complex procedural motions. Signs would include your coalition's name. They could read "Action Team--YES and "Action Team--NO."<p>
In a big convention, you also will find that ward, area or county sub-leaders are necessary. Their job is to get their delegates to the convention, keep them posted about what's happening and lead them when it's time to vote.<p>

<li>Designate someone to be your coalition's vote counter. From the <i>beginning</i> of the process of filing of delegates, this person will <i>keep and constantly update</i> a careful estimation of how many delegates votes your side has, how many are for your opposition and how many are unknown or genuinely undecided. <p>
The night before the convention and during it, your vote counter will be very busy. He will give you guidance on when and what you can win.<p>

<li>No later than the night before a convention, gather the leaders of your floor organization to discuss what must be done during the convention. Efficient organizers write out in great detail an expected "script" for a coming convention. <p>
The "script" is a step-by-step description of <i>the anticipated meeting or convention events, who will do what and in what order</i> at the meeting, from the opening gavel to the final adjournment. It includes what the convention officers will do, what you expect your opposition to do and what your team plans to do. <p>
If the opposition tries any surprises, your floor leader must be ready to respond appropriately. Your supporters follow his lead.<p>

<li>If you arrive at a convention with more support than your opposition, you should win. <p>
If your opponents try dirty tricks with <i>credentials</i> certification or the meeting's <i>rules</i>, be prepared to make a steal more expensive than it's worth to them.<p>
People without strongly held political philosophy often lack ethics as well. If they think you'll meekly accept their cheating, they'll cheat. If they know cheating would cause fire to rain on their heads within the party, in the news media and in the courts, they may decide not to cheat. <p>
Cheaters hesitate if they know you have perseverance, good lawyers, good news media contacts, communications skills and ties with high ranking party officials and public officeholders. Most dirty tricks can't stand the light of public exposure.
</ul><p>

25. Win or lose, be polite. That's not always easy. Never lose your temper if you lose or swagger if you win.<p>

26. If you win, remember that winning politics involves addition and multiplication on your side, not subtraction and division.<p>

You may have the opportunity to organize a nominated candidate's general election campaign or to set up the executive committee and appoint officers of your party committee.<p>

<i>In either case, involve some people who are part of, or friendly to, the side you just defeated.</i><p>

Not that you should turn over to them the power you just won. That would be foolish. But you should, by your appointments and in other ways, let everyone know you are willing to work with others, even former foes, who are willing to work with you for the party and its candidates.<p>

27. When beaten by conservatives in party contests, liberals often try to shut off the finances to party committees and to conservative candidates.<p>

Therefore, <i>it's a good idea for your new party leaders and your new party nominees to forestall this if possible by quickly announcing prestigious finance committees which include some unexpected names</i>. They should also quickly develop a base of direct mail donors, which will sustain them if liberals get some big donors to stop giving.<p>

Sometimes those you beat may stay active only to gripe, complain and make life as miserable for you as they can. Keep building and ignore their antics as much as you can. In the long run they will be <i>self</i>-destructive.<p>

In volunteer politics, a builder can build faster than a destroyer can destroy. Win or lose, you should keep building.<p>

28. If you lose, don't be discouraged.<p>

Winston Churchill started out as a soldier and became a politician. He noted much later that in his "former profession one could die but once, but that in politics one can die many times." And still come back to win.<p>

29. If you win a party nomination contest, run the general election campaign in such a way as to <i>increase the number and effectiveness of your party's activists</i>. Run a people-oriented campaign. Campaign consultants often try to spend all the candidate's money on ads in print or broadcast media. Don't let them do it.<p>

30. If you win control of a party committee, run it in such a way as to <i>increase the number and effectiveness of your party's activists</i>.<p>

Hold your own political education and training programs. And send local activists to training programs offered by party groups, non-party activist groups and educational foundations at the local, state and national levels. Have good social events.<p>

Winning gets easier with experience. But no political victory is permanent. Repeat the above 30-step process in each election cycle, from the beginning. Coalitions will vary over time. Some people drop out; others will sell out. Activate new people.<p>

Succession is a problem in any political system.<p>

If you are an elected officeholder or if you are one of those in a conservative majority of a party committee, you should nevertheless plan succession for fellow conservatives in the same open way. Expand the leadership. It's tempting to try to hand-pick your successors, but you'd lose the major benefits of coalition support and set yourself up for an accusation of machine politics. Organize your coalition anew before each potential, major conflict.<p>

It is easier to win an election than to govern well.<p>

America's founding fathers disliked the very idea of political parties. Yet they formed parties as they reluctantly decided they had to do so. It became clear that democratic systems naturally develop such organizations.<p>

Thomas Jefferson once said, "If I could not go to Heaven but with a party, I would not choose to go."<p>

Despite his healthy prejudice against political parties, Jefferson systematically built the anti-Federalists into a national party called the Democratic Republican Party. From it, by a somewhat tortured genealogy, the modern Democratic Party claims descent.<p>

Often matters of political principles and practice were first and best thought out by British statesman Edmund Burke. He wrote the case for political parties: "When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle."<p>

But after a couple of hundred years of experience with organized parties across the world, neither scholars nor politicians nor voters can agree on exactly what a party is or what a party's purpose should be.<p>

At the dawn of the era of political parties, Burke offered a definition: "Party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavors the national interest upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed."<p>

That's a noble concept. But in practice, as Burke himself discovered, <i>serious people often disagree about which principles should unite their party</i>. Some partisans reject principles almost entirely. Nevertheless, British parties and most political parties across the world have unitary structure, party discipline and at least a superficial resemblance to Bruce's description.<p>

However, what we call a party today <i>in the United States</i> is clearly a different thing.<p>

Our two major parties have no unitary structure. Each has a proliferation of official, <i>independent</i> committees. No national party committee can direct state parties or has authority over the operations of all national groups which bear the same party name. Similarly, the state party committees generally have no control over their candidates' campaign committees, state party legislative caucus campaign committees, local party committees or party auxiliary groups.<p>

U.S. parties don't require dues. A national or state party committee cannot even revoke a person's party membership. In those states without official party registration, it's difficult or impossible to say who is or isn't a party member. By law, you are what you say you are.<p>

A political party in the United States is a legal label used by a wide variety of people to serve their interests or their philosophy or both.<p>

What's a U.S. political party for?<p>

Here are some of the many different purposes I have heard mentioned:<p>

<ul>
<li>To recruit candidates
<li>To run candidates' campaigns
<li>To win elections<p>

<li>To advance a specific political philosophy 
<li>To serve elected public officials of the party 
<li>To provide an organizational structure for citizens to participate in the political process<p>

<li>To pass or defeat certain legislative proposals 
<li>To get political jobs for party members 
<li>To provide a social outlet for people who can't find any better way to meet new people<p>

<li>To advance the financial interest of participants
<li>To conduct class warfare
<li>To assemble coalitions of interests for the purpose of governing
</ul><p>

Many of these are legitimate functions of a party. In practice, any of these purposes may conflict with others.<p>

Long affiliation with a party is usually necessary for successful American political leaders.<p>
 
The few major exceptions in our history are when military heroes have been elected to office after demonstrating their leadership skills in battle. And among our military-hero presidents, only George Washington was elected without first affiliating with a party.<p>

Some leaders of non-partisan groups greatly influence elections and the legislative process. But they are forced to work through parties to get their favorites nominated. Often they must work with party leaders in legislative bodies to pass or defeat specific bills.<p>

Politicians neglect party ties at their peril.<p>

In 1976 President Gerald Ford picked Sen. Bob Dole as his running mate and dropped Vice President Nelson Rockefeller from the national party ticket.<p>

A reporter then interviewed Vice President Rockefeller. He asked him, now that it was unlikely he would ever achieve his ambition to be President, if there were things Rockefeller wished he had done differently.<p>

The Vice President answered to this effect: "Yes, I spent my adult life preparing myself to be President, but I neglected to prepare myself to be nominated. "<p>

Most people do not participate in parties. They don't even vote in party primaries, much less serve as party convention delegates or as members of party committees. Yet most of the political power in America is channeled through political parties.<p>

Whether we like it or not, parties are necessary. To pretend they don't exist or don't matter is to limit or destroy our political effectiveness.<p>

Because our major parties are composed of disparate elements and have few and weak mechanisms to enforce party unity on any topic, they seldom reach unanimity on anything. It's no more realistic to expect to find unanimity of opinion within a party than it is to find a winning majority of the voters who all agree on every issue.<p>

Many people with strong preferences about specific issues and with firm beliefs about the proper role of government do work in parties. Such people, men and women with political convictions, often comprise a majority of the party activists. But they always encounter inside a party others with different policy preferences.<p>

They also find themselves working with different kinds of people who have no strong political convictions at all:<p>

<ul>
<li>People who seek power for its own sake
<li>People for whom the party is a social outlet
<li>People for whom the party is merely a family tradition
<li>People who are looking for a political job<p>

<li>People who are active as a favor to their friends 
<li>People whose only political principle is to seek consensus 
<li>People for whom party participation is merely fulfillment of a civic obligation
</ul><p>

Parties, like coalitions of voters on election day, are uneasy alliances. Nevertheless, parties and winning coalitions of voters tend to be stable for extended periods of time. A new, normal winning majority in presidential elections is formed no more than a couple of times each century in America.<p>

The Presidential election majority which won consecutive landslide victories in 1980, 1984 and 1988 may reassemble in future presidential elections. I believe it will. But that's an open question.<p>

For conservative activists who participated in the formation of the winning majority of the 1980s, these are interesting times, filled with dangers and opportunities.<p>

I wish more citizens were politically active. But, since relatively few people choose to participate in party activity, those who do participate have a disproportionate share in our politics and government. In a practical sense, they are the political leaders of our country. If you're not one of them, you have to influence them to accomplish much in the area of public policy.<p>

Election laws and party rules vary from state to state and within each state. Veteran party activists understand the applicable procedures and use their knowledge to maximize their own power. But, although it's different in other countries, party leaders here have little direct control over party activists.<p>

Indeed, party leaders must depend on the voluntary cooperation of others. <i>Our political parry structures are wide open at the bottom</i>. Power inside a party goes to those who recruit and lead others.<p>

Anyone can be a party activist. With a little effort and the resulting experience, almost anyone can be a party leader.<p>

Why not you?<p>

<h1>BARRY GOLDWATER'S LEGACY TO THE 1990'S</h1><p>

<b>by Morton C. Blackwell<br>
Speech to the Philadelphia Society <br>
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania April 30, 1995</b></center>
<hr>

It's almost impossible for people who grew up in the Goldwater for President effort to be objective now about Sen. Goldwater. We can't help loving him, no matter what he might do. We know he paid his lifetime dues more than 30 years ago. <p>

Judging the long political career of Barry Goldwater as most politicians are judged, one might say he was a failure. <p>

His 1964 presidential campaign set records for losing. Every traditionally Republican state was swept by President Lyndon Johnson, whose popular vote victory margin was almost 16 million votes. <p>

Republicans lost a staggering thirty-seven seats in the House of Representatives and two in the Senate. The next year, my friend Tom Pauken, then College Republican national chairman and now state chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, told me the term "conservative" was so badly discredited that we would have to think of some other word to describe our pro-freedom political philosophy. <p>

Sen. Goldwater's legislative record, measured by usual standards, didn't look much better. Rarely did he propose major bills or amendments which passed; rarely did his opposition prevent major bills or amendments from passing. <p>

Yet Barry Goldwater was an essential man for American conservatives. <p>

If America shakes off any of the increasingly heavy shackles of big government, it will be because of what Sen. Goldwater did. <p>

The presidential election landslides of the 1980s, the many special and off-year elections during the two years after the 1992 defeat of Pres. George Bush, and the sweeping Republican landslide in November, 1994, all were made possible by the earlier efforts of Barry Goldwater. <p>

Not that he intended these specific political results. What Adam Smith called an invisible hand can work in a free political system as well as in a free economic system. The new, normal governing majority in American politics is composed of economic issue conservatives and social issue conservatives. That was no part of Goldwater's intention, certainly not after his 1964 defeat. <p>

Barry Goldwater campaigned for political power to implement his conservative philosophy. In that, he was unsuccessful. But he was a highly successful co Eunicator of ideas who challenged the reigning political orthodoxy and created a base of activists who went on to build our country's new, normal governing majority. <p>

Those who cannot remember Goldwater in his prime, before his 1964 defeat, can have little idea of how powerfully he expressed pro-freedom ideas. He was never given his due by the dominant news and opinion media. They did all they could to belittle and marginalize him. <p>

There have been few subsequent books, none of them of wide circulation, which could reveal, even to serious students, the significance of Barry Goldwater. That is why Dr. Lee Edwards' new book, <i>Goldwater</i>, will be so valuable. The book's carefully-worded subtitle, <i>The Man Who Made a Revolution</i>, states its theme. <p>

Goldwater did not win the conservative revolution, but he made it. He created it. <p>

Principled, articulate, handsome, tireless, in the later l950s and early 1960s he was an exciting personality. He spoke out for the historic ideas of America: limited government, free enterprise, strong national defense and, yes, traditional values. <p>

Goldwater's ringing proclamations struck responsive chords where these ideas were still cherished, in the hearts of millions of Americans who had never accepted Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal or its lineal descendants. Lee Edwards captures the authentic Goldwater for posterity. <p>

Goldwater fearlessly spoke truths, truths about the dangers of big government, truths about the nature of communism, and, yes, truths about our culture. He spoke truths which those on the American political left hoped had been buried and eliminated forever from political discourse. <p>

As he vigorously spoke out for endangered conservative principles, he was David against Goliath. He was Horatio at the bridge. He was Leonidas at Thermopylae. He was the honest boy who shouted that the emperor had no clothes. No wonder he became the hero of so many Americans. <p>

For those who agreed with him, Barry Goldwater had Charisma with a capital "C." <p>

His pure message was unadulterated with the opportunism so commonly found in politicians. He said exactly what he thought, with almost no diseernable concern about the political consequences. Long before his presidential campaign adopted its slogan, in our hearts, conservatives knew he was right. <p>

Self educated, he never pretended to be an intellectual. But, for eonservatives, there was no question of our intellectual respeetability. Goldwater and those Americans who looked to him as our political spokesman had a solid foundation of intelleetual support. <p>

Milton Friedman, Russel Kirk, F. A. Hayek, William F. Buckley , Jr., William A. Rusher, Frank Meyer and dozens of other exceptionally bright people were during these years thinking, writing, teaching and speaking at the height of their powers. Most of them worked diligently and effectively to make converts to their views. <p>

A conservative student admirer of Sen. Goldwater might not be able to argue toe-to-toe with his local leftist professor. But that student had access to brilliant, inspiring books, articles, columns and speeches by conservative intellectuals whom he <i>knew</i> could debate circles around the most clever liberal academician. <p>

Confident they were in the right, in the sense of being correct, conservative students, intellectuals and just plain citizens jumped on the Goldwater bandwagon, many becoming political activists for the first time in their lives. <p>

For a new political phenomenon, the conservative movement made remarkable strides. Before the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy, Goldwater was doing much better in the polls against Jaek Kennedy than he ever did against Lyndon Johnson. <p>

Even facing an almost certainly hopeless race against President Johnson, the Goldwater forces soundly defeated the long-dominant Republiean Eastern Establishment in the contests for delegates to the 1964 Republican National Convention and captured about half of the state parties. <p>

The crushing defeat of November, 1964, demoralized many Goldwater activists. Some dropped out of politics. <p>

Many of us, however, had enjoyed the taste of success in our intra-party battles. We concluded that victory in 1964 had not been possible, that Lyndon Johnson's victory was not conservatives' fault, that our cause was ultimately winnable and that our political prospects depended on our own future actions. <p>

We remained active and built on our experience. <p>

The Republican Party's youth organizations stayed in explicitly Goldwaterite hands for more than a decade, recruiting a new generation of like mind. <p>

Eventually many of us became organizational entrepreneurs, building political action committees, lobbies and foundations which multiplied the number and effectiveness of conservative activists. Others became scholars, congressional staff or senior Republican Party leaders. All this is recounted in interesting detail by Lee Edwards. <p>

Proof of participation in the Goldwater campaign became a badge of honor, sometimes a lifelong credential for many of us. In a political world teeming with opportunists, the battle for Goldwater was like Shakespeare's account of Agincourt. We happy few became a band of brothers. <p>

All this Goldwater made possible, and more. <p>

In 1965, a young man named Richard A. Viguerie showed up at the General Accounting Office in Washington, D.C. and began to copy out from government records the names and addresses of donors who had contributed $50 or more to the Goldwater for President Committee. That was legal in those days. <p>

Soon his hands tired, so he hired Kelly Girls to come in and copy more of the names. Before the General Accounting Office staff threw them out Viguerie had a list of 12,500 Goldwater donors. With that list he built a new industry. <p>

At that time, the donor lists of none of the existing conservative organizations was available for use or rental by others. At first, Viguerie's list was the only one on the market. <p>

The stunning new technology of direct mail in the public policy process, soon learned by many others, enabled conservatives to fund a remarkable variety of independent organizations and election campaigns, to communicate personally to mass numbers of voters, and to lobby effectively for conservative causes. <p>

Conservative movement direct mail broke the back of the left wing communications monopoly in America. And it began with the list of 1964 Goldwater donors. <p>

After 1964, the conservative movement gradually went on the offensive. Barry Goldwater went on the defensive. <p>

Before 1964, Goldwater was everywhere available to help conservative candidates and organizations. After 1964, at best, Goldwater was like a defender under siege at his post on a wall. From time to time he'd take a shot at some barbarian who rode by, but his days of advancing the conservative cause were over. He made news primarily on those occasions when he took potshots at fellow conservatives. <p>

Rather abruptly, he underwent a transformation from an inspiring hero to an endearing curmudgeon. <p>

An anecdote: Arizona Congressman Sam Steiger, cut from much the same cloth as Barry Goldwater, asked his old friend Barry to sign a fundraising letter for his 1974 reelection campaign. Goldwater agreed. Steiger asked Viguerie to handle the mailing. Working for Viguerie at the time, I was assigned the job of drafting the letter and overseeing the production of the mailing, which we hoped would raise $40,000. <p>

There was no way the Viguerie company could make much money on such a mailing. Mr. Viguerie undertook the mailing as a favor to Congressman Steiger. <p>

Drafting that letter, I poured myself into Barry Goldwater's persona. I tried to write a letter Barry might have personally written to an old friend from the 1964 campaign. <p>

Between 1958 and 1964 I had read every scrap I could find about and by Goldwater and taken every opportunity to see and hear him in person. Sen. Goldwater autographed my copy of <i>The Conscience of a Conservative</i> in October, 1960. I had been on the original eleven member steering committee of National Youth for Goldwater, as well as his youngest delegate to the 1964 Republican National Convention. So I was happy to try my hand at writing a letter for his signature. <p>

Sen. Goldwater approved my draft letter. We mailed it to a list, including the surviving Goldwater donors from a decade earlier, which we thought large enough to raise the $40,000 Congressman Steiger wanted. Far surpassing our expectations, the letter netted the Steiger campaign a total of $160,000. <p>

Viguerie had charged the Steiger campaign on a perletter-mailed basis. He would have been paid the same if the letter had netted only the expected amount or even less. But when Sen. Goldwater learned how much had been raised, he angrily concluded the direct mail company had made an outrageous profit. To this day he believes that. And from that day he virtually stopped signing letters for conservative organizations or for individual conservative candidates. <p>

Intransigent as always, he would not listen to the facts of the matter. His signature on that letter to that list simply did much better for his friend Sam Steiger than could reasonably have been expected. <p>

Goldwater clearly was uncomfortable with the growth of the conservative movement after he stopped being its standard bearer. <p>

Frank Meyer, senior editor of <i>National Review</i>, had persuaded most movement conservatives well before the 1964 election that our future success lay in the fusion of economic conservatives and traditional values conservatives. <p>

Before his defeat, Sen. Goldwater acted as if he concurred. Later, he resented the new and essentially defensive activism of social issue conservatives who were outraged at attacks on their values. The federal courts, previously a target of Barry Goldwater's frequent criticism, overturned settled laws and social policy in every jurisdiction in America. <p>

To be fair, it must be admitted that Goldwater probably had never been asked in 1964 his position on legalizing abortion. It was illegal everywhere, like bank robbery. <p>

Undoubtedly, Barry Goldwater also resented Ronald Reagan, as Lee Edwards' excellent new book amply documents. <p>

Reagan was an even better communicator. Reagan knew how to say unpleasant things pleasantly. Reagan shared Goldwater's conservative principles, but, unlike Goldwater, Reagan obviously cared what others thought of him. <p>

Most aggravating of all, Ronald Reagan was successful where Goldwater had failed. <p>

Like Moses, Barry Goldwater was not destined to lead his people into the promised land. Unfortunately also like Moses, Barry was unhappy about that fate. <p>

But we must always be grateful for what he did for us and for America. <p>

<h1>SURVIVAL VALUES</h1>

<b>By Morton C. Blackwell<br>
A speech delivered at the <br>
1989 College Republican National Convention <br>
Orlando, Florida July 7, 1989
</b></center>
<hr>

I will focus today on a topic none of you have ever heard me address before: sex.<p>

Right now, Washington, D.C. is experiencing two sex scandals which affect the party you have joined.<p>

The first involves Congressman Donald "Buz" Lukens of Ohio. A few days ago, Buz Lukens was sentenced to jail on misdemeanor charges for having sex with a 16 year old girl. Unresolved are possible felony charges that he also had sex with her when she was 13. Buz Lukens is 58. <p>

His unsuccessful defense in court was that he couldn't have contributed to this girl's delinquency because she was already immoral. <p>

The second scandal is still unfolding. It involves the expose of a largely homosexual prostitution ring in the Washington, D.C. area. <p>

Already there have been banner headlines about some Reagan and Bush administration officials' involvement. <p>

In the news about this second scandal are reports of bugged rooms, two-way mirrors, blackmail and midnight tours of the White House by teams of homosexual prostitutes. <p>

Five hundred credit card receipts for sexual services rendered are in the possession of <i>The Washington Times</i>, which broke the story. <p>

Reportedly, a lobbyist who spent as much as $20,000 per month on male prostitutes for himself and friends gave an $8,000 Rolex watch to a White House Secret Service officer who gave him access to the White House West Wing, which contains the president's Oval Office. <p>

The White House liaison for the U.S. Labor Department was implicated and has already resigned. <p>

The FBI, the U.S. Secret Service, and other Federal, State and local authorities are scrambling to do their jobs as the facts unfold. This story is far from over. <p>

As Republican youth activists, you should know who Congressman Lukens is. He is politically destroyed now. But you should know, I want to be sure you know, that Buz Lukens played a unique role in the development of the conservative movement. And he was a key player at a critical time in Republican youth politics. <p>

My first College Republican National Convention was in 1963, while I was state College Republican chairman of Louisiana. In those days the College Republican and Young Republican national conventions were held together. <p>

In 1963 in San Francisco, Goldwater Republicans won control of both organizations. An exciting book could be written about how Buz Lukens became the new Young Republican national chairman. It was a new era. <p>

After Goldwater's defeat, Buz was elected in 1966 to the Congress from Ohio. He immediately started supporting Ronald Reagan for President. Through the Reagan efforts of 1968, 1976, and 1980, Buz was a key leader. <p>

For 27 years, despite political defeats, a divorce, financial difficulties, a close call with disabling throat cancer and other troubles, Buz Lukens remained a state and national conservative leader, effective and admired by grassroots activists. <p>

Since 1962 he has been a good friend to me. <p>

I don't mind telling you my eyes have filled with tears more than once in recent months as a sex scandal of his own making has brought him down. <p>


<i>He made the wrong choices.</i><p>

I pray he can personally recover from this selfinflicted disaster, but his political situation is hopeless. <p>

In the unfolding, so-called "call-boy" scandal in D.C., two of the alleged patrons have had ties to conservatives for many years. They are the only ones yet named whom I have known. They made the wrong choices. <p>

But what can one say about the judgment of someone who pays for a prostitute with a credit card? Memories may fade, but not credit card records. <p>

You who are in your late teens and early twenties live in a world very different from the one I grew up in. A skirt above the knees raised eyebrows then. Movies were self-censored very effectively. Books, magazines, radio, music, and even conversation were much more restrained by traditional morality than they are today. <p>

What is commonplace now in the media was rare or non-existent then. <p>

There has been a massive assault on moral values. Everywhere there are voices urging young people: <p>

<blockquote>"Do it. Do it if it feels good. Do it now. The church is wrong. Your parents are old fogies. Everyone is doing it. Don't be left out. You're entitled to something for nothing. There are no bad consequences. And besides, you won't get caught."</blockquote><p>

In many ways our society has failed you, ignoring the hard-won lessons of history, the accumulated wisdom of the ages, the maxims of morality. Truths revealed, experienced and long respected are not well taught to most in your generation. And the decline began before your generation. <p>

My grandparents and, probably, your great grandparents were given copybooks in school. These copybooks served two purposes. At the top of each page was written a heading, a maxim or saying which gave moral guidance, such as, "Honesty is the best policy" and "Honor thy father and thy mother." <p>

Students learned handwriting by copying each heading many times, filling each page with the most useful, sensible advice, gleaned from the long experience of civilization. I have one of my grandfather's copybooks from the 1870's. <p>

The great English poet and writer Rudyard Kipling is probably best known to most of you, if at all, through Walt Disney's version of Kipling's <i>Jungle Books</i>. But Rudyard Kipling was highly perceptive. As early as 1919 he warned in a marvelous poem, "The Gods of the Copybook Headings," that our very survival depends on our not forgetting the lessons of history. <p>

Kipling contrasted the eternal verities, which called the Gods of the Copybook Headings, with the tempting, siren songs of Social Progress, "the Gods of the Market-Place," which falsely claimed that times so changed that the old truths no longer apply. <p>

<blockquote>
THE GODS OF THE COPYBOOK HEADINGS
 <p>

"As I pass through my incarnations in every age and race, <br>

I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market-Place. <br>

Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall, <br>

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all. <p>

"We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn <br>

That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn: <br>

But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind, <br>

So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind. <p>

"We moved as the Spirit listed. <i>They</i> never altered their pace, <br>

Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market-Place; <br>

But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come <br>

That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome. <p>

"With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch. <br>

They denied that the Moon was Stilton: they denied she was even Dutch. <br>

They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings. <br>

So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things."
 
</blockquote> <p>

What Kipling is describing here is a cyclical process, which each few generations must experience anew. Yes, the times are always changing, but not always changing in the same direction. <p>

In ancient Rome, Marcus Cicero's thundering denunciations of the sexual behavior of Marc Anthony were followed in the next century by the open depravity of Nero and Caligula. <p>

And in England, the licentiousness of the Stuart restoration period was followed two centuries later by the Victorian era. <p>

The pendulum swings back and forth over time. <p>

At a time when our society is newly outraged over the burning of our country's flag and when increasing restrictions on abortion are now certain, and when deadly AIDS is killing thousands, it is not a good bet that society will acquiesce in the loss of all standards of sexual propriety. <p>

Torturing each other for fun and profit, public sex acts, drinking urine, eating feces, and even itinerant bed hopping will, I believe, become less acceptable, not more licit in years to come. <p>
 
<blockquote>
"When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace, <br>

They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease. <br>

But when we disarmed They sold us, and delivered us bound to our foe,  <br>

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "<i>Stick to the Devil you know</i>." <p>

"On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life <br>

(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife) <br>

Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith, <br>

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: ' <i>The Wages of Sin is Death</i>."'
</blockquote> <p>

Notwithstanding waves of propaganda to the contrary, the old truth has emerged: There is no safe sex, except in a monogamous, faithful marriage. <p>

There are ways of lessening the risk of promiscuity, but value-free, sexual fun and games, none of them safe, are multiplying the number of victims of incurable, sexually transmitted diseases, one of them absolutely fatal. <p>

And yet we have increasingly shrill voices who advocate going beyond today's high level of toleration and say we should create new legal privileges for each increasingly bizarre form of sexual relationship. <p>

We are even told AIDS is a civil rights issue, not a public health issue. <p>

It was British Philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke who wrote in 1772 that "Dissent, not satisfied with toleration, is not conscience, but ambition." <p>

<blockquote>
"In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all, <br>

By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul; <br>

But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy, <br>

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: '<i>If you don't work you die</i>.'"
</blockquote> <p>

Perhaps the most fraudulent of the false gods today is the argument that, somehow, a high proportion of us are inevitably, genetically, uniquely foreordained to homosexual activity. <p>

One does not have to be a clinical psychologist or any type of scientist to see through that preposterous lie. <p>

Young man, your father, your grandfathers, all four of your great grandfathers, all eight of your great great grandfathers and on back beyond the reach of recorded time, all their fathers performed successfully and heterosexually. You are the product of eons of heterosexual activity. <p>

Young lady, your mother and your grandmother were not the product of parthenogenesis. They and all your maternal ancestors performed heterosexually and successfully. You are living proof they did. <p>


To say that ten or twenty percent of humanity is doomed to heterosexual disfunction is nonsense. Dangerous and arrant nonsense. <p>

 Authorities agree that sexual behavior is learned behavior. Researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson wrote, "We're born man, woman and sexual beings. We learn our sexual preferences and orientations." <p>

No reputable scientist has found any hereditary tie to homosexuality. <p>

Even Dr. Alfred Kinsey wrote, "I have myself come to the conclusion that homosexuality is largely a matter of conditioning." <p>

The problem is that for many years our society has been conditioning more and more people for this kind of behavior. <p>

Sympathetic portrayal is the rule now in movies and dramatic television. <p>

I believe it could be demonstrated statistically that in the last ten years major network television productions have portrayed sympathetically fewer clergy than homosexuals. And in so doing they have killed a lot of people. Literally killed them by leading them into temptation. <p>

Humans are so constituted as to enjoy sex. If sex were not a pleasure, there would be a lot less procreation. <p>

That which is pleasurable tends to be habit forming. And habits include many things, good, bad and indifferent. Among them are gambling, alcohol, illegal drugs, poetry, music, and various forms of sexual <p>

Just because something feels good does not mean it is good. <p>

Bad habits can be broken, particularly if people understand they are not inevitably, hereditarily forced into those bad habits. The problem I am discussing here is not bad genes but bad choices. <p>

Most of us have sense enough not to try heroin or other highly addictive drugs. We recognize there are things, once started, which cannot easily be stopped. Such wisdom could and should be applied to sexual activity. <p>

And for those whose counterproductive behavior has become addictive, it is still possible to change. Many take control of their own lives every day: smokers, gamblers, alcoholics, and illegal drug users. <p>

Studies indicate that about one third of former homosexuals have reformed themselves. <p>

Of course there are those who decide at some point to flaunt their homosexual behavior, taking up the cause of gay rights and saying how much better they feel to be out of the closet. <p>

Unfortunately for them, feeling better doesn't really make it better. <p>

I am reminded in these cases of Winston Smith, the central figure in George Orwell's powerful novel, <i>1984</i>. Beaten by remorseless conditioning at last, Winston Smith finally thinks he loves Big Brother. But his loving Big Brother only makes the tragedy complete. <p>

No reader of <i>1984</i> closes that book with feelings of hate or fear of Winston Smith. What one feels is sadness, pity, a wish that one could help. <p>

Our modern era will one day be a bygone era. The people of the future will be the descendants of those of us who made the right choices in our own lives. <p>

It is a dangerous, imperfect world. But those who came before us have left us valid lessons, not always written as copybook headings, which we would be wise to follow. <p>

A person does not profit from his own fatal mistake. But the fatal mistakes of others should be highly instructive. <p>

Kipling ended his poem:
<blockquote>
"Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew, <br>

And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true <br>

That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and make Four-- <br>

And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more. <p>

<center>*   *   *   *</center> <p>

"As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man-- <br>

There are only four things certain since Social Progress began:-- <br>

That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, <br>

And the burnt fool's bandaged finger goes wabblinq back to the Fire; <br>

And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins <br>

When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, <br>

As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, <br>

The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!"
</blockquote> <p>

<h1>HOW TO STOP THEM FROM STAMPING OUT THE GRASSROOTS</h1><p>


<b>Remarks by<br>
Morton C. Blackwell<br>
at the Second Annual <br>
Conservative Leadership Conference<br>
Washington, D.C., November 10, 1990</center></b><br>
<hr>

Knowledgeable conservatives, in moments of candor, will admit our grassroots activity is far less today than a dozen years ago.<p>

Several causes come initially to mind:<p>

<ul>
<li>We do not have a Ronald Reagan, persuasively reliable on all our issues, around whom to rally.<p>

<li>The success of conservative economic policies has brought an unprecedented period of economic prosperity, lessening our fears for the survival of the free enterprise system.<p>

<li>The success of conservative policies of peace through strength has helped engender the utter extinction of the Brezhnev Doctrine and hastened the collapse of much of the Soviet empire.<p>

<li>Our ancient liberal enemies have ceased to trumpet much of their old ideology and seem to be doing all they can to sound as if they are conservatives on many issues.
</ul><p>

Most of these causes are the natural results of successful policies of a newly formed, governing majority coalition, signs of the cyclical process familiar in a healthy, two party system.<p>

When the threat perception declines, activists tend to lose much of their old enthusiasm. Coalition members tend to start bickering.<p>

But these reasons are not sufficient to explain the extent of the current decline in grassroots activism. New governing coalitions in the United States tend to last for a generation or two.<p>

Other factors are at work.<p>

Today I intend to discuss two other factors, the increasing domination of political consultants and growing failure of conservative to run candidates. These are factors which affect our opponents as well. But the extent of the damage done to us by these two factors is largely in our power to correct.<p>

First let us consider the career path of a successful political consultant.

Here is what happens: <p>

A smart campaign staffer helps win a high visibility election and decides to become a consultant. <p>

The new consultant is soon involved in another win or two and is suddenly able to sell his services to many carnpaigns. <p>

While able to give his few, early clients a great deal of personal time, working through many levels of their carnpaign organizations, the consultant quickly finds it impossible to give the same type of service to half a dozen candidates simultaneously. <p>

Unable now to supervise detailed operations involving many layers of people in many campaigns at once, the consultant directs his client campaigns toward media-intensive, rather than people-intensive activity. Media decisions are few in number. They require skill but little time. <p>

The consultant also realizes it is very much in his own financial interest to have as much as possible of his clients' budgets spent on media. Most consultants take a 15% commission (over and above client-paid production costs and his retainer) from media vendors for all placements. The consultant knows he gets no commission for campaign funds spent on people-intensive activity, such as: <p>
<ul>
<li>precinct organization <br>

<li>voter ID phone banks <br>

<li>voter registration drives <br>

<li>youth efforts <br>

<li>the election day process to get out the vote
</ul><p>

With their budgets warped toward media spending, candidates and their in-state organizations are led to measure the progress of their campaigns only in terms of dollars raised and tracking polls. (When I ask a candidate in a close race how he is doing and he answers by first describing his fundraising progress, I know he is in trouble.) <p>

In defense of his practices, the consultant develops an outspoken contempt for any proposed, significant campaign expenditures except for paid media. <p>

Many of his clients lose due to their failure to organize large numbers of people in their campaigns. But some of his clients do win. These winners are the ones the consultant talks about as he recruits clients in the next election cycle. <p>

Having helped elect several candidates, the consultant is likely to be hired again to run their reelection campaigns. The incumbents have the ability to amass huge campaign funds, often from local donors. Even in the closing days of a reelection campaign where an incumbent is virtually unopposed, the consultant has a strong incentive to urge their incumbent on to raise more and more money. Never mind that conservative candidates in other contests in the area <i>might actually win close contests </i>but for the incumbent's having vacuumed up so much money from available donors. After all, for every additional $100,000 spent on broadcast media, the consultant will pocket a cool $15,000 plus his fees for creating any new commercials. <p>

The consultant, now prosperous and enjoying a changed lifestyle, has ready access to and influence with some incumbent officeholders He decides to branch out into lobbying, where his influence enables him to pull down some really fat fees from major corporations, trade associations and even foreign governments which have major financial interests in the decision of elected and appointed government officials. By now, most of the consultant's income does not come from election campaigns. But his continues to take some candidates as clients, partly to keep his valuable ties with incumbents and partly because there are in each election cycle some rich candidates and others able to raise big war chests, which will be spent largely on campaign media, still a fine source of income for the consultant. <p>

<blockquote>
Every experienced conservative campaign activist has seen outrageous examples of this behavior. My luncheon for conservative campaign activists has me bi-weekly, without exception, since 1974. I keep close touch with the election process.
I'm not raising this as a theoretical problem. </blockquote><p>

Not all successfill consultants behave this way. A great many do. But others, particularly those who specialize in one or more aspects of campaign technology such as direct mail, telephone canvassing, coalition building and youth efforts, do not. <p>

This growing problem with consultants has many bad effects:<p>
<ul>
<li>the unnecessary losses of many conservative candidates each year <p>

<li>the looting of millions of dollars misspent on media <p>

<li>the suckering of many right candidates who are falsely led by consultants to believe they can win <p>

<li>the increasing perception that campaigning is mostly mudslinging TV commercials. <p>

<li>worst of all, the general decline of citizen participation as activists and, often, even as voters in the political process 
</ul><p>

Historically, volunteer participation in elections is the greatest preparation for competent campaign management <i>and</i> good candidates in future elections. That source of new activists and candidates is drying up. <p>

Can grassroots activists do anything to limit the damage done by the increasing dominance of campaign consultants? Certainly. <p>

One big reason for reliance on campaign consultants is the increasing complexity of modern election technology. but in the years leading up to the election of 1980 conservative organizations ran massive political education and training efforts. Acdvists were prepared by the thousands. That grassroots infrastucture building should be vigorously resumed. <p>

If you are a donor to a conservatdve organization you should demand that a substantial portion of its budget be spent on increasing the number and the effectiveness of its activists. If a group fails to do this, give to other groups instead. <p>

If you are a donor to a party orga lization, demand that is spend you money, in part, on a serious program of political education and training. There is hardly any area of political technology which cannot be mastered by a willing local activist: The Republican Party was spending a much higher percentage of its revenue on political education and training twenty years ago than it is today. The GOP is giving only peanuts to its volunteer base. <p>

Be careful that the training programs actually teach usefill slcills. Many seminars which purport to teach local activists are taught by consultants not interested in preparing volunteer competitors. Such programs serve only to teach the participants that the consultant knows his topic and is worthy of hire. <p>

If you contribute to a candidate, you have the right to demand that his campaign give a healthy budget to people-oriented programs: precinct organizations, women's activities, youth efforts, etc. These activities build grassroots infrastructure like no others. <p>

<center>*   *   *   *   *</center><p>

Let us now turn to the problem of the growing failure of conservatives to run candidates. <p>

More and more it is proving impossible to recruit conservative candidates against incumbents or even for open seats. Challengers for even local incumbents often cannot be found. <p>

The next Congress will have only four Republicans among the ten congressmen from my home state of Vlrginia. But ten years ago we elected nine of the ten. And the lone Democratic congressman was more conservative than some of the Republicans. <p>

And all six of the Virginia Democratic congressmen are quite liberal by Virginia standards. And, what is worse, far worse, is the dreadful fact that we did not run Republican challengers against any of the five incumbent Democrats. They go off Scot free. <p>

But don't for a moment think the Democrats gave our five incumbent Republicans a free ride. No, there were Democratic challengers to all five of our congressmen. And the challenger who beat Congressman Stan Parris reportedly raised more money than any other challenger against a Republican incumbent in the United States this year. <p>

This problem in my state is typical of the situation in many parts of the country. <p>

In fact, there is a fundamental misconcepdon which is shared by many conservatives and many Republican leaders. This political error is not unique to Virginia. It is, I believe, a misunderstanding of how best to build grassroots strength through running candidates. <p>

Too many of us think we should run a candidate only when we think there is a good chance we can win the election. <p>

And, since nobody believed we could beat any of the five incumbent Virginia Democradc congressmen, nobody ran against any of them. I submit that, in the case of these ten congressional races, the Democrats acted smarter than the Republicans.

But not mnning a candidate oflen sounds so reasonable, doesn't it? <p>

Why spend the time and money it takes to run an almost surely losing race? <p>

Why ask a candidate to take on an almost surely losing candidacy? <p>

Why embarrass the party or the conservative cause by losing badly? <p>

Why take the chance of diverting resources from our candidates elsewhere who have a chance to win? <p>

Why anger a safe incumbent opponent? <p>

All those sound like pretty good reasons not to challenge apparently safe liberal incumbents, don't they? Many Republican incumbents, in particular, don't want to rile many of their Democratic colleagues by challenging them. <p>

And most of those arguments sound just as good as reasons not to run a candidate in an open district where the liberals seem virtually certain to win. <p>

Yet those are arguments which ultimately lead to slow growth, no growth and eventual decline of a movement or a political party. <p>

If conservatives in Virginia had operated in this fashion for the past 25 years, Republicans would not have won our first U.S. Senate race, the party would not today hold even four congressional districts and the party would not have the record strength it enjoys today in Virginia's General Assembly and in local offices. <p>

Take for example my own congressional district, the Tenth. Conservative Republican Frank Wolfwas an unknown in 1976 when he first announced against the incumbent liberal Democratic Congressman Joe Fisha. Frank Wolf campaigned hard but lost the nomination to a state legislator, who was then beaten by Congressman Fisher in November. <p>

Frank Wolf again took on this seemingly hopeless task in 1978. He was nominated and did better than the state legislator had two years earlier. But Wolf lost again in 1978. <p>

Finally, in 1980, Frank Wolfwon both the nomination and, narrowly, the general election defeating the incumbent who very few people thought was vulnerable four years earlier. <p>

The two earlier races had so weakened the liberal Democratic congressman and so strengthened our organization that we were able to take the district. We have been winning it by convincing margins ever since.<p>

Think about this seriously. Everyone who knows much about politics knows of many cases where races against supposedly entrenched incumbents weakened the incumbents so they could be defeated in subsequent elections. <p>

Isn't that a familiar situation? Isn't that a strong, solid reason to run candidates, almost an obligation to run candidates, even when there is thought to be no chance to win in the current election year? <p>

The best known political consultants, by the way, usually advise against running candidates who are very unlikely to win. But such candidates provide the big consultants with no revenue, except in the case of rich, hopeless candidates. In this latter case, consultants often are willing to take them as clients. Often to "take" them in both senses of the word. <p>

Conservatives who know how important it is to build for the future also know how a losing race can soften up an opponent for future defeat, build credibility for our challengers and build the strength of our own organizations. These are powerful reasons not to leave vacant places on the ballot. <p>

While we all know of losing races which made possible later victories, there is another situation which often occurs. <p>

Some conservative activists can remember our Virginia United States Senate race in 1972. An unusual congressman from the Eighth District, Bill Scott, made what most so-called "experts" thought was a hopeless race against the supposedly invulnerable incumbent, U.S. Senator Bill Spong. <p>

Now <i>not everyone</i> thought the Scott for Senate cause was hopeless. A conservative Republican leader, Richard Obenshain, thought this so-called "impossible" race was actually winnable. So he set out to win with Scott, certainly one of the most difficult candidates our party has fielded in our lifetimes. <p>

But Dick Obenshain was a political genius who saw opportunities where others saw only problems. <p>

Bill Scott won. Six years later he turned his U.S. Senate seat over to another Republican whom many of us hoped would have been Dick Obenshain. <p>

Senator John Warner won very narrowly in 1978, winning again in 1984 by a big margin. This year the Democrats did not challenge Sen. Warner, which is great for Republicans and, in my opinion, bad news for the Democrats. <p>

But we should remember that almost everyone at first thought Bill Scott could not win this seat when he ran for it 13 years ago.<p>

Please think about it. How many times have you, yourself, been pleasantly surprised when a race supposedly hopeless for us has resulted in a thrilling conservative victory? Most of our best conservative members of both houses of the Congress first won in just such circumstances. <p>

Sometimes the liberal nominee self-destructs unexpectedly. <p>

Sometimes our candidate and his campaigns turn out to be much better than we expected. <p>

Surely all of us can think of predicted losers who instead became glorious winners. Is that not therefore another good reason to run candidates whom we really don't expect to win? <p>

Frankly, looking at the ten congressional districts in Virginia today, how the Democrats treated us and how we treated them, it's a scandal that we have left all their incumbents unchallenged. At the congressional level, Virginia has only a one and a half party system in 1990. How about your state? <p>

This situation I call a scandal is not to be blamed on any particular party leaders at the local or state levels. The general idea of not challenging supposedly invulnerable incumbents is common almost everywhere in our country. <p>

In my home county of Arlington, our party has very often in recent years failed to run candidates against many of the worst liberals in Virginia. There is plenty of blame to go around. And I'll accept my share. <p>

What I am proposing today is not recriminations but a badly needed change of policy, a change of our behavior. <p>

Let me put it clearly. Not running candidates is almost always worse than putting up losing candidates. <p>

Sometimes we produce upset victories. <p>

Sometimes we build up candidates for future victories. <p>

Always we involve new people who can later help us win future victories. <p>

Always we force the opposition incumbents to gather and spend for themselves some resources which otherwise might be spent against our conservative candidates elsewhere. <p>

Not running candidates is no way to build a movement or a party.<p>

If one chooses to be active in a party structure, one necessarily must support that party's incumbents except in extraordinary circumstances. But conservatives primarily active outside a party structure are free of most such constraints. <p>

In sum, conservatives should run candidates against liberal incumbents and for open seats regardless of whether or not the potential candidates appear to be possible winners. <p>

The only two tests should be these: <p>
<ol>
<li>Will the person act responsibly in the campaign? <p>

<li>If elected, would the person be a credit to our cause? <p>
</ol><p>
If a potential candidate passes these two tests, then encourage him or her to run. Do this regardless of whether or not there appears to be a real chance to win the election. <p>

You may not happen to find or be able to recruit to run any independently wealthy, thirty five year old conservative business leaders with degrees in both economics and political science. <p>

If not, you might recruit a politically savvy housewife; we have a lot of them across America who would make good candidates. <p>

Or run a distinguished retiree. Or even a dedicated and intelligent young person.<p>

Each new candidate brings to your cause not only his own time and effort but also the resources and enthusiasm of his own circle of family, friends and supporters. And many people who don't like the liberals are happy we have given them a choice. <p>

Of course I don't advocate misleading a potential candidate to think you can provide money or manpower which aren't actually available. Already this happens too often. <p>

Give a realistic estimate of the chances of winning. <p>

Say what are the limits of likely movement resources and party support. The national and state party resources will be and should be focused in the main on candidates with some prospect of election.

Curiously, you will find that some people don't mind being run as sacrificial lambs in a good cause. To fill out a Republican ballot, I ran for the state legislature in Louisiana 22 years ago. I was duly sacrificed, but with no lasting ill effects. <p>

You will find that some potential candidates will respond to your less than optimistic assessment of their chances by declaring candidacy despite the long odds. Many will convince themselves that they do have a chance. And some may surprise you by actually winning. <p>

Look at this from your own experience. Aren't most of the conservative winners you know and almost all of the <i>key workers</i> for conservative winners you know, aren't these people experienced in prior, but losing campaigns? <p>

We are trying to build a stable, governing majority. Winning today isn't everything. Losing today may open doors to victories tomorrow. <p>

Let's fill the ballot where we can. <p>

<title>Trained Conservatives Bridge Leadership Gap</title>
</head>

<body>

<center>
<h2>Trained Conservatives Bridge Leadership Gap</h2>
</center> 

William R. Jackson, Sr. is <i>an arch-conservative</i>.<p>

To a liberal in the establishment media, longtime Leadership Institute supporter Bill Jackson might be called an archconservative simply because he supports limited government , free enterprise and traditional values.  But if that's the case he's an arch conservative in more ways than one.<p>

Because of Bill Jackson and his company, Pitt-Des Moines, millions of Americans every year enjoy a visit to America's "Gateway to the West" -- the Arch at St. Louis.

<center>
<h4>Bridge Builder Demonstrates Sucess of American Free Enterprise System</h4>
</center>

In 1982, Bill Jackson's father, William H. Jackson, founded Jackson and Moss with his partner and friend, Berkely Moss, to install water systems for small towns.  At the time, wood was the primary resource for building water tanks.<p>  

Their company grew into Des Moines Bridge and Iron Works, with its headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa.  With the increasee use and production of steel, it evolved into Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company.  Now it has operations inWarren, Pennsyulvania; Des Moines, Iowa; Provo, Utah; and several cities in California.  <p>

Today, Pitt-Des Moines still builds water towers -- and bridges, wind tunnels, space chambers and storage tanks for natural gas and oil.<p>

But, the best known product of Pitt-Des Miones is something quite different -- America's "Gateway to the West" -- The Arch at St. Louis.<p>

<h4>Jackson's Company Built Perfect Symbol of Growth</h4>

In 1962, Pitt-Des Moines was chosen to construct the "Gateway to the West" to commemorate the pioneers' great western movement.  <p>

Bill Jackson explains his revolutionary Catenary arch as equally wide as it is tall at 630 feet each.  The Arch is shaped at the base and all around as an equilateral triangle.  At the base, each side of the triangle is 54 feet long. <p>
 
The Arch was assembed by welding eight-foot-tall stainless steel pieces into triangle-shaped sections, buildingone on top of another.  Because fo the welding, the Arch is air tight and hollow inside.<p> 

The final piece -- the keystone -- was placed in October, 1965, and Bill Jackson was there. <p>

But the circumstances which surround the Arch placement are very interesting simply in themselves.<p>

<h4>Dedicating the Arch Easier Said than Done</h4>
The Mayor of St. Louis at that time wantsed to have a grand, public ceremony to commemorate the Arch's completion.  But Bill Jackson knew placing the keystone during the day would be difficult.  The heat of the sun on the Arch's southern exposure would cause half of it to expand and lean down a foot and a half.  <p>

In that case, the keystone wouldn't fit.<p>

"I told the Mayor that it would be best to place the last piece at two or three in the morning," Jackson says.   "But he wanted to hold a big political rally in the daytime."<p>

Jackson finally agreed to have the ceremony at nine in  the morning, on one condition: The Mayor would have every possible fire truck availavle in site to spray cool water on the southern base of the Arch.<p>

Even with this precaution and the assistance of several workers, it still took over three hous to insert the keytone.<p>

More than 25 years later, the Gateway Arch at St. Louis is the fourth most visited tourist attraction in the world and the most famous symbol of American growth.<p>

<center>
<h4>America's Potential for Growth Restrained by Government</h4>
</center>

Bill Jackson still has faith in America's potential.  But he believes exessive government regulation greatly reduces the potential for continued growth.<p>

"Our founders never expected government to bee as big as it is, " Jackson says.  "Government was only meant to be as big as necessary to protect us from foreign attack."<p>

"Right now the government is overly involved in the lives of the people," Jackson continues.  "Government isn't trying to help people work.  Instead, it makes them lazy.<p>

"The government wants to gain control of the people by trying to bring an end to free enterprise."<p>

Bill Jackson graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1930 with a deegree in Engineering and Business Administration.  He began working  at Pitt-Des Moines six years after he graduated and worked up the ladder, serving as Chairman of the Board of Pitt-Des Moines from1959 to 1990.  Now Jackson works mostly half days as Chairman Emeritus.<p>

He has been a generous supporter of Leadership Institute programs since 1999.<p>

<center>
<h4>Institute Educates Conservatives Who Share Jackson's Beliefs</h4>
</center>

"I like to see the number of conservatives grow in order to increase our salvation from liberal dominance," Jackson says.  "That is why I support the Leadership Institute, because they help these numbers grow. <p>

"I am encouraged to support the Leadership Institute because their educational programs teach young people how to go out and support conservative points of view which are so much better than liberal beliefs."<p>

Thanks to the generosity of donors like Bill Jackson, the Leadership Institute trains record numbers of young conservatives every year. <p>

These young advocates of free enterprise, limited government and traditional values will take up the banner of conervative leadership fo rmany years to come.<p><p>

<title>Catch This Rising Conservative Star</title>

<body>

<center>
<h2>Catch This Rising Conservative Star</h2>
</center>

Few twenty-six year olds in America today have acheived as much as Leadership Institue graduate and faculty member Kevin Pritchett.<p>

But Kevin Pritchett is no ordinary twenty-six year old.<p>

Culrently the Floor Assistant to Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott, Prikhen has compiled an impressive resume of success as a conservative in the pubiic policy process.<p>

Now Kevin Prhchett  is a rising among young conservative movers and shakers in America<p>

At Dartmouth College Pritchett served as Editor-in-Chief of the well-known and highly successful independent conservative newspaper, <i>The Dartmouth Review</i>. Then,for three years as an intern during his college summers and for two years full-time after college, he worked as a journalist for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Now, in addition to his work as an aide to U.S. Senator Lott, he volunteers as a panelist on <i>Youngbloods</i>, a young-adult version of the McLaughlin Group, broadcast nationally on NET-Political NewsTalk Network.<p>

Kevin Says his wide range of pre-Hill experience along with graduation from a Leadership Institute Capitol Hill Staff Training School in 1988 strengthened his principles and his leadership skills. Now he
helps conservative senators define and set the conservative agenda in the new Congress.<p>

<center>
<h4>Pritchett Active Against Liberal College Establishment</h4>
</center>

Kevin Pritchett became a member of the of Ihe <i>Dartmouth Review</i> to better express his conservative views and to expose the predominately liberal bias on his campus.<p>

Working on <i>The Review</i> helped to strengthen my conservative opinions, says Pritchett. When you have people questioning your views and opinions, then you have to be brave and stick with them to defend them.<p>

<i>The Review</i>, like any other student publication, provides a good forum to exercise your talents and skills, says Pritchett. Dealing with the political controversies related to the paper and the pressure
of your college workload isn't easy, but it will definitely teach you responsibility.<p>

Pritchett ran into his share of troubles early in his association with <i>The Review</i>. One of Dartmouth's most intense racial controversies occurred when writers for <i>The Review</i> raised concerns about a visiting black music instructor  who used very offensive and racist terms in his lectures.  These principled jounalists stood up for their beliefs. But the admhistration's reaction was to defend the offending professor and <b>suspend the <i>Review</i> journalisls from school</b>.
Campus liberals, fomenting a rage against <i>The Review</i>, branded the publication racist.<p>

The heat was on Pritchett, as the first black editor of <i>The Review</i>, he took a stand against the faculty and administration in defense of nis fellow staff members.  He received anonymous death threats
and became an object of scorn by leftist organizaaons. Not surprisingly, these tactics fed his disgust with liberalism and encouraged him to continue working with <i>The Review</i>. In his senior year, as Editor-in Chief, he was a vocal articulate advocate for conservative principles.<p>

<center>
<h4>Pritchett Brings <i>Dartmouth Review</i> Experience to Institute's Student Publications School</h4>
</center>

In 1983, Leadership Instiitute President Morton Blackwell founded the Institute's Student Publications School to train young conservatives how to start their own independent conservative newspapers. The best model was and remains <i>The Dartmouth Review</i>. Kevin Pritchett now serves on the
Institute's Student publications School faculty.<p>

According to students, Pribchett gives a great lecture on investigative reporting. Young joumalists learn how to expose the many injustices which occur every day on college campuses.<p>	

Students running papers on their campuses need to remember that their papers will be more effective if they reveal the idiosyncrasies of the respective administrations and campus groups, says Pritchet. The most effective news is politically active and effects change.<p>

Plitchett continue, The Leadership Institute's Student Publications School teaches students to do just that. It is especially good for students just starting a paper, and it also gives good direction on how to
keep a paper going.<p>

In the summer of 1988, Pritchen served as an intern for Institute Preddent Morton Blackwell. I admire Morton Blackwell for his interest and dedication over a couple of decades of working with young people, says Pritchett. Very few, if any, people have the desire to be involve h the training of young
activists to battle liberals in government and other areas..<p>

<center>
<h4>Pritchett Hired as Writer for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i></h4>
</center>

Also while at Dartmouth, Pritchett worked as an editorial  page intern for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> for three summers, where he gained valuable experience writing editorial comrnentary. Afler graduation, he continued for two years to write for <i>The Journal</i> full-time in the business and editorial departments. There, Pritchett polished a writing style worthy of envy from his peers. Pritchett plans to return to journalism as a conservative voice after working on Capitol Hill.<p>

<center>
<h4>Pritchett Now a Top Aide to Senate Majority Whip</h4>
</center>

As Floor Assistant to the Majority Whip, Kevin Pritchett is in a prime position to assist not only Senator Trent Lott effectively but also other U.S. Senators.  Pritchett helps write good legislation and fights for its
passage.<p>

Pritchett said the first few months of the Senate were busy with much of their schedule dictated by the House. He doesn't expect the next four months bo be any different. Although the Senate was not bound by the Contract with Amenca, I did a lot of work this year on bills that occurred because
of it, says Pribchett. Social issues did not come up much with the Contract, so I see them coming up in the next few months. Although, I thtnk there will definitely be a big push on the budget.<p>

The challenge will be to get a bill through the Senate which will balance the budget  in the next seven yeas.<p>

With Capibl Hill insiders like Kevin Pritchett working behind the scenes, good public policy can be put into law.<p>

With his expert  knowledge on such a wide range of topics, Pritchett has found himself committed to another ongoing task as a commentator on Paul Weyrich's NET-Political NewsTalk Network show, <i>Youngbloods</i>.<p>

Youngbloods ia a call-in talk show of both conservatives and liberals in the twenty-something age range designed to counteract the stereotypical view of the MTV generation with a group of young commentators who discuss political issues.<p>

Pritchett finds <i>Youngbloods</i> as a way to help young adults express their views and be taken seriously.  We talk about issues that affect everything, and what government is doing or should be doing, says Pritchett.<p>

<center>
<h4>Institute Graduate Ahead of the Game</h4>
</center>

Because of his many activities during and after college, Kevin Pritchett has strengthened his conservative views and become a leader at the forefront of the conservative movement.  The type of guidance and instruction Pritchett got working for Institute President Morton Blackwell, <i>The Dartmouth Review</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and U.S. Senator Trent Lott has definitely put him ahead of the political game.<p>

Thanks to the generous support of its many thousands of committed donors, the Leadership Institute has been able to train more than 10,000 young conservatives since its founding.  With continued support, the Leadership Institute can train and place many more conservatives like Kevin Pritchett.<p><p>

<title>New Student Publications Director Leads Free Speech Fight</title>
</head>

<body>

<center>
<h2>New Student Publications Director Leads Free Speech Fight</h2>
</center>

Today's university  climate is alarmingly hoslile toward the traditional  belief on which this nation was founded.<p>

There is plenty of evidence something is amiss in American education
Yale University, long a revered academic institution, lost a huge donation, $20 million, because the liberal faculty administration refused to implement the donor's requested program to emphasize Western Civilization.<p>

There is a fight under way for the heart and soul of America's academic institutions<p>

And Pat Moodey, the Leadership Institute's Student Publications School Director, is no stranger to the  controversy. <p>

In 1991 at Carnegie Mellon University, Mooney was at the center of controversy when he took a principled stand against the liberal campus establishment.   And in two separate, outrageous incidents, Mooney was punished by school officials for his refusal to conforrn to the liberals' far-out political correctness agenda.<p>

<center>
<h4>Insfitute Graduate Sticks to His Strong Moral Beliefs</h4>
</center>

Pat Mooney grew up in Frederick, Maryland.  He says about his upbringing, "Since my mother was forced to flee Cuba, I was raised in a very pro-capitalist, Catholic home. We understood sacrifice and the value of freedom."<p>

Mooney chose to attend Carnegie Mellon for its excellent academic reputation. But he soon learned the university had a liberal agenda to prornote instead.<p>

In October, 1992, he attended the Leadership Institute's Student Publications School learn how to cornbat the campus Left and to start up his own independent conservative newspaper.<p>

<center>
<h4>Graduate Fired for His Beliefs</h4>
</center>

In Mooney's freshman year at Carnegie Mellon, he worked as a Resident Advisor in his dormitory. His.supervisor was impressed with his perforrnance and invited him to continue his job in his sophomore year.<p>

Before the beginning of his sophomore year, Mooney attended a week of training
for RA's.  The controversy began there.<p>

Mooney's area coordinator for student housing passed out pins which promoted
hornosexual rights.  When Mooney declined to wear one, she told him, "You have no choice."<p>

Mooney refused to violate his religious convictions.<p>

So he was fired.<p>

The university's attempt to force him to submit to their liberal  propaganda was an
obvious atlack on Mooney's freedom of religion and speech. So he took the university to court in a federal lawsuit.<p>

After over two years of litigation, Carnegie Mellon acknowledged defeat and
offered Mooney a setflement he couldn't refuse.<p>

Mooney remarks, "I am very, very pleased with the outcome."<p>

During the debate on Mooney's dismissal, the liberal campus paper blasted him as a "homophobic bigot".  Mooney realized the ideological vacuum on carnpus was allowing the Left to control the debate. So, with the knowledge he gained from the Leadership Institute, he founded <i>The Phoenix</i>, a conservaffve student publication at CMU, in his junior year.<p>

As a voice for the conservative views on campus, Mooney became a favorite target of radical left  wing attacks.<p>


<center>
<h4>Money Attacked for Protesting Liberal Sllander</h4>
</center>

In his senior year, Mooney was disgusted by a poster from a carnpus gay-rights group which attacked the Catholic church.  The poster defamed Cardinal John O'Connor and compared him to a  condom with the slur, "Know your scumbags."<p>

A visiting professor argued the poster deserved the university's support.  When Mooney dared to question the decency of this bigoted and hateful attack on Catholics, he was accused of haras ment.<p>

For refusing to give in to the liberal adminislrators, Mooney was attacked as a homophobic religious fanatic. The liberal campus newspaper immediately defended the professor's position.  And the Dean of Student Affairs advised the professor to press charges against Mooney.<p>

<center>
<h4>Kangaroo Court Passes Sentence on Preposterous Charges</h4>
</center>

In the kangaroo court which followed, Pat Mooney was faced with possible suspenion and even expulsion.  Mooney was also charged with violating the university's confidentiality rules because he spoke with the press about the ordeal.  When Mooney's lawyer explained his client had no knowledge of these rules and inquired about the universty's confidentiality laws, he was told, "They're confidential."<p>

Furthermore, Mooney was officially gagged during the deliberations of the disciplinary committee.  His lawyer argued the university provided no due process and questioned their right to threaten his free speech rights.<p>

The committee ruled Mooney did not harass the visiting professor and dismissed
the charge along with two others. It did, however, find him guilty of violating the free
speech rights of the group which posted the flier by removing it.  His sentence was 
indefinite probation.<p>

Pat Mooney successfully appealed the decision tothe university president, who reduced it to a warning.<p>

<center>
<h4>Mooney's Injustice Received Nationwide Coverage</h4>
</center>
 
The case garnered the media's attention, includng the <i>Washington Times</i> and <i>U.S. News and World Report</i>.  Pat Mooney was widely hailed for refusing to succumb to the vicious forces of political correctness which have captured so many campuses today.<p>

Now, Mooney looks back with great satisfaction at the outcome.  He used the skills he devloped at Leadership Institute schools to gain support for his fight and ultimately to win the battle.<p>

Mooney has great faith in the potential of independent conservative campus newspapers on campuses where the news would otherwise be one-sided.<p>
	
<h4>Conservatlve College Journalists Have Great Power  In Their Camus Papers</h4>

As the Leadership Institute's Publications School Director, Mooney is in a positon  influence greatly the debate campuses today.  His job is to encourage the proliferation of conservative college papers.<p>

"Conservative journalisls," Mooney observes, "bring to light the scandals and excesses of liberal admhistrators and college professors who normally hide behind the cloak of academic freedom."<p>

He attributes his perseverance to his faith, guidance and friends.  He is the first to say the training he received from the Leadership Institute gave him the tools and connections to win  his fight against the liberal campus establishment.<p>

Every year the Leadership lnstitute trains many college activists to battle the double standards invoked by politically correct university adminstrators.  The Institute's Student Publictions School has now trained 785 young conservatives.  One hundred conservative campus papers publish at American universities.<p>

With the generouis and faithful support of Institute donors, every year more and more activists are trained to defend the rights and principles which Americans hold dear.<p><p>

<h2>"Just Keep Throwing Us Back in That Briarpatch"</h2>
</center>

Readers of Building Leadership may be interested to know the 1994 "Contract with America" began at  Leadership Institute President Morton Blackwell's cabin, "The Briarpatch," in Madison County, Virginia.  House Majoritty Leader Dick Armey made this announcement live on C-Span at the Sixth Annual Conservative Leadership Confrence last December, 1994.<p>

"We firsty began planning our strategy for a Republican Party majority last year down at the Briarpatch, which is Morton's mountain homoe.  And he knew that our reason for being there was to start working on the chapter and verse of what  is it we must know ... so we can get the transition completed by January Fourth," said Armey.<p>

"I think we did a fairly good job of training our minds and contemplating the problems, understanding, anticipating, getting ready for the development of the transition plan.  And I don't know whether it was the woods or the fresh air.  You know, sometimes you get out in the woods of Virginia and find yourself almost giddy with expectations..."<p>

"Morton, let me just say -- just keep throwing us back in that Briarpatch."<p><p>

<H2><CENTER>INSTITUTE FOR CHILDREN</CENTER></H2>

<H3><CENTER>DIRECTOR'S PROFILE</H3></CENTER>

<P>
Conna Craig is a Director and President of the Institute for Children. 
Ms. Craig brings to the Institute a solid commitment to promoting effective 
and humane approaches to substitute care. She advises governors, other policy 
makers and opinion leaders on practical steps that must be taken to 
restructure foster care and adoption and help tens of thousands of children 
find permanent families.

<P>
Born and raised in Northern California, Ms. Craig graduated with honors 
from Harvard College. At Harvard she wrote her honors thesis on the 
relationship between research and legislation on child abuse.  In the 
course of her research, she traveled across the United States, meeting 
not only with experts in child protective services but also with children 
in foster care, group homes and shelters. She met many children who, 
temporarily or permanently separated from their families of origin, 
languished for months or even years in state-run care. Her deep and 
abiding interest in discovering how best to serve these children led 
her to investigate how other countries approach substitute care. Ms. 
Craig has lived in Japan as a Harvard Graduate Fellow; there she studied 
child abuse and related issues. She has traveled throughout the world to 
research foster care and adoption practices; most recently, she has advised 
legislators and scholars in China, Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea and the 
United Kingdom.

<P>
Ms. Craig's commitment to rebuilding foster care and adoption is rooted 
in her belief that children get a better start in life with a family and a 
loving, permanent home and that indeed every child deserves such a foundation. 
Adopted into a family that has to date cared for 110 foster children, Ms. 
Craig has spent her entire life involved in and very much aware of the 
"client" side of the foster care equation.

<H2><CENTER>INSTITUTE FOR CHILDREN</CENTER></H2>

<H3><CENTER>CURRENT PROGRAMS - SUMMER 1995</CENTER></H3>


<P>The <B>INSTITUTE FOR CHILDREN, INC.</B> creates and promotes innovative 
policies on foster care and adoption in America. What makes these 
policies "innovative" is a shift of focus away from building 
bureaucracies and toward helping children. The well-being of many 
thousands of youngsters depends on such innovation: across the nation 
50,000 children who could be adopted today are languishing in state-run 
foster care. The Institute for Children, a private, charitable organization, 
is reshaping foster care and adoption to make sure every child has a 
permanent, loving home.


<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Institute for Children is advising leaders. The Institute' s 
starting-point strategy plan, "What a Governor Can Do to Make Foster 
Care and Adoption Work," was one of the driving forces behind Governor 
William Weld' s November 1993 initiative, Assignment Adoption - A Home 
for Every Child.
</UL>
<I>The initiative has expedited adoption for many Massachusetts children: 
the number of 	foster child adoptions 
in the state has increased by 47% in one year, from 725 in 1993 to 
1,068 in 1994. The plan is now being studied in other states.
</I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Institute is extending its reach to governors across the nation and 
 to federal leaders, including members of the U.S. Senate, as today's 
 policy makers launch adoption and foster care reform.
<P>
<LI>The Institute is addressing urgent questions about foster care in its 
upcoming report, "21 Questions on Foster Care," to be co-published with 
the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis.
<P>
<LI>The Institute is creating blueprints for change. With the Reason 
Foundation (Los Angeles), the Institute will soon co-publish 
"Private-sector approaches to foster care," a how-to guide for state 
and local governments. The guide assesses the results of model programs 
in five states.
<P>
<LI>The Institute for Children is changing the rules that keep children in 
foster care for too long. The Institute is working with the Institute for 
Justice, a public interest litigation group in Washington, D.C., to develop 
targeted lawsuits brought on behalf of foster children who are legally free 
to be adopted yet -- because of regulatory and practice barriers -- are 
forced to spend months or even years waiting for permanent adoptive families.
<P>
<LI>The Institute' s president, Conna Craig, has been asked by a prominent 
publisher to write a book on foster care in America. The book will examine 
the history, scope, complexities, outcomes and costs of state-run substitute 
care. The purpose of the book is to add depth to the debate on how to best 
care for America' s parentless children and, ultimately, to spark the types 
of policy changes that will wrest children from long-term state care and 
allow them to grow up in permanent families.
</UL>

<P>
<I>The Institute for Children, Inc. is a 5O1(c)(3) nonprofit, charitable organization founded in March 1993.</I>

<TITLE>ABIC - Note about Senate Term Limits Vote</TITLE>

<CENTER><H3>A Note About the Senate Term Limits Vote in April, 1996</H3></center>
<P>
In April, 1996, the Senate debated the Term Limits Constitutional Amendment.  During the days of April 19th, 22nd and 23rd, Senators took to the floor for a hearty discussion on the merits of the issue.  
<P>
Unfortunately, due to lack of Democratic support, the amendment never came to floor vote.  Instead, the Senate had a "cloture" vote which means they voted on whether to cut off debate so that the Senate could move forward to a full vote on the Amendment itself.  It takes 60 votes to cut off debate on any issue.  
<P>
On April 23rd, 1996, every single Republican Senator voted "yes" on cloture to go forward with the vote on the term limits amendment.  Because only five Democrats voted "yes", the cloture vote failed by a vote of 58-42.  The Senate was unable to cut off debate and therefore never voted on the actual amendment.
<P>
However, it is good to note that 58 Senators, a majority of the Senate, voted <EM>with</EM> term limits supporters.  While not all of these Senators may have voted "yes" on the actual amendment if it had come to a floor vote, this is nonetheless a great showing for the term limits issue in its first time at bat in the Senate.

<TITLE>ABIC - Will Rogers and the 1920's Political Conventions</TITLE>

<BR><BR>
<CENTER><H3>Will Rogers and the 1920's Political Conventions</H3></CENTER>
<P>
A little background for those of you who have forgotten your high school civics...

<CENTER><H4>The 1920 Convention:<BR>
Republicans in Chicago - Democrats in San Francisco</H4></CENTER>
<P>
In 1920, President Woodrow Wilson (D) was coy about whether he would run for reelection as he had had a stroke the year before.  So the Presidency was virtually an open seat and there were no obvious leaders in the presidential campaign in either party.  The primaries produced no clear frontrunners in either party.
<P>
Leading the race on the Republican side at the beginning of the convention were Gen. Leonard Wood (endorsed by the late Teddy Roosevelt), Illinois Gov. Frank Lowden, California Sen. Hiram Johnson, and dark horse candidate Sen. Warren Harding (Ohio).  As an example of how things have truly changed, it is interesting to note (in the days before radio and television) that as the Republicans came into the 1920 convention with no clear nominee, it took 10 ballots over two days (and some backroom dealing) to finally nominate Sen. Harding as the GOP presidential candidate!  (And if you think that's bad, just you wait... )  The legend of the "smoke-filled" room was started by a <EM>New York Times</EM> report during this convention.
<P>
The Democratic situation was even more tumultuous.  After 35 ballots lasting several days (!), they finally settled on Ohio Gov. James M. Cox.  Other candidates included William Gibbs McAdoo, former Secretary of the Treasury and son-in-law of President Wilson; and U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer.  McAdoo never fully campaigned for the nomination out of respect for his father-in-law, who never formally withdrew from the race.  Thus, after more backroom dealing and manipulation by all the campaigns, Cox finally emerged as the Democratic nominee.
<P>
Will Rogers was not physically present at either of the 1920 conventions.  To give the impression that he was privy to "inside" information, he pretended that he was in the company of two very powerful convention watchers: Senator Boies Penrose (R-PA) during the Republican convention and President Wilson during the Democratic convention.  Both men were ill (Penrose more so than Wilson) and generally unable to attend the conventions themselves.  As there was no radio or television, Rogers and his "pals" supposedly were kept up-to-date on the proceedings via the telephone wires.

<CENTER><H4>The 1924 Conventions:<BR>
Republicans in Cleveland - Democrats in New York City</H4></CENTER>
<P>
The 1924 Republican convention was much less interesting.  President Harding (R) had died the year before, making Vice President Calvin Coolidge the chief executive.  As such, President Coolidge was the only candidate nominated at the convention.  The debate really focused on the vice-presidential nomination.  Coolidge supported Sen. William Borah (ID), who refused the offer.  The convention actually nominated Gov. Lowden (see 1920) on the second ballot but then a letter was read from the governor also declining the offer.  This threw the confused convention into recess--it finally decided on Charles G. Dawes in the third ballot.
<P>
The 1924 Democratic convention was one of the most divisive in history and echos of it can still be felt today.  Two frontrunners had emerged from the primaries: William G. McAdoo of California (see 1920) and New York Gov. Alfred E. Smith.  Each appealed to vastly different constituencies in different regions of the country.  McAdoo, a "dry" (supporter of Prohibition), appealed to small-town, rural America, especially Democrats in the South and West.  To the people in the cities of the Northeast Smith, a Catholic and an immigrant, represented the fulfillment of the American Dream.
  The convention went through a tortuous 103 ballots over the course of two weeks before both candidates threw in the towel and the convention finally ended up nominating John W. Davis of West Virginia.  The Democrats lost in November.
<P>
The 1924 conventions were the first that Rogers actually covered in person.  After attending the Republican convention, which took place first, he opened with the Ziegfield Follies in Atlantic City on June 18th.  When the Follies moved to New York later in the month, he covered the Democratic convention in two ways: with his daily column during the day and in his on-stage act in the evening, running back and forth between the two venues.  In his columns, he often compared one "show" to the other!
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><H4>The 1928 Conventions:<BR>
Republicans in Kansas City - Democrats in Houston</H4></CENTER>
<P>
Both of the 1928 conventions went fairly smoothly.  President Coolidge had announced in 1927 while on vacation that he wouldn't run for reelection.  Herbert Hoover immediately began to campaign for the nomination and did his homework so well that he was nominated at the convention on the first ballot.
<P>
After the disasterous 1924 convention, the Democrats were united in their commitment to avoid division and rancor.  Alfred Smith had been reelected governor of New York by a wide margin and enjoyed support of most northern states and some western ones.  As William McAdoo had no interest in running, Smith was the strongest candidate.  Franklin Roosevelt put Smith's name into nomination at the convention as he had in 1924 and Smith was eventually chosen as the Democratic nominee on the first ballot.  A southerner, Sen. Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas, was chosen as the vice presidential nominee to "balance" the ticket (becoming the first southerner on a presidential ticket since the Civil War).
<P>
Rogers' fame had only increased over the years.  His daily column (now written all year long) was a staple on American breakfast tables and many talked about him for national office, only half-jokingly.  <EM>Life </EM>Magazine published a series of articles promoting Rogers for president--the nominee of the "Bunkless" party--fearing the campaign would be "a colossal waste of time, for those actively engaged in it and for those of us who have to read about it in the newspapers and listen to it over the radio."
<P>
<CENTER>***</CENTER>
<P>
Will Rogers' observations of the conventions became a stabilizing force for many Americans following the proceedings, providing much-needed comic relief.  A June 1928 column in the <EM>Richmond Times-Dispatch</EM> said: "There is Will Rogers, the most sensible man on the floor, laughing at everybody, and yet seeing the human worth in it all..."  The Decatur (Illinois) <EM>Review</EM> called Rogers a "national institution" and said he "poked fun at both the Republican and Democratic conventions, but no dispatches from the conventions have been read with more interest than those sent by Rogers.  Few if any correspondents have cut as deeply into the real facts as has Rogers...  His jibes and jolts are taken as humor, but they have a way of staying with you."

<center>General Thoughts on the Convention and the Delegates</center>
<P>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<p><br>
<b>1920</b>
<p>
<ul><li>I said, "President (Wilson) (see <a href="/abic/rogersbkgrd.html.cgi">background</a>), some of the candidates are running out of money out in Frisco and are paying the delegates off with I.O.U.'s.  Why do the Democrats nominate so long before they ballot?"  He said, "I don't know, Will, unless it is so the delegates can get a chance to look around a bit before they sell."
</ul><p>
<b>1924</b>
<p><ul><li>
Now both shows (convention and Ziegfeld Follies) open Tuesday.  The Democrats go to Madison Square Garden, where Ringling Brothers' Circus always plays, and we go to the Amsterdam Theatre, a beautiful theatre consecrated solely to Art...  It's the first time in the theatrical history of New York City where two shows of equal magnitude both opened on the same night.
</ul>
<ul><li>
The city is doing all it can to make (conventioneers') stay here remembered.  The Mayor issued orders that no delegate was to be robbed until after the convention was called to order.
<li>
My home state of Oklahoma got here and wanted to parade the whole town on their way to the hotel and they haven't found them yet.
<li>
Tomorrow is what they call Credential Day.  Every delegate has to show he is a bona fide delegate with a vote before a Tammany man is allowed to start saying, "Well, here's how we get you."
<li>
Cordell Hull, the Chairman, announced that Cardinal Gibbons would offer the opening prayer.  He was informed by some Republican that Cardinal Gibbons had been dead for three years, but that he might prevail on Cardinal Hayes to act instead...  Hull evidently knows more about politics than the ministry...  I suppose they will have Ben Franklin lead us in prayer tomorrow.
<li>
Talk about civilization!  Why, if they ever took a sanity test at a political convention 98 percent would be removed to an asylum.
<li>
Well, I saw something yesterday that for stupidity, lack of judgment, nonsensicality, unexcitement, uselessness and childishness has anything I've ever seen beaten.  It was the Democratic National Convention.
<li>
One guy from Montana, Maloney, forgot his speech and didn't say anything.  He was the hit of the day.  They applauded for five minutes.
<li>
The Chairman of a State delegation is a man that announces how many votes his State cast.  The qualification for this job seems to be for a man that can't count.  After he has announced the votes, they poll the delegates and he sees for himself just how near he guessed.
<li>
Prohibition has certainly raised the price of democracy.  Votes that you used to be able to buy at conventions with a half dozen nickel beers are now thinking nothing of asking a case of Scotch...  I guess there are some men here who don't spend anything for delegates and it is easy to see who they are.  They are the ones with no delegates...
<li>
I suggested to Tex Rickard, who runs the Garden, that he turn the water on during the balloting.  I think the delegates would welcome a bath while here.
<li>
In years to come children will say, "Father, were you in the big war?" and father will say, "No, son, but I went through the New York convention." ...  In six years, the people of the United States will be paying a bonus to the delegates who survive this convention.
<li>
Another reason I know it can't last much longer is that the women who sit in front, on the speakers' platform, are about to run out of different hats to wear.  They would rather lose the election than wear the same hat twice.
<li>
The Democratic Convention was apparently beginning to get humorous even to its leaders, so the only way they could stop it being funny was to adjourn it.
</ul><p>
<b>1928</b>
<p>
<ul><li>Some man prayed...  He read his prayer, ending with the Lord's Prayer.  He read that too.  The reason he read that, he may have had a different version of it for this occasion...  I am going to keep going to these conventions till I find a preacher that can pray from memory and practice...
<li>
Well, after he had finished asking for guidance...why, a lady sang, and How!... She opened up with the "Star Spangled Banner."  She had a dandy voice and she knew the song, she didn't read it.  People applauded her for knowing the words...
<li>
The breakfast was billed for 9 o'clock on the roof of the Rice Hotel and on account of the elevators we all arrived for a lovely luncheon.  Everybody talks about "what the country needs."  What this country needs is more elevators...  If you get a place in one you don't like to give it up, so you just keep it, and half of Texas is just riding up and down.
<li>
Well I have finished my mission at conventions.  Finally a preacher prayed last night from memory and not from manuscript...

<P>
<center><h3>Politics, the Parties and the Platform</h3></center>
<p>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<p><br>
<b>1920</b>
<p><ul><li>
The Democrats are investigating the Republican slush funds and if they find where it's coming from they want theirs...  
<li>
Congress is investigating these slush funds.  So that means nothing will be done about it.
<li>
I said, "Mr. President, I read your platform and it says we advocate generosity to soldiers, but don't want to tax the people more.  How are you going to do that?  Let the soldiers float a loan among themselves?"
<li>
I went on: "I see the platform says you advocate free speech.  I don't see what good that would do.  Your parties have called each other everything I ever Heard."
</ul>
<ul><li>I said, "Why don't you declare yourself one way or the other on the liquor question?"  He said, "Well, we can't.  If we declare wet we lose the bootlegger vote."
<li>
I said, "There is somebody praying."  He said, "yes, even a Democrat needs a little religion every four years."
</ul><p>
<b>1924</b>
<p><ul><li>
The building is literally lined with flags.  I could never understand the exact connection between the flag and a bunch of politicians.
<li>
(T)he next box I stopped at was Barney Baruch's.  I guess he is about the only scandalously rich man that is not a Republican.
<li>
Well, it was 6:30 and they had just read the platform.  I had it before me, forty-five pages.  If it came out in the open on every question and told just where they stood, they could have saved themselves, not only forty-two pages of paper, but perhaps their election in November.  When you straddle a thing it takes a long time to explain it...  It favors fixing everything Republicans have ruined and keeping everything they haven't...
<li>
Another rule reads, no money shall change hands among buyers or sellers while on the floor of the convention...  This is purely a Democratic rule; the Republicans have no such restrictions.  That is why they re the most prosperous party...  The Government has an income tax man watching all transactions.  In selling you have got to figure on a tax.
<li>
I have only one regret in regard to Mr. Broun selecting me for his praise.  That is, he is on a New York paper.  And New York City's leading papers have been so universally wrong in all that they have predicted, that it is almost fatal to have them support you.
</ul><p>
<b>1928</b>
<p><ul><li>
Been here three days, haven't heard a cheer, a band, an argument, or even an echo...  I wouldn't stay for the thing, but I know that a Democrat is just like a baby, if it's hollering and making a lot of noise, there is nothing serious the matter with it; but if it's quiet and still and don't pay much attention to anything, why that's when it's really dangerous.
<li>
But there is bound to be some comedy coming, and here is the reason: Since prohibition was unearthed nine years ago, there has only been one argument invented that a politician when he is cornered can duck behind, and that is the old applesauce one: "I am for law enforcement."  It don't mean anything, and never will mean anything.  It would take practically a lunatic to announce: "I am against law enforcement."
<li>
Now the Republicans held their convention first and naturally they grabbed this lone tree to hide behind.  Now that leaves the Democrats out in the open.  If they say anything about prohibition, they either got to say, "It out to be modified," or "It shouldn't be modified."  They can't duck behind the old alibi tree, "I am for law enforcement," for there is only room for one in back and a Republican is already hiding there.
<li>
So all the boys are up against here is just these few simple problems.  "We want Smith., for he is the only man we got a chance with."  "We wish he was dry instead of wet.  But, as he is not, we got to make the most of it.  We got to dress him up so he will look wet in the cities and dry in the country."
<li>
A band of women hailed me yesterday and wanted me to write something about helping them get "equal rights."  So I told them I thought myself that they had too many, and it was mighty nice of them to want to split some of them with the men.
<li>
The whole talk down here is wet and dry; the delegates just can't wait till the next bottle is opened to discuss it.  Prohibition is running about a quart to the argument here now.
<li>
Tomorrow it starts--the biggest show in the world...  The actors have had four years to think up new things to call the Republicans, and it will be worth the money, for Democrats are the only race that can have arguments, even when they agree.
<li>
(Sen.) Joe Robinson (Ark.) disposed of the prohibition problem this morning easier than any one I had ever heard.  He said: "There are wets and drys both in the Democratic Party.  I don't think we should do anything to lose the drys' support and I think we should keep the goodwill of the wets."
<li>
Franklin Roosevelt, a fine and wonderful man, who has devoted his life to nominating Al Smith, did his act from memory.  Franklin Roosevelt could have gotten far in the Democratic Party himself, but he has this act all perfected and don't like to go to the trouble of learning something else.  So he just seems satisfied going through life nominating Al Smith...
<li>
The only part I didn't agree with is where (Roosevelt) said that Al was "good to women, and children and dumb animals," and he insinuated that the Republican President and nominee were not.  Now Franklin, you are wrong about the Republicans and the dumb animals.  They just thrive on dumb animals.  They are like Lincoln with the poor.  They must love em, for they have so many of them in the party, and I even believe that the Republicans like children, not perhaps as children, but they are the material of which voters are made in a few years.  Also, I believe the Republicans would be kind to em, just so they would grow into manhood quicker.
<li>
I have heard so much at this convention about "getting back to the old Jeffersonian principles" that being an amateur, I am in doubt as to why they <i>left them</i> in the first place.
<li>
They are stalling with the platform, and when it is ready there is not a wire walker in America that can stand on it.

<P>
<center><h3>The Vice Presidential Nomination</h3></center>
<p>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<b>1920</b>
<p>
"Mr. President," said I, "in all these years of worry about what to do to get rid of (William Jennings) Bryan, how is it that none of you thought of making him vice president?"
<p>
<b>1924</b><br> 
<i>(This is Will Rogers' column from the June 26, 1924, edition of the </i>New York Times<i>.)
</i><p>
The following is one of the bravest statements made in a political decade:
<p>
In the entire three years of preparation by the Democratic Party to groom some man for this present crisis there has never been a mention of a man to run for Vice President.
<p>
You see, every man that wants to run at all wants to be President, and a man would take his life in his hands to go and ask one of those fellows if he was willing to run for the second place.
<p>
It's bad enough to be nominated on that ticket for President, much less Vice President.
<p>
So I just got off and held a caucus with myself and said somebody has got to be sacrificed for the sake of party harmony.  I hereby and hereon put myself in nomination, and to save some other man being humiliated by having to put me in nomination, why, I will just nominate myself.
<p>
Here is an enclosed certificate to show that this is bona fide:
<p>
I, Dr. Isador Moskowitz of 234 East Mott Street, have examined the enclosed patient, Mr. Will Rogers, and find him to be of sound mind and body (in fact, sounder in body than in mind).  This certifies that if he wants to run for Vice President I see no way of preventing it.
<p>
Signed, Isador Moskowitz, whose doctor's commission expires June 1, 1925.
<p>
So I, Will Rogers, of Claremore, Oklahoma; Hollywood, California, and 42nd Street and Broadway, New York, do hereby step right out and declare myself, not only as a receptive but an anxious candidate for the husband's position (meaning second) on the forthcoming Democratic ticket.
<p>
On first hearing this it may sound like a joke, but when I relate to you some of the qualifications which I possess, why, I think any fair-minded man will give me serious consideration.
<p>
But the trouble is there are not any fair-minded men in politics.
<p>
In the first place, they have got to nominate a farmer who understands the farmers' condition.  Well, I got two farms in Oklahoma, both mortgaged, so no man knows their condition better than I do.
<p>
He has also to be a man from the West.  Well, if a man came from 25 feet further West than I lived last year, he would have to be a fish in the Pacific Ocean.
<p>
Dawes was nominated on the Republican ticket on account of his profanity.  Now I have never tried cussin' in public, but I guess I could learn to get used to it before a crowd.
<p>
Another big reason why I should be nominated is I am not a Democrat.
<p>
Another still bigger reason why I should be nominated is I am not a Republican.
<p>
I am just progressive enough to suit the dissatisfied.
<p>
And lazy enough to be a Stand Patter.
<p>
Oil has never touched me.  The reason I know it never has is, I drilled a well on my farm in Oklahoma, and I never even touched it, much less oil touching me.
<p>
I never worked for a big corporation.
<p>
When the President can't go anywhere, why, the Vice President has to go and speak or eat for him.
<p>
Now, I could take in all the dinners, for I am a fair eater.
<p>
I could say, "I am sorry the President can't come, but he had pressing business."  Of course, I wouldn't tell the reason why he didn't come, so I am just good enough a liar to be a good Vice President.
<p>
I am not much of an after-dinner speaker, but I could learn two stories, one for dinner where ladies were present, and one for where they were not.
<p>
Of course I have no dress suit.  The Government would have to furnish me a dress suit.  If I went to a dinner in a rented one, they would mistake me for a Congressman.
<p>
I know I can hear a lot of you all say, "Yes, Will, you would make a good Vice President, but suppose something happened to the President?"
<p>
Well, I would do just like Mr. Coolidge--I would go in there and keep still and say nothing.  He is the first President to discover that what the American people want is to be let alone.
<p>
It won't take much to launch the boom.  We will wait till about tomorrow, and when some dark or even light horse is eliminated, we can take their headquarters, and buy their buttons and badges cheap.
<p>
P.S.  I was born in a Log Cabin.

Yesterday I asked President Wilson if he was going to listen to the rest of the nominating speeches over the phone.<br>
He said, "Will, do you want me to be sick again?"
<li>
I said, "I see the boy says he don't want it.  You say you don't want it.  The Republicans this year consider it an honor to be nominated, but the Democrats seem to consider it a duty."
</ul><p>
<b>1924</b>
<p><ul><li>
Chairman Hull pulled another beaut.  He read what the convention was gathered here for: "That it was to nominate a man to run for President, and take any other drastic means necessary."
<li>
Thursday they start balloting and as fast as a Presidential candidate is eliminated he has to leave the hall.  I look for the building to be empty by Thursday night.
<li>
Someone after saying fourteen of these, "the man I am about to name" finally decided to name Governor Ritchie of Maryland as a possible President.  Well, Maryland broke out and next to Smith or McAdoo it was be far the next most foolish.<br>
Only Maryland and Delaware were in on this demonstration but if they had as many votes as they have noise he would be our next vetoer.<br>
Maryland has a flag that looks as if they were advertising a Turkish cigarette.<br>
They kept marching by, trying to get the District of Columbia to join them, not knowing, of course, that the District has no votes.  But one more emblem would have broken up their Turkish flag color scheme.
<li>
Kansas had a man who is a Governor that they were "about to name" for about forty minutes before even the speaker who was nominating him could think of his name.  It was Davis.  This race will be clogged up with Davises before the end of the week.
<li>
Well, they have been balloting all day at the Democratic side show at the Garden, for that is what some misguided people think is the nominating place.<br>
The real nomination is taking place in a room at some hotel with less than six men present.<br>
And when it is known it will be as big a surprise to those delegates as it will be to you out in Arizona, and you will have just as much to do with it as they will have had.
</ul><p>
<b>1928</b>
<p><ul><li>
I knew Kansas would furnish the comedy.  What Georgia was to the Republican convention, why Kansas was to the Democrats.  Some fellow talked for two hours, nobody knew who he was.  You couldn't tell who he was talking for or against, and when he finally finished and mentioned his man we were more in the dark than before.<br>
If I had been him out of respect for my candidate after I finished my speech, I wouldn't have mentioned who it was.  No one would ever suspected and perhaps a good man's name would have been saved.

<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<p>
<b>1928</b>
<p>
Well, it's been a great time.  These Democrats are a great bunch.  Just as happy as if they were working.  Houston, the police, the people, everything, was great, and so was Kansas City.  I tell you it was two fine conventions.
<p>
But I have looked at enough badges and heard enough speeches that if I ever hear another man say, "The grand old Republican party" or, "Back to the Jeffersonian principles," I will go to the gallows with a clear conscience.  I just want to go back home and go to sleep for a month.
<p>
All the speakers said "we are making history."  Well, I don't want to be disrespectful to either party, but I am just tired of seeing history being made...
<p>
Good-bye, Houston, take care of yourself.  But don't ever bid for another one of these things.  You might get it...
<p>
Good night, everybody!  I hope the next election is a draw, and they have to run it off.  This is Graham McNamee and Captain White <i>(see note below)</i> signing off, and swearing off from all conventions.
<p>
Come on airplane.  Let's show these delegates how to travel!
<p><p>

<h5>Note: Graham McNamee and Andrew White were two of the first radio announcers who covered the conventions of 1924 and 1928.  McNamee worked for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and White was one of the founders of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS).</h5><P>

<center>General Thoughts on the Convention, the Delegates</center>

<P>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<CENTER><H3>General Convention</H3></CENTER>
<P>
1920:<UL>
<LI>I am being paid to write something funny about this Republican convention.  That's funny... All a fellow has to do to write something funny on a Republican convention is just write what happened.
<LI>When (California GOP Governor) Hiram Johnson arrived in Chicago, he bowed and started to make a speech, when someone reminded him that the demonstration was for Babe Ruth...   On Johnson's arrival he pulled the old gag which is always good: "Friends, if I am elected I will be for the common people."  Yea, bo!
<LI>I asked Pen: "What do you think of Dr. Leonard Wood?"  Boies said: "It will take more than a doctor to do this country any good the shape it's in.  What we need is a magician."
<LI>Some leading Republicans were against having a prayer this year as they didn't think it necessary.  But to add variety to an otherwise monotonous show--they decided to leave it in.
<LI>As none of the politicians present knew how to pray, they called in a professional.
</UL>
<P>
1924<UL>
<LI>As I pen these lines, I am waiting for my train to carry me to Coolidge's Follies in Cleveland.  At first I was going to say the Republican Follies, but it's not.  They have nothing to do with it.  The whole this is under the personal supervision of Mr. Coolidge.<BR>
It's a one-star show.  Now can you imagine Yaps like us going to Cleveland from all over the country when Mr. Coolidge is not going to be there himself?  Its like going to see Sir Harry Lauder's show without Sir Harry.<BR>
I am leaving tonight with New York's delegation of Unnecessary Delegates.  They preach economy, and here are hundreds of thousands of dollars being wasted to ship all these Destructive Delegates to a place to announce something that everybody in the United States knew six months ago.  He could have been nominated by post card.  Why didn't he suggest taking this money they are spending to tell him he is nominated and give it to the poor in each State?  Don't say there is no poor.  There must be some Democrats in every State.
<LI>(William Jennings) Bryan and I had no sooner got in the hall than they commenced to pray.  The preacher started reading his prayer, which was new to me.  Where I come from if a man can't think of anything to pray about offhand, why, there is no need of him praying.  If they couldn't find a Republican that knew how to pray they should have called in a Democrat.  They are all praying this year.
<LI>Take Abraham Lincoln.  A new angle on the reason that his memory is honored through eternity is (according to every speaker that was allowed to open his mouth at this convention) that "Lincoln was a member of the Republican Party."  Had Lincoln been unfortunate enough to have been a member of the Progressives and done the same thing he did, why, a Republican convention would never have heard of him...  Of course to most of you who never attended a Republican convention, why, Lincoln's fame was based on a remark (while a member of the Republican Party), consisting of eleven words.  That's all.  Some historians have since added two other lines, but in the original Lincoln saying there were only these eleven words.  Both political parties are based on it: "You can fool most of the delegates all of the time." ...  That's enough: you don't need to fool only a comfortable majority.
</UL>
<P>
1928<UL>
<LI>They had a time seating the Texas delegation, as there was no law in Texas to apply to a Republican primary.  Texas never thought they would come to a point where there would ever be any Republicans there.  They also have no laws against the shooting out of season of reindeer or musk ox.
<LI>The (GOP) convention opened with a prayer, a very fervent prayer that (Democrat) Al Smith be not nominated (in the Democratic convention).  It was a keynote prayer, if the Lord can see his way clear to bless the Republican Party the way it's been carrying on, then the rest of us ought to even get it without asking for it.
<LI>They just played the National Anthem, and when they finished (Senator) Fess asked the band leader to play something else "while the Chairman was trying to think of something to say."  They are still playing.
<LI>There is nothing to do here when a speaker comes on.  You have to listen to him...
<LI>The convention met last night and then adjourned in five minutes.  That was the most successful convention the people of the country have ever enjoyed.  They met again at 10 this morning, but unfortunately didn't adjourn.  It looked like they had, but they hadn't.
<LI>Reed Smoot from Salt Lake read what sounded like a cross between a financial report and a World Almanac.  He spoke heartily of prosperity.  But our national deficit was still thirty billion when he finished...  The crowd couldn't hear him and shouted for him to speak louder.  Then when he did speak louder and they did hear him why they got sorer than a boil and wanted him to speak low again...  He brought up Nicaragua but he left the marines down there.  He said that he would protect American lives down there, even if we had to send some there to protect.


<LI>They stopped everyone in the house from smoking.  The Republicans are coming out against cigarettes and tobacco.
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>The Delegates</H3></CENTER>
<P>
1920<UL>
<LI>The California delegation took a carload of California poppies to scatter (at the Republican convention) in Chicago.  They figure on catching the dope fiend vote which is very large this year...  Suppose the Kentucky delegation will bring some tobacco leaves and try and land the nicotine vote.
<LI>I asked Pen: "How can you tell who bought delegates?  He said: "That's easy, the ones who didn't buy any are the ones who haven't got any."
<LI>I asked Pen: "How does it come the New York delegates are practically uninstructed."  Boies remarked to me: "You can't instruct a New Yorker, he knows it all."
<LI>I said: "What makes the delegates change?  Don't they stay with their man?"  Pen said: "The delegates vote the way their people told them the first ballot.  But after that they sell to the highest bidder."  I said: "But that's not honest, is it?"  Pen said: "No, just politics."
</UL>
1924<UL>
<LI>If these Delegates vote the way they were instructed to vote Back Home they will be the first politicians that ever did what the people told them to do.  And if they do, this will be the first convention in the History of the World where the Man won who had the most votes to start in with.

1920
<ul><li>Imagine a Congress that squanders $670,000,000 to make one airship trying to 
investigate where some candidate spent a few thousand.
</ul>
<p>
1924
<ul>
<li>As for drafting the platform, that's just a lot of Apple Sauce.  Why I bet you there
is not a Republican or Democrat office-holder today that can tell you one Plank in the 
last Election Platform without looking over the minutes.  These Misled Delegates that 
journey to Cleveland will have just as much chance of helping to frame that platform as a Bow-
Legged girl would have at our Stage Door.  Mr. Coolidge framed that Platform.  I doubt if
 Lodge even has been allowed to see it...
<li>
P.S. Since I arrived in New York, they read a platform.<br>
P.S. It is now six hours later and everybody has forgotten what the platform was.<br>
P.S. (third time) Before they forgot it, they nominated Coolidge.  I'm telling you this 
as a scoop on the other papers.
</ul>
1928
<ul><LI>A keynote speech is press notices for the Republican Party, written by its own 
members.
 Here are just a few things that I bet you didn't know the Republicans were responsible
 for--radio, telephones, baths, automobiles, savings accounts, enforcement, workmen 
living in houses and a living wage for Senators...  The Democrats had brought on war, pestilence,
 debts, disease, boll weevil, gold teeth, need of farm relief, suspenders, floods, and
 famines...<br>He told of so much money that we had saved, that I think if he had talked
 another hour he would have paid us a dividend...<br>When he got to (outgoing GOP president)
 Coolidge, I thought sure he was referring to "Our Saviour" till they told me, "no, it
 was Coolidge."  The way he rated 'em was Coolidge, the Lord and then Lincoln.

<center><h3>The Vice-Presidential Nomination</h3></center>
<P>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<p>
<p>
1920
<ul><li>I see where they are cutting a lot of delegates down to half a vote.  Guess they will let the half-a-vote delegates nominate the vice-president.
</ul>
1924
<ul><li>Of course, lots of people are banking on the excitement coming from the nomination of the Vice President.  Why Mr. Coolidge has had him picked out months ago, ever since Congress overrode his first Veto.  Some say it is Lowden.  But I don't think they can ever persuade him that he can never do any better.

<li>Imagine the Republicans worrying over who they will pick for a Vice President.  Just think of the Poor Democrats.  They are worrying who to pick for a President.  If they can get a good man for President they would be willing to let the Vice Presidency go.
<li>
This is the first Vice Presidential convention ever held in the history of politics...  I suppose four years from now they will hold a National Convention to nominate the Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives.
<li>
All my life I have been longing to attend a convention and see the excitement and hear the shouts.  Now, when I do get a chance I draw this one...
<li>
But we are all just victims of circumstances.  Who would have ever thought that the day would come when people would be going to a convention just to nominate a Vice President.
<li>
Why at the last Republican Convention they were days nominating Mr. Harding and just as they were putting on their hats to leave, someone happened to think, "Why, we haven't nominated a Vice President.  That's customary is it not?"  So someone who happened to have read of the Boston police strike suggested Mr. Coolidge, so they nominated him that minute, and the others went home to read the next day who he was.
<li>
In the old days it was not, "Who will we nominate for Vice President?"  It was "Who can we get to take the thing?"...
<li>
They say they won't nominate one of the Old Guard for Vice President, they want new faces.  Tomorrow at the convention, I am going to put into nomination Fanny Brice.  Fanny has the newest face I know of; she just had it overhauled this year.
<li>
The Republican Vice Presidential conscription convention opened at 11 o'clock this morning with an array of badges that was deafening.  I had the thrill of my entire life.  I entered the convention press stand with William Jennings Bryan.  We were the only two aliens in the entire hall--he the solitary Democrat and I the sole remaining Progressive Bull Moose.  Both of us entered, not to jeer, but to be instructed.  We came out three hours later more ignorant than when we went in.
<li>
My candidate has come.  He just got in this morning and phoned me.  I told you I would deliver him.  It's Will Hays.  I started him Monday for President, but he has degenerated down now till Vice President is about all I have for him.  He can hold both jobs, preside over the Senate and Hollywood both.  In fact, I think we should move the studios from Hollywood to Washington in exchange for the Senate and Congress.  I bet you the City of Washington would trade in a minute.  But I would hate to be the one to suggest it to Hollywood.
<li>
They held off choosing a Vice President until the finish of the show.  This is the first time a Vice Presidential nomination has been strong enough to hold an audience till the finish.
<li>
It has been rumored around town today that I left to prevent my being nominated as Vice President.  I wish to state that that was exactly the case.
</ul>
1928
<ul><li>The whole show has degenerated into nothing but a dog fight for Vice President...  Men who two days ago wouldn't even speak to a Vice President are now trying to get to be one...  They have weeded the Vice Presidential candidates down to just the following: ninety-six Senators, 435 Congressmen, and forty-seven Governors.  (Forty-eight Governors, I should have said; Oklahoma has been admitted (to the Union).)

<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
"Cowboy humorist" and star of stage and screen Will Rogers was commissioned to write 
about the 1920, 1924, 1928 and 1932 national political conventions, a job he thoroughly
enjoyed as these quadrennial politicalfests provided ample fodder for a humorist.  ABIC is pleased
 to offer just a sampling of Rogers' observations during the 1996 convention season.
  You'll note that in many cases things haven't changed much.  But in some cases 
things have changed so much that his statements offer even more ironic humor.
<P>
Each day we'll focus on a different aspect of the convention.  And as Rogers covered both
 the Democratic and Republican conventions, be sure to come back in two weeks and see 
what he had to say about the Democrats!

I said: "This fellow Sproul you are for--nobody knows anything about him."  Pen said: "That's just what makes it so hard to nominate those other Republican candidates; people know too much about them."
<li>
(During the voting for the presidential nominee) Boies said: "I might just as well sent Connie Mack (grandfather of current Sen. Connie Mack, R-FL) out there.  He couldn't a finished any further back."
<li>
I said: "Do you think Johnson will start a third party?"  Boies said: "If he does this will be the most successful convention the Democrats ever held."
</ul><p>
1924
<ul><li>Things must be in a pretty bad way in the Republican Party when they have only Two Men who think they are good enough to run.  Why, in the Democratic Party they have a Thousand who think they are good enough.  According to that, they Democrats must have the most Able Party.
<li>
Lots of people can't understand the popularity that Mr. Coolidge is deservedly enjoying all over the country at the present time.  I can tell you.  It started the minute he opposed Congress and the Senate.  The People said: "If he is against Congress he must be right."  It was the surest fire political move anyone ever had a chance to make.  If he agreed with Congress he would have been as dead as they are today.

<center><h3>Some Final Thoughts</h3></center>
<p>
1924
<ul><li>Well, so long readers--both of you.  Will meet you at the Democratic convention again.  What it lacks in class, in comparison to the Republican one, why, they will make up in noise.

<li>Leave your watches and jewelry at home.  Bring nothing but your alternates.  It's a cinch you can't lose them.
</ul>
1928
<ul><li>Wow!  She is all over.  Hoover and Curtis...  The Republican Party owed (Curtis) something, but I didn't think they would be so low down as to pay him that way.  He used to be floor-walker of the Republican Party on the Senate floor.  Now he will be time-keeper.
<li>
Another preacher prayed this morning and had to read his prayer.  There hasn't been a one that could make an impromptu prayer...  This one was a Methodist, and he wanted us "to look to the hills for wisdom," and here we went and nominated Charley Curtis from the plains of Kansas, where a five-foot ash heap would constitute a precipice...
<li>
This preacher prayed for Plymouth Rock.  Lord, it's Boulder Dam we are after, now!  There is no appropriation goes with Plymouth Rock.
<li>
I hate to say it, but the women that spoke were all terrible.  Well, they were pretty near as bad as the men, and that will give you an idea how bad they were.
</ul>
1932
<ul><li>See you at the Democrats, where they will let anybody nominate everybody.
</ul><p>

Dear Readers:
<p>
Welcome to Capital Letters!  Take Dear Abby, Ann Landers, Hints from Heloise and Capital Gang, roll them all into one and what do you have?  <b>CAPITAL LETTERS</b>: an advice column for the politically interested but inexperienced and organizationally challenged.  Send us your political questions, queries, ideas via <a href="/abic/cl-emailer.html">e-mail</a> and we'll pick the two or three each week to answer on-line.  
<p>
Maybe you'd love to know:
<ul>
<li>how to get your congressman to pay more attention to your views;
<li>how to take control of your local school board;
<li>how to organize your neighbors into a political force on a specific cause or issue;
<li>how to find out more about your Senator's activities in Washington--things he or she 	   might not want you to know;
<li>how to get started running for office;
<li>how to build a fire under your local media and change the political climate of your area
</ul><p>
We welcome the questions -- and we'll do our best to sift through and answer the ones that have the most universal application (or are the most interesting).
<p>
Look for new letters every Monday -- and if we receive enough, we'll change them more often.
<p>
The goal?  To help put the American people back in charge of their government at every level.  We will do our best to give you the information and the tools to help you do exactly that.

<h2>Advice for Health Charity Donors</h2>

By James T. Bennett and Thomas J. DiLorenzo 
<P>
Americans give some $10 billion annually to over 2,000 health
charities. How can donors determine if a charity is using contributions
efficiently and is running effective programs, and is thus worthy
of support?
<P>
Donors should recognize that there may be a wide disparity between
what a health charity says about its activities and what it actually
does. Before you contribute, consider the following:
<UL>
<LI><I>Health Advice</I>. Some advice offered by health charities
is so simplistic (e.g., &quot;watch your diet,&quot; &quot;get
plenty of exercise&quot;) that it is worthless. Worse, advice
may be contradictory, misleading, or based on weak evidence.
<LI><I>Professional Education</I>. Some health charities spend
heavily on educating health professionals about new medical advances,
diagnostic techniques, and treatments. But other well-paid professionals
(e.g., accountants, lawyers, college professors) attend conferences
and subscribe to professional journals at their own expense.
<LI><I>Research</I>. Nearly all disease research is paid for through
federal taxes. Health charities that say they fund research often
only provide money to help researchers apply for federal grants.
<LI><I>Patient and Community Services</I>. Of 39 health charities
examined in a 1990 report by the National Health Council (a nonprofit
association of health charities), 14 spent nothing on patient
services, and another 11 spent less than $1 million each. Twenty-three
of the 39 spent a total of just over $1 billion on community services
(e.g., screening for diseases, support for rehabilitation programs).
<LI><I>Real Estate and other Assets</I>. Some health charities
hold millions of dollars in cash, stocks, bonds, certificates
of deposit, land, buildings, and automobiles. Obviously, such
holdings mean fewer funds for program services.
</UL>

<P>
Donors should carefully review a health charity's annual report
and audited financial statement before making any contribution.
These show the amount the charity spends on its programs. Other
questions that donors should seek answers to include:
<UL>
<LI>Does the charity provide services at the lowest possible cost?
<LI>Does the charity use its funds for the purposes described
in its fund-raising appeals?
<LI>Do those in greatest need benefit most from the charity's
programs?
<LI>Could better results be achieved by redirecting resources
to other activities, e.g., services for disease victims?
</UL>

<P>
An in-depth look at these issues can be found in our book, <I>Unhealthy
Charities: Hazardous to Your Health and Wealth</I> (New York:
Basic Books, 1994).

<TITLE>MacArthur's Genius Awards: Catharine Stimpson, Director-- CRC</TITLE>

<BR>
<I>CATHARINE STIMPSON, 
<P>DIRECTOR, MACARTHUR FELLOWS PROGRAM</I>
<P>
<P>Catharine Stimpson's story is typical of many 
left-wing women of her generation.  Born in 1936, she became 
a radical activist in the `60s. But as the era ended and as she 
has aged, her sights turned from the streets to the schools. 
Rising up the academic and philanthropic ladder, Stimpson 
has never abandoned her feminism or her animus toward 
conservatives.
<P>Stimpson joined the English department of Barnard 
College in 1963, where she remained until 1980, when 
she joined the English Department at Rutgers University.  In 
the mid-1980s, she became dean of the Rutgers graduate 
school, where she stayed until her appointment to the 
MacArthur Foundation in 1994.  She retains a house in Staten 
Island, New York, and is officially on leave from Rutgers.
<P>Stimpson's early writings are quite militant.  In a 
1974 essay, for example, she charged that the plight of women 
in America was analogous to that of blacks, because &quot;what 
the economy gives both women and blacks are menial 
labor, low pay, and few promotions.&quot;  She added that &quot;blacks 
and women also live in the wasteland of American 
sexuality&quot; because &quot;white men, convinced of the holy primacy 
of sperm, yet guilty about using it, angry at the loss of the 
cozy sanctuary of the womb and the privilege of childhood, 
have made their sex a claim to power and then used their 
power to claim control of sex.  In fact and fantasy, they 
have violently segregated black men and white women.&quot;
<P>In 1976, Stimpson, who has never married, moved in 
with another woman and  became what she called &quot;father/mother&quot; 
 and &quot;parenter&quot; to four children, none her own.  She 
also began work on her only novel, <I>Class Notes </I>(1979).  
The work describes a woman who, like Stimpson, grew up in 
a small town in the state of Washington in the late 1940s 
and 1950s.  Periodically Harriet Springer, Stimpson's 
heroine, confronts men who drink excessively, beat her, and 
warn her of the dangers of Communism and the United Nations. 
 Stimpson's heroine escapes this male torment by 
entering an effete Eastern women's college where she learns 
the delights of lesbian love. 
<P>Stimpson became a national figure after she became 
a dean at Rutgers.  She generally sided with the left, 
though she has always opposed speech codes and has 
attacked feminists who call for censorship.  As Cathy Young 
reported in <I>Heterodoxy</I>, Stimpson has said her ultimate 
goal was for &quot;a mutiracial, multicultural, multispecied world.&quot; 
<P>Stimpson's views towards conservatives are best 
expressed in her 1987 essay &quot;Nancy Reagan Wears a Hat: 
 Feminism and Its Cultural Consensus.&quot;  &quot;Right-wing 
conservatism could also appeal to fears,&quot; she wrote, &quot;to 
the fears of women that they would be vulnerable and 
helpless if men did not protect them economically; to the fears 
of men that they would be vulnerable and helpless if 
women did not submit to them; and to the fears of both men 
and women that the world would be wholly cruel, 
wholly pitiless, wholly formless, if it had neither havening 
homes nor nurturing mother figures.&quot;
<P>Stimpson has denied she has that much influence 
over who becomes a MacArthur Fellow. But, in a 1994 
interview with the <I>Chicago Tribune</I> she said that as 
program director, &quot;one of my responsibilities is to make sure 
activists are as much represented as academics.&quot;

<P>
MARIAN WRIGHT EDELMAN,  1990 FELLOW</I>
<P>
<ul>Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of 
the Children's Defense Fund, (CDF) is the leading 
champion of the welfare state in the U.S.  In earlier years, she led 
the effort to make the welfare state grow; today, her efforts 
are devoted to prolonging Great Society programs as long 
as possible.
<P>As late as 1990, Edelman presented herself as 
an unreconstructed liberal, writing inflammatory articles 
with titles like &quot;Why America May Go to Hell&quot; if 
welfare programs did not grow.  But after winning her 
MacArthur Fellowship, she reformulated her strategy, presenting 
herself as an &quot;independent&quot; who combined 
conservative-sounding approaches to raising children with 
big-government liberalism.  In 1992, for example, she published 
<I>The Measure of Our Success</I>, a bestseller which 
combined homilies about childrearing with pleas for making 
the welfare state bigger.  But in the same year, she told 
the readers of <I>Challenge</I>, a business magazine, that 
families could only be saved by national health insurance, 
national child support insurance, fully-funded Head Start,  and 
a new federal program for &quot;intensive family 
preservation services.&quot;
<P>Since Hillary Rodham Clinton had served as CDF chairman until her husband began his presidential 
campaign, many observers expected that she would be a 
key adviser to the Clinton Administration.  The first part 
of 1993 sparked a flurry of profiles about 
Edelman;<I> Harper's Bazaar</I> even titled their profile of her &quot;Saint Marian.&quot;  
But other observers were more skeptical.  <I>The New 
Republic'</I>s Mickey Kaus, for example, said that Edelman's view 
that &quot;welfare should be expanded into a guaranteed income 
is a deadweight political loser.  How many politicians 
could win an election today arguing that the solution to 
the problems of South-Central Los Angeles is to put 
everyone on the dole?&quot;  <I>Fortune</I>'s Daniel Seligman added that 
&quot;the spending called for by CDF would make matters 
worse, not better,&quot; since more welfare might increase the 
number of single-parent households.
<P>With the Republican takeover of Congress and 
Hillary Rodham Clinton's retreat from the political 
arena, Edelman's influence has substantially diminished. 
She continues to critique the Republicans, however; in a 
1995 interview with the leftist magazine <I>Southern 
Exposure</I>, she condemned the Contract with America as &quot;a 
Trojan horse for a relentless assault on children's programs 
that leaves non-needy  constituencies virtually untouched.  
Not only is it morally wrong, it is economically wrong.&quot;</ul>

<P><I>PAUL EHRLICH, 1990 FELLOW</I>
<P>
<ul>Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich has long been the 
leading doomsayer among environmentalists.  A prolific writer, 
he has consistently predicted ecological disasters which 
have never happened.  In <I>The Population 
Bomb</I> (1968; revised, 1971), Ehrlich predicted  that America in 1984 would 
have food shortages so severe that steak would be $12 a pound, 
 the U.S. unemployment rate would be 27 percent, and 
India would be an anarchy because of nationwide food riots.  
In 1973, Ehrlich predicted that by 1990, 65 million 
Americans would suffer from starvationabout the same number 
of Americans who were overweight in that year.
<P>Ehrlich's most famous prediction was a bet he made 
in 1980 with economist Julian Simon, in which he 
predicted that the prices of thirteen minerals would rise by 1990 
as their supplies became exhausted.  Ehrlich lost that 
bet, because 11 of the 13 minerals fell in price, and the 
constant dollar price of six of the minerals (including silver, 
platinum, and tin) dropped by over 50 percent.
<P>Accompanying Ehrlich's gloomy predictions are 
calls for draconian increases in government in order to 
forestall a pending ecological apocalypse.  In <I>How to Be a 
Survivor </I>(1971), Ehrlich and Richard L. Hartman called for 
the establishment of a federal Department of Population 
and Environment which would combine the government's 
environmental agencies, the Interior Department, and 
the Census Bureau and &quot;should, of course, have more 
power over the private sector and state and local governments 
than all of these (other agencies) combined.&quot;  They also 
endorsed FDR brain-truster Rexford G. Tugwell `s efforts to 
replace the Constitution with a new version that would include 
a &quot;national regulator&quot; who would have veto power over 
the activities of all corporations and nonprofits in the U.S.
<P>In a June 1995 interview with the <I>Wall Street 
Journal</I>, Ehrlich admitted that he had made mistakes in his 
previous predictions, but that most of them would come true in 
the near future.  Ehrlich also continues to be rewarded 
by nonprofits; he was one of the first recipients of the 
Heinz prize, a smaller-scale version of the MacArthur 
Fellowships.

<a name="lovins"></a>
<P><I>AMORY LOVINS, 1993 FELLOW</I>
<P>
<ul>Amory Lovins was one of the more important ecologists 
of the 1970s.  His day of fame came in 1976, when he 
published an article in<I> Foreign Affairs</I> calling for the U.S. to follow 
a &quot;soft energy path&quot; of reliance on the sun and the wind 
instead of the &quot;hard energy path&quot; of using oil, coal, and 
nuclear power.  Lovins's article was wildly controversial, and led 
to Lovins being invited to the White House, testifying 
before Congress, and being hired as a consultant by many 
agencies devoted to energy, both in the U.S. and abroad.  So 
voluminous was the response to Lovins' article that in 1979 
Lovins produced <I>The Energy Controversy</I>, a 409-page book 
in which he responded to thirteen of his critics.
<P>But in the 1980s, falling oil prices made Lovins an 
anachronism.  He briefly tried to capture the limelight with 
<I>The First Nuclear World War (</I>1983), in which he and 
Patrick O'Heffernan predicted that nuclear weapons would 
explode in Pakistan, Iran, and southern California by 1988.  
Lovins and O'Heffernan even predicted that U.S. troops would be 
in Iraqto defend Saddam Hussein against 
nuclear-armed Iranians. 
<P>In 1982, Lovins founded the Rocky Mountain 
Institute, devoted to promoting energy conservation policies.  A 
1993 article in <I>The Economist</I> noted that the institute's 
power sources included solar cells and a bull terrier named 
Nanuq the Beastoid, whom Lovins claimed was a 50-watt 
energy source, &quot;but sometimes we throw things for her and get 
her up to 100 watts.&quot;  What the hound did to generate power 
was not made clear.
<P>Lovins is still an advocate of larger government; in a 
1992 article in <I>Foreign Affairs</I>, he and Joseph L. Romm called 
for the Clinton Administration to implement massive 
subsidies for energy conservation, a national industrial policy, 
worker training programs, and subsidies to rebuild America's 
infrastructure.

<a name="schneider"></a>
<P><I>STEPHEN SCHNEIDER, 1994 FELLOW</I>
<P>
<ul>A climatologist, Schneider is one of the nation's 
leading advocates of the theory of &quot;global warming,&quot; the notion 
that the earth is getting progressively warmer due to the 
dissemination of &quot;greenhouse gases.&quot;  But as author Ronald 
Bailey notes in <I>Eco-Scam,</I> Schneider's first book, 
<I>The Genesis Strategy</I> (1976) was devoted to the idea that the earth 
was getting progressively colder.  To fight this alleged 
&quot;global cooling,&quot;  Schneider proposed massive income 
redistribution, strict regulations on the introduction of new 
technologies, and government-subsidized environmental 
programs which would teach the public to &quot;question present 
value systems and adopt a new political consciousness.&quot;
<P>After switching his position to favor global warming, Schneider admitted to author Jonathan Schell that in order 
to save the planet, scientists should suspend any doubts 
they may have about the possibility of ecological disaster.  
&quot;To capture the public's imagination,&quot; Schneider said, 
&quot;entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up 
scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and 
make little mention of any doubts we might have.&quot;
<P>Long associated with the National Center for 
Atmospheric Research, Schneider recently joined Stanford 
University, where he is associated with fellow doomster 
Paul Ehrlich.

<a name="wolfe"></a>
<P><I>SIDNEY WOLFE, 1990 FELLOW</I>
<P><ul>Since 1971, Sidney Wolfe has headed the Health 
Research Group, the medical branch of Ralph Nader's 
nonprofit Public Citizen.  But throughout his career, as Milton 
Copulos charged in a 1985 critique in 
<I>Reason</I>, there have been &quot;concerns that Wolfe is selective in his use of facts, that 
he frequently overemphasizes the negative aspects of 
evidence, and that he often exaggerates the dangers he alleges 
are present.&quot;
<P>As early as 1976, for example, Wolfe led a 
successful effort to ban Red Dye No. 2, an alleged carcinogen, 
even though the research conducted by the Food and Drug 
Administration was inconclusive and badly managed.  
Wolfe also led a successful effort (aided by a class-action 
lawsuit) to persuade Merrell Dow to withdraw Benedictin, a 
drug given to pregnant women to prevent nausea, even though 
the drug had safely been given to women for thirty years.
<P>In his career, Wolfe has made curious allies .. He 
has worked with Scientologists to try to ban the use of Prozac, 
an alliance that led the <I>Wall Street 
Journal</I> to dub Wolfe &quot;L. Ron Nader.&quot;  Wolfe's critics also accuse the Health 
Research Group of selling &quot;how-to-sue&quot; kits to trial lawyers for 
$750, filled with studies needed to launch a class-action 
lawsuit. Wolfe claims that he only sells these kits &quot;when there's 
an unequivocal relationship between the product and causes 
of (injury or) death&quot;, and that contributions from trial 
lawyers make up less than one percent of Public Citizen's $8 
million budget.  
<P>As CRC Visiting Fellow Tom Holt notes in his 
monograph <I>The Rise of the Nanny State</I>, Wolfe has been 
an advocate of a single-payer Canadian-style health care 
plan since 1970. &quot;Wolfe often asserts, without evidence, that 
as much as half the money spent on health care is wasted,&quot; 
Holt reports.<BR>

<center><h3>
Why doesn't a journal for the best high school history papers have support from groups professing an interest in the future of education?
</h3></center>

<p>
By Laurence Jarvik
<P>
<BR>
 When Will Fitzhugh quit teaching high school history in Concord, Massachusetts nine years ago to start
 <i>The Concord Review</i>, he didn't know that it would be so difficult to find backers for his venture. 
The premise for his quarterly publication was simple: to publish the best history papers by public and private 
high school students in the United States so that teachers and students alike would have access to examples
 of excellence. High standards for writing history could be encouraged through learning by example. Fitzhugh, 
a graduate of Harvard University (Class of 1960), thought that there would be a natural demand among 
teachers for his effort to publicize essays written by the "best and the brightest." He was surprised when his 
request for funding was rejected by 125 foundations, the Department of Education, and the National 
Endowment for the Humanities.  
<P>
Fitzhugh cashed in his retirement account and put one hundred thousand dollars of his own money into 
<i>The Concord Review</i>, whose first issue appeared  in 1988. What Fitzhugh did not realize was that 
while he was pursuing teaching history in the public high schools, the field of academic history was changing.
 The lifelong Democrat had become an unknowing participant in the culture wars. The rejections he received 
from foundations and government agencies were the results of a paradigm shift which preferred group identity 
to individual merit. "Sometimes they tell me they are only interested in the work of minority students," 
Fitzhugh recalled, "and sometimes they say they cannot see the value of supporting the work of just a few 
good youngsters." Fitzhugh's position that minority students are "welcome to contribute their work" and to 
be judged on the basis of its excellence fell on deaf ears.
<P>
That Fitzhugh's journal would be caught up in the controversy over politically correct high school history came 
as a surprise. When the <i>National Standards for United States History</i> were released in 1994, they 
listed <i>The Concord Review</i> among approved "teaching resources for United States history" as "an 
exceptional teaching tool modeling outstanding essays research (sic) and written by high school 
students... Recommended for grades 9-12." Two essays were featured in a special January, 1995 
<i>Concord Review</i> as the best of the year. Neither could be considered conservative. Aaron Einbond, a
 sophomore at New York City's elite public Hunter College High School, contributed a study of John 
Maynard Keynes based on citations from liberal  economists John Kenneth Galbraith and Robert Lekachman.
 Pia Lindstrom Luedtke, a sophomore at the private Polytechnic School of Pasadena, offered a feminist 
interpretation of the career of architect Julia Morgan entitled "Blueprint for Social Change." The high-schooler
 had already enjoyed one official seal of approval: in 1993 Luedtke received a $1900 grant from the National 
Endowment for the Humanities  through the NEH Younger Scholars Program to write her essay over summer 
vacation. Other essays published in The Concord Review included accounts of baseball's Negro Leagues, 
women's suffrage, President Woodrow Wilson's vision of the League of Nations, the role of women in the 
French Revolution, and a critique of Frederick Jackson Turner based on the work of liberal historian Richard 
Hofstadter.  <i>The Concord Review</i> also published essays on the development of the Ferris Wheel and 
the power loom and an analysis of  how Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis continued the debate between 
the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists. A glance at issues provided to <i>Culture Watch</i> shows little in 
the way of what might be categorized as conservative history: for example, the legacy of conservative 
statesmen, scientists, businessmen,  intellectuals, military history, or criticism of leftist historical figures 
and trends.  
<P>
Fitzhugh is a colorful character. The son of a prominent Boston physician, at the age of two Fitzhugh moved 
to Arizona with his mother after his parents divorced. Graduating from a boarding school in Menlo Park, 
California after winning a prize by answering 1000 questions correctly (the first time a student had done 
so in 17 years), he went to work as a lumberjack.  Fitzhugh entered Harvard in 1956 after his father brought 
him back East with an offer to pay his tuition. He graduated in 1962 with an English degree, spent a year 
doing graduate work in English literature at Cambridge University, and in 1964 went to work for the Apollo 
space program preparing charts used in the construction of the Command Module. This led to a job with 
Pan Am as a management trainee. Fitzhugh returned to Cambridge, Massachussetts where he obtained a 
masters degree in education from Harvard.  After jobs with the Peace Corps (which sent him to Iran), 
Westinghouse, and Polaroid, Fitzhugh went into teaching, first working as a guidance counselor and, in 1978,
 as a social studies teacher at Concord High School. He started <i>The Concord Review</i> to give 
recognition to good students, "the ones who are doing better than we think they are." In its first year the 
magazine had subscribers in 14 states, and soon had support from both Harold Howe, a Harvard professor 
and Commissioner of Education in the Johnson administration, and Chester Finn, Assistant Secretary of 
Education in the Reagan administration. Finn gave Fitzhugh $10,000 from the Fordham foundation. Howe 
wrote letters to 15 foundations on his behalf.  
<P>
A traditional liberal approach to history -- narratives of great men, nations, and ideas -- is not in keeping with 
trends in political correctness sweeping education. Against his will, Fitzhugh is being pushed into the 
conservative camp.  His notion that <i>The Concord Review</i> is a form of "varsity academics" is offensive 
to advocates of the new pedagogy. The very educational nostrums which brought Fitzhugh to Harvard in 
1956 from a logging camp are now considered obsolete and elitist. The new view of history is instrumental, 
and high school history has become a kind of sensitivity training. Robert Lerner, Althea K. Nagai, and 
Stanley Rothman have called the process <i>Molding the Good Citizen</i> (Prager, 1995) in their review of 
the politics of high school history texts. They point out that civil rights groups, feminists, peace activists 
and environmentalists have all "sought to change the schools in specific ways to bring about a new 
social order." Because Fitzhugh's journal does not pretend to fight oppression by race, class and sex, its 
purpose is suspect. "It used to be people on both sides of the aisle thought standards were a good idea," 
Fitzhugh told <i>Culture Watch</i>. "Now anybody who thinks reading and writing and doing homework is 
a good idea is considered a conservative."

For Immediate Release<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Professor Claims Race and Sex <BR>
Based Discrimination Committed by Bowling Green</CENTER></FONT><BR>


<P>     Dr. John Hartman filed a lawsuit in federal court Tuesday claiming that he was denied employment at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) because of illegal discrimination.  He is suing the university and its accrediting agency--the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC)--for sex and race based discrimination in violation of his equal protection rights.  Dr. Hartman is a white male.

<P>     In 1991, ACEJMC rescinded the journalism department's full accreditation, citing among the reasons for denial the perceived underrepresentation of women and minority faculty.  While the agency did not claim that BGSU had discriminated, it did require the department to eliminate the perceived imbalance in order to regain full accreditation.  BGSU's journalism department acceded to the ACEJMC's demands, and set-aside a number of future positions for women and minorities.

<P>     When Dr. Hartman applied for a teaching position at Bowling Green in 1994, his qualifications included a Ph.d in communication and twelve years teaching experience, as well as experience conducting seminars on mass communication and diversity, serving as a minority student mentor for several years, and publishing numerous scholarly works.  Despite his credentials, Bowling Green denied Dr. Hartman employment and instead offered the position to a black female who did not have a Ph.d, had significantly less teaching experience, and had a less impressive publishing record.

<P>     Following the hiring decision, Dr. Hartman filed a complaint with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (OCRC).  OCRC found probable cause that the university had discriminated against Dr. Hartman, declaring that his "expertise and educational experience in the field of journalism more closely met the job requirements compared to the background of the successful candidate. . . ."  When subsequent mediation efforts between the parties failed, OCRC held a formal hearing in March on the issue, the results of which are pending.

<P>     In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, Dr. Hartman is seeking an injunction against the university and the accrediting agency which would prohibit them from discriminating against him on the basis of race and sex.  He is further seeking instatement to the position for which he was wrongfully denied employment, and damages resulting from the denial of employment.

<P>     Michael Rosman, attorney for Dr. Hartman and General Counsel for the Center for Individual Rights, stated that "Bowling Green and its accrediting agency created a system where, regardless of Dr. Hartman's qualifications, he could not have been hired simply because he is a white male.  It is precisely this sort of egregious deprivation of rights that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits."

<P>     To receive a copy of the complaint, or for more information about the case, call Robert Alt, Director of Public Relations and Education for the Center for Individual Rights, at 202-833-8400, ext. 101.

<h1>Preface</h1>

Over 200 years ago, a revolution began upon the continent of 
America, the richest and greatest territory discovered by the civilization 
of Europe.  It did not begin on battlefields, with the clash of armies, but 
with deliberations among a few people.  Most of these people were 
Protestant Christians, and most of their debates took place, in the 
beginning, in churches.  
<P>
In conducting a revolution and framing a new constitution,  our 
Founders followed certain principles.  They did not dream up these 
principles out of nothing.  The principles came to them by study and 
acute observation of their situation.  These prin-ciples express great 
truths that apply at all times and to all men.  But they are not merely 
abstract and general.  They are practical and solid.    
<P>
For one thing, the Founders noticed that many former  nations had 
been built upon specific religious teachings.  They noticed that these 
nations tended to fight wars over matters     of religious doctrine, 
outlaw certain sects, and persecute people for their beliefs.  Indeed, 
many of our forefathers had come to America in order to practice their 
faith without hindrance or impediment.  
<P>
The tradition in England at the time was religious tolera-tion.  
Doctrinal differences with the Church of England were held to be 
wrong.  They were tolerated, but in that toleration was the frown of 
disapproval, carrying with it restrictions in how much property one 
might own or whether one might hold public office.  The Founders 
replaced this tradition with the idea of religious freedom.  
<P>
Religious freedom goes beyond toleration.  It was expressed by 
President Washington in his marvelous letter to the Hebrew 
congregation in Newport in 1790, marking the first time Jews were 
ever officially welcomed as citizens outside of Israel:  
<p>

<blockquote>
It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it were 
the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed 
the exercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, 
the government of the United States, which gives to 
bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires 
only that they who live under its protection should demean 
them-selves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions 
their effectual support. . . .  May the children of the Stock 
of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and 
enjoy the good will of the other in-habitants, while every 
one shall sit safely under his own vine and fig tree, and 
there shall be none to make him afraid.
</blockquote>

<p>
The first practical truth of the American founding, then, is religious 
freedom.  One man may not rule another on the basis of his reading of 
revealed scripture.  For that reason, this book of ours does not advance 
its arguments for moral revival on such a basis.  This is not a 
compromise on our part.  We ground our arguments elsewhere because 
it is right.
<p>

The second practical truth will tell us, when we understand it, what 
the Founders meant by human nature and the natural law.  This law 
was available to them, as it is to us, because God talks to human beings 
not only in the scriptures, but also through their reason.
<p>

C. S. Lewis begins a great book with a discussion of the plain moral 
knowledge we are born with.  Listen, says Lewis, to people talking:  
One person says, "I was here first and you took my place away."  The 
second person does not reply, "Yes, and that is good."  Rather he says, 
"No, you were not here first," or "This is my place."  However much 
they may twist the facts, they agree on the standard by which the facts 
may be judged.
<p>

Just as we know that round things are not square, or short things 
tall, or flat things lumpy, we know that infidelity, lying, and theft are 
wrong.  This does not mean that men do not cheat, lie, and steal.  But 
just as imperfection is part of human nature, so is an intuitive grasping 
of moral facts, and an ability to reason from those facts about how best 
to live.  It is one of the ways in which we participate in the divine 
nature.  
<p>

This is what is meant by the law of nature.  It is the law that we 
know innately because we are human.  It forms the  basis of moral life, 
and is compatible with the moral teachings of revelation.  America was 
founded on principles derived from this law of nature or law of reason.  
Our book takes its bearings from these founding principles.
Today the moral fiber of our country is weak and growing weaker, 
largely because the natural law is forgotten or denied.  Consider this 
passage from a 1989 report of The American Council of Learned 
Societies:
<P>

<blockquote>
The consensus of most of [today's] dominant theories is 
that all thought does, indeed, develop from par-ticular 
standpoints, perspectives, interests . . . .  We should not 
equate truth with our own political ideology . . . .  At its 
best, contemporary humanistic thinking . . . attempts to 
sensitize us to the presence of ideology in our own work, 
and to its capacity to delude us into promoting as 
universal, values that in fact belong to one nation, one 
social class, one sect. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Such moral relativism has been the predominant doctrine in 
American universities for decades.  Today we see it filtered down in 
the media and popular culture, where the easy senti-ments of modern 
liberalism go for the most part unchallenged. 
<P>

The six chapters in our book explain how this abandonment of the 
natural law has spawned radical new public policies:  sanction (and 
even subsidies) for pornography and sexual licentiousness, 
redistribitive taxes that undermine the idea of property rights, an 
intrusive welfare state that wreaks destruction on the American 
character, and a bureaucratized, "value-free" public school system.  
Each chapter, in turn, sup-plies arguments and actions needed to 
reverse these policies, and to return to policies which support the 
family.
<P>

In addition we include two appendices, which make a simple point:  
Morality and politics are inseparable, and there is nothing more 
American than bringing one's religious and moral views to bear on 
political issues.  This runs counter to the propaganda of America's 
intellectual and political elites today.  But what these people mean 
when they tell us to check our deepest held beliefs when we conduct 
ourselves politically is this:  "We know better than you how you should 
live and raise your children.  Let us have our way."  Nothing could be 
more foreign to what our Founders had in mind.
<P>

Neither moral relativism nor the desire to rule grown people as if 
they were children (or worse) is anything new.  At the dawn of 
American democracy, the Founders rejected the relativist views of 
the philosopher Hobbes, which James Wilson, one of the leading 
members of the Constitutional Convention, condemned as "totally 
repugnant to all human sentiment, and all human experience."  Of 
course, the Declara-tion of Independence is itself the greatest 
expression of our Founders' non-relativist understanding of man as a 
created being with unalienable rights, which rights governments are 
formed to protect.  As for despotism, we need only recall King George 
and his colonial tax collectors.
<P>

We must aim today at something like a repetition of the story of the 
founding.  We must reject the bad ideas behind the policies that have 
brought our country to its current crisis.  We must replace these bad 
policies with good ones.  The history of our nation tells us that only 
one method of moral reform is possible:  to call America back to her 
highest principles, to her better self.  In that spirit The Claremont 
Institute is proud to publish Moral Ideas for America.

<h2>The First Amendment and Pornography</h2>
<h3>Francis Canavan</h3>
</center>

The clause of the First Amendment that is relevant to the subject of 
pornography is:  "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the 
freedom of speech or of the press."  The Supreme Court, through its 
interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, has applied this clause to 
state and local governments, so that all levels of government in this 
country are bound by it.  The question before us now is, what is this 
freedom of speech or of the press that is protected by the Amendment?
I am not going to argue that the Supreme Court has spoken, that the 
matter is settled, that there is nothing more to discuss, and that those 
who disagree with me should therefore shut up.  I leave that kind of 
argument to people on the other side.  But I will occasionally cite 
Supreme Court decisions, because I want to show that the Supreme 
Court has occasionally said things that support my case.
<P>

Indeed, contrary to common opinion, the Court has never actually 
banned any and all regulation of freedom of speech and press.  I feel 
safe in saying that it has never subscribed to the view that freedom of 
speech is absolute-or that obscenity as such is protected by it.  
<P>

For example, in 1961, in the case of Konigsberg v. State Bar of 
California, the Court held that "constitutionally protected freedom of 
speech is narrower than an unlimited license to talk."  In a footnote it 
pointed out that any contrary view "cannot be reconciled with the law 
relating to libel, slander, misrepresentation, obscenity, perjury, false 
advertising, solicitation of crime, complicity by encouragement, 
conspiracy and the like." 
<P>

The other point of view, against which I stand, is what I will call the 
absolutist view of freedom of speech and press-a view that is 
sometimes called "First Amendment fundamentalism."  This was 
represented on the Supreme Court by Justices Black and Douglas in 
their day.  According to them, the only line that can be drawn legally or 
constitutionally is between speech and conduct.  If it is speech, it is 
protected absolutely.  If it becomes conduct, then the state can regulate 
it.  For all practical purposes, Justices Brennan and Marshall later sub-
scribed to the same view.  That is to say, they approached it without 
ever quite reaching it.  But it was effectively the same.  
<P>

Whether among people on the Court or off it, this absolutist school 
of thought has telescoped freedom of speech and press into "freedom 
of expression."  "Expression" started out as a sort of shorthand way of 
referring to speech and press, but now covers things that are 
neither-like what the Court has described as "nonobscene nude 
dancing."  When you get to that point, it doesn't matter what is 
expressed or how it is expressed, so long as it is expressed rather than 
done.  The fact of expression is all that really matters.  Thus expression 
is detached from any public or societal purpose that it is supposed to 
serve.  Expression becomes its own end and its own justification.  
Therefore there can be no constitutional limit on it.  That is what I call 
the absolutist view.  
<P>

I am advancing an opposite position which holds that a rational 
interpretation of the constitutional freedom of speech and press must 
consider the purposes which that freedom is intended to serve.  And 
that in any given case coming before the courts, it must be asked 
whether the particular speech or publication or expression in question 
has any discernible relation to those purposes.  Why?  Because the end 
or purpose of the free speech and free press guarantee-or indeed of any 
legal or constitutional right-is the rationale or the principle that justifies 
it. 
<P>

<center>
<h3>Rights Have Purposes, Hence Limits</h3>
</center>

We do not legally recognize or create rights for no purpose 
whatsoever.  We have in each instance something that we wish to 
achieve.  Once we admit this, and admit that the constitutional 
guarantee of freedom of speech and press has a purpose or purposes, 
we have also accepted the principle that limits it.
<P>

In addition to justifying the guarantee, the purpose indicates what 
the limits are; if a particular expression has little or no discernible 
relation to the purpose of the First Amendment guarantee, or, even 
more, if it positively impedes that purpose, then it is not protected by 
the guarantee.  
<P>

The Supreme Court in 1942 made a statement which, I think, is still 
valid today, in deciding the case of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire:
<P>

<blockquote>
There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited 
classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which 
have never been thought to raise any constitutional 
problems.  These include the lewd and obscene, the 
profane, the libelous, and the insulting or "fighting" 
words-those which by their very utterance inflict injury or 
tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.  It has 
been well observed that such utterances are no essential 
part of any exposition of ideas and are of such slight social 
value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived 
from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in 
order and morality. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Notice, this says that the First Amendment guarantee has a 
purpose-the search for truth-against which one can weigh a particular 
utterance; and also that if one finds this utterance has little or no role in 
this search, or in the exposition of ideas, then it can be outweighed by 
the social interest in morality.
<P>

Of course, one will not find in the Supreme Court's opinions 
anywhere a catalogue of all the purposes of the First Amendment in a 
hierarchical arrangement.  Nor will one find a catalogue of the social 
interests that can outweigh them.  But there are plenty of statements 
indicating that the Court does recognize (however reluctantly) that 
some kinds of speech are more important than others, that some are 
pretty unimportant, and that some are simply off the scale and not 
protected at all.
<P>

In other words, the social interest that justifies limiting or even pro-
hibiting low kinds of speech need not be great.  When dealing with a 
high kind of speech, on the other hand, we have to weigh in something 
as important as the national security in order to justify any sort of 
limitation.
<P>

So the freedoms of speech and press are defined by goals.  They are 
broad but not unlimited.  The principal goal of these freedoms is to 
furnish a necessary condition for running a representative, democratic 
form of government.  Clearly, there can't be a democracy where people 
can't talk or write about politics, or campaign for or against candidates 
or tickets or policies.  More broadly, as has been said over and over 
again-not only in the opinions of the Supreme Court, but in the whole 
tradition of defending free speech and press going back to John 
Milton's Areopagitica-the purpose of this freedom is the pursuit of 
truth or-to use a phrase of which the Court is fond-the establishment of 
"a free marketplace of ideas," in which truth may emerge.  We should 
note in this context, and emphasize the fact, that the free speech and 
press clause presupposes or is founded upon a faith in human reason, as 
the Court has often said.
<P>

I think that one could stretch this a bit further and say that the 
purpose of the First Amendment is to provide people, through open 
discussion and through works of literature and art, with the opportunity 
to explore not only what is true, but also what is good and what is 
beautiful.  Nonetheless, all of these forms of expression are subject to 
rational judgment.

<center>
<h3>Drawing the Line</h3>
</center>

It may be true that works of literature and art are primarily appeals 
to the imagination and to emotion rather than to reason.  I don't quite 
agree with that opinion, because I think it relies upon a very narrow 
conception of reason.  But let's assume that it's true:  Even if a work of 
literature or art is primarily an appeal to imagination and to emotion, 
nonetheless, reason can judge what emotion is being appealed to.  We 
can look at an alleged work of art and determine whether it appeals to a 
love of beauty, to the appreciation of human good and evil, to the 
vicarious enjoyment of adventure, to the desire for a good belly laugh, 
to sexual lust, or to a sick appetite for violence.  
<P>

I am suggesting here that there are various levels and kinds of 
speech, and that reason can make judgments that distinguish them.  The 
Supreme Court, I think, agreed with this in the 1957 case of Roth v. 
U.S., when it laid down a norm for judging what is legally obscene-and 
thus constitutionally unprotected.  The test is "whether to the average 
person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant 
theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest."   
Clearly the court assumes here that the average person can judge 
this, at least in the case where the appeal to prurient interest goes far 
enough.  There will always be borderline cases; in these we should 
favor freedom.  But sometimes there isn't any real doubt.  
<P>

In 1973, in Miller v. California, the Supreme Court said that courts 
can distinguish commerce in ideas, which is protected by the First 
Amendment, from commercial exploitation of obscene material.  
Indeed, it went on to say, courts must make this distinction, because "to 
equate the free and robust exchange of ideas and political debate with 
commercial exploitation of obscene material demeans the grand 
conception of the First Amendment and its high purposes."   So, then, 
there are purposes in the First Amendment, and some of them, at least, 
are high.  The First Amendment doesn't protect all speech simply 
because it is speech, any more than freedom protects all action simply 
because it is action.  We must always ask, what kind of action?  Who is 
doing what?  And-as they say-to whom?
<P>

In a companion case, decided the same day as Miller v. California, 
the Court held that legislatures as well as courts can distinguish 
between protected and unprotected expression:
<P>

<blockquote>
The sum of experience affords an ample basis for legisla-
tures to conclude that a sensitive, key relationship of hu-
man existence, central to family life, community welfare, 
and the development of human personality, can be 
debased and distorted by crass commercial exploitation of 
sex. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Furthermore-and this is very important-the Court said: "Nothing in 
the Constitution prohibits a State from reaching such a conclusion and 
acting on it legislatively simply because there is no conclusive 
evidence or empirical data."   After all, the Court pointed out, 
legislatures have acted in many fields on indemonstrable premises, yet 
the Supreme Court has upheld their legislation.
<P>

It is utter flimflammery to insist that we have to get social scientists 
to prove that, for instance, pornography does harm.  Independently of 
any proof of harm that certain types of expression do, we can recognize 
these types as being at best worthless, and therefore not worth 
protecting.  Any rational ground for thinking that they do some harm is 
sufficient for prohibiting them.  

<center>
<h3>Answering the Absolutists</h3>
</center>

Needless to say, there is an absolutist response to all this, which it 
seems to me is reducible to two arguments.  The first is what I call the 
"pearl in the garage" argument, the argument that every expression, as 
long as it is an expression, contains (or at least may for all we know 
contain) something of value of which society would not be deprived; 
and that we should be willing to wade through an ocean of garbage to 
find it.  
<P>

I believe it is an adequate answer to this remarkable argument to 
say: "We know there is an ocean of garbage, but we do not know that 
there is a pearl in it; and even if there is a pearl, we do not know that it 
is a pearl of such great price that it is worth wading through an ocean 
of garbage to get it.  Nor do we know that we have to wade through 
this ocean of garbage to find this particular pearl, for it may be a 
thought that occurred to somebody else who was able to express it 
without burying it in an ocean of garbage."
<P>

Faced with this line of reasoning, the absolutists tend to fall back 
upon the argument of John Stuart Mill in his essay On Liberty.  The 
risks involved in allowing any limitation of expression are always 
greater than the risks involved in guaranteeing an unlimited freedom of 
speech.  To guarantee an absolutely unlimited freedom of expression 
will doubtless result in some harm, but it will always be less harm than 
is done by allowing any limitation at all upon expression.   
<P>

To hold this view requires an ideological, doctrinaire mentality-a 
mentality for which the needle on the gauge always stands either at 
zero degrees or at 180 degrees.  Yet I submit that legislation-a balance, 
as Edmund Burke said, sometimes between good and good, sometimes 
between good and evil, and sometimes even between evil and 
evil-practically always corresponds with one of the 179 degrees 
between zero and 180.
<P>

It is only the doctrinaire mentality that can insist we either 
guarantee Fanny Hill or else join the Spanish Inquisition, there being 
no middle ground.  Or that if we ban the raunchiest of X-rated films, 
we will undoubtedly end up banning Shakespeare and the Bible.  Or, as 
one noted civil libertarian has suggested, that if we allow any limitation 
whatsoever on freedom of expression, we will end up burning witches, 
as they did in 17th-century Massachusetts.
<P>

There is no reason to accept these arguments.  The whole history of 
literature contradicts them.  Take, for example, the names of 
Shakespeare, Dante, Cervantes, Moliere, Goethe, and Dostoyevsky.  
Not one of these writers lived in a regime of unlimited freedom of 
expression.  Not one of them, for that matter, lived in a liberal 
democracy.  And yet critics have compared their writings favorably 
with the very best work of Ernest Hemingway and Norman Mailer.  
Consider the history of our own country.  A regime of unlimited 
freedom of expression came in only in the 1960s.  Do we know, or 
have we any reason to believe, that American arts and letters were 
stifled before that time?  Or that we are producing better arts and letters 
today than we did prior to 1965?
<P>

I can remember when Fiorello La Guardia was the mayor of New 
York, and drove the burlesque shows and the striptease joints out of the 
city.  He simply refused to renew their licenses, and they didn't come 
back until after John Lindsay was elected mayor in 1965.  Yet the La 
Guardia years were the golden years of the Broadway musical, the 
years when we had the great shows-Oklahoma, South Pacific, The King 
and I, My Fair Lady, and so forth.  There is no ground on which 
anyone can prove that banning pornography harmed Broadway.  And I 
would say that that's true of literature generally.
<P>

All of these absolutist arguments rest upon a profound mistrust of 
the ability of average human beings to make prudent practical 
judgments.  Granted, if we let the public decide, sometimes it will go 
too far and will be too restrictive.  Sometimes.  But there is nothing that 
gives us any reason to believe that the American public is a bunch of 
frustrated Puritans held back only by the strong arm of the American 
Civil Liberties Union.
<P>

Furthermore, I think the type of arguments that are used for 
absolute freedom of speech and press undermine these freedoms in the 
long run.  Absolutists say that we have no standards by which we can 
distinguish the purposes of expression, or judge what kinds of 
expression-however coarse they may be-make at least some 
contribution to our progress.  But if we go far enough along that line, 
we will wind up wondering why the freedoms of speech and press are 
worth protecting at all.  As Walter Lippmann wrote in The Public 
Philosophy, "freedom to speak and think are not self-evident 
necessities.  It is only from the hope and the intention of discovering 
truth that freedom acquires such high public significance."  But, he 
warned, 
<P>

<blockquote>
when the chaff of silliness, baseness, and deception is so 
voluminous that it submerges the kernels of truth, freedom 
of speech may produce such frivolity, or such mischief, 
that it cannot be preserved against the demand for a 
restoration of order or of decency.  If there is a dividing 
line between liberty and license, it is where freedom of 
speech is no longer respected as a procedure of the truth 
and becomes the unrestricted right to exploit the ignorance, and to incite the passions, of the people  Then freedom is such a hullabaloo of sophistry, propaganda, special 
pleading, lobbying, and salesmanship that it is difficult to 
remember why freedom of speech is worth the pain and 
trouble of defending it.
</blockquote>

<h3>Practical Steps Against Pornography</h3>
</center>

So far I have argued only that the First Amendment does not bar all 
regulation of expression, and that obscenity is not constitutionally 
protected.  The practical question of what kind of regulation citizens 
can advocate with any hope of having it accepted is a more difficult 
one.  Such citizen-advocates are up against a deep-seated prejudice in 
the minds of many Americans, who may not know much about the 
Constitution, but are convinced that the First Amendment guarantees 
everyone's absolute right to say, hear, read, and view whatever he 
pleases.  This conviction has been fostered in their minds by liberal 
academics, journalists, and entertainers, all of whom have an obvious 
interest in it.  It is now the prevailing orthodoxy in the law schools, and 
has heavily influenced the courts.
<P>

The odds are therefore against the success of efforts to restrict the 
production and dissemination of pornography, but they are not 
hopelessly great.  Concerned citizens should make such efforts, but 
with care and caution.  The first piece of advice that I would offer is: 
don't go for the gold.  Do not seek sweeping pieces of legislation that 
ban everything that someone finds pornographic.  Begin with the hard-
core stuff that is clearly pornographic.  
<P>

On the other hand, the purpose should be to ban the sale of 
pornography, not merely to keep porn shops and movie houses a 
certain distance from schools and churches.  If the freedom of speech 
absolutists fear that they may not be able to prevent some restriction of 
pornography, they will offer that sort of "compromise."  It should not 
be accepted!  Acceptance would imply that pornography, no matter 
how raw, is protected by the First Amendment and is, at most, subject 
to regulation of where it may be sold.  
<P>

A proposed ordinance offered to a city council or state legislature 
should clearly specify what it intends to prohibit, in language that the 
courts will find hard to declare unconstitutional on the ground that it is 
"vague and overbroad."  The courts hold, reasonably enough, that the 
law may not punish a man for violating the law, when it did not tell 
him clearly what it forbade him to do.  Some judges, of course, will 
find any law vague and overbroad that puts any limits on "expression," 
but we should not play into their hands by using loose legal language.
<P>

A proposed ordinance should also be accompanied by a well-
thought out statement of reasons for restricting the sale of this kind of 
pornography.  It need not and should not seek to prove that 
pornography has done direct, tangible, assignable harm to individuals, 
or has been the cause of crimes committed by particular persons.  A 
rational case, however, which abstains from off-putting moralistic 
language, can be made for the connection between the material sought 
to be banned and harm to society, along the lines of Miller v. 
California.  This case will support the constitutionality of the proposed 
legislation.  
<P>

Finally, the citizen group or groups sponsoring the legislation will 
have to take steps to arouse public opinion and win public support for 
the ordinance.  That will require a certain amount of leg work.  
If that sounds like a big order, well, it is.  But it can be done by 
dedicated people who are willing to put time, effort and money into it.  
They should seek advice from organizations that have long been active 
in the fight against pornography and know what can succeed and what 
will likely fail.  Among such organizations are:
<P>

American Family Association<BR>
P.O. Box 2440<BR>

</blockquote>

<P>
If possible, the proponents of an anti-pornography ordinance should 
ask the help of a good lawyer who is on their side and believes in their 
cause-perhaps a friendly law school professor who is well versed in the 
constitutional law of speech and press.  
<P>

The citizen group, therefore, should survey the field, seek advice on 
where to get the kind of lawyer or lawyers that it needs, and carefully 
choose the place in which to seek the desired legislation.  It would not 
be wise to begin with New York or San Francisco.  Better to pick a city 
or a state where victory is possible, and the local courts are likely to 
sustain the legislation.  From that point on, as George Washington said 
in his Farewell Address, let us raise a standard to which the wise and 
the good may repair; the event is in the hands of God.

<h1>Homosexuality,<BR>
Public Health, and Civil Rights</h1>

<hr size=4 align=center>

<h3>Daniel C. Palm</h3>


The 1972 Gay Rights Platform1 contained the following demands:
<P>

<ul>
<LI>Amend all federal Civil Rights Acts, other legislation and government 
controls to prohibit discrimination in employment, housing, public 
accommodations and public services.

<LI>A presidential order prohibiting the military from excluding for reasons of their sexual orientation, persons who of their own volition desire entrance into the Armed Services; and from issuing less than fully-honorable discharges for homosexuality; and the upgrading to fully honorable all such discharges previously issued, with retroactive benefits.

<LI>A presidential order prohibiting discrimination in the federal civil service because of sexual orientation, in hiring and promoting; and prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals in security clearances.

<LI>Elimination of tax inequities [favoring traditional families].

<LI>Elimination of bars to the entry, immigration and naturalization of homosexual aliens.

<LI>Federal encouragement and support for sex education courses, prepared and taught by [homosexuals], presenting homosexuality as a valid, healthy preference and . . . a viable alternative to heterosexuality.

<LI>Federal funding of aid programs of [homosexual] organizations designed to alleviate the problems encountered by [homosexuals].

</ul>

The document made similar demands of states, including:
<P>

<ul>

<LI>Repeal of all state laws prohibiting solicitation for private voluntary sexual liaisons; and laws prohibiting prostitution, both male and female.

<LI>[L]egislation prohibiting insurance companies and any other state-regulated enterprises from discriminating because of sexual orientation, in insurance and in bonding or any other prerequisite to employment or control of one's personal demesne.

<LI>[L]egislation so that child custody, adoption, visitation rights, foster parenting, and the like shall not be denied because of sexual orientation or marital status.

<LI>Repeal of all laws prohibiting transvestism and cross dressing.

<LI>Repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent.

<LI>Repeal of all legislative provisions that restrict the sex or number of persons entering into a marriage unit; and the extension of legal benefits to all persons who cohabit regardless of sex or numbers.
</ul>
<P>

Two decades later, especially at the federal level, most of these demands have been met.  Nor do signs look good for  a quick reversal of this trend:  The descriptive word "homosexual" has been replaced by the perfectly nondescriptive word "gay."  Opponents of homosexuality are said to be afflicted with "homophobia."  The media and academic elites are actively supporting the organized homosexual line.  Politicians routinely court the "homosexual vote" in the same way they court, for example, the votes of farmers.  "The love that dare not speak its name" is fast becoming "the love that no one dares to question."
<P>

Defenders of morality have a tough row to hoe.  They must begin by sensibly recasting the terms of the debate.  This means, first, addressing sex-related diseases as health issues rather than civil rights issues.  Second, it means distinguishing the civil rights of all Americans under the Constitution from the special rights demanded by organized homosexuals.  
<h3>Homosexuality and the Public Health</h3>

While AIDS has destroyed the lives of non-homosexuals through intravenous drug use, blood transfusions, or promiscuity, until recently the disease has been primarily spread among homosexuals.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control reports that 64 percent of all adult/adolescent AIDS cases and 79 percent of AIDS cases among Caucasians in the U.S. were acquired through homosexual contact.  Ninety-one percent of American AIDS cases have been traced to homosexual sex, intravenous drug use, or some combination of the two.2
<P>

Homosexuals also continue to contract and spread other diseases at rates significantly higher than the community at large.  These include syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis A and B, a variety of intestinal parasites including amebiasis and giardiasis, and even typhoid fever.3  This is because rectal intercourse or sodomy, typically practiced by homosexuals, is one of the most efficient methods of transmitting disease.  Why?  Because nature designed the human rectum for a single purpose: expelling waste from the body.  It is built of a thin layer of columnar cells, different in structure than the plate cells that line the female reproductive tract.  Because the wall of the rectum is so thin, it is easily ruptured during anal intercourse, allowing semen, blood, feces, and saliva to directly enter the bloodstream.  The chances for infection increase further when multiple partners are involved, as is frequently the case:  Surveys indicate that American male homosexuals average between 10 and 110 sex partners per year.4  
<P>

Not surprisingly, these diseases shorten life expectancy.  Social psychologist Paul Cameron compared over 6,200 obituaries from homosexual magazines and tabloids to a comparable number of obituaries from major American newspapers.  He found that while the median age of death of married American males was 75, for sexually active homo-sexual American males it was 42.  For homosexual males infected with the AIDS virus, it was 39.  While 80 percent of married American men lived to 65 or older, less than two percent of the homosexual men covered in the survey lived as long.5
<P>
 
In the face of these facts, it is reprehensible that Americans, and especially American schoolchildren, are being told today that homosexual behavior can be safe.  Condoms are no god-send:  estimates of condom failure run from 15.7 to as high as 44 percent.  Breakage is even more likely with rectal intercourse, where the wear and tear on condoms is obviously greater.  
<P>

Because smokers don't live as long as non-smokers, society considers smoking harmful and discourages the use of tobacco.  By the same logic, aren't homosexual practices deserving of social disapproval?  
<h3>Civil Rights and Special Rights</h3>
The gay rights movement's main rhetorical ploy is to liken itself to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s.  The extent to which this line is successful reflects a confusion about the meaning of "rights" in the public mind.  
<P>

The charter of American liberty, the Declaration of Independence, explains that human beings are born with "certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."  These rights belong to people equally.  No human being is so superior to another that he may treat the other as he would treat an irrational beast.  This is the argument that Abraham Lincoln hearkened back to during the Civil War, and Martin Luther King, Jr. during the 1960s.  Unlike people in most countries, Americans have been able to enjoy these rights, because the American Constitution sets up a government that is limited in what it can do.  
<P>

Consider the claimed comparison between the gay rights movement and the civil rights movement in light of this.  An obvious difference is that the former is centered around a type of behavior, namely sodomy.  Is there a constitutional right to sodomy which can be deduced from our equal natural rights, such as there is, say, to practice our religion or speak our mind?  No.  
<P>

At the time of the American founding, and following the tradition of English common law, sodomy was a criminal or common law offense in each of the 13 states.  Until 1961, all 50 states considered sodomy a punishable offense.  It remains illegal today in 23 states and the District of Columbia, and in many of these stands as a felony offense.  At the federal level, the question was dealt with in the Supreme Court's 1986 decision, Bowers v. Hardwick.  The defendants in the case had asked the Court to proclaim, in effect, "a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy."  "This," wrote Justice Byron White in delivering the Court's decision, "we are quite unwilling to do."6  
<P>

More deeply, sodomy is unnatural and, as such, incompatible with any notion of natural rights.  We know that human beings are entitled to their liberty because they are, by nature, capable of reasoning and of choosing.  This is precisely the faculty that identifies a human being, among all the other beings in nature.  We are entitled to civil rights, because we are the one creature equipped by nature to exercise them.
<P>

Human beings also have other aspects to their nature, aspects that are not unique to them and are not such noble features of their makeup.  One is their method of sexual reproduction.  And make no mistake: despite the astonishing denials of organized homosexuality, human beings, as surely as deer or elephants, come equipped with a natural method of reproduction.  Unlike in other species, however, these lower aspects in man share in man's higher aspect, reason.  The result is the virtue of temperence or self-control.  The Founders of America understood that our rights stem from this capacity, the capacity for moral virtue.7  
<P>

Homosexuals like to argue that, since people are by nature free to choose, the choice of sodomy should be protected, at least as much as any other choice.  But the fact that people are free by nature to make choices does not mean that any choice they make is good or that all choices should be equal before the law.  Some people choose to steal and to lie.  Some abandon their children or their wives or husbands. Some sink into the grip of drugs.  Some evade the draft at their country's need, or abandon their duty in the face of battle.  These are bad choices, and when they are made, the rest of us must bear part of the cost.  These things are wrong in a democracy, as much as they are wrong anywhere else.
<P>

On the other hand, liberal societies recognize that all sins cannot be, and must not be, punished under the law.  A state powerful enough to do that is too powerful to control.  That is why we are cautious, in a free country, about telling others what to do.  That is why our presidents often appeal to us to be upright, moral citizens, but they do not bring charges against us unless we break the law. 
<P>

Still we must not forget that democracies have the greatest interest in the practice of virtue by citizens, because in democracy the citizens themselves are the rulers.  So it is that George Washington, one of the greatest moral examples in history, said in his First Inaugural Address: "there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness . . ."  
<P>

A liberal society might, then, find it prudent to ignore homosexuality.  It might well deem it unwise to peer into private bedrooms.  But this is not the issue before us.  Today the demand is not that people be allowed their privacy.  The demand is that homosexuality be endorsed and promoted with the full power of the law.  This would require us to abandon the standard of nature, the one standard that can teach us the difference between freedom and slavery, between right and wrong. 
<P>

Once we abandon the standard of nature, what is to forbid us from resorting to any violation of nature that we may please?  Why should we not return to slavery, if we find it convenient?  Or the practices of incest or adultery or cannibalism?  Without an understanding that there is a higher law that limits human will-whether divine law or a "law of Nature and Nature's God" which we can grasp through our reason-there is no basis to prohibit any activity.  Anything becomes permissible.
<P>

In fact, the rights sought by homosexual activists are not natural or constitutional rights.  They are the special rights granted ethnic minorities by affirmative action policies.  These special rights would force businesses, schools, and virtually every institution in the land, public and private, to open their doors to homosexuals, and allow lawsuits to be brought against those that refuse.  
<P>

To be considered a specially-protected minority under the law, a group must meet several tests, as determined by a series of Supreme Court decisions.  Its members must be identifiable by an unchanging physical condition-e.g., skin color, gender, handicap.  They must be able to demonstrate that they have suffered discrimination to the extent that they are unable to earn an average income, receive an adequate education, or enjoy a fulfilling cultural life.  And they must show that their members are politically powerless to change their predicament.8 
<P>

To date, the homosexual lobby has been unable to prove that its members meet these requirements.  There is no evidence-statistical or otherwise-that homosexuals are suffering any practical or political disadvantages.  They have never been denied the right to vote or other constitutional rights, nor have they suffered segregation under the law, nor have they been denied access to public facilities.  Several U.S. Congressmen, Senators, and prominent state legislators are openly homosexual, as are high-level members of present and recent presidential administrations.  Statistically, homosexuals enjoy higher economic standards than average Americans.9   Any claim to political powerlessness is belied by how politicians today-especially Democratic politicians-court the "homosexual vote."  
<P>

It is easy to see the difference between civil and constitutional rights and the special rights sought by homosexuals by considering the controversy over "gays" in the military.  First: there is no civil right to join the military.  People are refused entrance for numerous reasons, e.g., age, intelligence, physical handicap, criminal record.  Second: the racial integration of the armed forces (to which proponents of "sexual preference integration" like to point) was part of the proper expansion of constitutional rights because race was an irrational (hence unconstitutional) basis of discrimination.  Those who thought blacks were different in behavior were simply prejudiced-they were wrong.  Those who think homosexuals behave differently are self-evidently right.  The word "homosexual," unlike the words "black" or "brown" or "yellow," denotes precisely a different behavior.  In this case, those who deny a difference are being irrational.  
<P>

As summed up by a veteran of the civil rights movement: "The road to Selma was not the road to Sodom."
Near-term Measures
There is no indication that the Supreme Court will strike down the remaining state anti-sodomy laws.  Thus the organized homosexual offensive operates primarily in two areas:  incorporating homosexual propaganda into public school curricula and promoting special "anti-discrimination laws" in states and cities.
<P>

In combatting this offensive, generally speaking, debates about Biblical doctrine, the percentage of the homosexual population, or whether homosexuality is genetic or psychological in origin, are fruitless and allow homosexual activists to obscure the main points on which the political battles will be won or lost: public health and civil rights.10  
  Champions of morality should really go on the offensive themselves on the issue of homosexuality as a public health hazard.  A good place to do so is before the governing boards of public schools, where homosexuality (when practiced "safely") is often presented as an acceptable alternate lifestyle.  The principle of the matter is simple: Parents must not tolerate anyone in a position of authority telling their children that anal intercourse is acceptable or can be safe.  
<P>

The public must be educated to the fact that homosexuality is associated with higher rates of disease, and why.  Then it must be mobilized to force the hand of school boards and state education commissions either to teach the benefits of traditional morality or to leave the job of sex education to families.
<P>

The best recent example of this sort of offensive campaign is the toppling of New York City's Chancellor Joseph Fernandez by an outraged public mobilized by a retired public school teacher from Brooklyn.  Parents became incensed when they learned that the curriculum (entitled "Children of the Rainbow") portrayed homosexuality in a favorable light to children as young as eleven years. 11  
<P>

As for defense: A successful campaign against giving special rights to homosexuals was waged in Colorado in 1992.12  Citizens were convinced to prohibit laws and ordinances requiring them to hire and accept homosexuals as tenants, teachers, employees, day-care providers, health care workers, ministers, etc.  They were convinced primarily by arguments about fairness and equity.  Pro-Amendment 2 campaign literature (often presented in myth/fact format) argued that while homosexuals ought to enjoy the same constitutional rights as other Americans, they ought not be granted rights and privileges above and beyond the rights of others.  

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The case against organized homosexuality is twofold.  First, nature rewards healthy living habits with good health.  It is abundantly clear that homosexual behavior is unnatural and unhealthy, and it is odd that such behavior is applauded in an age that worships nature and bodily good health, even to the exclusion of other good things.
<P>

Secondly, Americans are exceedingly tolerant.  They are not as a rule inclined to dig around in each others' private lives.  But they still believe that there is right and wrong.  They reject the absurd claim that the constitutional principle of equality before the law means that all behavior, no matter how heinous, is equally okay.  And on the basis of this distinction, they can be mobilized against laws that give homosexuals special legal standing to bully the rest of us.

<h1>Turning the Tide on Abortion</h1>
</center>
<hr size=4 align=center>

<h3>Glen E. Thurow</h3>

Family life was quite sturdy in America until the 1960s.  For one 
thing, the family had the support of the law.  Laws were designed to 
promote a strong sense of responsibility to one's family and country.  
This responsibility has been undermined by the laws passed since the 
sexual revolution and the launching of the welfare state in the 1960s.  
One of the most dramatic changes along these lines was the 1973 
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
<P>

America now has the most liberal abortion laws in the world.  Over 
1.5 million abortions take place here every year.   This is not solely an 
"underclass" phenomenon, as many seem to believe.  Abortion is 
prevalent among middle-class and upper-class young girls who, in 
effect, use this procedure as a form of birth control.   No other fact, 
perhaps, more graphically illustrates our delining moral sense and 
increasing confusion of constitutional liberty with personal license.

<center>
<h3>Abortion and Slavery</h3>
</center>

Today's abortion controversy is similar in a couple of instructive 
ways to the slavery controversy of the 1850s.  In both controversies, 
the fundamental issue for Americans was and is the meaning of the 
claim of the Declaration of Independence that "all men are created 
equal" and possess "unalienable rights" that include "life, liberty and 
the pursuit of happiness."  Who is included in the "men" who are 
created equal?  The pro-slavery forces said that Negroes were not 
created equal, and today's pro-abortion forces say that babies who are 
still in their mother's wombs are not included.
<P>

The constitutional and political arguments are similar as well.  The 
pro-abortion forces have succeeded in getting the Supreme Court to 
endorse their views and to impose them on the other branches of 
government and the people.  In the 1854 case of Dred Scott v. Sanford, 
the Court held that Negroes were not "men" and had no rights 
enforceable by federal courts.  In the 1973 case of Roe v. Wade, the 
Court held that unborn children were not "persons" and therefore have 
no constitutional rights.
<P>

Both cases held that a part of the human race have no rights; both 
also claimed that the government has no power to extend protections to 
the disfavored groups even should the people desire to do so.  The 
Dred Scott majority held that the government had no power to prohibit 
slavery in the hitherto free territories of the United States, and Roe held 
that no government could prohibit or even substantially restrict the 
killing of the unborn.  There is a constitutional right to make a black 
man one's slave in federal territory, proclaimed the Court in 1854; there 
is a constitutional right to kill the unborn, proclaims the contemporary 
Court.

<center>
<h3>Corruption of the Moral Sense</h3>
</center>

Our sense of right and wrong depends upon our recognition of our 
common humanity-the recognition that there is no inequality among us 
that entitles one person arbitrarily to kill or enslave or otherwise 
mistreat another human being.  In both the cases of slavery and 
abortion, the country's highest and most revered legal authority has 
tried to erase from the American conscience the awareness of the 
common humanity that binds us to another part of the human race.
This has proved to be a harder task to accomplish than the judges 
thought.  It is not easy to erase our natural sense of justice towards our 
fellow human beings.  Abraham Lincoln noted that the injustice of 
slavery was 
<P>

<blockquote>
so plain that no one, high or low, ever does mistake it, 
except in a plainly selfish way; for although volume upon 
volume is written to prove slavery a very good thing, we 
never hear of the man who wishes to take the good of it, 
by <i>being a slave himself</i>.
</blockquote>

<P>
Just as it was impossible for even slaveholders to consistently deny that 
the Negro slave was an human being, so it is difficult to deny that the 
unborn child is human.  Thus except for a small minority, even 
abortion-rights supporters, to some extent or another, are shocked by 
the large numbers of abortions performed each year.
<P>

After all, what is the growth in the womb if not a human baby?  It is 
certainly not some other kind of animal.  Nor is it simply part of the 
mother.  If it were, we would treat it like other parts of the human 
body: we do not allow people to remove their livers or appendices just 
because they feel like it, but only if such organs are diseased and 
therefore dangerous to the person's general health.  Is it then a tumor, a 
diseased growth within the human body?  Of course not.  It is a 
developing and growing baby-weak, dependent, perhaps not yet able to 
breathe if separated from his or her mother-but undeniably human.
Just as people had to steel themselves not to see the humanity in the 
slave baby, so people today must hide the humanity of the unborn baby 
from themselves in order to believe that it is proper to kill him or her.  
Our natural feeling of connection with the growing baby in the 
mother's womb has to be destroyed.  
<P>

The abortion movement has developed an elaborate language of 
euphemisms to hide reality.  As people called African-Americans such 
derisive terms as "nigger" in order to deny their full humanity, today 
the flesh in the mother's womb is a "fetus," never an "unborn child."  
"It" is only "potential life," as though nothing has to be killed in order 
to perform an abortion.  An abortion is only a "medical procedure" like 
any other medical procedure, as though it were an operation designed 
to restore health rather than to kill a growing baby.  The movement is 
the "pro-choice" movement, not the "pro-abortion" movement, as 
though there were some other choice than the choice to have an 
abortion at stake.
<P>

Even the word "abortion" hides what is being aborted.  Until 
recently a very common colloquial expression when a medically 
necessary abortion was performed was to say "they had to 'take the 
baby'," implying both taking the baby out of the mother's womb and 
taking the life of a human baby.  This delicate but revealing and honest 
speech has been replaced by antiseptic euphemisms that subtly but 
effectively erode and neutralize our moral sense.  
<P>

But this deadening of the moral sense with respect to the unborn 
child does not stop there.  If, in being honest with ourselves, we cannot 
deny that the growing fetus is a growing human being, where do we 
draw the line between this human being and other human beings such 
that we have the right to kill this one, but not the others?  Is it because 
the unborn child is weak and dependent?  Then do we have the right to 
kill the old, or those who are sick, or those who require apparatus to 
assist their breathing?  Is it because the baby in the womb cannot think 
or is not fully developed?  Then do we have the right to kill post-natal 
babies?  Is it because we think the unborn cannot feel pain?  Then do 
we have the right to kill those to whom we first administer pain-killers?
As Abraham Lincoln once memorably said, "You say A is white 
and B is black.  It is color, then; the lighter, having the right to enslave 
the darker?  Take care.  By this rule, you are to be slave to the first man 
you meet with a fairer skin than your own."   Any argument that could 
be used to justify Negro enslavement would also justify the 
enslavement of at least some white men.  So, too, the killing unleashed 
by the opinion that it is proper to kill the unborn cannot permanently be 
restricted to the unborn because the same arguments justify killing at 
least some other human beings-the sick, the old, the dependent, or the 
inconvenient.  

<center>
<h3>Corruption of the Political Sense</h3>
</center>

Roe v. Wade also corrupts the Constitution and our understanding 
of it.  Like Dred Scott, which found a ringing defense of slavery in a 
document that does not even mention slavery, so Roe found a right of 
abortion, based upon a right of privacy, in a document that mentions 
neither abortion nor privacy.  Nor does Roe simply make an error in the 
way in which it reads the Constitution; it relies upon a view of the 
Constitution that destroys the authority of the people and the rule of 
law that are at the heart of constitutional government.
<P>

In the great case of Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice John 
Marshall stated the principles of American constitutional government 
in their classic form.  He noted that the Constitution's authority rested 
on the "original right" of the people "to establish, for the future 
government, such principles as, in their opinion, shall most conduce to 
their own happiness."  These principles are "fundamental" and are 
"designed to be permanent." 
<P>

The American Constitution established a government of limited 
powers, reserving the remaining powers to the states or the people.  It 
required a government of laws and is itself, as the "supreme law," the 
crowning part of the rule of law, binding and controlling all other acts 
and laws.  As Marshall put it, "The distinction between a government 
with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if those limits do not 
confine the persons on whom they are imposed."  This power was to be 
enforced by impartial judges.  But those judges themselves were to be 
limited by being subordinate to the Constitution.  "The framers of the 
Constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government 
of courts, as well as of the legislature."   This means that it is the duty 
of judges to discern what was intended by any provision of the 
Constitution and to make their rulings in accordance with those 
intentions, rather than in accordance with their own desires and 
preferences.
<P>

These principles-the fundamental authority of the people, the rule 
of law, and the subordination of judges as well as others to the 
Constitution-are all undermined by Roe v. Wade.  Instead of a set of 
principles or laws, whose intended meaning can be found by judges 
and to which they must conform, the Constitution is regarded by the 
Court in Roe as a collection of vague clauses which suggest principles 
to judges that have nothing to do with the Framers' intentions.  Roe 
relies upon a "right of privacy" to prohibit laws restricting abortion.  
But this "right" is nowhere explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  
Nor is there any clause to which it can be clearly attached.
<P>
The Court suggests, not that the "right" itself, but that its "roots" can 
be found in various constitutional provisions.  But even the location of 
the "roots" is extremely vague.  The roots may be found, for example, 
in "penumbras" of the Bill of Rights (as though there were ghosts 
walking through the Constitution visible only to judges).  While citing 
the Fourth Amendment as possible authority for its decision, the Court 
does not bother even to try to show how it could be reasonable to think 
that the American people, in prohibiting unreasonable searches and 
seizures, intended to prohibit laws regulating abortions.  In spite of its 
own confessed inability to say where the right of privacy is even 
"rooted," the Court nevertheless considered itself free to rule that this 
right "is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or 
not to terminate her pregnancy," and thereby to take this vital moral 
question out of the hands of a self governing people and place it in 
those of nine judges.
<P>

While hiding behind a facade of being faithful to the Constitution, 
such reasoning almost entirely frees judges from the constraints of the 
Constitution.  They simply declare their own preferences to be the 
"supreme Law of the Land."  When its guardians are freed from its 
rule, the rule of law itself is destroyed, and what passes as "law" is in 
fact only the particular preferences of judges.  The authority of the 
Constitution disappears and, along with it, the authority of the people 
as well.  
<P>

The people's authority in our political order is expressed both in the 
Constitution itself, and in the laws and acts made by the people's 
elected representatives.  But when the judges sweep the Constitution 
aside in favor of their own preferences, and prohibit the people from 
making laws through their legislatures that might oppose those 
preferences, then the people's authority and self government ceases.  As 
Lincoln said in his First Inaugural Address:
<P>

<blockquote>
[I]f the policy of the government, upon vital questions, 
affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by 
decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, 
in ordinary litigation between parties, in personal actions, 
the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having 
to that extent, practically resigned their government, into 
the hands of that eminent tribunal. 
</blockquote>

<center>
<h3>Answering Pro-Abortion Arguments</h3>
</center>

Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's opponent in the Lincoln-Douglas 
debates, maintained that the issue raised by the slavery controversy was 
not the rightness or wrongness of slavery, but the right of people in the 
states to choose for themselves whether to have slavery or not.  
"Choice" (or "popular sovereignty" as Douglas called it) was the 
issue.   The parallel today is obvious; many people who support 
unrestricted abortions even go so far as to say that they personally 
oppose abortion but believe it is the right of the mother to choose for 
herself whether to kill the infant or not.  Like Douglas, they say that the 
issue is free choice.  Also like Douglas, they claim that those on the 
other side are fanatics (Black Republicans, Douglas liked to call them) 
who want to impose their own beliefs and destroy free choice.
<p>

To this argument Lincoln replied that this would be true were slaves 
not men.  There are certain things people do not have a right to choose, 
and one of them is to make another man their slave, for our own 
freedom to choose rests upon our being human.  Freedom is not 
restricted by prohibiting slavery; it is enlarged, for freedom cannot be 
secure without the recognition that other men are equally entitled to be 
free.
<P>

Similarly the argument that what is at stake in the abortion 
controversy is the freedom or choice of the mother rests on the premise 
that the unborn child is not human.  It does not enlarge freedom for one 
human being to be legally entitled to choose to kill another; it restricts 
freedom because it says, as even the majority in Roe v. Wade 
recognized, that some group has no rights.  The fundamental issue is 
not choice but whether the unborn child is human and therefore 
whether it is right or wrong to kill him or her.
<P>

A second argument made to obscure the moral question is that the 
only grounds for believing that the unborn is human is religious 
conviction, and that our belief in religious freedom requires us to keep 
religious opinions from influencing public policy and law.  Both of 
these contentions are false.  
<P>

As suggested above, not only religious conviction, but common 
sense suggests that the fetus is a growing and developing human being.  
It is as obvious as it is that both blacks and whites belong to the same 
human race.  Some say that science cannot tell us when human life 
begins.  But this argument uses the tendency of science to see the 
development of life as a continuum to obscure what no medical 
scientist would deny.  Contrary to the implications of this argument, 
medical science is perfectly able to distinguish a growing baby from a 
tumor or an organ, and knows with certainty that from the time of the 
union and implantation of egg and sperm a human being and not some 
other creature is developing.
<P>

Furthermore, even insofar as the view that a fetus is human 
coincides with religious teachings, it is perfectly legitimate for it to 
influence the law.  To think otherwise is to grossly misunderstand and 
pervert the meaning of religious freedom; it would say that only 
atheists have a right to influence public policy.  The First Amendment 
is not a grant of the government's power to atheists and an exclusion of 
religious people, but a guarantee that people are free to worship God in 
the way they choose.  As long as the opinions one gains from one's 
religion do not infringe on the right of others to worship God in a 
different way, those opinions can properly influence public policy and 
law.  Indeed, at the heart of the American experiment is a religious 
opinion that all men are "endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights."  To remove religious opinions from our public life 
would be to destroy the fundamental conviction that lies at the heart of 
our country.

<center>
<h3>Molding Public Sentiment </h3>
</center>

In resisting slavery advocates, Lincoln always kept the central 
objective closely in mind.  That objective was to restore the nation to 
the principle that all men are created equal by making the opinion that 
slavery was wrong the ruling opinion of the country.  As he put it, "He 
who molds public sentiment goes deeper that he who enacts statutes 
and pronounces decisions.  He makes statutes or decisions possible or 
impossible to execute."   The central task today is to reestablish in our 
public opinion the conviction that the unborn child is entitled to the 
right to life that we grant to other human beings.  If that conviction is 
present, no court or other obstacle can long stand in its way.
<P>

There may be a tendency to look at the current political situation 
and despair over the issue of abortion.  Pro-abortion forces seem to be 
gaining strength.  The current President not only does not want to use 
the law to restrict abortion, but favors promoting abortion as a means 
of birth control at least in foreign countries and to some extent in ours.  
<P>

The Supreme Court has yet to overturn Roe v. Wade and is not likely to 
do so in the near future, especially with the current likelihood that new 
judges who are committed to it will be appointed to the Court.  Only 
the Congress remains something of a question mark, but its anti-
abortion majority of a few years ago is no longer in control.
But this is no reason to lose heart.  The democratic mechanism of 
elections ensure that the people may bring about change when the 
government goes astray.  In order to accomplish such a task today, 
opponents of abortion must work to persuade people of the justice of 
the cause.  And they must be willing to unite with all those who would 
move the country in the direction of reinstating the opinion that 
abortion is a bad thing to be avoided rather than a good thing to be 
encouraged.
<P>

To persuade as many people as possible of the justice of their cause 
requires three things: the first is to lay the foundations of the pro-life 
argument on the widest possible basis.  The central task is to restore the 
conviction among Americans that it is wrong to kill unborn children.  
What exceptions there might be to this rule is a secondary issue best 
decided at this point on the basis of what will attract the largest number 
of people.  Once people are convinced that killing the unborn is bad, 
they can be trusted to make a reasonable judgment about what 
exceptions might be good or tolerable.
<P>

The second thing required is to recognize and acknowledge the 
right of people to make up their own minds on this issue.  
Demonstrations are useful to call the issue to people's attention, but 
force, threats, or intimidation do not persuade.  Moral reformation 
comes from the heart and cannot simply be compelled.  Again, as 
Lincoln said so well, 
<P>

<blockquote>
When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, 
persuasion, kind, unassuming persuasion, should ever be 
adopted.  It is an old and a true maxim, that a 'drop of 
honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' 
</blockquote>

<P>
Third, pro-lifers must understand and present their cause as part of 
a larger cause-the revival of strong families through welfare reform, tax 
reform, education reform, etc.  They must make it clear that they are 
not simply out to save lives but to ensure that the babies they save will 
be brought up in a healthy family environment, and provided with the 
opportunity to prosper that has been America's hallmark.  

<center> 
<h3>Politics and Community Action</h3>
</center>

Thought and reflection are opponents of abortion.  They must be 
fostered both in the individual women who are immediately faced with 
the choice of life and death for their babies, and in society at large.  
Pro-lifers should support private institutions that seek to inform women 
of the alternatives to taking the lives of their babies, and work to bring 
about laws that will encourage time for thought and good advice.  
Parental notification laws, waiting periods, laws requiring that women 
be informed of alternatives to abortion, and similar laws, are all 
permitted under current judicial rulings, and should be promoted in all 
50 states.  Of course, at the same time a majority must be maintained in 
Congress that will oppose laws like the so-called "Freedom of Choice 
Act," which would prevent the states from passing these reasonable 
laws.
<P>

To work to secure passage of these kinds of laws has the additional 
advantage that they are considered eminently reasonable by the 
majority of the American public.  Opposition to these laws is an 
Achilles heel of the pro-abortion movement.  It is clearly irrational to 
oppose laws that simply encourage women to reflect before acting or to 
consult with someone who has a more mature judgment than a young 
girl is likely to have.  In opposing these laws pro-abortion groups 
discredit themselves in the public eye, unmasking their apparent 
concern for the welfare and informed choice of the woman.
<P>

To show this concern themselves, pro-lifers can put the energy now 
put into demonstrating to establish and maintain groups and institutions 
that provide support to pregnant mothers who might be tempted 
otherwise to kill their babies.  Support for groups providing adoption 
services and fostering healthy family lives are needed badly.
It is not possible to predict when the dominant opinion in the 
country can be turned around to actively recognize the common 
humanity of the unborn.  But the day will come if the pro-life 
movement holds firm to America's central principle of human equality, 
and is flexible and tolerant and broadminded in order to attract the 
largest number possible to support a step-by-step revival of the sturdy 
American family.

<title>Moral Ideas for America, Progressive Income Tax</title>

<h1>The Progressive Income Tax and the Progressive Attack on the Founding</h1>
</center>

<hr size=4 align=center>

<h3>Edward J. Erler</h3>

The passage of the Sixteenth Amendment (the Income Tax 
Amendment) in 1913 was part of a larger decision by America's 
political and intellectual elites to make sweeping and fundamental 
changes in America.  These changes were calculated to transform the 
limited constitutional government of the Framers into what is today 
called the welfare state.  The principal goal of the welfare state is not 
the protection of the individual rights and liberties of citizens, but the 
promotion of a concept of "social justice" that is alien to the principles 
of the American founding.  What is more, proponents of the welfare 
state believe that individual liberty (i.e., equal opportunity and property 
rights) is incompatible with social justice.

<center>
<h3>The Rise of Class Politics</h3>
</center>

In the same year that the Sixteenth Amendment was passed, Charles 
Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United 
States was published.  This work, in many respects the culminating 
achievement of the Progressive movement, was a thinly veiled Marxist 
analysis of the Constitution.  According to Beard, the Constitution, like 
every other human endeavor, was the product of class struggle.  What 
made the class struggle for the American Constitution different was the 
fact that it was waged largely in secret and by indirection.  Instead of 
viewing the Framers of the Constitution as genuinely public-spirited 
patriots, Beard preferred to see them as members of the propertied elite 
who created the Constitution merely to aggrandize their own class 
interests at the expense of the political rights of the majority.  And 
while the Constitution does not at first glance appear to be an 
"economic document," the "true inwardness of the Constitution" is 
revealed by the "economic interests" of those who framed and 
supported the Constitution. 
<P>

Beard's purpose was "to expose the undemocratic nature of the 
Constitution, to unmask its hidden features in order to show that it 
deserved no veneration, no respect, and should carry no authority to 
democratic Americans of the twentieth century."   The Constitution, 
while presenting a democratic facade, is, in reality, an elaborate scheme 
that allowed predatory minorities (the propertied, the wealthy, the 
holders of public securities, speculators) to dominate and effectively 
disenfranchise the majority.  As another prominent Progressive,     J. 
Allen Smith, noted, "the Constitution was in form a political document, 
but its significance was mainly economic.  It was the outcome of an 
organized movement on the part of a class to surround themselves with 
legal and constitutional guarantees which would check the tendency 
toward democratic legislation."   The Constitution was, in short, an 
oligarchy masquerading as a democracy.
<P>

In the view of the Progressives, one of the more powerful 
institutional devices created by the Framers to prevent majority rule 
was the separation of powers.  Far from being a necessary principle of 
limited government ("an essential precaution in favor of liberty" in 
Madison's terms), separation of powers was portrayed by Beard as 
nothing more than a barrier to democratic rule.  Whereas Hamilton, 
Madison, and the other leading Framers thought that the Supreme 
Court, one of the three separated branches of government, would be an 
independent tribunal serving as the guardian of individual rights and 
liberties, the Progressives argued that the Supreme Court has merely 
served as the guardian of property rights and propertied interests 
against the popular will. 
<P>

This debunking of the Constitution was intended to be a prelude to 
radical reform-a conscious effort to change the Constitution from one 
of limited government to one of unlimited government.  The explicit 
goal of this reform was not the greater protection of rights and liberties 
of individuals, but a newly discovered sense of justice based on the 
redistribution of wealth.  In practical terms it was necessary to reform 
the Constitution to reflect the priority of the welfare of the community 
(or the state) over the rights of individuals.  One lamentable result of 
this project was that Beard and the Progressives made the rhetoric of 
class politics respectable for the first time in American history.  
Although the details of Beard's economic thesis have long ago been 
refuted,  President Clinton's appeal to class envy as the mainstay of 
the welfare state is witness to the fact that the rhetorical power of 
Beard's work remains undiminished.

<center>
<h3>Redistributionism vs. Property Rights</h3>
</center>

The class politics that animates today's welfare state made its subtle 
entry into the political arena through the progressive income tax.  The 
well-known Marxist formula for justice is "from each according to his 
ability, to each according to his need."  The first part of the credo 
("from each according to his ability") is exemplified by the progressive 
income tax, where those who have the greater ability to produce wealth 
have the greater obligation to pay.   The second part of the credo 
awaited only the advent of the welfare state for its implementation.  
The redistribution of wealth through public spending would ensure that 
everyone received, not indeed according to his merit or ability, but 
"according to his need."  What is lost in this attempt to secure the 
welfare of the whole is the rights of individuals.  While the 
Progressives did not identify democracy as "a mere scheme for the 
redistribution of wealth," they never wavered in their belief that redistribution was "a necessary condition or means of progress." 
<P>

Part of today's ethics of redistribution has taken the form of an 
attack on the right to property.  It is said that property rights exist only 
at the expense of human rights; property ownership inspires greed 
whereas social justice requires compassion.  The inescapable 
conclusion is that human rights can be protected only to the extent that 
the right to property is diminished or extinguished.  
<P>

Former Supreme Court Justice William Brennan once remarked that 
<P>

<blockquote>
Government participation in the economic existence of 
individuals is pervasive and deep.  Administrative matters 
and other dealings with government are at the epicenter of 
the exploding law.  We turn to government and to the law 
for controls which would never have been expected or 
tolerated before this century. . . .  Now hundreds of 
thousands of Americans live entire lives without any real 
prospect of the dignity and autonomy that ownership of 
real property would confer.  Protection of the human 
dignity of such citizens requires a much modified view of 
the proper relationship of individual and state.   
</blockquote>

<P>
This modification of the relation of the individual and the state is, 
of course, the highest imperative of the welfare state.  The important 
question that remains is whether the state can assume priority over the 
right to property without at the same time assuming priority over the 
right to life and liberty.
<P>

It almost goes without saying that Justice Brennan's view of the 
right to property (following that of the Progressives) is wholly at odds 
with the view of the Framers of the Constitution.  James Madison, for 
example, saw no inherent tension between the right to property and the 
rights to life and liberty.  In Madison's view-a view that was virtually 
unanimous in 1789-the right to property was the great vehicle for 
securing the rights to life and liberty:  "that is not a just government, 
nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in 
his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated." 
<P>

Madison and the other leading Framers followed John Locke in 
understanding the right to property as the comprehensive right:  "as a 
man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to 
have a property in his rights."   Locke and the American Founders saw 
the connection between property rights and human rights in a clear and 
precise light.  Locke notes that one of the "Bounds" put on the 
legislative power "by the Society, and the Law of God and Nature" is 
that the legislature "must not raise taxes on the Property of the People, 
without the Consent of the People, given by themselves, or their 
Deputies."   This was repeated in unequivocal terms in the Declaration 
of Independence.  
<P>

As many have pointed out, the taxes imposed on the American 
colonies by the British Parliament were not particularly onerous or 
burdensome.  They were nevertheless taken in the Declaration of 
Independence as evidence of a "design to reduce [the Colonies] under 
absolute despotism."  Under these circumstances, "it is [the people's] 
duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their 
future security."  If property can be taken (or taxes imposed) without 
the consent of the people, then the principle of consent itself is in 
jeopardy because the right to property is the most visible means by 
which the right to consent is protected.  This is the indefeasible 
connection-misunderstood or misconstrued by the Progressives and 
their epigones between the right to property, understood as the 
comprehensive political right, and human rights.

<h3>Woodrow Wilson and Constitutional Reform</h3>
</center>

Some five years before Beard's famous work appeared, Woodrow 
Wilson had also attacked the idea of the separation of powers and 
limited government.  Wilson, however, did not do so from the point of 
view of class antagonisms, but from its tendency to suppress the 
"organic will" of the nation:
<P>

<blockquote>
Government is not a machine, but a living thing.  It falls, 
not under the theory of the universe, but under the theory 
of organic life.  It is accountable to Darwin, not to 
Newton.  It is modified by its environment, necessitated 
by its tasks, shaped to its functions by the sheer pressure 
of life.  No living thing can have its organs offset against 
each other as checks, and live.  On the contrary, its life is 
dependent upon their quick cooperation, their ready 
response to the commands of instinct or intelligence, the 
amicable community of purpose.  Living political 
constitutions must be Darwinian in structure and in 
practice. 
</blockquote>

<P>
According to Wilson, separation of powers-indeed limited 
government itself-is antithetical to progress.  Government must have 
unified leadership to meet the shifting exigencies of the day.  This 
notion of the Constitution as an organism has come down to us today in 
the rhetoric of the "living Constitution"-a view that is wholeheartedly 
endorsed by both liberal and conservative members of the Supreme 
Court!
<P>

James Madison wrote in Federalist 49: "it is the reason, alone, of 
the public, that ought to control and regulate the government."  The 
reason of the public is expressed in terms of the rule of law.  And the 
most powerful institutional arrangement for regulating the government 
from this point of view    was the separation of powers and checks and 
balances.  This provided a system in which the ambitions of the various 
office-holders would serve as a countervailing force to control the 
unwise exercise of governmental power.  Thus Madison was not 
exaggerating when he said that the separation of powers was an 
"essential precaution in favor of liberty" because the separation of 
powers bears the most intimate relationship to the preservation of "the 
rights and liberties of the people."  But the Framers were clear that the 
rights to be protected by limited government were individual natural 
rights.  The Progressives opposed separation of powers because they 
were concerned not with individual rights, but with the rights of classes 
or the "organic" rights of the community.

<center>
<h3>Financing the Welfare State</h3>
</center>

Once the decision had been made to begin implementing the 
reforms of the Progressives, it was necessary for the government to 
discover new sources of revenue.  In 1894, Congress passed an income 
tax law that placed a two-percent flat tax on all income over $4,000.  It 
was to last for only five years, expiring in 1900.  In 1895, however, the 
Supreme Court declared the act unconstitutional as a violation of the 
Constitution's ban on any "direct tax" not apportioned among the states 
according to population.  A tax on income, the Court concluded, was a 
direct tax on property and thus forbidden by the Constitution in the 
form proposed in the 1894 Income Tax Act.  The Court's decision in 
Pollock v. Farmer's Loan and Trust Company set off a frenzied 
scramble to amend the Constitution.  One clue to the character of the 
ensuing debate was Justice Henry Brown's dissent in Pollock.  "Even 
the spectre of socialism," he lamented, 
<P>

<blockquote>
is conjured up to frighten Congress from laying taxes upon 
the people in proportion to their ability to pay them . . .  
While I have no doubt that Congress will find some means 
of surmounting the present crisis, my fear is that in some 
moment of national peril this decision will rise up to 
frustrate its will and paralyze its arm.  I hope it may not 
prove the first step toward the submergence of the liberties 
of the people in a sordid despotism of wealth. 
</blockquote>

<P>
The eventual result of the protracted income tax debate was the 
Sixteenth Amendment which allowed "taxes on incomes, from 
whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several 
States, and without regard to any census or enumeration."  The 
subsequent tax law passed in 1913 included a provision aimed at 
implementing the emerging welfare state's sense of social justice-the 
progressive income tax.
<P>

The Framers of the Constitution had included a provision restricting 
direct taxes except when apportioned according to population in order 
to insure that the Federal system of government would remain 
decentralized by making the states the primary recipient of taxes.  This 
restriction would also make it difficult to place a direct tax on capital, 
the most destructive tax in terms of economic growth and economic 
initiative.  Until the income tax law of 1913, the vast majority of 
Federal revenues were derived from imposts and consumer taxes.  
<P>

These had the advantage not only of encouraging thrift and industry, 
but also of being self-limiting.  As Alexander Hamilton noted, 
every class of the community bears its share of the duty in 
proportion to its consumption; which last is regulated by 
the comparative wealth of the respective classes, in 
conjunction with their habits of expense or frugality.  The 
rich and luxurious pay in proportion to their riches and 
luxury; the poor and parsimonious, in proportion to their 
poverty and parsimony.  A chief excellence of this mode 
of revenue is that it preserves a just measure to the abilities 
of individuals, promotes frugality, and taxes 
extravagance.   
<P>

Progressives rejected consumption taxes for a variety of reasons.  
Not only were they supposedly "regressive," but they did not produce 
revenues in nearly the amount required of the emerging welfare state.  
In addition, the individual had too much control over how much taxes 
he would pay-parsimony could be rewarded by lower taxes.  Thus 
many of the Progressives began to look upon the progressive income 
tax as a kind of government induced or government sponsored 
philanthropy.  At bottom, however, the idea of "social justice"-massive 
public spending as a tool to redistribute wealth-was the real impetus for 
the progressive income tax.  "From each according to his ability" was 
now shortly to be connected with "to each according to his need."  This 
is the perfect expression of the "organic unity" of the state.

<center>
<h3>The Progressive Income Tax vs. the Family</h3>
</center>

These notions of "organic unity" and "social justice" have wreaked 
havoc on individual rights.  But undoubtedly the largest casualty of the 
welfare state has been the family.  Indeed, the family is the enemy of 
the welfare state no less than it is for communism because it provides a 
source of authority and allegiance independent of the state.  For Marx, 
no less than for the modern day feminists, the patriarchal family is a 
form of slavery.  Who can doubt that welfare policies have been aimed 
at the break up of the traditional family unit?  It is much easier for 
government to create dependent clients in the absence of strong 
families.
<P>

Progressive tax policies clearly demonstrate the welfare state's bias 
against the family.  In its attempt at wealth redistribution, the welfare 
state has created tremendous tax burdens.  Today, forty percent of the 
median family's income goes to federal, state and local taxes.  Thus 
many women have had to become working mothers-with obvious 
consequences for the stability and integrity of family life.  But working 
mothers contribute little real increase in family income: approximately 
two-thirds has gone for the increase in federal and state taxes during 
the post-World War II period.  What is the welfare state's response to 
the crisis of family life?-more government in the form of day care 
programs!
<P>

More revealing, perhaps, is the tax rate differential for families and 
single taxpayers or childless couples.  Since the mid-1950s, the tax rate 
for families has increased nearly 150 percent while remaining almost 
constant for single taxpayers and childless couples.  This differential is 
principally due to the erosion of the personal exemption for children.  
The value of the current exemption is $2,300; if it had kept pace with 
inflation during the period, it would be $8,000.  
<P>

Many tax reformers advocate an increase in the rate of exemptions 
for children to end this discrimination against the family.  This 
solution, however, misses the point.  Rather we must begin to reduce 
the overall tax burden so that families can devote more resources and 
time to their children.  

<center>
<h3>A Just Solution: The Flat Tax</h3>
</center>

At this late date, the question of how to reel in the excesses of the 
redistributive state is an exceedingly difficult one.  The welfare state 
appears more and more to have taken on a hydra-headed life of its own, 
incapable of controlling itself and not amenable to control from 
outside.  The obvious remedy is to limit the revenues-the life blood-of 
the state; or, failing that, at least to make government spending more 
accountable.  One good way to begin would be to adopt a flat tax.  
While not a perfect solution, a flat tax would be a step in the right 
direction.  It would be equitable: rich and poor and middle class would 
pay at the same rate.  It would thus not penalize industry or force a 
potential producer of wealth to calculate the "marginal rate" of his 
earnings.
<P>

In addition, the flat tax would be simple: there would be no 
complicated bureaucratic rules to mask hidden taxes or hidden 
exemptions.  Certainly the exercise of individual liberties would be 
enhanced by the attendant demise of the Internal Revenue Service 
bureaucracy.  
<P>

What is perhaps most important is that under the flat tax, any 
increase in government spending would be immediately obvious to the 
taxpayer because the percentage of the tax would be raised.  Politicians 
would be forced to justify increased taxes in real terms.  The tax rate 
would thus be tied to real policy issues and would demand justification 
in terms of particularized proposals for increased spending.  Budget 
deals and compromises would be open to public inspection.  Tied with 
a balanced budget provision, there could be no "off-budget" spending 
or "continuing resolutions."  Public spending would become more 
accountable.  In this sense it would slow down the growth of the 
welfare state.  
<P>

Until we repudiate the welfare state and the "progressive" ideas at 
its core we will be fighting a rear guard action.  But let no one be 
mistaken-it is a battle worth fighting.

<h1>Poverty and the Welfare State</h1>
</center>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<h3>Thomas G. West</h3>

Conservatives often criticize excessive government spending and 
regulation.  But liberals leave conservatives tongue-tied when they 
accuse them of lacking compassion.  No word in our political 
vocabulary-except perhaps racism-can silence critics of the welfare 
state more quickly and effectively.
<P>

Strangely, hardly anyone pauses to consider the easy assumption 
that it is compassionate to spend money on the poor. Yet we have 
known for some time that most poor people today have not been 
helped, but have been positively harmed, by the poverty programs of 
the 1960s and '70s.  Meanwhile, most of these programs are still in 
place.  The numbers of those dependent on them are growing rapidly.
<P>

Between 1960 and 1990 government welfare spending increased 
from about $30 billion (measured in 1990 dollars) to $225 billion per 
year, an increase of 750 percent.    Even during the 1980s, the 
supposed "decade of greed," federal welfare spending rose almost 50 
percent.   In California in 1992, a welfare mother of two with a 
Section 8 housing voucher from the federal Department of Housing 
and Urban Development had a tax-free equivalent income of $1,817 
per month, or $21,804 per year.  This is more than twice the after-tax 
amount she could have earned at a minimum-wage job. 
<P>

Yet in spite of this generosity, the percentage of poor Americans 
has hardly budged since 1965.  In contrast, before the 1960s, the 
poverty level had been declining rapidly.  According to government 
figures, almost 35 percent of Americans were poor in 1950.  By 1965, 
that figure had declined to 14 percent, which is about where it has 
stubbornly remained ever since. 
<P>

Worse, the nature of poverty has changed.  Prior to the 1960s, most 
poor Americans were poor because their work brought in such a paltry 
income.  After about 1965, there was,   in the words of sociologist 
William Julius Wilson, a "sharp increase in social pathologies in ghetto 
communities."  Poverty became increasingly a problem of a new 
underclass of able-bodied people who work rarely or not at all.  This 
underclass, unlike the poor of an earlier era, has, says social critic 
Myron Magnet, "an impoverished intellectual and emotional development that generally imprisons them in failure."  Many of them frankly 
reject the qualities that most Americans admire: self-control, sobriety, 
hard work, loyalty, courage, fair play, and faith in God.  The adult men 
of the underclass rarely marry.  Children are brought up by single 
women or their female relatives.  These mothers are often very young, 
ignorant, and irresponsible.  The men in their lives are temporary 
sexual partners or frightening predators-often both. 
<P>

Among the black underclass in particular, those who cultivate 
decent qualities in themselves or their children are sneered at and said 
to be "acting white."  One high school in a poor neighborhood holds its 
academic awards ceremony at night, without publicity, because when 
the rest of the students attend, the winners are mocked with jeers and 
hoots.  In the world of the underclass, writes social scientist Charles 
Murray, "the drug dealer is lionized, the man who mops floors is 
scorned.  The school girl who gets pregnant is envied, the school girl 
who studies is taunted." 
<P>

These rejected virtues enabled earlier generations of Americans to 
rise out of the poverty into which they were born or (if they were 
immigrants) from which they started out in America.  Even today, 
hard-working and self-disciplined Koreans and others succeed in 
establishing thriving businesses in the poorest neighborhoods in 
America, following the path of earlier generations from poverty to 
modest comfort to the middle class.
<P>

Work in low-paying jobs is where many Americans have 
traditionally learned the basic skills of showing up on time, being 
pleasant to customers and the boss, and persevering in getting the job 
done.  The underclass regards these jobs as "dead-end" and their pay as 
"chump change."  Ken Auletta quotes a typical underclass male saying, 
"Man, you go two, three years not working, and hanging around and 
smoking reefer or drinking, and then you get a job-you can't handle it.  
You do two, three years of idleness and after the first two, three years 
of working, you feel people are pushing you.  You say, 'I don't want to 
get up in the morning, get pushed and shoved.  I'm gonna get on 
welfare.'" 

<center>
<h3>Poverty and Welfare, 1776 to 1965</h3>
</center>

Prior to the new, post-1965 approach, America had the most 
successful poverty program in history.  Two centuries ago most 
Americans-at least 90 percent-were desperately poor by today's 
standards.  By the 1960s most were middle class.  Meanwhile, most of 
the rest of the world remained as poor in 1965 as they were in 1776.
The recipe for America's successful 189-year-long poverty program 
was simple:
<P>

<UL>
<li>(1)  Establish free markets and opportunity for all who 
can work.
<li>(2)  Provide strong governmental support for the family 
and for a morality of self-controlled self-assertion (combining industriousness, self-restraint, and basic decency with 
the vigilant spirit that says "Don't tread on me").
<li>(3)  Provide support in local communities for the 
deserving poor:  widows, orphans, and the disabled who are 
unable to work.
</ul>

<P>
Poor people become unpoor when their work is rewarded by 
income, when they marry and support a family, and when their leaders 
publicly affirm the dignity of self-support, sacrifice, and responsibility.  
In the middle ages a serf might have worked hard all his life, but the 
wealth he produced often went into the hands of a wealthy landowner.  
In America a man had the right to keep what he earned, and the 
authorities praised him for doing so.
<P>

In the view of America's Founders, poverty programs that helped 
people whether or not they could work were not only ineffective but 
unjust.  Compelling workers to support those who refuse to work 
would be to make some men masters and other men slaves: the haves 
would be enslaved to the have-nots.  Thomas Jefferson said,
<P>

<blockquote>
If we are made in some degree for others, yet in a greater 
are we made for ourselves.  It were contrary to feeling, 
and indeed ridiculous, to suppose that a man had less right 
in himself than one of his neighbors, or indeed all of them 
put together.  This would be slavery, and not that liberty 
which the bill of rights has made inviolable, and for the 
preservation of which our government has been charged. 
</blockquote>

<P>
For Jefferson, a welfare state that supported shirkers, far from being 
compassionate, would have violated the rights of the working poor.
Although the Declaration of Independence says we have a right to 
life and liberty, it does not say we have a right to happiness.  Unlike 
life and liberty, happiness is not something we possess by nature.  
Likewise, there is a right to acquire and possess property, but no right 
to be wealthy.  Everyone has the natural capacity to acquire wealth and 
pursue happiness, just as everyone has the capacity to live, be free, and 
worship God.  To possess a right, even to exercise it, does not 
guarantee that it will lead to the end desired.  Happiness is earned by 
talent and effort, or enjoyed unbought through grace or good fortune.  
It is not a right.
<P>

Abraham Lincoln once responded to Southern critics of capitalism 
in this way:  "The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for 
wages a while, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for 
himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at length 
hires another new beginner to help him."  This system "gives hope to 
all, and energy, and progress, and improvement of condition to all."    
When Lincoln led the nation into Civil War, it was not for the principle 
that the masters owed their former slaves a living.  That would have 
been to turn the former masters into slaves, and the former slaves into 
masters.
<P>

For earlier Americans, it is always wrong for one group in society 
to live off the labor of another group-whether it be white slaveholders 
or the underclass that despises "dead-end jobs" and "chump change."  
"It is the same tyrannical principle," said Lincoln.  "It is the same 
principle in whatever shape it develops itself.  It is the same spirit that 
says, 'You work and toil and earn bread, and I'll eat it.' " 
<P>

This did not mean that Americans like Lincoln and Jefferson were 
"social Darwinists," indifferent to the plight of the few who, through no 
fault of their own, could not work or had no family to care for them.  
From the earliest colonial days, local governments took full 
responsibility for their poor.  But one thing was always clear:  able-
bodied men and women were not supported by the taxpayers unless 
they worked, if necessary in establishments that provided them food 
and shelter in exchange for labor.  Only those too old or weak or sick 
to work were taken care of in idleness.
<P>

Jefferson gives us a vivid picture of welfare in early America in his 
Notes on the State of Virginia.
<P>

<blockquote>
The poor who have neither property, friends, nor strength 
to labor, are boarded in the houses of good farmers, to 
whom a stipulated sum is annually paid. . . . Vagabonds 
without visible property or vocation, are placed in 
workhouses, where they are well clothed, fed, lodged, and 
made to labor.  Nearly the same method of providing for 
the poor prevails through all our states; and from 
Savannah to Portsmouth you will seldom meet a beggar.
</blockquote>

<P>
In addition to this minimal "safety-net" support from government, 
voluntary charities, often church-based, provided further benefits.  
Hospitals for the poor, educational institutions, YMCAs, and more 
were established all over America by public-spirited citizens.  When 
Tocqueville visited America in the early 1800s, he was astounded at 
the number and variety of such associations, all promoted by 
volunteers in local communities.
<P>

The Founders' main objection to welfare for those who refuse to 
work was to its injustice.  But they were also aware of the problem of 
welfare creating poverty, which we see so massively today.  Benjamin 
Franklin once said,
<P>

<blockquote>
I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of 
the means.  I think the best way of doing good to the poor, 
is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving 
them out of it. . . .  There is no country in the world where 
so many provisions are established for them [as in 
England] . . . , with a solemn general law made by the rich 
to subject their estates to a heavy tax for the support of the 
poor.  [Yet] there is no country in the world in which the 
poor are more idle, dissolute, drunken, and insolent.  The 
day you [Englishmen] passed that act, you took away from 
before their eyes the greatest of all inducements to 
industry, frugality, and sobriety, by giving them a 
dependence on something else than a careful accumulation 
during youth and health, for support in old age and 
sickness.  In short, you offered a premium for the 
encouragement of idleness, and you should not now 
wonder that it has had the effect in the increase of 
poverty. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Marvin Olasky has shown in detail in The Tragedy of American 
Compassion how earlier Americans combined Franklin's hard-headed 
realism about the ill effects of indiscriminate generosity with a warm-
hearted sympathy for those who fell into need through no fault of their 
own.  Especially encouraged were those who were willing to give up 
their idleness to follow the path of responsibility and self-reliance.  
Americans of that day always kept in mind the example of God 
himself, who is infinitely merciful-but only to the repentant who strive 
to do better. 

<center>
<h3>Poverty and Welfare After 1965</h3>
</center

A few American intellectuals, influenced by European socialist 
thinkers, began to question the Founders' conception of individual 
responsibility as early as the 1830s.  By 1900 many intellectuals were 
beginning to turn away from the traditional American view that in a 
free country destitution usually comes from a defect in character, while 
frugal and industrious conduct usually lead to a comfortable living.  
This began to influence actual policy debates. 
<P>

But it was not until the mid-1960s that welfare was conceived as a 
right to be demanded of society by anyone in need, regardless of 
conduct or circumstances.  Gone was the earlier worry about welfare 
creating dependency and therefore subsidizing poverty.  Gone was the 
demand that individuals seeking government support should act in 
accord with minimal moral standards.  Compassion was the 
watchword.  Federal funding provided the cash.
<P>

The old system had tried to focus its help on the deserving poor 
while keeping benefit levels low enough to prevent poverty from being 
an economically attractive alternative to work.  The new system 
abandoned the distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor, 
and it raised typical benefit levels above the equivalent of a minimum 
wage job.
<P>

Charles Murray has persuasively explained the perverse incentive 
structure of the modern welfare state.  Generous payments to women 
with children expand poverty by funding it.  "There is no need to 
invoke the specters of cultural pathologies or inferior upbringing.  The 
choices [of the poor to forego work for welfare] may be seen much 
more simply, much more naturally, as the behavior of people 
responding to the reality of the world around them and making the 
decisions-the legal, approved, and even encouraged decisions-that 
maximize their quality of life."    Robert Rector summarizes the point 
in this way:
<P>

<blockquote>
Current welfare may best be conceptualized as a system 
which offers each single mother a "paycheck". . . . She 
will continue to receive her "paycheck" as long as she 
fulfills two conditions:  1) she must not work; and 2) she 
must not marry an employed male. . . .
<P>


Welfare has converted the low-income working husband 
from a necessary breadwinner into a net financial 
handicap.  It has transformed marriage from an institution 
designed to protect and nurture children into an institution 
which financially penalizes nearly all low-income parents 
who practice it. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Social science research has established with precision that benefit 
levels are closely correlated with single motherhood.  Rector reports:
<P>

<blockquote>
In 1979, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 
established a large sample of young women (aged 14 to 
19) and then tracked the behavior of these women over the 
next decade.  [NLSY data shows] that a 50 percent 
increase in the monthly value of AFDC and Food Stamp 
benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-
of-wedlock births over the study period.  [Another study 
shows that] a 10 percent increase in AFDC benefits in a 
state will cause a decrease in the marriage rate of all single 
mothers in the state by 8 percent.
</blockquote>

<P>
The data also confirm the common-sense view that children raised 
without fathers are more likely to be spoiled and undisciplined.  
"[H]olding family income, neighborhood, parental education, and other 
variables constant, young black men from single-parent homes are 
twice as likely to commit crimes and end up in jail when compared to 
young black men raised in low-income families where the father is 
present." 
<P>

George Gilder adds an important dimension to this economic 
analysis.  He shows that when government gives women large sums of 
money, it has the unintended effect of making men feel inferior to their 
women.  Women have a natural superiority to men when it comes to 
bearing children.  To measure up to women as equals, men have always 
felt the need to be the principal providers in the family.  When 
government support became widely available to unmarried women in 
the 1960s, "welfare payments usurped the man's role as provider, 
leaving fatherless families." Welfare destroys the incipient families of 
the poor by making the struggling male breadwinner 
superfluous and thereby emasculating him emotionally.  His response 
is predictable.  He turns to the super-masculine world of the street: 
drinking, drugs, male camaraderie, and crime. 
<P>

The analyses of Murray and Gilder need to be supplemented in one 
respect.  Myron Magnet and others have shown that the ideas of 
America's academic and media elites played as big a role in the 
massive changes of the 1960s, as the changes in benefit levels.  They 
decisively changed the attitude of the poor toward their own poverty. 
Since the '60s, poor Americans have all faced the same economic 
and psychological incentives not to work.  Yet different groups respond 
to these identical incentives in very different ways.  Poor Asian 
immigrants, for example, most often decline the generous offers of 
government help.  Instead, they become self-reliant entrepreneurs.  
Other Americans, especially poor blacks, more often accept 
government's tempting handouts.  However, blacks who have 
immigrated to the United States from the West Indies live more like 
whites than like other blacks.  Their average income is about the same 
as that of whites, and their crime rates are actually lower than whites'.   
Analysts sometimes call the source of these differences cultural.  It is 
more accurate to say that the source is people's differing opinions of 
right and wrong, and the conduct that follows from those opinions.
Prior to the '60s, it was considered shameful to be on the dole and to 
bear a child without being married.  One telling example: the director 
of a large maternity home in the 1950s said, "Society regards 
illegitimacy as an inroad on the family's stability and permanency, and 
repels it by ostracizing the unwed mother."    The desired situation, 
everyone thought, was to get married, have children, and support the 
family with a job.
<P>

Beginning in the '60s, the poor were taught by welfare organizers 
that welfare is "nothing to be ashamed of."  Welfare mothers came to 
meetings of the National Welfare Rights Organization "with a sense 
that welfare should be avoided."  But "constant repetition of the word 
rights got through to the women."  The result, as one welfare official 
commented at the time, was "a changing outlook among many poor 
and the near poor." Within a few years, a much larger proportion of 
those eligible for welfare chose to take advantage of it.    In a similar 
way, America's elites, who were enthusiastically celebrating the sexual 
revolution, taught the poor that bearing children outside of marriage 
was a perfectly acceptable way to live.  Those who said otherwise were 
denounced as puritanical or even racist.
<P>

Instead of teaching the virtues of sobriety, self-reliance, and 
responsible parenthood, America's most influential voices now scoffed 
at "bourgeois values."  "Blaming the victim" and "racism" were the 
shrill charges leveled against anyone who dared to criticize the 
teenagers who lightly bore children and then raised them badly without 
bothering to get married.  Far from condemning the able-bodied poor 
who refused to work or marry, liberals taught the poor to blame "the 
system."  Because of capitalism and racism, the poor were told, they 
had no control over their fate.  They were passive victims, and there 
was nothing they could do about it.  As victims, they had endless rights 
but no responsibilities. 
<P>

Plato suggested in book 8 of his Republic that the fundamental 
cause of public policy under any form of government is the character 
and beliefs of the ruling class.  If Plato was right, as I think he was, this 
change in our leaders' conception of justice was the decisive event of 
the 1960s.  Their grandparents had faith in God, believed that sex was 
best reserved for marriage, and controlled their impulses toward instant 
gratification.  They believed in the principles of the Declaration, 
supporting equal rights for all individuals.  The grandchildren who 
became the leaders of the '60s rejected all that as hopelessly naive-and 
unjust.
<P>

The poor quickly learned the lesson taught by their patrons.  Its 
impact on their lives, however, was more devastating.  All the common 
character flaws of lower-class life were exalted into symptoms of 
society's corruption.  Laziness, irresponsible sex, abandonment of 
children, drugs, drinking, crime:  these were no longer vices but 
understandable signs of rebellion against a rotten, even criminal, 
bourgeois system.  Ramsey Clark, Lyndon Johnson's Attorney General, 
wrote that "[C]rime among poor blacks . . . flows clearly and directly 
from the brutalization and dehumanization of racism, poverty, and 
injustice. . . . To permit conditions that breed antisocial conduct is our 
greatest crime."  Trained by such sentiments to believe that "the system 
is to blame," blacks in more than thirty cities rioted between 1964 and 
1967, destroying one black neighborhood after another across 
America. 
<P>

During the 1960s, "poor" practically became a synonym for 
"black," as government directed its anti-poverty energies to black 
neighborhoods in the North and black rural areas in the South.  Long-
established black patterns of life had centered, as historian Herbert 
Gutman has shown, on the stable nuclear family.    Yet their family 
life collapsed under the weight of the attention lavished on blacks by 
this uplifting crusade.  The destruction of the way of life of decent 
blacks should-but does not-haunt the consciences of liberals.  One law-
abiding black commented bitterly, on the occasion of the accidental 
shooting of a nine-year-old girl by a thug's casual bullet, "Our lives 
have been reduced to the lowest levels of human existence." 
<P>

The destruction of the black communities of America was the 
legacy of the anti-poverty crusade of the 1960s.  Blacks who are old 
enough to remember earlier times sometimes recall the days of official 
discrimination with fondness-not because they favor segregation, of 
course, but because in those days there were communities of families, 
schools, shared responsibility, and basic decency.
<P>

Ralph Abernathy was Martin Luther King's successor as head of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a longtime civil rights 
leader.  In his autobiography he described the life of his childhood in 
almost nostalgic terms.  His father, he said, 
<P>

<blockquote>
was a farmer, as were most people who lived in the South 
at that time [the 1930s]; but unlike some of our neighbors, 
black and white, we were not struggling to survive on a 
patch of hard-scrabble land.  My father owned 
approximately five hundred acres of good, black soil that 
he had bought a few acres at a time, having begun with a 
wedding gift of a milk cow and a calf.
To get ahead, he did three things:  worked as hard as he 
possibly could; led a severely disciplined and sober life; 
and married well. . . .
<P>

[He believed] in righteousness and self-reliance. . . .
<P>

In a rural area where land was available to people who 
were willing to work for it, it was possible for a few blacks 
to enjoy both freedom and a kind of equality-one based on 
mutual respect and a certain standoffishness.  It was not an 
ideal community by any means. . . .  Indeed, that world 
was a fragile one; and its survival depended on staying in 
the country and living among people you had known all 
your life and who had known you. . . .
<P>

[In the 1980s,] as I encounter these tragic young faces [of 
poor blacks] all over the country, I remember the faces of 
my brothers and sisters and cousins a half century ago, 
working in the fields of rural Alabama, glistening in the 
hot summer sun.  The faces I recall are not as bitter and 
hopeless as the ones I see today, if only because my father 
and the other adults in my family understood that 
economic independence, our ultimate freedom and 
salvation, was achievable. 
</blockquote>

<P>
In spite of segregation, Abernathy was saying, it was possible for 
blacks to live decently in a country that provided the basic civil 
right-the right denied to the slaves-to keep the wealth they earned with 
their own hands.
<P>

Life was better for many blacks in the North as well.  In 1947, 
third-grade students at black economist Thomas Sowell's Harlem 
elementary school "matched the citywide average in understanding 
both paragraph meaning and word meaning,    and they exceeded the 
citywide average in arithmetic. . . . Compare that with today, when 
everyone takes it for granted that ghetto schools will perform miles 
behind everyone else." 
<P>

Black columnist William Raspberry recalls that a young man killed 
in a motorcycle accident was "the only con-temporary of ours to die of 
any cause" during his late teens and early twenties (in the 1950s and 
'60s).  Raspberry's own middle-class children, in contrast, can name 
half a dozen deaths among their acquaintances, including several 
murders.  Conditions in poor black neighborhoods, of course, are far 
worse. 
<P>

The dimension of the change appears most obviously in a single 
disheartening statistic:  in 1950, only one-sixth of blacks were born to 
an unmarried mother; by 1993, over two-thirds of blacks were born 
illegitimate.   In other words, the vast majority of blacks today grow 
up without fathers, without models of male decency, without the 
toughness of male discipline, and without the experience and the 
example of a father's love for a child and for a wife and mother.  Out of 
the nightmare world of impoverished single mothers, undisciplined 
teenagers, and adult male lawlessness comes the bulk of today's cases 
of child abuse, drug abuse, and crime.

<h3>What Is To Be Done?</h3>
</center>

In the long run we should aim to restore the welfare policies that 
prevailed in America prior to the 1960s.  The principle of those policies 
is simple:  equal opportunity for all, with government support only for 
those who are truly unable to provide for themselves.
<P>

As a practical matter, in the short run, we should take steps to 
approximate the older way to the extent politically feasible.
First and most important, political and community leaders should 
again speak candidly about virtue and vice.  We know destructive and 
immoral conduct when we see it.  Its carnage is all around us.  There is 
no good reason to refrain politely from pointing out the truth when the 
lives and souls of the next generation are being trashed so casually 
every day.  America waged its only successful War on Poverty before 
1965, when its leaders affirmed the dignity of marriage, work, honesty, 
self-sufficiency, and individual responsibility.  And if a responsible life 
is a life of dignity, then we must overcome our squeamishness and 
affirm publicly that an irresponsible life is a life of indignity, of 
degradation.  In Charles Murray's words,
<P>

<blockquote>
Let government policy start from the premise that to bring 
a baby into the world when one is not emotionally or 
financially equipped to be a parent is not just ill-advised, 
not just inimical to the long-term interests of the mother; it 
is profoundly irresponsible.  It is wrong. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Second, government must undo the perverse economic incentives 
that it has created through its misguided, community-destroying 
generosity.  Welfare laws, like all laws, should encourage, and in no 
way discourage, marriage and work.

<P> 
Most urgently, we should return to the older and common-sense 
policy of refusing government support to unmarried women bearing 
children.  This policy led to what Murray calls "a stern self-selection 
process . . . in which the prospects [were] so grim" that single mothers 
rarely chose "to keep their babies instead of giving them up" for 
adoption.  To keep a fatherless child almost guaranteed a life of 
physical hardship and social ostracism.  Today, true compassion for the 
well-being of the children as well as the mother demands that 
government refuse to be a party to single motherhood.  Murray rightly 
remarks that government "cannot and must not intervene in the 
decision to have a baby."  It would be wrong to "give people licenses to 
have babies" or "take babies away" from unmarried women.  But it is 
also wrong for government to give such women special benefits.  They 
should be eligible only for the same programs, such as unemployment 
benefits, as everyone else. 
<P>

For widows and women abandoned by their husbands, some 
temporary aid is appropriate.  However, the aid should be given in such 
a way as to compel the women to support themselves, or to find men to 
support them, as quickly as possible.  Cash or cash-equivalent 
benefits-AFDC, food stamps, medical care, housing allowances-should 
be converted to in-kind provision of basic material needs in 
institutional settings.  Strict rules of civilized conduct should be 
enforced.  Food should be nourishing but plain.  In general, wherever 
welfare is appropriate, it should be made less pleasant, less convenient, 
and less subject to abuse.  There must be a time limit-perhaps as short 
as three months-for eligibility.  Tax credits for babysitting expenses 
would make it possible for them to work when or before benefits run 
out.
<P>

For those truly unable to provide for themselves due to chronic 
disease or old age, long-term welfare should be made available only in 
institutional settings.  Small homes or apartment buildings, privately 
owned and reimbursed by taxpayers, or at least locally administered, 
would best protect everyone concerned.
<P>

Other policy changes not directly related to single motherhood 
would improve the lives and opportunities of the poor.
<P>

For example, a third reform would be a serious response to the 
crime that poisons poor neighborhoods.  The poor deserve, and justice 
demands, an efficient system of arrest, fair trial (not plea bargains), at 
least some punishment for every offense, imprisonment for the first 
serious offense, and escalating punishments for repeat offenders.  The 
juvenile justice system, laughed at by underclass children who breezily 
commit cold-blooded murders, should be toughened up.  The most 
urgent purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property.  
That purpose is pervasively subverted in every major city in America, 
where flagrant piracy is a way of life for a substantial minority of the 
underclass.  The law-abiding poor need such protection more than the 
middle class, who always have the option of moving to a safer 
neighborhood.
<P>

State governments handle most of our criminal justice system. 
State-level politicians must therefore put these reforms into effect. 
Simply to enforce existing criminal law would be a radical change 
from present practice, as Joseph M. and Anne Nutter Bessette point 
out:  "Nearly one-third of those convicted of a felony in state courts in 
1988 served no time in prison or jail. . . . half of convicted murderers 
released from prison each year serve less than six years for their crime; 
half of released rapists serve three years or less."  The majority of 
crimes are committed by these same convicted criminals who serve 
minimal or no sentences. 
<P>

Even increased police protection can make a difference, as Los 
Angeles learned during the second Rodney King trial.  When a repeat 
of the 1992 riots was feared, police were posted on the streets of South 
L. A. in large numbers.  In a television interview, a black man 
commented, "It's safe, but I don't see why we can't have this kind of 
presence all the time."  A black woman said, "It was wonderful.  For 
the first time I was able to just go out for a walk . . . without always 
looking over my shoulder for someone." 
<P>

Less obvious than crime, but important for opportunity, are the 
legal obstacles faced by the ambitious poor.  A fourth reform would 
reduce these obstacles.  Since the '60s, regulation and high taxation 
have made it hard for the poor to enter the market and produce goods 
and services, and even to find affordable housing.   Big companies 
with well-paid lawyers can cope with the endless red tape of regulation.  
Businessmen who are just getting started cannot.  A federal law 
exempting all businesses with fewer than 50 employees from most 
federal and state regulation would be a simple way to start this process.  
State governments should act in parallel fashion, for instance by setting 
limits on local zoning laws that prevent the poor from working in their 
homes and neighborhoods.  Housing regulations that require expensive 
construction methods are known to create homelessness.    These 
should be modified or eliminated wherever possible.  Economist 
Walter Williams has written of other areas for potential reform, for 
example in arbitrary licensing requirements that exclude blacks and 
others from driving taxis and practicing other trades. 
<P>

Fifth, laws strengthening the family are long overdue.  The latest 
social-science research confirms what common sense has always 
known:  broken and single-mother families produce a high proportion 
of unhappy children, who often grow up to become self-indulgent, 
abusive, sometimes criminal adults.  There should be firm public 
endorsement of healthy families, consisting of a married father and 
mother raising their own offspring.  So-called alternative family life-
styles should be treated with the contempt, or silence, they deserve.
<P>

The law can do much to support the family.  Parents of children 
ought to be given tax relief.  Because of the dependent exemption, the 
median family of four in 1948 paid almost no income tax.  Today, that 
family pays almost 24 percent of its income in payroll and income 
taxes.    No-fault divorce ought to be eliminated, and divorce generally 
ought to be made more difficult.  Most controversially, we ought to 
consider restoring the pre-1900 custom of awarding child custody in 
divorces to the parent who is in the best position to provide for the 
children's material needs-usually the father.  The full weight of the law 
could then be lowered on him if he failed to fulfill his legal duty to his 
children.  This last reform would make many a woman and man 
hesitate before breaking up a family on the basis of a passing fancy or 
vague feelings of unfulfillment.  If women were threatened with losing 
the children they love, and if men could not look forward to the 
footloose freedom they might crave, mothers and fathers would be 
likely to try harder to keep their marriages intact by mutual concessions 
and affection. 
<P>

Sixth and last, the scandal of the non-education of the poor in public 
schools must be repaired.  In the immediate term, tax credits for school 
expenses would instantly enable the poor to send their children to 
private schools.  In the longer term, public schools need radical 
overhaul, with much higher educational and disciplinary standards.  
This will only follow from a policy of returning control over schools to 
local communities.  Funding will become available by canceling 
about three-quarters of administrative positions in public education.
This essay has said nothing about government waste, high taxes on 
the middle class, loose eligibility requirements, welfare cheats, and 
similar issues.  That is because these are not the main problems.  
Americans are a generous people.  They are willing to impose 
burdensome taxes on themselves if they are convinced that it is for the 
public good.  There is therefore only one way to return to the wisdom, 
and the effective anti-poverty program, of pre-1965 America.  
America's leaders must explain clearly that giving things 
indiscriminately to poor people harms rather than helps them.  We need 
to discover once again-as our Founders knew well-that compassion 
calls for treating the able-bodied poor as adults with souls rather than 
as mindless children who will never grow up.

<h1>Educating Citizens</h1>
</center>
<hr size=4 align=center>

<h3>Christopher Flannery</h3>

Democracy requires more of its citizens than any other form of 
government.  It depends on the capacity of the citizens to govern 
themselves.  But the habits and dispositions of self government are 
difficult to acquire and to sustain.  They are rooted in moral and 
political principles in which each new generation must be educated.  It 
is no accident that history provides so few examples of successful and 
enduring democracies.  In the American democracy today, we have 
largely lost sight of those principles which provide the common ground 
of American political community and inform the civic character 
required of American citizens.  There is widespread recognition of the 
necessity to restore private morality and to strengthen the common 
bonds of civility among the diverse citizens of America.  Educating 
citizens in the principles, rights, duties, and capacities of citizenship is 
the primary purpose of American public education.  That our schools 
are failing miserably in accomplishing this purpose is apparent to all 
who have eyes to see and ears to hear.  
<P>

There are, of course, other and more publicized failings in 
American education such as the decline in SAT scores and in the basic 
skills needed for a competitive workforce.  These are connected with 
the failure to educate good citizens.  Their causes are many and 
various.  Even when we can agree on the causes, it is not always 
possible to agree upon or even to envision a solution.  To the extent 
that a single cause may be identified as the primary source of our 
failure at the task of educating citizens, it can be summed up simply:  
bad ideas.  
<P>

American education today, from the earliest elementary levels to 
the graduate schools, is dominated by doctrines that openly repudiate 
the principles on which America is founded;  indeed, they deny the 
very capacity of men to distinguish freedom from tyranny, justice from 
injustice, right from wrong.  These doctrines have wholly discredited 
the perspective of the democratic citizen: they have made self 
government itself unintelligible as a political phenomenon.  The 
consequence has been a corruption of the political language through 
which the nation conducts its public deliberations, a citizenry 
increasingly confused or uncertain about the ground and substance of 
its rights and duties, and political and educational leaders capable for 
the most part only of deepening the crisis.  These bad ideas are rooted 
in a profound assault upon human reason and human nature as grounds 
of human morality, an assault waged over the past two centuries 
culminating in explicit and assertive nihilism.  The popular expressions 
of these ideas in our time take a wide variety of forms.  But in the 
world of American education today, they converge most faddishly 
under the banners of "Multiculturalism" and "Diversity."
<P>

The multicultural movement and the diversity movement are 
distinct political and intellectual movements which frequently overlap 
and reinforce one another.  Their stronghold is in the academies of 
higher learning, whence they have sallied forth into practically every 
nook and cranny of American life.  Anyone who reads a daily paper or 
a national news magazine has read about them over the past several 
years.  They are "multi"-dimensional or "diverse" as one might expect, 
but it is possible to identify their most common ideas and predilections.  
For convenience sake, I will refer to the diverse phenomena as 
multiculturalism.

<center> 
<h3>Multiculturalism</h3>
</center>

The foremost idea of multiculturalism is the equal value of all 
cultures, or cultural relativism.  This is an idea that has made it 
impossible for a generation of American students to make the perfectly 
rational moral distinction between a "culture" that puts Jews in ovens 
and one that grants them freedom of worship and all rights of 
citizenship.  (Under the heading of "diversity," this is also why public 
schools must not teach that monogamous heterosexual marriage is 
morally preferable to homosexual promiscuity.  All "lifestyles," like all 
cultures, are created equal.)  
<P>

This is not just the view of zealots or extremists but of the 
mainstream, supposedly responsible public officials making policy at 
the highest levels.  To offer just one small example among countless 
thousands:  At a conference sponsored by the National Governors 
Association, a distinguished historian who was a co-author of the 
California Framework for History and the Social Sciences announced 
that "California would be teaching democratic values as a standard of 
judgment" for its students.  In response, "half a dozen speakers jumped 
to the microphone to argue that it was ethnocentric and chauvinistic to 
expect other people to care about or practice democracy."  Again:  this 
was not a rally for the resurrection of the Grateful Dead, but a 
conference sponsored by the National Governors Association.  It took 
place, as it happens, just prior to the spectacle of Chinese youths in 
Tiananmen Square erecting their Goddess of Democracy on the model 
of the Statue of Liberty and shouting "Give me liberty or give me 
death!"   (Many got the latter; none got the former, but it would be 
"ethnocentric" to suggest who got the worst of it.)  
<P>

This reigning dogma among professional educators who shape the 
curriculum of American public schools requires a non-chauvinistic, 
non-ethnocentric, balanced treatment of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, 
and Jefferson or Lincoln.  Moral relativism prohibits preferring 
freedom to despotism or believing that there can be a rational ground 
for preferring one over the other.  With Lincolnian firmness, our civics 
instruction is dedicated to the proposition that "the concept of freedom 
can mean different things to different people in different 
circumstances."  While true, this is hardly conclusive, and offers small 
consolation to the one being enslaved by another's concept of 
freedom.  
<P>

Inherent in the idea of cultural relativism is the idea that culture, 
race, or ancestry (feminist multiculturalists throw in gender) determines 
our ideas.  Our minds, that is, are locked inside our skins, and the gulf 
between races or cultures is unbridgeable.  There is no such thing as 
human reason capable of grasping any part of objective moral truth 
(also non-existent) which is worthy of imparting to a student.  No truth, 
that is, except the asserted truth that certain preferred cultures must be 
"affirmed."  We must, therefore, have black teachers to teach the black 
point of view to black students; "hispanic" teachers to teach the 
"hispanic" point of view to "hispanic" students, etc.  Education itself 
becomes merely the imposition of one's own ethnically or culturally 
determined prejudices on others.  The relation between teacher and 
student can be understood only in terms of power.  
<P>

Multiculturalists loudly denounce the emphasis in American 
schools on American history and culture and western civilization.  
Everyone has read about this.  Perpetuating the American heritage in 
American public schools falls under the heading of "Eurocentrism," 
one of the worst forms of cultural or ethnic chauvinism.  It 
discriminates against other cultures by denying them an equal "voice" 
in the classroom or the textbooks.  One might think that it would be a 
rational and non-controversial approach to teach American students 
about the American Declaration of Independence and the American 
Constitution.  This is naive.  And, again, it is not just the "fringe 
elements" who protest.  At a meeting of the California School Boards 
Association, a school board member objected to such an approach:  
"We have children from all over the world.  They want to learn about 
their own cultural heritage, not about the Bill of Rights."   American 
taxpayers are thus required to support the inculcation among American 
citizens of non-American cultural heritages however antipathetic these 
cultures may be to democracy or to American institutions.  The 
preferred cultural categories, "black" or "African," "hispanic," "Asian," 
"Pacific Islander," and so on, are egregiously arbitrary.  How many 
hundreds of "cultures" are there in Africa?  Should Puerto Ricans be 
compelled to immerse themselves in Mexican culture?  But the 
categories are more or less convenient for the bureaucracies.  
<P>

Bilingualism springs from this fount of multiculturalism.  The 
common understanding of bilingualism is that it is a program 
facilitating the transition to English literacy for American students 
whose first or native tongue is something other than English.  In fact, 
the animating idea of the bilingual movement today is to preserve the 
sanctity of the students' "native" language and culture against the 
imperialistic efforts to force the "foreign" tongue of English upon 
them.  According to a study by one of the country's leading experts on 
bilingualism, "71% of the studies show transitional bilingual education 
to be no different from or actually worse than doing nothing" to 
achieve English literacy.   Bilingualism has even worse effects in 
math.  Federal statistics, moreover, show that "as many as 60% of the 
children to whom ["transitional" bilingual education] is offered are not 
in need of a "transition" to English since English is already their best 
language." 
<P>

The more tepid multiculturalists say that teaching "American 
culture" is fine and proper, adding merely that American culture is 
defined by unqualified openness to all cultures.  These are the ones 
who chant that it is "Diversity" that unifies us; and in a meeting of 
professional "educators" no one laughs or raises a puzzled eyebrow.  
<P>

The more ardent multiculturalists not only denounce the emphasis on 
western civilization as bad but denounce western civilization and its 
American variety as uniquely evil in themselves.  The very ideas of 
"humanity" and "reason" are seen in this view as eurocentric (and for 
the feminists, patriarchal) prejudices contrived to exploit "oppressed" 
cultures.  This is the real driving force of the multicultural movement.  
Multiculturalism has no patience for objective academic standards 
of excellence.  These are merely other means by which the "dominant 
culture" oppresses "minority cultures."  Therefore objective tests are 
denounced as racist, and multiculturalists insist that students be graded 
only within their racial or cultural group or that tests be redesigned so 
that preferred "minorities" perform as well as the "dominant" racial 
group.  This is called "Race-norming," and it has been practiced in the 
hiring policies of the federal government for years.  Private employers 
are now reluctant to take high school diplomas or grades into account 
in hiring for fear of being punished under the law for racial 
discrimination. 
<P>

The multiculturalist replaces education with therapy, insisting that 
supporting the students' "self-esteem" is the governing object of 
education.  Self esteem is achieved by teaching the students of 
"oppressed cultures" to be proud of their particular race or ancestry.  
Some argue that this should be done by revealing the true greatness of 
these cultures.  The more candid or incautious multiculturalists admit 
or even insist that the self worth of the oppressed must be cultivated by 
myths where facts will not do the trick.  
<P>

A relatively harmless example of the "truth-road-to-self esteem" is 
UC Irvine's Native American Intertribal University Preparatory 
Summer Program, a $700,000 a year program serving a few hundred 
youths from a few dozen different tribes each year.  As one of the 
participants described the purposes of the program, "Every person here 
needs to make these kids understand how worthy they are as Native 
Americans."  To help accomplish this students study canoe 
construction and build shelters with bark to demonstrate how inventive 
and environmentally sound Native Americans are, and especially "to 
disprove this notion that Native Americans didn't work very hard."  
Some teachers apparently considered whether it might be more 
beneficial "to concentrate class time on what the children have to do to 
succeed in school and in mainstream society."  But parents seemed 
pleased.  One marvelled at how his daughter had "matured and 
developed a confidence in her own worth and an identity as a native 
woman" in only three weeks.   
<P>

Oppressed students can travel the multicultural road to self-esteem 
beyond the walls of their schoolyards.  It branches off into every corner 
of popular culture.  "Indians are about the environment, sensitivity, and 
culture," as Bonnie Paradise, Director of the American Indian Registry, 
said while denouncing the insensitive treatment of Native Americans in 
the movie "Black Robe."   Speaking for the organized handicapped or 
"differently abled" as they are sometimes called, Ira Zimmerman, 
advocacy chairman of the National Stuttering Project, complains about 
the unflattering depictions of stutterers in such movies as "A Fish 
Called Wanda" and "Oscar."  Expanding his clientele he complains that 
the movie "Hook" was not introduced by "a public service campaign on 
behalf of the disabled."   Nor are the oppressed confined to the alleged 
human species.  Betty Denny Smith, Director of the American Humane 
Association's Los Angeles office, was very concerned about a scene of 
a wolf attacking a man in the movie "White Fang":  "I was very 
concerned about that being an anti-wolf statement."  Those who 
watched the film know that that scene was removed and that the movie 
included a "disclaimer from Defenders of Wildlife saying healthy 
wolves do not attack human beings."   
<P>

Representing the "myth-road-to-self esteem," Beverly Slapin of 
Communities United Against Racism condemns as racist the inclusion 
in American history textbooks of the account of the migration of 
Indians across the Bering Strait to Alaska, whatever may be its claim to 
historical truth.  "Native people say they were created here," she says, 
"that they sprang from Earth, not from Europe or Asia. . . .  [To] 
disregard people's religious beliefs is racist."   Alex Haley, famous as 
the author of Roots, was extremely influential in teaching black 
Americans where to seek self-esteem.  But historians generally regard 
Haley's Roots  as fiction and doubt that he located his actual ancestor.  
Leaving aside the fact that Haley was half Irish and might have written 
a different fiction appealing to Hibernian-Americans had he traced his 
father's rather than his mother's "roots," the uplifting point is that 
mythical roots can be the source of even greater self-esteem than actual 
roots, as most of us descendants of horsethieves can attest.  
<P>

Martin Bernal's Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical 
Civilization, is a sincere effort to "lessen European cultural arrogance" 
by demonstrating the indebtedness of white European civilization to 
black African sources.   Know-ledgeable scholars have amply 
demonstrated the untruth of Bernal's primary claims.  But truth must 
not get in the way of therapy.  As the African-American Baseline 
Essays insist, "the therapeutic effect of history [for black students] can 
be lost, indeed totally defeated, if the African contribution is omitted."  
Therefore black students, and presumably any other students who are 
in the same classroom with them, must be taught that "Since Africa is 
widely believed to be the birthplace of the human race, it follows that 
Africa was the birthplace of mathematics and science."   As Marcus 
Garvey candidly put it, "Things that may not be true can be made true 
if you repeat them long and often enough.  Therefore always repeat 
statements that will give your race status and advantage."   This sage 
advice must presumably be kept from members of the "dominant" race 
or culture.  
<P>

The teachers who teach our public school children are graduates of 
American colleges where such doctrines of multiculturalism are 
rampant.  They then (or concurrently) attend a teacher-training 
institution to learn arcane methodologies for promoting these doctrines.  
There are about 1,300 teacher-training institutions, or "ed schools," in 
America today.  There are about 150 graduate schools of education 
which concentrate more on the study of education than on training 
teachers-preparing education professors, adminis-trators, etc.  The 
approximately 2.8 million public school teachers depend on these 
institutions for the certification that allows them to teach.  
Social critic Rita Kramer recently spent a year visiting and studying 
representative schools of education across the country.  Her conclusion:  
<P>

<blockquote>
At present, our teacher-training institutions, the schools, 
colleges, and departments of education on campuses 
across the country, are producing for the classrooms of 
America experts in methods of teaching with nothing to 
apply those methods to.  Their technique is abundant, their 
knowledge practically nonexistent.  A mastery of 
instructional strategies, an emphasis on educational 
psychology, a familiarity with pedagogical philosophies 
have gradually taken the place of a knowledge of history, 
literature, science, and mathematics. . . . 
<P>

Hardly anywhere did I find a sense that any kind of 
knowledge is valuable in itself or more valuable than any 
other . . . .  What matters is not to teach any particular 
subject or skill, not to preserve past accomplishments or 
stimulate future achievements, but to give to all that stamp 
of approval that will make them 'feel good about 
themselves.'  Self-esteem has replaced understanding as 
the goal of education. . . . 
<P>

The worst of the ed schools are certification mills where 
the minimally qualified instruct the barely literate in a 
parody of learning. 
</blockquote>

<P>
We have succeeded perhaps beyond our expectations in replacing 
knowledge and skills with self-esteem in our students.  American 
students and even their parents "feel good" about their educations.  
While Asian students outperform their American counterparts both in 
reading and in math, the American students are much more likely to 
consider themselves "among the best" in those accomplishments.  And 
around 80 percent of American mothers think their child's school is 
doing a good or excellent job even as one national study after another 
headlines the declining academic performance of the nation's 
students.   The prospect in civics, one supposes, is that Americans 
will feel good about their country as their civic freedoms continue to 
erode and they turn to tribal warfare.
<P>

The not surprising tendency of the multicultural therapy inflicted on 
America's children is to produce students who cannot distinguish 
between right and wrong; who are ignorant of their rights and duties as 
citizens and of the foundations and conditions of their political 
freedom; who have been taught to identify themselves through the skin 
color or surnames of their ancestors; who are ignorant of American 
history and the principles of American democracy or have been taught 
to despise America; who are lacking in basic intellectual 
accomplishments; and who believe that they should feel good about all 
this.   
<P>

Perhaps the most tragic injustice perpetrated against the innocent 
young student by teachers animated by these bad ideas is that he will 
have been denied his greatest birthright as an American.  He will have 
been intellectually and therefore politically exiled from that community 
bound together by what Abraham Lincoln called "the principles and 
axioms of free society":  the community originating in 1776 with the 
bold proclamation of the inalienable rights of man.  Indeed, today's 
student is in a sense divested of his very humanity insofar as he is 
taught to understand himself not as a being possessed of the "rights of 
human nature," but as a member of one tribe asserting his atavistic will 
against other tribes, while possessing no capacity of distinguishing or 
choosing between good and evil.  

<center>
<h3>We Hold These Truths</h3>
</center>

Intelligent liberal critics of multiculturalism see the problem more 
or less clearly.  As the respected historian of education Diane Ravitch 
says, American schools should say to students from other cultures "that 
wherever they have come from, wherever their parents have come 
from, they are now preparing to be American citizens. . . .  They must 
learn about American history, the Declaration of Independence, the 
Con-stitution, and the Bill of Rights, because this is now part of their 
precious heritage as American citizens."   So far so good.  But in 
inviting children from other cultures to become American, Ravitch 
would have them understand that "the unique feature of the United 
States is that its common culture has been formed by the interaction of 
its subsidiary cultures. . . .  Paradoxical as it may seem, the United 
States has a common culture that is multicultural."  "Our story is one of 
diverse peoples meeting, mingling, and changing each other."    But it 
is hardly unique for a "common culture" to be formed from "subsidiary 
cultures."  Nor is America's uniqueness to be found in diverse people 
mingling with and changing one another.  Lawrence Auster, a 
respectful critic of Ravitch's position, points out that her view "turns 
out to be virtually identical in key respects" with the multiculturalism 
she criticizes.   But, typical of the conservative response to 
multiculturalism, Auster offers as a remedy the affirmation of 
America's "Anglo-Saxon" roots.   Alex Haley for the WASPs?  
<P>

Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., offers a useful analysis of the phenomenon 
of multiculturalism in his popular little book, 
<i>The Disuniting of America:  Reflections on a Multicultural Society</i>.  
In response to the tribalism inherent in the multicultural view, 
Schlesinger says that "what has held the American people together in 
the absence of a common ethnic origin has been precisely a common 
adherence to ideals of democracy and human rights."   But these 
ideals which Americans are supposed to hold in common become very 
slippery in Schlesinger's hands.  "The American Creed . . . is an ever-
evolving philosophy."  It is "history" that gives us our "values."  
"People with a different history will have differing values.  But we 
believe that our own are better for us.  They work for us; and for that 
reason we live and die by them."   Certainly in proclaiming the 
"American Creed" in 1776, Thomas Jefferson had no intention of 
proclaiming an "ever-evolving philosophy."  He meant to proclaim 
what Lincoln understood him to have proclaimed, "an abstract truth, 
applicable to all men and all times."  This is the "paradox" and 
uniqueness of America, that for the first time in history a particular 
people established a particular political community on principles not 
peculiar to them but rooted in human nature itself.  
<P>

America began with a ringing affirmation of a fundamental moral 
and political truth:  "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all 
men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with 
certain inalienable rights."  Certainly, here was no appeal to skin color 
or ethnicity.  The truth of human equality and liberty was asserted 
against all despotisms of race, class, or religion.  Neither is this an 
appeal to "history" or an invocation of "Anglo-Saxon" roots.  America 
is distinguished by being founded on an idea, the idea of the equal 
rights of human nature.  We do not "live and die" for this idea because 
"it works for us" or because it is "our own."  We make it our own 
because it is true.  And having been elevated by making it our own, we 
pledge "our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor" to its 
vindication.  No nation or people in history had ever established its 
political institutions on such principles.  
<P>

There is no question that these ideas were generated and 
implemented by what the multiculturalists refer to as dead, white, 
European males-DWEMs to use the popularized acronym.  Are we 
then to believe that they should be confined to beings of that 
description?  That the blessings of liberal democracy "belong" only to 
the particular race or culture or gender that gave rise to it?  This was 
never the belief of Washington, or Jefferson, or Lincoln who did so 
much to secure these blessings for their posterity.  They believed 
themselves to have the high honor of securing and transmitting 
imperfectly and in one small place a universal inheritance, the 
birthright of all humanity.  They never for a moment found the 
authority of their ideas in the time, or race, or culture of those who 
proclaimed them or established them in the fundamental laws of their 
country.  The authority of their ideas lay, simply, in their truth.  That 
men throughout most of history (and throughout most of the world still 
today) tyrannized one another in an infinite variety of ways was not 
proof that human beings do not possess equal rights by nature-rather it 
was proof of how rare and difficult a thing it is to secure them.  It is 
proof of the philosophic rigor, the high moral discipline, the rare 
political sagacity, and-one must add-the great good fortune that is 
required for reflection and free choice to prevail over ignorance, 
prejudice, accident, and force.  Nothing short of such rigor, and 
sagacity, and luck will solve our current educational problems.
<P>

Proclaiming that all men everywhere and at all times possess by 
nature equal rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, the 
American founders undertook the historic effort to secure these rights, 
so far as they thought they could then be secured, to a small people at a 
particular place and time.  They were acutely conscious of the limits of 
their ability to secure these rights.  When they were able to establish a 
"more perfect union" they understood full well how far from perfection 
they remained.  It was all the new republic could do in the first century 
of its existence to keep the experiment in freedom from failing 
miserably at home, as the principles espoused in the American 
revolution slowly and uncertainly began to take hold on the minds, if 
not yet in the politics, of other peoples in the world.  
<P>

In the course of their history, the American people have many times 
fallen beneath the high standards they set for themselves at the 
beginning.  They have strayed from those principles, and they have 
forgotten them, and become confused about them, and allowed 
misunderstood self-interest to obscure them.  The reason that Abraham 
Lincoln is rightly regarded as the greatest democratic statesman is that 
he kept America from abandoning those principles as the foundation of 
American democracy.  His statesmanship preserved for future 
generations of Americans the moral truth of human equality as the pole 
star of their political life: 
<P>

<blockquote>
a standard maxim for free society, which should be 
familiar to all, and revered by all; constantly looked to, 
constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly 
attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly 
spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the 
happiness and value of life to all people of all colors 
everywhere.    
</blockquote>

<P>
To begin to restore American public education today, it is necessary 
to restore the moral and intellectual horizons within which the self 
evident truths of America's founding can command the respect and 
allegiance they deserve; within which the life and death choices 
required of citizens and statesmen can appear as something other than 
arbitrary assertions of ethnicity, or history, or gender.  Within such 
horizons, among the variety of regimes that come to light in principle 
and in history, Americans can justly appreciate why Lincoln might say 
of America, that here "We find ourselves under the government of a 
system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends 
of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former 
times tells us."   
<P>

The "genius" of the American people at the time of the founding 
made it both possible and necessary to establish a regime based on the 
principles proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence.  As 
Jefferson said in explaining the genesis of the Declaration, the ideas 
expressed in it were "the common sense of the subject" in America.  He 
was merely expressing "the American mind."   It was only because 
the American people had learned to embrace republican principles that 
it was possible to establish an American republic.  The Founders were 
animated by "that honorable determination which animates every 
votary of freedom to rest all our political experiments on the capacity 
of mankind for self government."   But they understood that this was 
a capacity that Americans would have to demonstrate for themselves, 
and continue to demonstrate each generation.  As the Declaration 
proclaims, the just powers of government are derived from "the consent 
of the governed."  Only a people prepared to consent to a republic are 
capable of establishing one.  This means a people prepared to recognize 
their own humanity and that of their fellow citizens; who will neither 
aspire to be masters nor submit to be slaves; who are prepared to rule 
and be ruled in turn; who are prepared to abide by the laws they claim 
the right to make for themselves.  A people that means to be free must 
have the virtues necessary to sustain their freedom.  Do we?
<P>

It is up to this generation, as it has been up to each generation that 
preceded us and will be up to each generation that succeeds us, to 
demonstrate our capacity for self government.  This we do for our own 
sake and for the sake of the cause to which our country was dedicated 
some two centuries ago.  What we prove capable, or incapable, of 
doing about the present state of American education will reflect not 
only on ourselves but on the prospects of free government itself.  
<P>

<blockquote>
The American people owe it to themselves , and to the 
cause of free Government, to prove by their establishments 
for the advancement and diffusion of Knowledge, that 
their political institutions . . . are as favorable to the 
intellectual and moral improvement of Man as they are 
conformable to his individual & social Rights.  What 
spectacle can be more edifying or more seasonable, than 
that of Liberty & Learning, each leaning on the other for 
their mutual & surest support?

<P>
When presidents, and governors, and educators talk about the crisis 
of American education, they often emphasize the need for a highly 
skilled work force in this technologically progressive world.  And there 
is such a need.  One should add that the ability to earn a decent living, 
and to have the self sufficiency and the responsibility that comes with 
that, is a great foundation of individual liberty, moral responsibility, 
and self government.  But job training and liberal education are two 
distinct things, and institutions of public education exist primarily for 
the latter.  The reasons for this are not always as apparent to the student 
as they might be.  Indeed, they are not always as apparent as they 
should be to our presidents, governors, and educators.  A reflection on 
not so ancient history reminds us of the importance of this distinction.  
<P>

In the autumn of 1942, in the midst of world war, informa-tion was 
smuggled out of Nazi Germany through neutral Switzerland revealing 
to the outside world "the extent of the German slaughter of Jews on the 
eastern front, the murder by gas of Polish Jews in three special 'death' 
camps at Chelmno, Belzec, and Treblinka, and of the deportation of 
Jews from France, Belgium, and Holland to an 'unknown destination' in 
the East."   It was only two years later that this 'unknown destination' 
was identified as Auschwitz, where Jews were being gassed at the rate 
of about 12,000 men, women, and children a day.  As Churchill wrote 
at the time, this was "probably the greatest and most horrible crime 
ever committed in the whole history of the world, and it has been done 
by scientific machinery by nominally civilized men." 
<P>

The German people were the most technically advanced-one might 
say highly educated-people in the world at that time.  Doctors, nurses, 
psychologists, educators, scientists, engineers, accountants, lawyers, 
and the whole array of other highly skilled and nominally educated 
men and women, were devoting their considerable skills, acquired at 
great effort and expense, to the extermination of a people.
<P>

Our century, the most technologically advanced century in history, 
with more technically skilled people per square mile than could once 
have been imagined, stands out as a century in which genocide is a 
term with which every grade school child must become familiar.  As 
communism takes its much awaited departure from the world, let us not 
forget the Bolshevik extermination of the Kulaks, the millions 
sacrificed to China's political experiments, and of course the killing 
fields in Cambodia-all in the name of scientific socialism and progress, 
but in fact amounting to a new phenomenon in the world:  scientific 
savagery.
<P>

More generally, if less dramatically, human beings throughout 
history have proven as apt to use their acquired skills to take advantage 
of one another as to confer benefits on one another.
What does this tell us about education and about the distinction 
between liberal education on the one hand and the acquisition of 
competence or technical skill-job training-on the other?  It points to the 
very heart of the matter.  Every art, or craft, or profession, or technical 
skill may be used in the service of justice or injustice, good or evil.  
They may be used to dignify our humanity or to degrade it, to free us 
or to enslave us.  For this reason, it is critical that we learn to do what is 
right as we arm ourselves with such great power to do wrong.  
<P>

Turgot's full inscription on a portrait of Benjamin Franklin reads, 
Eripuit Fulmen Coelo Sceptrumque Tyrannis ("He snatched the 
lightning from the heavens and the sceptre from tyrants").  This tribute 
to Franklin indicates how "liberty and learning," in Madison's phrase, 
may be mutually supportive and how technical skills and liberal 
education are vitally connected.  The prototype of the modern 
educational reform movements in America came in response to the 
launching of Sputnik by the Soviet Union, by which tyranny may be 
said to have ascended into heaven (with grave earthly consequences).  
Americans energetically set about to ensure that the coming generation 
of American citizens would have the technical competency to 
withstand the threat of communist tyranny armed with the most 
sophisticated modern technology.  This effort, of course, assumed that 
Americans would have the courage to stand up to this threat-a courage 
founded in the conviction that American freedoms were worth fighting 
for.  Slavish cowards with good math and science skills are no match 
for technologically advanced tyrants.  Today, as third world tyrants are 
arming themselves with nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, 
Americans appear to be in as much need of courage and conviction as 
of technological competence.

<h3>The NEA and Local Control of Our Schools  </h3>
</center>

One of the chief obstacles to effective reform of American public 
education is the powerful centralized union of public school teachers, 
the National Education Association.  The NEA is the most powerful 
trade union in America.  It boasts a membership around 2.1 million.  It 
has 52 state-level affiliates and around 13,000 local-level affiliates.  All 
local members and state members are automatically national members, 
paying an average $400 a year in dues, most of which goes into the 
coffers of the state and national organizations.  One estimate of the 
total dues collected at all levels in 1992-93 is a whopping $750 million.  
<P>

Providing the main pool of teachers to the nation's public schools, the 
NEA is a "near-monopoly supplier to a government-enforced 
monopoly consumer."  The NEA also exerts a powerful influence on 
school management and on curriculum.  As a public sector union, the 
NEA's power is more political than economic, and its essential interest 
is increasing government spending and preventing competition from 
the private sector.  
<P>

"[T]he union's growing power has exactly coincided with the 
dismal spectacle of rising spending on education producing 
deteriorating results."  In 1962, the percentage of public school 
teachers in collective bargaining units was zero.  By 1992, that 
percentage had risen to 80 percent.  Teachers' salaries, which in 1945 
averaged $14,770 a year (in 1992 dollars), rose to $35,334 by 1992.  
This does not include fringe benefits worth another 25 percent after 
taxes.  Per pupil spending was $974 in 1945 (again in 1992 dollars) and 
by 1992 had risen to $5,216.  Average national SAT math scores were 
493 and verbal scores were 470 in the late 1940s.  Both rose in the '50s, 
then began their notorious declines through the '60s and '70s, levelling 
off in the '80s to stand in 1992 at 476 and a dismal 423, respectively.  
<P>

According to former U.S. Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander, 
"After the post office, schools are the most unionized activity in 
America. . . .  [T]hey are often the largest lobby in the state."  The NEA 
is extremely political and extremely partisan, and proud of it.  "You're 
looking at the absolute heart and center of the Democratic Party," says 
former Secretary of Education William Bennett.  The first time the 
NEA endorsed a presidential candidate was in 1976, when they 
endorsed Jimmy Carter.  The NEA proudly claims to have been the 
largest single bloc at the Democratic National Convention since 1976.  
At the 1992 Democratic convention, one in eight delegates were NEA 
members endorsing Bill Clinton.  The NEA sent posters celebrating the 
Clinton victory in January 1993 to some 26,000 junior high and middle 
schools.  Your tax dollars at work.  
<P>

NEA methods and interests were displayed in the NEA-affiliated 
California Teachers Association efforts in 1992 to prevent the placing 
of a school choice initiative on the ballot.  Methods included blocking 
citizens' access to the petition in shopping malls.  CTA President D.A. 
Weber explained that "There are some proposals that are so evil that 
they should never even be presented to the voters," and compared the 
school choice initiative to an effort to empower the Ku Klux Klan or 
legalized child prostitution.  These are the people of whom Bill Clinton 
said, "If I become President, you'll be my partners.  I won't forget who 
brought me to the White House."  
<P>

As powerful and pervasive as the NEA is, there is at least the 
possibility that its hold on American public education can be broken.  
In a 1992 Gallup poll, "only half the American people supported 
private-school vouchers."  In 1993, this had risen to 70 percent.  School 
choice initiatives have been cropping up across the country, and the 
more there are the more difficult it is for the NEA to concentrate its 
considerable resources against them.  
<P>

Twenty-two percent of NEA teachers put their own children in 
private schools.  This is twice the national average.  Presumably they 
know what they are doing and can afford to do it.  Parents send their 
children to private schools when they can afford to for the simple 
reason that private schools are better than public schools.  One reason 
for this is that private schools must respond to market forces while 
public schools do not have to respond to these forces.   Public schools 
are much more highly unionized than private schools and have a much 
more difficult time firing bad teachers.  Public school principals also 
have much more difficulty hiring the teachers they may want.  Private 
school teachers are more satisfied with their jobs, have fewer sick 
leaves, better attendance and all this for less money and without 
unions.  "Private school teachers are trading economic compensation 
and formal job security for superior working conditions, professional 
autonomy, and personal fulfillment.  Public school teachers are doing 
precisely the opposite."   "[I]t is instructive that the private schools, 
which are products of an institutional system that decentralizes power 
to the producers and immediate consumers of educational services, 
tend to develop precisely the sorts of organizational characteristics 
reformers want the public schools to have."   
<P>

Schools tend to do better when they must respond to the parents and 
students who have the greatest stake in the schools' performance.  That 
means parents must be able to withdraw their children and send them to 
another school.  Politicians and bureaucrats and special interests have a 
great stake in preventing parents from doing this and retaining the 
control they have over our public schools.  This is why there is 
resistance to vouchers.  But the country has a stake in wresting control 
of its public schools from the centralized bureaucrats, interest groups, 
and unions and returning it to local parents.  Maybe fewer mothers 
would "feel good" about their child's education if they thought there 
was an alternative.  An added virtue of vouchers is that they would 
reduce the need for the extremely costly army of bureaucrats with bad 
ideas currently supported by our education tax dollars.  
<P>

Some knowledgeable and experienced people advocate the 
establishment of various kinds of national standards and tests to 
improve the performance of our public schools, and there has been 
some minimal success in applying national standards.   And the 
opposition to such proposals from education interest groups like the 
NEA suggests that such measures may have at least some potential for 
holding the education monopoly accountable for their performance.  
The problem is that to implement any national standards and tests will 
likely subject the standards and tests in the process to the entrenched 
interest groups and ideologues who have done so much damage to 
American education already.   Although there is certainly a national 
interest in elevating the standards of American public education, this 
interest may be best served by giving the opportunity to the parents 
whose interests are most at stake to see that their children get the 
educations they deserve.

At the end of the American War of Independence James Madison 
wrote an Address to the States, endorsed by Congress and by George 
Washington, recommending measures to secure the fragile 
independence that had just been won.  He concluded with a reflection 
that sheds light on what is at stake in the education of American 
citizens in our own day:
<P>

<blockquote>
[T]he citizens of the United States are responsible for the 
greatest trust ever confided to a political society.  If 
justice, good faith, honor, gratitude and all the other 
qualities which enoble the character of a nation and fulfill 
the ends of government be the fruits of our establishments, 
the cause of liberty will acquire a dignity and lustre, which 
it has never yet enjoyed, and an example will be set, which 
cannot but have the most favourable influence on the 
rights of Mankind.  If in the other side, our governments 
should be unfortunately blotted with the reverse of these 
cardinal and essential virtues, the great cause which we 
have engaged to vindicate, will be dishonored and 
betrayed; the last and fairest experiment in favor of the 
rights of human nature will be turned against them; and 
their patrons and friends exposed to be insulted and 
silenced by the votaries of tyranny and usurpation.

<h3>Statements on Religion and Politics:  Washington to Bush</h3>

The purpose of the following collection of statements is to show 
the extraordinary agreement among presidents throughout America's 
history concerning the proper relationship between religion and 
politics.
<P>

This agreement affirms two principles: first, that there must be a 
separation of church and state, and the government must not favor or 
support one sect in preference to others; but second, that the principles 
of human freedom and equality ultimately rest on the moral and 
religious convictions of the American people, and that if those 
convictions ever fail, liberty will not survive.
<P>

We include statements by all of the presidents from Franklin 
Roosevelt to George Bush, and statements by some of the more 
important presidents from Washington to Coolidge.  At the end, we 
also include famous statements by Alexis de Tocqueville and Supreme 
Court Justice William O. Douglas.

<h3>GEORGE WASHINGTON</h3>

Farewell Address (excerpt)<BR>
September 19, 1796
<P>

Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political 
prosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable supports.  In 
vain would that man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who should 
labour to subvert these great Pillars of human happiness, these 
firmest props of the duties of Men and citizens.  The mere 
Politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to 
cherish them.  A volume could not trace all their connections with 
private and public felicity.  Let it simply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious 
obligation desert the oaths, which are the instruments of 
investigation in Courts of Justice?  And let us with caution indulge 
the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion.  
Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education 
on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid 
us to expect that National morality can prevail in exclusion of 
religious principle.
<P>

'Tis substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary 
spring of popular government.  The rule indeed extends with more 
or less force to every species of free Government.  Who that is a 
sincere friend to it, can look with indifference upon attempts to 
shake the foundation of the fabric?
<P>

Promote then as an object of primary importance, Institutions 
for the general diffusion of knowledge.  In proportion as the 
structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is 
essential that public opinion should be enlightened. . . .

Letter to the Hebrew congregation of Newport, 
Rhode Island (excerpt)<BR>
August 17, 1790
<P>

It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the 
indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the 
exercise of their inherent natural rights.  For happily the 
government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no 
sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who 
live under its protection should demean themselves as good 
citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support. . . .  
May the children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, 
continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants, 
while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, 
and there shall be none to make him afraid.

<h3>THOMAS JEFFERSON</h3>

Notes on Virginia, Query 18 (excerpt)<BR>
1787
<P>

And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we 
have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of 
the people that these liberties are of the gift of God?  That they are 
not to be violated but with his wrath?  Indeed I tremble for my 
country when I reflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep 
for ever. . . .

<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

Report to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, University 
of Virginia (excerpt)<BR>
October 7, 1822
<P>

. . . in conformity with the principles of our constitution, 
which places all sects of religion on an equal footing, with the 
jealousies of the different sects in guarding that equality from 
encroachment or surprise, and with the sentiments of the 
legislature in freedom of religion, manifested on former occasions, 
they had not proposed that any professorship of divinity should be 
established in the University; that provision, however, was made 
for giving instruction in the Hebrew, Greek and Latin languages, 
the depositories of the originals, and of the earliest and most 
respected authorities of the faith of every sect, and for courses of 
ethical lectures, developing those moral obligations in which all 
sects agree.  That, proceeding thus far, without offense to the 
constitution, they had left, at this point, to every sect to take into 
their own hands the office of further instruction in the peculiar 
tenet of each.
<P>

It was not, however, to be understood that instruction in 
religious opinion and duties was meant to be precluded by the 
public authorities, as indifferent to the interests of society.  On the 
contrary, the relations which exist between man and his Maker, 
and the duties resulting from those relations, are the most 
interesting and important to every human being, and the most 
incumbent on his study and investigation.  The want of instruction 
in the various creeds of religious faith existing among our citizens 
presents, therefore, a chasm in a general institution of the useful 
sciences. . . .

<h3>ABRAHAM LINCOLN</h3>

Proclamation Appointing a National Fast Day (excerpt)<BR>
March 30, 1863
<P>

Whereas, the Senate of the United States, devoutly recognizing 
the Supreme Authority and just Government of Almighty God, in 
all the affairs of men and of nations, has, by a resolution, requested 
the President to designate and set apart a day for National prayer 
and humiliation.
<P>

And whereas it is the duty of nations as well as of men, to own 
their dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess 
their sins and transgressions, in humble sorrow, yet with assured 
hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon; and 
to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures 
and proven by all history, that those nations only are blessed 
whose God is the Lord.
<P>

And, insomuch as we know that, by His divine law, nations 
like individuals are subjected to punishments and chastisements in 
this world, may we not justly fear that the awful calamity of civil 
war, which now desolates the land, may be but a punishment, 
inflicted upon us, for our presumptuous sins, to the needful end of 
our national reformation as a whole People?  We have been the 
recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven.  We have been 
preserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity.  We have 
grown in numbers, wealth and power, as no other nation has ever 
grown.  But we have forgotten God.  We have forgotten the 
gracious hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and 
enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the 
deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced 
by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own.  Intoxicated with 
unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the 
necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to 
the God that made us!
<P>

It behooves us then, to humble ourselves before the offended 
Power, to confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and 
forgiveness.
<P>

Now, therefore . . . I do, by this my proclamation, designate 
and set apart Thursday, the 30th day of April, 1863, as a day of 
national humiliation, fasting and prayer.  And I do hereby request 
all the People to abstain, on that day, from their ordinary secular 
pursuits, and to unite, at their several places of public worship and 
their respective homes, in keeping the day holy to the Lord, and 
devoted to the humble discharge of the religious duties proper to 
that solemn occasion.
<P>

Let us then rest humbly in the hope authorized by the Divine 
teachings, that the united cry of the Nation will be heard on high, 
and answered with blessings, no less than the pardon of our 
national sins, and the restoration of our now divided and suffering 
Country, to its former happy condition of unity and peace.

Second Inaugural Address (excerpt)<BR>
March 4, 1865
<P>

On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all 
thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil-war.  All 
dreaded it-all sought to avert it. . . .
<P>

One eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not 
distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern 
part of it.  These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful 
interest.  All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the 
war.  To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the 
object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by 
war; while the government claimed no right to do more than to 
restrict the territorial enlargement of it.  Neither party expected for 
the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already 
attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might 
cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease.  Each 
looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and 
astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; 
and each invokes His aid against the other.  It may seem strange 
that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing 
their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge 
not that we be not judged.  The prayers of both could not be 
answered; that of neither has been answered fully.  The Almighty 
has His own purposes.  "Woe unto the world because of offenses! 
for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by 
whom the offense cometh!"  If we shall suppose that American 
Slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, 
must needs come, but which, having continued through His 
appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both 
North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by 
whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure 
from those divine attributes which the believers in a Living God 
always ascribe to Him?  Fondly do we hope-fervently do we 
pray-that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.  Yet, 
if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-
man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, 
and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by 
another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years 
ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord, are true 
and righteous altogether."
<P>

With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in 
the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish 
the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him 
who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his 
orphan-to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a 
lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.

<h3>THEODORE ROOSEVELT</h3>

"The World of Micah: The Religion of Service" (excerpt)<BR>
1917
<P>

The most perfect machinery of government will not keep us as 
a nation from destruction if there is not within us a soul.  No 
abounding material prosperity shall avail us if our spiritual senses 
atrophy.  The foes of our own household shall surely prevail 
against us unless there be in our people an inner life which finds its 
outward expression in a morality not very widely different from 
that preached by the seers and prophets of Judea when the 
grandeur that was Greece and the glory that was Rome still lay in 
the future.
<P>

In his Farewell Address to his countrymen, Washington said:  
"Morality is a necessary spring of popular government . . . and let 
us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be 
maintained without religion.  Whatever may be conceded to the 
influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, 
reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national 
morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."
<P>

Washington lacked Lincoln's gift of words; but not Lincoln 
himself possessed more robust common sense in the thought that 
lies back of words.  In this case the thought is not new-only a few 
good thoughts are new; but it was given expression at a time when 
the European movement with which the American people were in 
most complete sympathy-the French Revolution-had endeavored 
to destroy the abuses of priestcraft and bigotry by abolishing not 
only Christianity but religion, in the sense in which religion is 
properly understood.  The result was a cynical disregard of 
morality and a carnival of cruelty and bigotry, committed in the 
names of reason and liberty, which equalled anything ever done by 
Torquemada and the fanatics of the Inquisition in the names of 
religion and order.  Washington wished his fellow countrymen to 
walk clear of such folly and iniquity.  As in all cases where he 
dealt with continuing causes his words are as well worth pondering 
now as when they were written. . . .
<P>

In this actual world a churchless community, a community 
where men have abandoned and scoff at or ignore their religious 
needs, is a community on the rapid down-grade.  It is true that 
occasional individuals or families may have nothing to do with 
church or with religious practices and observances and yet 
maintain the highest standard of refined ethical obligation.  But 
this does not affect the case in the world as it now is, any more 
than the fact that exceptional men and women under exceptional 
conditions have disregarded the marriage tie without moral harm 
to themselves interferes with the larger fact that such disregard if 
at all common means the complete moral disintegration of the 
body politic. . . .

<h3>WOODROW WILSON</h3>

Address in Trenton, New Jersey (excerpt)<BR>
October 1, 1911
<P>

There are great problems, ladies and gentlemen, before the 
American people.  There are problems which will need purity of 
spirit and an integrity of purpose such as has never been called for 
before in the history of this country.  I should be afraid to go 
forward if I did not believe that there lay at the foundation of all 
our schooling and of all our thought this incomparable and 
unimpeachable Word of God.  If we cannot derive our strength 
thence, there is no source from which we can derive it, and so I 
would bid you go from this place, if I may, inspired once more 
with the feeling that the providence of God is the foundation of affairs, and that only those can guide, and only those can follow, 
who take this providence of God from the sources where it is 
authentically interpreted. . . .
<P>

The happiness of seeing a great company of people like this 
gathered together in the interest of the Sunday School is the 
happiness of knowing that there are they who seek light and who 
know that the lamp from which their spirits can be kindled is the 
lamp that glows in the Word of God.
<P>

Every Sunday School should be a place where this great book 
is not only opened, is not only studied, is not only revered, but is 
drunk of as if it were a fountain of life, is used as if it were the 
only source of inspiration and of guidance.  No great nation can 
ever survive its own temptations and its own follies that does not 
indoctrinate its children in the Word of God; so that as school 
master and as Governor I know that my feet must rest with the feet 
of my fellowmen upon this foundation, and upon this foundation 
only; for the righteousness of nations, like the righteousness of 
men, must take its source from these foundations of inspiration.

<h3>CALVIN COOLIDGE</h3>

"Authority and Religious Liberty" (excerpt)<BR>
September 21, 1924
<P>

[The Founders] did not deny the existence of authority.  They 
recognized it and undertook to abide by it, and through obedience 
to it secure their freedom.  They made their appeal and rested their 
cause not merely upon earthly authority, but in the very first 
paragraph of the Declaration of Independence asserted that they 
proposed "to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate 
and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God 
entitle them."  And as they closed that noble document in which 
they submitted their claims to the opinions of mankind they again 
revealed what they believed to be the ultimate source of authority 
by stating that they were also "appealing to the Supreme Judge of 
the world for the rectitude of" . . . their "intentions."
<P>

When finally our Constitution was adopted, it contained 
specific provision that the President and members of the Congress 
and of state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officials, 
should be qualified for the discharge of their office by oath or 
affirmation.  By the statute law of the United States, and I doubt 
not by all States, such oaths are administered by a solemn appeal 
to God for help in the keeping of their covenants.  I scarcely need 
to refer to the fact that the houses of the Congress, and so far as I 
know the state legislatures, open their daily sessions with prayer.  
The foundation of our independence and our Government rests 
upon our basic religious convictions.  Back of the authority of our 
laws is the authority of the Supreme Judge of the World, to whom 
we still appeal for their final justification. . . .
<P>

What a wide difference between the American position and that 
imagined by the vagabond who thought of liberty as a glorious 
feast unprotected and unregulated by law.  This is not civilization, 
but a plain reversion to the life of the jungle.  Without the 
protection of the law, and the imposition of its authority, equality 
cannot be maintained, liberty disappears and property vanishes.  
This is anarchy.  The forces of darkness are traveling in that 
direction.  But the spirit of America turns its face towards the light. 
<P>

It seems to me perfectly plain that the authority of law, the 
right to equality, liberty and property, under American institutions, 
have for their foundation reverence for God.  If we could imagine 
that to be swept away, these institutions of our American 
government could not long survive. . . .  

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

"The Inspiration of the Declaration" (excerpt)<BR>
July 5, 1926
<P>

[W]hen we come to a contemplation of the immediate 
conception of the principles of human relationship which went into 
the Declaration of Independence we are not required to extend our 
search beyond our own shores.  They are found in the texts, the 
sermons, and the writings of the early colonial clergy who were 
earnestly undertaking to instruct their congregations in the great 
mystery of how to live.  They preached equality because they 
believed in the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.  
They justified freedom by the text that we are all created in the 
divine image, all partakers of the divine spirit.
<P>

Placing every man on a plane where he acknowledged no 
superiors, where no one possessed any right to rule over him, he 
must inevitably choose his own rulers through a system of self 
government.  This was their theory of democracy.  In those days 
such doctrines would scarcely have been permitted to flourish and 
spread in any other country.  This was the purpose which the 
fathers cherished.  In order that they might have freedom to 
express these thoughts and opportunity to put them into action, 
whole congregations with their pastors had migrated to the 
colonies.  These great truths were in the air that our people 
breathed.  Whatever else we may say of it, the Declaration of 
Independence was profoundly American. . . . 
<P>

A spring will cease to flow if its source be dried up; a tree will 
wither if its roots be destroyed.  In its main features the 
Declaration of Independence is a great spiritual document.  It is a 
declaration not of material but of spiritual conceptions.  Equality, 
liberty, popular sovereignty, the rights of man-these are not 
elements which we can see and touch.  They are ideals.  They have 
their source and their roots in the religious convictions.  They 
belong to the unseen world.  Unless the faith of the American 
people in these religious convictions is to endure, the principles of 
our Declaration will perish.  We can not continue to enjoy the 
result if we neglect and abandon the cause. . . .

<h3>FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT</h3>

Address at George Rogers Clark Memorial, 
Vincennes, Indiana (excerpt)<BR>
June 14, 1936
<P>

It is not a coincidence that this service in dedication of a noble 
monument takes place on a Sunday morning.  Governor McNutt 
and I, aware of the historic relationship of religion to this 
campaign of the Revolution, and to the later Ordinance of 1787, 
have understood and felt the appropriateness of today.
<P>

Clark had declared at Kaskaskia before he began his famous 
march, that all religions would be tolerated in America.  Eight 
years later the Ordinance of 1787, which established the territory 
northwest of the Ohio River, provided that "no person demeaning 
himself in a peaceable and orderly manner shall ever be molested 
on account of his mode of worship or for religious sentiments in 
the said territory."  And the Ordinance went on to declare further 
that "religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good 
government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means 
of education shall forever be encouraged."  It seems to me that one 
hundred and forty-nine years later the people of the United States, 
in every part thereof, could reiterate and continue to strive for the 
principle that religion, morality and knowledge are necessary to 
good government and the happiness of mankind.

Annual Message to Congress (excerpt)<BR>
January 4, 1939
<P>

Storms from abroad directly challenge three institutions 
indispensable to Americans, now as always.  The first is religion.  
It is the source of the other two-democracy and international good 
faith.
<P>

Religion, by teaching man his relationship to God, gives the 
individual a sense of his own dignity and teaches him to respect 
himself by respecting his neighbors.
<P>

Democracy, the practice of self government, is a covenant 
among free men to respect the rights and liberties of their fellows.
International good faith, a sister of democracy, springs from 
the will of civilized nations of men to respect the rights and 
liberties of other nations of men.
<P>

In a modern civilization, all three-religion, democracy, and 
international good faith-complement and support each other.
Where freedom of religion has been attacked, the attack has 
come from sources opposed to democracy.  Where democracy has 
been overthrown, the spirit of free worship has disappeared.  And 
where religion and democracy have vanished, good faith and 
reason in international affairs have given way to strident ambition 
and brute force.
<P>

An ordering of society which relegates religion, democracy and 
good faith among nations to the background can find no place 
within it for the ideals of the Prince of Peace.  The United States 
rejects such an ordering, and retains its ancient faith.

Letter to the Honorable Samuel I. Rosenman, President 
of the Jewish Education Committee (excerpt)<BR>
December 16, 1940
<P>

Our modern democratic way of life has its deepest roots in our 
great common religious tradition, which for ages past has taught to 
civilized mankind the dignity of the human being, his equality 
before God, and his responsibility in the making of a better and 
fairer world.
<P>

Everywhere in the world there are men of stout heart and firm 
faith now engaged in a great spiritual struggle to test whether that 
ancient wisdom is to endure, or whether it must give way to the 
older, discarded doctrine that some few men shall dominate 
multitudes of others and dictate to them their thinking, their 
religion, their living.  This conflict has found its most terrible 
expression in a war which has now engulfed a large portion of 
humanity.  In its more peaceful aspects, the same struggle also 
pervades all efforts of men of good will who are seeking through 
democracy the way to the world to come.
<P>

In teaching this democratic faith to American children, we need 
the sustaining, buttressing aid of those great ethical religious 
teachings which are the heritage of our modern civilization.  For 
"not upon strength nor upon power, but upon the spirit of God" 
shall our democracy be founded.
<P>

I hope that your Committee and all American citizens will 
continue to strive to bring a new, fresh vigor into the teaching and 
lessons of religion for the children of our beloved land.

We have just come through a decade in which forces of evil in 
various parts of the world have been lined up in a bitter fight to 
banish from the face of the earth . . . religion and democracy.  For 
these forces of evil have long realized that both religion and 
democracy are founded on one basic principle, the worth and 
dignity of the individual man and woman.  Dictatorship, on the 
other hand, has always rejected that principle.  Dictatorship, by 
whatever name, is founded on the doctrine that the individual 
amounts to nothing; that the State is the only thing that counts; and 
that men and women and children were put on earth solely for the 
purpose of serving the State.
<P>

In that long struggle between these two doctrines, the cause of 
decency and righteousness has been victorious.  The right of every 
human being to live in dignity and freedom, the right to worship 
his God in his own way, the right to fix his own relationship to his 
fellow men and to his Creator-these again have been saved for 
mankind.
<P>

The fight to preserve these rights was hard-won.  The victory 
took a toll of human life and treasure so large that it should bring 
home to us forever how precious, how invaluable, is our liberty 
which we had just begun to take for granted.
<P>

Now that we have preserved our freedom of conscience and 
religion, our right to live by a decent moral and spiritual code of 
our own choosing, let us make full use of that freedom.  Let us 
make use of it to save a world which is beset by so many threats of 
new conflicts, new terror, and new destruction. . . .
<P>

If men and nations would but live by the precepts of the 
ancient prophets and the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount, 
problems which now seem so difficult would soon disappear.
That is the great task for you teachers of religious faith.  This 
is a supreme opportunity for the Church to continue to fulfill its 
mission on earth.  The Protestant Church, the Catholic Church, and 
the Jewish Synagogue-bound together in the American unity of 
brotherhood-must provide the shock forces to accomplish this 
moral and spiritual awakening.  No other agency can do it.  Unless 
it is done, we are headed for the disaster we would deserve.  Oh 
for an Isaiah or a Saint Paul to reawaken this sick world to its 
moral responsibilities!

<h3>DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER</h3>

Address to the National Conference of Catholic 
Charities (excerpt)<br>
September 26, 1960
<P>

The American people accept as a clear responsibility the 
combating of privation and suffering.  The growth in private 
philanthropic contributions in the past ten years has exceeded 
both the rate of growth of our population and our personal 
income. . . . 
<P>

Now this responsibility is not laid upon us by any constitutional or legal mandate.  Our belief, that men are brothers in 
divine origin and destiny, is a part of our religious heritage that 
reaches back to the hills of Galilee and imposes upon each of us a 
spiritually-rooted obligation.  Moreover, the methods by which 
we discharge this obligation must conform to the true spirit of the 
giver.  And, today, they involve a lasting and fruitful partnership 
between citizens and their government. . . 
<P>

Against the dangers inherent in the attitude and announced 
purposes of a powerful, secretive dictatorship, we steadfastly 
maintain the military, moral, economic and political strength to 
assure the nation's safety.  Further, knowing that peace and 
freedom are weakened if not shared, we help other nations which, 
like ourselves, uphold the dignity of men and maintain their 
liberty.  But in spite of these inescapable burdens, America, if true 
to herself, will never be tempted to abandon her noble goals.  
For close to two centuries our nation has thrived under the 
bracing influence of belief in God and the dignity of the 
individual.  Should this spiritual base of our society ever become 
dimmed, our faith in the destiny of America would disappear 
before a vain reliance on materialism, and crass political 
maneuver.
<P>

Then, even should we seem, for a while, victorious over world 
circumstances and all visible foes, we would be tragic 
losers-robbed of our heritage in ideals and our destiny as a leader 
for world peace with justice.  An apparent triumph would become 
a soon-exposed illusion.  A materialistic America-bereft of 
spiritual purpose-could be nothing more than a rudderless ship of 
state, and eventually a victim of the fury of international storms 
and internal decay.
<P>

That tragedy will never be visited upon us so long as our 
churches and our synagogues and chapels-and people who believe 
in God and in themselves-continue to give of their spirit, of their 
time, and of their substance, that they may be secure and their 
fellow men may have faith and hope and courage. . . .

<h3>JOHN F. KENNEDY</h3>

Remarks at the Dedication Breakfast of 
International Christian Leadership, Inc. (excerpt)<BR>
February 9, 1961
<P>

This country was founded by men and women who were 
dedicated or came to be dedicated to two propositions:  first, a 
strong religious conviction, and secondly a recognition that this 
conviction could flourish only under a system of freedom.
I think it is appropriate that we pay tribute to this great 
constitutional principle which is enshrined in the First Amendment 
of the Constitution:  the principle of religious independence, of 
religious liberty, of religious freedom.  But I think it is also 
important that we pay tribute and acknowledge another great 
principle, and that is the principle of religious conviction.  
<P>

Religious freedom has no significance unless it is accompanied by 
conviction.  And therefore the Puritans and the Pilgrims of my 
own section of New England, the Quakers of Pennsylvania, the 
Catholics of Maryland, the Presbyterians of North Carolina, the 
Methodists and the Baptists who came later, all shared these two 
great traditions which, like silver threads, have run through the 
warp and the woof of American history.

Remarks to the Trustees of the Union of 
American Congregations (excerpt)<BR>
November 13, 1961
<P>

I think, as the Rabbi said, that the significance of this 
ceremony is not merely a gift of an ancient document, but that in 
a very real sense the great issue today is between, as he said, the 
supremacy of the moral law which is initiated, originated, and 
developed in the Bible, and which has special application here 
today.
<P>

I've never felt that we should attempt to use the great impulse 
towards God and towards religion, which all people feel, as an 
element in a cold war struggle.  Rather, it's not an arm, it is the 
essence of the issue-not the organization of economy so much but 
the supremacy of moral law, and therefore the right of the 
individual, his rights to be protected by the state and not be at the 
mercy of the state.
<P>

In the Inaugural Address, which the Rabbi mentioned, I said 
that the basic issue was that the rights the citizen enjoyed did not 
come from the state but rather came from the hand of God.  And 
it's written here [pointing to the Torah].  And it is written in the 
Old and New Testaments.

A Proclamation for a National Day of Prayer (excerpt)<BR>
October 8, 1963
<P>

Our forefathers declared the independence of our Nation "with 
a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence."  In that 
reliance, they set forth the conviction that all men are created equal 
and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
<P>

More than a century and three-quarters after our Nation was 
dedicated to that proposition, it may truly be reaffirmed that "We 
are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme 
Being."  Conscious of that religious character of our people, the 
Congress of the United States by a joint resolution of April 17, 
1952, provided that "The President shall set aside and proclaim a 
suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of 
Prayer, on which the people of the United States may turn to God 
in prayer and meditation, at churches, in groups, and as individuals."

<h3>LYNDON B. JOHNSON</h3>

Remarks to a Group of Civil Rights Leaders (excerpt)<BR>
April 29, 1964
<P>

[F]rom the time of the ancient Hebrew prophets and the 
dispersal of the money changers, men of God have taught us that 
social problems are moral problems on a huge scale.  They have 
demonstrated that a religion which did not struggle to remove 
oppression from the world of men would not be able to create the 
world of spirit.  They have preached that the church should be the 
first to awake to individual suffering and the church should be the 
bravest in opposing all social wrongs.
<P>

This tradition is deeply imbedded in America's history.  During 
the middle of the 19th century, men of God, men of all faiths, men 
of the North, men of the South, took to pulpits, to press, yes, even 
out into the public squares to demand an end to the moral evil of 
slavery.  As a consequence, we took the chains off the slaves. . . .
Today, as we meet here a century later, we are faced with and 
we are given another great opportunity.  Today, as we meet here, 
again the problem of racial wrongs and racial hatreds is the central 
moral problem of this Republic.  Today, as we meet here in the 
first house of the land, again hostility and misunderstanding and 
even violence awaits the man who attempts to translate the 
meaning of God's love into the actions and the thoughts of this 
world and this time.
<P>

Today, again the hope for happiness of millions of Negro 
Americans is going to be profoundly affected by your efforts.  And 
today, again, religion has one of those rare, historical opportunities 
to renew its own purpose, to enhance the dignity of its own social 
role, to strengthen its institutions, and its heritage. . . .
<P>

[L]aws and government are, at best, coarse instruments for 
reminding social institutions or illuminating the dark places of the 
human heart.  They can deal only with the broadest and the most 
obvious problems, constantly guarding against segregation in 
schools but not against the thousands of incidents of discrimination 
and hatred which give the lie to what is learned there in the 
schoolroom.
<P>

They can call for the highest standards of moral conduct, but 
those standards are only tortuously imposed on a community 
which does not accept them, for laws do not create moral 
convictions.  Those convictions must come from within the people 
themselves, and it is your job, as men of God, to reawaken the 
conscience of your beloved land, the United States of America.

<h3>RICHARD M. NIXON</h3>

Remarks at the 17th Annual Presidential 
Prayer Breakfast (excerpt)<BR>
January 30, 1969
<P>

In these days in which religion is not supposed to be fashion-
able in many quarters, in these days when skepticism and even 
agnosticism seems to be on the upturn, over half of all the letters 
that have come into our office have indicated that people of all 
faiths and of all nations in a very simple way are saying:  "We are 
praying for you, Mr. President.  We are praying for this country. . . . 
As I read those letters I realized how great was my responsibility and how great was your responsibility, those who 
share with me these days in Government.
I realize that people whom we will never meet have this deep 
religious faith which has run through the destiny of this land from 
the beginning.
<P>

I realize that we carry on our shoulders their hopes, but more 
important, we are sustained by their prayers.
I say to all of you joining us here today . . . you have inspired 
us.  You have given us a sense of the continuity of history which 
brings us together from the beginning to now.  You have told us in 
a very simple and eloquent way that, great as the problems are 
which now confront us, with faith, faith in our God, faith in the 
ideals of our country . . . we are going to be able to make these 
next years great years for this Nation and great years for the world.
I believe that and it is to that end that we dedicate ourselves 
today.  That objective transcends all partisan considerations.  I am 
proud to stand here today in the presence of those who, by your 
being here, indicate that you have not lost faith in this Nation.  
You have not lost faith in the religious background that has 
sustained us. . . .

<h3>GERALD R. FORD</h3>

Remarks on Receiving a Collection of 
Day-of-Prayer Proclamations (excerpt)<BR>
July 21, 1975
<P>

I didn't realize until I talked to you and read some material on 
it, but there have been proclamations issued either by a congress or 
the Congress and by the President since June 12, 1775.  I was 
delighted, of course, to issue the proclamation for July 24, 1975.  
The point that I think significant is the following:  Our forefathers 
for almost 200 years have prayed, regardless of their beliefs or 
their faith, and this has helped them, and they are doing it today as 
they have in the past.
<P>

But equally significant, it has been the prayers of our 
forefathers, as it is the prayers of our fellow countrymen today, 
that have made America strong.  And I am convinced, as we move 
ahead, individual prayer will help not only the person but the 
country, and prayer today means as much to Americans as it did on 
June 12, 1775.

<h3>JIMMY CARTER</h3>

Remarks at the Presidential Prayer Breakfast (excerpt)<BR>
February 2, 1978
<P>

The leaders of our Nation look with a great deal of concern 
over the past experiences when kings and princesses had tied 
themselves to God, to the church, sometimes even in an exalted 
position relative to God, and had cloaked maladministration and 
injustice in the protection of the church.  So, in our Constitution, 
we carefully prescribed that there should be no establishment of 
religion in this country.
<P>

So, we worship freely.  But that does not mean that leaders of 
our Nation and the people of our Nation are not called upon to 
worship, because those who wrote the Declaration of 
Independence and the Bill of Rights and our Constitution did it 
under the aegis of, the guidance of, with a full belief in God.
In our rapidly changing world, we need to cling to things that 
don't change-to truth and justice, to fairness, to brotherhood, to 
love, and to faith.  And through prayer, I believe that we can find 
those things.

<h3>RONALD REAGAN</h3>

Remarks to an Ecumenical Prayer Breakfast (excerpt)<br>
August 23, 1984
<P>

I believe that faith and religion play a critical role in the 
political life of our Nation and always have; and that the 
church-and by that I mean all churches-has had a strong influence 
on the state, and this has worked to our benefit as a Nation.  Those 
who created our country-the Founding Fathers and 
Mothers-understood that there is a Divine order which transcends 
the human order.  They saw the state, in fact, as a form of moral 
order, and felt that the bedrock of moral order is religion.
The Mayflower Compact began with the words, "In the name 
of God, amen."  The Declaration of Independence appeals to 
"Nature's God," and the "Creator," and "the Supreme Judge of the 
world."  Congress was given a chaplain, and the oaths of office are 
oaths before God.
<P>

James Madison in the Federalist Papers admitted that in the 
creation of our Republic he perceived the hand of the Almighty.  
John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, warned that 
we must never forget the God from whom our blessings flowed.
George Washington referred to religion's profound and 
unsurpassed place in the heart of our Nation quite directly in his 
Farewell Address in 1796.  Seven years earlier, France had erected 
a government that was intended to be purely secular.  This new 
government would be grounded on reason rather than the law of 
God.  By 1796, the French Revolution had known the Reign of 
Terror. And Washington voiced reservations about the idea that 
there could be wise policy without a firm moral and religious 
foundation.  He said, "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead 
to political prosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable 
supports.  In vain would that man [call himself a patriot] who 
[would] labour to subvert these . . . firmest props of the duties of 
men and citizens.  The mere Politician . . . [and] the pious man 
ought to respect and to cherish [religion and morality]."  He added, 
". . . let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can 
be maintained without religion."
<P>

I believe that George Washington knew the City of Man cannot 
survive without the City of God; that the Visible City will perish 
without the Invisible City.
<P>

Religion played not only a strong role in our national life, it 
played a positive role.  The abolitionist movement was at heart a 
moral and religious movement.  So was the modern Civil Rights 
struggle.  And throughout this time, the state was tolerant of 
religious belief, expression, and practice.  Society, too, was 
tolerant.
<P>

But in the 1960s, the climate began to change.  We began to 
make great steps toward secularizing our Nation and removing 
religion from its honored place.
<P>

In 1962, the Supreme Court in the New York prayer case 
banned the compulsory saying of prayers.  In 1963, the Court 
banned the reading of the Bible in our public schools.  From that 
point on, the courts pushed the meaning of the ruling ever 
outward, so that now our children are not allowed voluntary 
prayer.  We even had to pass a law-pass a special law in the 
Congress just a few weeks ago-to allow student prayer groups the 
same access to schoolrooms after classes that a Young Marxist 
Society, for example, would already enjoy with no opposition.
The 1962 decision opened the way to a flood of similar suits.  
Once religion had been made vulnerable, a series of assaults were 
made in one court after another, on one issue after another.  Cases 
were started to argue against tax-exempt status for churches.  Suits 
were brought to abolish the words "Under God" from the Pledge 
of Allegiance, and to remove "In God We Trust" from public 
documents and from our currency.
<P>

Today, there are those who are fighting to make sure voluntary 
prayer is not returned to the classrooms.  And the frustrating thing 
for the great majority of Americans who support and understand 
the special importance of religion in the national life-the 
frustrating thing is that those who are attacking religion claim they 
are doing it in the name of tolerance and freedom and open-mindedness.  Question:  Isn't the real truth that they are intolerant 
of religion?  That they refuse to tolerate its importance in our 
lives?
<P>

If all of the children of our country studied, together, all of the 
many religions in our country, wouldn't they learn greater 
tolerance of each other's beliefs?  And is that not to be desired?  If 
children prayed together would they not understand what they 
have in common and would this not indeed bring them closer?  I 
submit to you that those who claim to be fighting for tolerance on 
this issue may not be tolerant at all.
<P>

When John Kennedy was running for President in 1960, he 
said that his church would not dictate his presidency any more than 
he would speak for his church.  Just so-and proper.  But John 
Kennedy was speaking in an America in which the role of 
religion-and by that I mean the role of all churches-was secure.  
Abortion was not a political issue; prayer was not a political issue; 
the right of church schools to operate was not a political issue; and 
it was broadly acknowledged that religious leaders had a right and 
a duty to speak out on issues of the day.  They held a place of 
respect; and a politician who spoke to or of them with a lack of 
respect would not long survive in the political arena.  It was 
acknowledged then that religion held a special place, occupied a 
special territory in the hearts of the citizenry.
<P>

The climate has changed greatly since then.  And since it has, it 
logically follows that religion needs defenders against those who 
care only for the interests of the state.
<P>

There are, these days, many questions on which religious 
leaders are obliged to offer their moral and theological guidance.  
And such guidance is a good and necessary thing.  To know how a 
church and its members feel on a public issue expands the 
parameters of debate.  It does not narrow the debate.  It expands it.
The truth is, politics and morality are inseparable.  And as 
morality's foundation is religion, religion and politics are 
necessarily related.  We need religion as a guide; we need it 
because we are imperfect.  And our Government needs the Church 
because only those humble enough to admit they are sinners can 
bring to democracy the tolerance it requires in order to survive.
A state is nothing more than a reflection of its citizens; the 
more decent the citizens, the more decent the state.  If you practice 
a religion-whether you are Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or guided 
by some other faith-then your private life will be influenced by a 
sense of moral obligation.  So, too, will your public life.  One, you 
see, affects the other.
<P>

The churches of America do not exist by the grace of the state; 
the churches of America are not mere "citizens" of the state.  The 
churches of America exist apart-they have their own vantage point, 
their own authority.  Religion is its own realm; it makes its own 
claims.
<P>

We establish no religion in this country nor will we ever; we 
command no worship, we mandate no belief.  But we poison our 
society when we remove its theological underpinnings; we court 
corruption when we leave it bereft of belief.  All are free to believe 
or not to believe, all are free to practice a faith or not.  But those 
who believe must be free to speak of and act on their belief, to 
apply moral teaching to public questions.
<P>

I submit to you that the tolerant society is open to and 
encouraging of all religions.  And this does not weaken us, it 
makes us strong.
<P>

Without God there is no virtue because there is no prompting 
of the conscience; without God we are mired in the material, that 
flat world that tells us only what the senses perceive; without God 
there is a coarsening of the society; without God democracy will 
not and cannot long endure.  And that, simply, is the heart of my 
message:  If we ever forget that we are One Nation Under God, 
then we will be a Nation gone under.

<h3>GEORGE  BUSH</h3>

Remarks on the National Day of Prayer (excerpt)<BR>
May 4, 1989
<P>

[L]et me focus on what . . . this observance means.  It . . . 
[means] that we believe in separation of church and state, but not 
in the separation of morality . . . and state.  While the government 
must remain neutral towards particular religions, it must not . . . 
remain neutral toward values that Americans support. . . .  Our 
work has gone on now for more than 200 years in the Nation-a 
work best embodied in four simple words:  In God we trust.  And 
it was to that higher being that George Washington looked when in 
1776 he was addressing his troops, and he said, "The fate of 
unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and 
conduct of this army."
<P>

Lincoln believed in divine providence.  Leaving Spring-field . . 
. to assume the Presidency, he told the people of his hometown 
that the God which helped General Washington must now help 
him.  "Without the assistance of the divine being," Lincoln said, "I 
cannot succeed.  With that assistance, I cannot fail."  And [on D-
day], over a nation-wide network, Franklin Roosevelt prayed for 
the safety and success of our invading force.  "Our sons," he said, 
"pride of our nation, lead them straight and true.  Give strength to 
their arms, stoutness to their hearts, stead-fastness to their faith."  
Our history tells us what our hearts confirm:  As Americans, 
we are a religious people.  We prize compassion and self-sacrifice.  
We know that America is great because America is good. . . .  
Several weeks ago . . . I went to a high school in a relatively 
affluent rural area, Lancaster [Pennsylvania], and there we 
discussed a problem which is America's problem-the rising use of 
drugs. . . .  [T]hen, after meeting with this relatively affluent 
group, and hearing that drugs were in their corridors and in their 
playgrounds, I went a few miles over-just the same community to 
meet with the Amish and Mennonite leaders . . . and they don't 
have a drug problem.  And they made very clear to me why:  
family and faith.  Against them, drugs don't have a chance. . . .
I thought of those values last Sunday when I was in New York 
to mark the 200th anniversary of George Washington's first 
Inaugural Address.  For it was then that, like Washington two 
centuries ago, Barbara and I prayed at St. Paul's Chapel, there 
where in 1789 a prayer service was offered by the chaplains of 
Congress for the United States of America. . . .  Washington 
realized that political values without moral values, without that 
moral underpinning, cannot sustain a nation.

Alexis de Tocqueville, 1856
<P>

I have sometimes asked Americans whom I chanced to meet in 
their own country or in Europe whether in their opinion religion 
contributes to the stability of the State and the maintenance of law 
and order.  They always answered, without a moment's hesitation, 
that a civilized community, especially one that enjoys the benefits 
of freedom, cannot exist without religion.  In fact, an American 
sees in religion the surest guarantee of the stability of the State and 
the safety of individuals. . . . Yet there is no country in the world in 
which the boldest political theories of the eighteenth-century 
philosophers are put so effectively into practice as in America.  
Only their anti-religious doctrines have never made any headway 
in that country, and this despite the unlimited freedom of the press.

<h3>Justice William O. Douglas, 1952</h3>

We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a 
Supreme Being.  We guarantee the freedom to worship as one 
chooses.  [We] sponsor an attitude on the part of government that 
shows no partiality to any one group and that lets each flourish 
according to the zeal of its adherents and the appeal of its dogma.  
When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with 
religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to 
sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions.  For it then 
respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the 
public service to their spiritual needs.  To hold that it may not 
would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the 
government show a callous indifference to religious groups.  That 
would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those 
who do believe.

Answers to Questions  Commonly <BR>
Asked  by Modern Liberals <BR>

<h3>1. Is America a Christian nation?</H3>

Constitutionally America is a nation with no official religion.  
Socially and historically, America has been a nation populated largely 
by Christians; a nation, therefore, whose laws reflect a Christian view 
of the world and of the nature of man.
<P>

Any country's laws inevitably reflect the conscience of the people 
or of the dominant element among them, be that element religious or 
secularist.  There is no such thing as a simply neutral society, and 
anyone who tries to tell us that there is trying to con us into agreeing 
with his highly liberal idea of what society ought to be.
<P>

More significantly, all the religions whose adherents were 
numerous enough to be influential in this country were religions of the 
Bible.  However badly people lived up to the teachings of their 
religions, they believed that the world was created by a personal and 
loving God who had given us rules of right conduct to live by in the 
Ten Commandments and the natural moral law.
<P>

Were those people a menace to the republic and to the liberties of 
their fellow citizens?  Or were their beliefs the bedrock on which the 
republic stood, because they furnished it with the moral foundation that 
any society needs if it is not to disintegrate into sheer individualism as 
American society seems to be in danger of doing at the present time?  
We believe the latter-not because we want to impose our religion(s) on 
the country but because we are convinced that society needs a moral 
consensus on certain basic principles of social life.  
<P>

Put another way, the beliefs that impinge most directly and 
importantly on the political and legal order of the country are moral 
rather than purely religious doctrines.  People who disagree about the 
Trinity, the divinity of Jesus Christ or the sacrament of the Eucharist 
can, and often do, agree on such things as the importance of the family 
and the virtues that good citizens ought to practice.
<P>

The lines that divide this country are not the vertical ones that 
separate religious denominations but horizontal ones that cut across the 
denominations.  On one side are liberals of all religious descriptions or 
of no religion at all; on the other are people who maintain the moral 
convictions on which American society has until recently stood.  

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>2. Doesn't allowing prayer in schools violate separation of church 
and state?</h3>

The phrase "separation of church and state" occurs nowhere in the 
Constitution of the United States.  The words of the First Amendment 
are:  "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."  That is the 
separation of church and state.
<P>

If we look at the only record we have of the debates in the First 
Congress, in which James Madison proposed the amendments that 
eventually became the Bill of Rights, we find the following.  When a 
question was raised about the meaning of establishing a religion, the 
record reports:  "Mr. Madison said, he apprehended the meaning of the 
words to be, that Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce 
the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in 
any manner contrary to their conscience."
<P>

If opening a meeting (or a session of a school) with a prayer 
violates that conception of "separation of church and state," then 
Congress has been violating it ever since it adopted the First 
Amendment.  The recitation of a prayer which anyone can join or not 
join as he wishes does not legally enforce the observation of a religion 
or compel anyone to worship God in a manner contrary to his 
conscience.
<P>

The Supreme Court has applied the First Amendment to the states 
only since the 1940s, and found school prayer to be "an establishment 
of religion"-wrongly, we think.  The Amendment does not bar 
everything that someone finds objectionable. 

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>3. Wouldn't allowing public funds to support education in church-
related schools violate separation of church and state?</h3>

To violate the First Amendment of the Constitution, an action by 
the state would have to violate either the guarantee against an 
establishment of religion or the guarantee of the free exercise of 
religion.  It is hard to see how letting people's taxes go to the schools 
which their children, or even other people's children, attend deprives 
anyone of the free exercise of religion.  For the parents of children 
going to church-related schools, it would contribute to free exercise.
<P>

Despite what some civil libertarians seem to think, the Constitution 
gives the state no interest in preventing or hampering the religious 
education of children.  The state's only interest is in seeing to it that 
children get an adequate education in secular subjects.  It is not 
necessary that the state should give it to them in state schools.  Church-
related schools regularly teach the usual range of secular subjects, and 
in so doing they serve the state's purpose.  That they also give 
instruction in their religion(s) frustrates no valid state concern.
Nor does it "establish religion" to subsidize the secular instruction 
that such schools give.  But if necessary to satisfy constitutional 
scruples, the state could issue vouchers-not to the schools, but directly 
to the parents of schoolchildren.  After all, they are the ones primarily 
responsible for their children's education.  The state would then let 
them choose the schools in which the vouchers would be used.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>4. Should creationism be taught in the public schools alongside 
evolution?</h3>

If creationism means the story of the creation of the world as we 
find it in the book of Genesis, it is hard to see how a state school could 
teach it without teaching religion, which is not the function of the state.  
It does not follow, however, that the public school must reject as 
unscientific, and therefore untrue, the proposition that the world was 
created by God.  Science knows nothing, one way or the other, about 
that, and the school should not pretend that science does know.
<P>

There are factual grounds for believing that some evolution of 
species has taken place.  But that all living creatures have evolved from 
an original DNA molecule is an overarching explanatory scheme-not a 
demonstrated fact.  It should not be taught as anything more than a 
theory widely held at present by scientists.  Still less should the school 
teach that a universal evolution of species is explained by a process of 
random variation over long periods of time.  That is an explanation that 
constantly gets more out of less and the higher out of the lower, and 
this by accident.
<P>

It raises philosophical (not merely theological) problems to which 
science has no answer because the answers lie beyond the scope of the 
scientific method.  To assume that the scientific method is the only 
method of knowing truth is mere intellectual arrogance, and the schools 
would do well to steer clear of it.  Intellectual modesty will not resolve 
the conflict between science and creationism, but it might help. 

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>5. Is there one monolithic Christian or Judeo-Christian political 
agenda?</h3>

It is hard to see how there could be, since there is no one political 
program that follows necessarily from the Christian or Jewish faiths.  
What can be said is that religious believers who are called conservative 
and traditionalist, and who consider themselves to be orthodox, tend to 
converge on certain basic moral principles that can be applied to social 
and political issues.
<P>

Thus, they believe that human beings, made in the image of God, 
are endowed with intelligence and free will, and are ultimately 
responsible for their own actions.  They also believe that the human 
person and human life enjoy a basic sanctity which society and the 
state must respect.  They therefore believe that no moral question is 
irrelevant merely because it has become a political issue.  After all, 
Thomas Jefferson, the founder of the Democratic Party, said in 
reference to slavery, "I tremble for my country when I reflect that God 
is just."  
<P>

To insist that a political issue has a moral dimension is not 
"imposing" a religious belief.  It is an effort to persuade fellow citizens 
to take a certain course of political action on grounds of public 
morality and sound public policy.  The fellow citizens are capable of 
judging for themselves if they are not persuaded.  All that religious 
believers can do is to ask them to listen with a degree of serious 
attention.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>6. Isn't the "religious right" really trying to establish a theocracy in 
America?</h3>

No.  We are not proposing a Christian, Judeo-Christian, or any 
other religious orthodoxy for the pluralistic society of this country.  We 
are only saying that political issues at some point along the line raise 
moral questions.  These questions must be answered in the light of 
some conception of human nature, its basic needs, and its common 
social welfare.  That means that citizens of different beliefs must be 
able to discuss, debate, and come to some decision about public 
policies.  If there is nothing we can agree on about human good, then 
we cannot act as a community.
<P>

In that discussion all citizens may take part; none are excluded 
because their moral beliefs are also religious beliefs.  A person may 
recognize that killing, stealing, and bearing false witness violate the 
rights of others and do injury to the community, as well as violate the 
commandments of God.  In fact, the harm they do to human beings and 
to the community is the reason God has forbidden them.  So long as the 
evil to be remedied or the good to be achieved falls within the 
jurisdiction of the state, beliefs about them are appropriate in the public 
forum.
<P>

Others who do not share our religious beliefs may nonetheless agree 
with the moral beliefs and join with us in advocating certain public 
policies.  All we can hope to do, and all we are trying to do, is to win 
the support for the policies as being in the public interest.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>7. Shouldn't the state stay out of the field of morals and leave it to 
the private consciences of the citizens?</h3>

There are, and always have been, areas of moral conduct into which 
the state does not enter.  On the other hand, there is a public morality 
that the state must protect and even enforce because the welfare of 
society depends on it.  It cannot be left to the private conscience of 
every individual.  Hence American law has long recognized a "police 
power" in the several states; i.e., the power to legislate for the public 
health, safety, welfare, and morals.
<P>

Since the state is not a church, it may not legislate to save our souls 
or to achieve our eternal salvation.  The object of state legislation is the 
common good of the community in this world.  This is a good which 
has moral dimensions and does not consist merely in material welfare.
It is a secular goal, however, inasmuch as it is confined to this 
world.  But it is not therefore a secularist goal, to be pursued only on 
the basis of secularist notions about what human beings are and what is 
good for them.  The state is separate from the church, but it is not 
sealed off from the consciences of citizens which churches have 
instructed.
<P>

No citizen need check his conscience at the door when he enters the 
public forum to take part in the debate on the secular common good 
and the means of achieving it.  For example, that a citizen believes that 
the heterosexual, monogamous family was instituted by God is not a 
reason why he may not urge the traditional family as the norm for 
public policy.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>8. Isn't it wrong for the "religious right" to impose its morality, 
such as its belief about abortion, on others?</h3>

All laws impose rules and norms which are seldom agreed to by all 
members of the community.  Laws are often passed for low and 
partisan reasons, as we all know.  But, theoretically and in principle, 
laws are made to serve justice and the general welfare-and it does not 
invalidate them that they impose norms that not everyone agrees to.
The relevant question is whether the subject of the law is properly 
in the public forum and within the jurisdiction of the state.  Not all 
immoral acts should, therefore, be made illegal as well.  There is no 
moral principle that commands us to make every sin a crime.  But if an 
action seriously harms the common good, it may be forbidden or 
restricted by law, unless doing that will do more harm than good to 
society's welfare.
<P>

Merely saying, or getting the U.S. Supreme Court to say, that an 
action is private in nature does not make it so or remove it from public 
concern and regulation.  Were that the case, one could argue that 
polygamy, sodomy, the use of narcotic drugs, and a good many other 
practices are purely private matters.  If abortion is immune from 
regulation, why not these other things as well?
<P>

Now, whether we define abortion as murder or not, in every case it 
puts an end to a human life.  Surely, if the protection of human life is a 
basic purpose of civil society, that is enough to make abortion a matter 
of public concern, debate, and possible regulation, and not merely a 
matter of religious belief.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>9. Why doesn't the "religious right" think that homosexuals should 
be treated like everyone else?</h3>

This question is like asking why we don't treat polygamists like 
everyone else.  One answer would be that we do treat them like 
everyone else and grant them the same right that everyone has: to 
marry one wife.  In regard to homosexuals, another answer would be 
that they are not like everyone else, precisely in their orientation to 
sexual union with persons of their own sex.  Homosexual unions are 
not oriented to procreation and the family, and calling such unions 
families does not change that fact.
<P>

We should not punish homosexuals for being homosexuals, and we 
need not punish them for homosexual acts (though sodomy laws have a 
certain utility in preventing sodomy from becoming a "right").  But 
neither need we, nor should we, recognize homosexuality as a lifestyle 
as good as any other, and as entitled as marriage to the protection and 
encouragement of the law.
<P>

We certainly do not mean that rapists, pedophiles, philanderers, or 
adulterers are better than homosexuals merely because they happen to 
be heterosexual.  They, too, pervert-or at least abuse-their sexual 
powers.  But behind current homosexual demands lies a certain notion 
of democratic equality which asserts that all appetites are equal.  That 
idea busts the family down to the level of an alternative lifestyle.  No 
society that looks to the next generation and its future as a society can 
afford to entertain it.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>10. Isn't the Biblical view of women outdated?</h3>

Anyone who asks that question should be obliged to explain what 
he (or, more probably, she) thinks the Biblical view of women is, and 
why it is "outdated."  The answer will very likely be the feminist notion 
that women prove their worth and achieve self-fulfillment by careers in 
the workplace.
<P>

The Biblical view of women begins with the book of Genesis 
(1:27):  "God created man in his own image, in the image of God 
created he him; male and female created he them."  The species, man, 
exists in two sexes, which are equally human, equally images of God, 
equally worthy of honor and respect for what they are precisely as men 
and women.
<P>

The Bible also implies that man (the species) is essentially social, 
for the two sexes are designed by nature-and therefore by God-to form 
couples, have children, and raise families.  The basic unit of society is 
not the discrete and separate individual who pursues personal goals in 
competition with other individuals, and who consents to law and 
government only in order to keep the competition from degenerating 
into violence.  Human society begins with, and grows out of, the 
family.
<P>

It does not follow that women have no place in the workforce.  
Women have always worked-usually harder than men.  As society 
develops technologically, they do broader and more varied kinds of 
work.  But, given their essential and distinct role in the family, it is a 
mistake for society to regard them as primarily jobholders and career-
seekers for whom marriage is simply a sacrifice of themselves to their 
husbands.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>11. Isn't the "religious right" opposed to the most basic value of 
American life: the liberty of the individual?</h3>

The liberty of the individual, as liberals too often conceive of it 
today, is not the most basic value of American life.  It is a radical 
individualism that rejects all social norms and institutions that the 
individual has not agreed to.
<P>

The basic American ideal, in a phrase that the Supreme Court 
regularly uses, is "ordered liberty."  We certainly don't agree with some 
of the conclusions the Court has drawn from that phrase.  But it is in 
itself a good one and states the liberty that America was built on.  It is a 
liberty that exists within and depends upon an order of law, of social 
institutions, and ultimately of moral principles that are widely enough 
accepted that we can say that they represent society's consensus.
<P>

The best example of a subject on which we are losing our consensus 
is the family.  But we may regain it.  In the April 1993 Atlantic 
Monthly, Barbara Dafoe Whitehead has presented lengthy and detailed 
evidence for the harm done to children and to society by the spreading 
breakdown of the American family.  The evidence shows that the intact 
family with two biological parents offers children greater security and 
better outcomes in life than single-parent or step-parent families.
Society, as well as children, needs stable, intact families.  When 
men and women commit themselves to such families, they exercise an 
ordered liberty that outweighs their desire for choice, freedom, and 
"self-expression."  Ordered liberty of that type deserves the support of 
a social consensus.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>12. Isn't the "religious right" opposed to the other basic value of 
American life:  the equality of all individuals?</h3>

The American idea of equality is that all individuals are by nature 
persons, and as such are endowed with those natural rights that belong 
to persons.  It does not follow that all desires, urges, appetites, and 
drives that persons feel are entitled to equal respect and the equal 
protection of the laws.  Natural rights are based on our common human 
nature, not on our personal idiosyncrasies.
<P>

Nor does equality assume that all ideas and tastes in music, art, 
literature, philosophy, and morals are of equal validity.  That notion of 
equality implicitly denies that there are any standards of judgment by 
which a society would come to conclusions about higher and lower, 
better and worse.  It regards all standards of judgment as purely 
subjective feelings about what individuals like and don't like.
Today this false idea of equality leads people to throw slogans 
around.  Racism, sexism, homophobia, and multiculturism, as now 
commonly used, are not invitations to discussion and rational 
argument.  They are designed to prevent argument and to force us to 
accept ideological views without discussion.
<P>

Proponents of a racial, feminist, homosexual, or multicultural 
agenda certainly have a right to take part in public discussion.  But the 
discussion must eventually come to a conclusion and allow society to 
decide by which standards it will frame public policy and educate its 
children.

Many environmentalists see the new Republican majority as America's repudiation of an environmentally friendly administration. Because the Clinton administration had a green facade, they fear that this change portends environmental doom</P><P>       The Clinton administration has a green posture. Vice President Gore wrote an impassioned green book, &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot; George Framton, formerly president of the Wilderness Society, is assistant secretary of Interior.

Framton reports to Bruce Babbitt, secretary of Interior, a person so revered by environmentalists that they protested the proposed nomination that might have moved him to the Supreme Court.</P><P>     Yet, despite their green rhetoric, the Clinton administration has no substantive environmental accomplishments. Why? They surely had good green intentions. The vice president even recommended that America adopt environmental quality as the &quot;central organizing principal&quot; of culture and policy. But good intentions won't suffice. The administration has failed in its efforts to implement reform.</P><P>     Their pervasive and persistent failure to understand political economy keeps them locked into the centralized planning, &quot;scientific management&quot; model of the century old Progressive Era. This approach has never worked as promised and it generates predictable failures.</P><P>       Many new members of Congress campaigned against activist, interventionist government. Their election provides new and expanded opportunities to those seeking environmental quality and a sustainable economy.

Subsidized clear-cutting of timber in the marginally productive high, dry and cold National Forests of the Rocky Mountains, the killing of wild mammals and birds by the Animal Damage Control agents of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the federal damming of free-flowing rivers to bring subsidized water to crops grown with federal price supports, stored at federal expense and then given away are telling examples of distressingly common phenomena.</P><P>     These environmentally and economically wasteful activities would be highly unpopular if they were well-known. They are not. Most citizens don't understand the bureaucratic arrangements let alone their ecological and economic consequences. The average, generally well-informed citizen knows nothing of these programs. Few citizens can even differentiate the Park Service (in the Department of Interior) from the Forest Service (in the Department of Agriculture). Even fewer understand that the Forest Service sells most of its timber, on average three-fourths of all sales, at a loss totaling about half a billion dollars per year - year after year. This loss persists despite the persistent claim that with their (inherited) inventory of timber, the Forest Service will soon show a profit.</P><P>     Sylvan socialism works like all forms of large-scale socialism: very poorly indeed. As one of my Forest Service friends told me after he retired: &quot;If the Supervisor of a national forest in the Rocky Mountain states regularly auctioned off piles of gold bricks, he would soon lose money on every sale. The bureaucratic process is really that wasteful.&quot;</P><P>       But profit isn't everything and usually not the most important thing. What about environmental quality and economic justice? Again, the federal resource-management agencies fail reasonable tests. The fundamental reasons are straightforward. Bureaucratic decisions, like other decisions, are made on the basis of information and incentives. And political bureaucracies systematically generate bad information and perverse incentives that favor larger appropriations rather than benefits to citizens.</P><P>     When the Progressives of 1900 created these agencies, they simply got it wrong. They expected the federal resource-management agencies to be efficient, environmentally sensitive and to promote equity. One hundred years of experience demonstrates that even competent and well-intentioned bureaucrats are not omniscient and selfless seekers of the public interest. Those who rise to the top and stay there are budget maximizers.</P><P>     No one high in the Clinton administration seems to understand this pathology. It's inherent to bureaucratic politics. Successful advocates of reform must understand this.</P><P>     The new Congress has arrived with refreshingly little baggage. If members are sincere in their protestations against big government and are not sucked into the vortex of established interests, waste will be reduced. The new Congress might build on the previous and useful alliances between the Environmental Defense fund, an economically sophisticated green group, and the National Taxpayers Union, an organization that targets wasteful federal programs. It is not naive to seek change when we understand how the world works.</P><P>     Environmentally concerned citizens can use this change in the orientation of our congressional majority. They can advocate the elimination of environmentally destructive and economically costly programs. If you'd like to promote a harmony between our economy and our ecology, identify a program to be cut and show why cutting it would help. Then write your senators and representative and nominate that program for elimination. And be sure to copy Newt. He deserves help in achieving worthy goals, and to be held accountable for results.</P><P>__________ <BR> John A.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>1/18/95</P><H1><P>Keep politicians from ruining our parks</P></H1> <P>          THE idea of national parks is one of America's best. Approval ratings exceed 90 percent. But political federal management of the parks is a terrible idea. Politics promotes ecological destruction and ethical corruption</P><P>       Two recent books, &quot;Playing God in Yellowstone&quot; and &quot;Rocky Times in Rocky Mountain National Park,&quot; publicize what experts have known for years: our parks' long-term ecological health is seriously threatened.</P><P>     One problem is severe elk overpopulation. Elk in Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks far exceed the number the parks can sustain. There are 40,000-50,000 elk in the Yellowstone area, though it is the 20,000 elk inhabiting the northern range and wintering in the park that are the main problem. The burgeoning elk population is rapidly destroying aspen, cottonwood and willow stands and various grasses. Erosion is increasing and vegetative diversity is falling. Antelope, bighorn sheep, moose, mountain lions, ptarmigans, and beaver are among the victims.</P><P>     Why does the Park Service permit elk to degrade the land and ecology in Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain? The answer is politics. Until 1967 (1961 in Rocky Mountain), the Park Service culled herds with government hunters. With natural predators and hunting by native Americans virtually eliminated, historic range severely reduced, and relocation no longer an option, slaughtering elk was the only responsible action.</P><P>     But the public sees elk as cute and fuzzy charismatic megafauna that shouldn't be shot. Because the Park Service and its congressional overseers are sensitive to voter pressure, the elk population is exploding even as ecology, land quality and species diversity degrade.</P><P>     Absence of fire is the second problem. Both Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain are fire-driven ecosystems. Fire is crucial for rejuvenating stagnant climax forests because it stimulates the growth of diverse succession species such as aspen and various grasses, shrubs and wildflowers. Lack of fire, particularly in Rocky Mountain, is destroying these species and the animals that depend on them. Before white men imposed a fire-control regime, low-level surface fires cleared away accumulated undergrowth while leaving most mature and healthy trees alive.</P><P>     Ecological vitality is fostered by regular, small-scale burns. But once again, political pressure has made such burns difficult to tolerate, let alone create. Residents of nearby towns dislike smoke and haze from fires. Even controlled fire annoys tourists. And fires may escalate out of control.</P><P>     Ultimately, as fuel accumulates, large fires are inevitable. Without the natural firebreaks created by less severe, more frequent burns and with the huge buildup in deadwood and other fuel (up to 100 tons/acre), a dry year may bring another fire such as that which burned 1.2 million acres of Yellowstone in 1988.</P><P>     Perversely, fires actually help the Park Service. The Park Service is rewarded for uncontrolled fires because Congress grants blank checks for fire fighting. Besides, fighting fires is macho and romantic. As a smoke jumper friend said: &quot;Fires are great! It's just like war but no one shoots back!&quot;</P><P>       Dr. Fred Wagner, director of the Ecology Center at Utah State University, notes another reason why destructive elk- and fire-management policies have continued: The people best qualified to criticize have been co-opted by the Park Service. Park Service scientists are well aware of an important ecological principle: Don't bite the hand that feeds you. In a 1989 paper, Wagner notes a recurring theme among researchers working with the parks. They say &quot;Yes, I have some misgivings about what is going on in the parks, but I'm getting research funds from them and I'm not going to rock the boat.&quot; The consequence of this self-censorship is poorly informed policy.</P><P>     To end the ecological damage of political management, we should consider alternative arrangements for park management. Public but nongovernment endowment boards operating under the common law doctrine of &quot;trust&quot; hold great promise. Everyone is familiar with institutions managed by endowment boards: nongovernment schools, nonprofit hospitals and museums are common examples.</P><P>     Each park would have an endowment board. It could be chartered with the legally binding mandate of fostering the values that justified creating that park, e.g. wilderness, waterfowl or wonders. Established environmental groups, local communities and business leaders would nominate people to the board. Each person would be confirmed by Congress, and each park given a modest, one-time-only financial endowment. Free from political interference, the trustees would have responsibility for managing that park in accord with its charter.</P><P>     An endowment board would solicit donations and charge fees just as a museum does. The board would have strong incentives to allow ecologically sensitive commercial activities, as we find on Audubon Society preserves and Nature Conservancy land. In rare cases, some extractive activities would be permitted, but only if they</P><P> complement our national parks' highest values of scenery, preservation and recreation.</P><P>     Freeing the parks from politics is essential to preserving their ecological and cultural legacy. We've had more than 600 years of experience with trusts. By making park managers accountable to a stable board of trustees rather than elected politicians with transient interests, they would be forced to confront the real, long-term consequences of their actions. Freed from the pressures of special interests, humans and nature could seek responsible balance.</P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>2/01/95</P><H1><P>Hunting plays a key role in habitat conservation</P></H1> <P>          MANY environmentalists oppose hunting. They find the idea of killing animals for sport repulsive and incomprehensible. For these people, sport hunting is an obsolete remnant of our barbaric past, one excised by civilized cultures</P><P>       This position is empathically understandable, but logically paradoxical because hunters are important supporters of wildlife habitat protection. Hunters save habitat as individuals and through organizations such as Ducks Unlimited, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the Ruffed Grouse Society, Quail Unlimited, and North America Wild Sheep Foundation. Sportsmen and women know that without habitat there is no game.</P><P>     Members of the environmental community have recurrently tried to stop hunting on national wildlife refuges, and hunting is forbidden in national parks. Tensions between hunting and the animal-rights wing of environmentalism are complex and emotional. They are wrapped up with New Age religion and with &quot;junk&quot; science that falsely claims animal populations naturally regulate themselves without degrading their habitat. (The latter is a fiction propagated for political reasons by &quot;scientists&quot; within the Park Service.)</P><P>       Tensions also stem from demographic changes that insulate urbanites from nature's unpleasant realities. Prosperity has fostered an appreciation for the intrinsic value of life. But few people understand that predators, harsh winters and extensive range are necessary to preserve healthy wildlife populations. Only if &quot;challenged&quot; individual animals die will healthy populations survive. By eliminating major predators and winter range, people have sharply increased the danger of destructive crashes of whole animal populations.</P><P>     It is simply wrong to argue, as some do, that hunting does not promote environmental protection. Though hunting is not a cure-all, it is an important tool for promoting habitat conservation. It also substitutes for the natural population checks eliminated by human activity.</P><P>     A failure to accept the importance of hunting underlies the actions of John Lilburn, a member of the group, Fund for Animals. In 1990, Lilburn interfered with a state-supervised bison hunt near Yellowstone Park by interposing himself between hunters and the bison. Though we may marvel at his affection for bison, such passion threatens the bison's well being. Without natural predators, bison populations grow beyond their food supply and wander out of the park. They carry brucellosis, a disease causing cattle to abort. In terms of sound wildlife and livestock management, removing the bison was necessary.</P><P>     But, certain environmentalists resent people's enjoyment of hunting. They don't understand or accept that love of the hunt has deep cultural and perhaps biological roots. It is intellectually irresponsible to wish the love of hunting away. By accepting that hunting is loved by millions, environmentalists could tap a powerful reservoir of support for conservation.</P><P>     Hunters already pay big money for sport hunting. The Turner Ranch near Bozeman charges $9000 for a four-and-a-half day trophy elk hunt and limits the number of hunters to 30. These fees compensate the ranch for nearly $250,000 worth of grazing provided to wildlife that is not hunted.</P><P>     In Arizona, a hunter paid $303,000 for a Desert Bighorn sheep permit. That money went for wildlife research and habitat protection. Payment for hunting preserves game habitat and thereby saves less charismatic, but ecologically important species.</P><P>     If landowners and local communities cannot profit from wildlife, they may favor environmentally destructive sources of income, such as poor logging practices, or mining. This lesson holds not only for big-ticket species, but for animals with lower hunting values: deer, elk and waterfowl. Fees from hunting far exceed those from primitive recreation, bird watching, or photography.</P><P>     Hunters are a major force behind Ducks Unlimited (DU), a conservation organization with more than 600,000 members and 3,700 chapters across the United States and Canada. DU manages more than four million acres of wetland in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. It has acquired rights to these wetlands through purchases, leases and easements.</P><P>     The Boone and Crockett Club, founded in 1887, is one of the United States' first conservation organizations. Early on, it helped protect Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. The Club's 6,000-acre Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch in Montana is winter range for hundreds of elk and mule deer and harbors grizzly bear, white tailed deer, cougar, eagles, falcons, hawks, and cutthroat trout. It is also home to a research station conducting field work in conservation. Boone and Crockett recently endowed a professorship at the University of Montana through a $1 million gift.</P><P>     A desire to accommodate hunters has changed the forest-management practices of several important timber companies, including Champion, International Paper, and Temple Inland. The companies provide more &quot;edge&quot; along clear-cuts and more diverse ecosystems as they strive to offer habitat for prime game species. These efforts sensitize employees to the importance of wildlife habitat.</P><P>     People love nature in different ways. Not everyone empathizes with today's naive but politically correct preservationist ethic. Most people opposed to hunting are well intentioned. And some people's opposition to hunting is religious. To them, ecological science is irrelevant. But the facts are clear; hunters cannot be dismissed as enemies of animals, and their efforts help preserve healthy ecosystems.</P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

It was printed in Science magazine in 1968 and has been reprinted hundreds of times in dozens of fields ranging from anthropology to zoology. Its essential message is profound yet simple: If a valuable resource is open to all, if it is common property and unmanaged, it will be over-exploited. The standard examples are the open range of eastern Montana in the 1880s and unmanaged ocean fisheries. Because of its implications for social as well as natural systems, it is probably the only article written by a biologist that is known by all English-speaking economists</P><P>       The author is Garrett Hardin, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara. As Garrett used the term, &quot;tragedy&quot; is not mere unhappiness or even extreme sorrow over an outcome. Rather, tragedy resides in the solemn and remorseless working of things. Given the incentive for exploitation and the absence of constraints on use, valuable common property resources are exhausted. Ecological and economic waste are the expected consequences. Tragedy is predictable, not a puzzling aberration.</P><P>     I was honored to work with professor Hardin. Our book, &quot;Managing the Commons,&quot; was in print for nearly 15 years. It was the first environmental-studies book that stressed the importance of property rights in promoting stewardship and environmental quality. Professor Hardin is primarily responsible for its success and for teaching me principles with lasting value.</P><P>     Most importantly, Garrett taught me that we are intellectually and ethically obligated to ask the question &quot;and then what?&quot; when we evaluate environmental policy. Good intentions will not suffice. It is irresponsible to ignore predictable problems.</P><P>     But many Beltway environmentalists have done so. The results, the relentless working of things, are coming due. People are resisting new environmental legislation.</P><P>     This resistance seems paradoxical at first glance because the vast majority of Americans value environmental quality. Pollution control, habitat preservation and other green ends are widely accepted. Resistance follows from the means promoted by major national environmental groups.</P><P>     For 25 years, environmental control has been a growth industry led by crisis entrepreneurs who too often ignored costs imposed. Now we see a movement to calculate those costs. It is natural for people to weigh their costs against the benefits they receive. While Washington should keep people from imposing unwarranted burdens on others, it must not impose arbitrary burdens of its own. Opposition to the latter drives efforts to limit unfunded federal mandates.</P><P>     Crises entrepreneurs create or exaggerate &quot;problems,&quot; such as asbestos and pesticide residue, through misrepresentation and junk science. They use the fear and concern aroused in the public to generate funds and use the funds to lobby Congress. Protecting their budgets, not birds and bunnies, seems to be their primary goal.</P><P>     And what is the long-term environmental impact of crisis entrepreneurs? As real science wins out and &quot;crises&quot; are exposed as not so critical, the attentive public becomes skeptical about the importance of all environmental problems. The public also learns that the remedy offered, more federal control, is always too expensive and usually ineffective.</P><P>     Superfund, the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act are all up for renewal. Policy analysts, resource economists and more-enlightened environmentalists question the operation of these acts. Though the goals are legitimate and praiseworthy, the means are at best inappropriate and, at worst, pernicious.</P><P>     In his book, &quot;Breaking the Vicious Circle,&quot; Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer noted that many federal regulations require individuals and businesses to spend vast sums to obtain excessive cleanliness. For example, companies involved in a New Hampshire waste dump were forced to pay an additional $9.3 million to further clean a site where children playing on the site could already eat a small amount of dirt each day for 70 years without significant harm. But this was not a playground, it was a swamp. The $9.3 million surely had better uses. Sadly, such mandated waste is common.</P><P>     Environmental quality is not free. When Beltway environmentalists act as though it is, they foster waste and ultimately erode environmental concern. Americans are not rejecting environmental goals. Rather, they are challenging cures that often seem worse than the disease.</P><P>     To sustain public support we must harmonize environmental quality with economic security and liberty. To do so we must seriously consider three approaches castigated by professional greens as the &quot;unholy trinity&quot;:</P><P>       1) Require cost-benefit analysis of alternative regulations so we can direct our energies where they do the most good;</P><P>     2) Limit unfunded federal mandates that constrain state and local governments from addressing local problems;</P><P>     3) Require government to compensate property owners when environmental regulations reduce property's value but not when they control significant externalities or costs foisted on others.</P><P>     These principles have been dismissed with derision by the Beltway greens. But this dismissal is dangerous because it threatens support for worthwhile green goals. As people realize the opportunism and duplicity of crisis entrepreneurs, they may discount the importance of environmental concern and replace it with attention to problems of public health, community, and personal security. It is time for environmental leaders to ask professor Hardin's question - &quot;and then what?&quot; - and advocate innovative means to reach accepted environmental ends. </P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

When they reach 41st Avenue Northeast, the sidewalk ends. These people then wheel themselves into Sand Point's rush-hour traffic and travel down the street until the sidewalk resumes a block later</P><P>       Officials should know that disabled people live in the nearby Burke Gilman Place's &quot;affordable&quot; housing, which was built on city land. And officials should know that the sidewalk ends. But, not yet competent with sidewalks, they are on to light rail, a megaproject.</P><P>     Public &quot;megaprojects&quot; fail with amazing consistency. The RAND Corporation, a major research institute, studied 52 such projects costing an average of $2.4 billion each. These projects were plagued by cost overruns and delays and about half performed less successfully than intended. Rand's study, the WPPSS fiasco, and Denver International Airport strongly imply that massive public works are prone to overly optimistic planning and duplicity.</P><P>     The Regional Transit Plan's (RTP) proposed light-rail project exemplifies how wishful thinking leads to ineffective and unnecessarily expensive public projects. Even though we want everyone else to take the train, the RTP won't alleviate congestion. It will lure us from more-effective traffic-management strategies. Traffic congestion is an important challenge and we probably will spend large sums to deal with it. But we will sorely regret devoting resources to a light-rail system</P><P>       Although more than $20 billion was spent to build and expand rail systems in 14 cities during the 1980s, the number of people using rail to get to work fell in all but one. Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., have expensive rail systems but have not appreciably diminished congestion. More broadly, trips on public transit (of which light rail is only a fraction) actually declined from 9 percent of overall trips in 1970 to just 5.3 percent in 1990.</P><P>     Light rail is unpopular because, for most people, it is slower and less-convenient than driving. On average, a trip that includes a ride on light rail is half as fast as a trip by car because getting to the station, waiting for a train, transferring to and from buses, and making station stops take lots of time. Rail lacks flexibility, rarely going where people want to go. Rush-hour travel between the suburbs and downtown, the type of commute rail handles best, is declining in importance. Moreover, people often make side trips to shop, exercise, or take children to school. These trips are far less convenient because tracks are rarely laid where people want to go.</P><P>     According to the Regional Transit Authority's own figures, the $6.7 billion RTP will add a mere 37,000 daily rides to public transit. This is far less than 1 percent of all commutes. And most of these rail riders are people who now use buses. Instead of paying the estimated $360,000 per new transit rider, we could pay 220,000 people $2000 per year for 15 years to bike to work. Biking, like transit, is a healthy, nonpolluting method of travel.</P><P>     Mass transit fails because, under current arrangements, drivers can ignore the congestion they impose on others. Even with traffic delays, automobiles offer quick, comfortable, convenient transportation for most people. Many women view their car as &quot;a personal security device.&quot; The time we waste sitting in traffic is outweighed by these advantages. Public transit fails by comparison.</P><P>     Congestion toll pricing, charging drivers a fee that rises and falls depending on how heavily the road is used, is a more-effective traffic-management strategy. Tolls make better use of existing roadways by spreading traffic more evenly over the day, encouraging carpooling and biking, and making mass transit more attractive. Tolls reduce the need for costly road expansions or rail systems. They also save time and gas while reducing pollution.</P><P>     Start by placing tolls at major congestion points such as the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and the Ship Canal Bridge. Automated Vehicle Identification and Electronic Toll Collection systems, already used in Oklahoma, Norway and Texas, eliminate backups at toll booths. Tolls would be higher during rush hour and low or nonexistent when few cars are on the road.</P><P>     Ideally, our taxes will fall as tolls are used to finance road repairs and improvements. But even if taxes don't fall, new, congestion tolls are preferable to paying twice for the RTP: once, building light rail and buying buses, and again building roads to handle the vast increase in traffic that the RTP will do nothing about.</P><P>     Ordinary citizens rarely analyze complex policy proposals. Work, family and friends trump people's interest in policy analysis. But public officials have a duty to choose wisely. Even if well-intentioned, their myopic fixation on light rail will lead to a project that is expensive and seldom alleviates congestion.</P><P>     Our region is blessed with a highly educated and civic-minded populace, hi-tech businesses, and past public-works successes. But these blessings do not change human nature or repeal economic principles. Even with large subsidies and good intentions, light rail won't work as promised. Until we try congestion tolls it is irresponsible to commit to light rail.</P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

Predictions of a timber famine were common among forestry &quot;experts&quot; of the time, especially from Gifford Pinchot, first chief of the Forest Service</P><P>       Pinchot and others correctly noted that timber harvests were far exceeding reforestation, but incorrectly concluded that this was an inherent flaw of private management. The timber famine did not come to pass for two reasons. First, private-sector entrepreneurs anticipated increased timber scarcity and responded with a wide range of innovations. Second, as prices went up, people began to economize on the use of wood.</P><P>     Entrepreneurship is a continual search to preserve or create value in innovative ways. It is what we can expect when property rights are sufficiently secure to justify the risks always involved when trying something new. Experimenting with more productive and ecologically sensitive timber management is an especially risky venture for the time frame is long.</P><P>     Without relatively secure property rights, people think for the near term. Timber famines and short-term management are likely. But, perversely, the Environmental Protection Agency is penalizing entrepreneurs by harassing innovative timber owners. This has the effect of abridging their rights.</P><P>     EPA harassment has recently focused on Simpson Investment Company, a leader in high-yield forestry. I have known people at Simpson for nearly 20 years and have followed their forestry innovations with interest and admiration. In 1988, Simpson began a risky experiment in growing eucalyptus trees on a &quot;fiber farm&quot; near Corning, Calif. Buying 10,000 acres of land in orchard and pasture, Simpson experimented with eucalyptus trees at the edge of that tree's possible range. The chance of failure was high but the potential rewards seemed to merit the risk. Since eucalyptus grows nearly five times faster than native trees, about 500 cubic feet per acre per year, a given plot of land can yield much more fiber for wood pulp than a comparable section of natural forest.</P><P>     There are many benefits to Simpson's experiment. For example, water is conserved by using 7,000 miles of drip irrigation, an approach developed in the deserts of Israel. By planting on land that had been in agriculture for decades, Simpson preserved natural forests.</P><P>     A third benefit is noted by Resources for the Future (RFF), an organization widely respected as the largest and oldest of the natural resource-environmental think tanks. Roger Sedjo, a University of Washington Ph.D., is director of their Forest Economy and Policy Program. His recent paper, &quot;The Global Environmental Effects of Local Logging Cutbacks,&quot; places the environmental consequences of entrepreneurial efforts such as Simpson's Tehama Tree Farm into its larger context.</P><P>     Sedjo notes that international trade in forest products is well-developed. Logging restrictions in one place produce increased logging elsewhere. This is important because logging's environmental impact varies greatly from place to place. Logging old growth or forests with biodiversity or habitat values has more serious environmental effects than logging plantation forests. Sedjo says, &quot;. . . logging in plantation forests is likely to be the most environmentally benign (alternative), especially when these forests are established on former agricultural lands,&quot; exactly the case with Simpson's eucalyptus farms. By increasing the production of plantation forests, Simpson relieves pressures on the natural forests elsewhere.</P><P>     But the EPA chose to ignore Simpson's solid environmental record and the obvious benefits of its California facility. On Jan. 25 and again on Feb. 3, EPA bureaucrats invaded Simpson's premises. Without explanation, they seized privileged documents and threatened to halt the farm's activities. They claimed possible threats to fairy shrimp, a species listed as endangered last November.</P><P>     Though Simpson officials tried to arrange a meeting to determine the cause of EPA's concerns, their efforts were rebuffed. On Feb. 28, Simpson received an administrative order from EPA that may require the company to cease operations at Tehama. Without a single meeting, EPA snuffed a pioneering effort in innovative forestry.</P><P>     This is a tragic, but unsurprising example of the corruption of purpose associated with government bureaucracies. It demonstrates the pathology identified by Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer as &quot;tunnel vision&quot;; bureaucrats single-mindedly carrying the mission of their organization to the point where it does more harm than good.</P><P>     EPA's treatment of Simpson discourages ambitious environmental experiments. Their behavior makes a mockery of EPA's very reason for existence, environmental protection. When we examine this case from a long-term environmental perspective, we understand why the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; carries such heavy negative baggage.</P><P>     EPA's response to Simpson's experiment gives huge negative incentives to exactly the type of entrepreneurs upon whom our future depends. EPA's actions demonstrate the huge environmental, ethical and economic consequences of giving vast power to government bureaucracies. It would be ironic indeed if the timber famine predicted by the progressives a century ago would finally come to pass due to the arrogance and aggrandizement of their bureaucratic descendants. </P><P>__________<BR>John A.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>3/29/95</P><H1><P>Earth Day reconsidered: liberty, ecology, prosperity</P></H1> <P>          On April 22 we will celebrate the 25th anniversary of Earth Day. This is also the last time I will teach the environmental policy course I began teaching in 1970 at Indiana University.</P><P>       When I began teaching environmental courses, many of my colleagues looked toward two reforms for ecological salvation: an environmental ethic to regulate behavior and a wise and powerful government to manage for the greatest good, for the greatest number, for the long run. While ethics are indeed important and limited government has value, we have learned since Earth Day not to depend on either.</P><P>     Students in environmental courses still bring some burdensome baggage: well-intended but fundamentally naive ideas regarding the potential of altruism and government action. Unless trained in economics, they come mentally wired with an anti-market, anti-property-rights orientation. They often can't separate their hopes from reasonable expectations for political solutions. They believe that government power is easily harnessed for good ends.</P><P>     Fortunately, as students grow wiser they often reject government command-and-control. They follow the examples of leading academics and environmental writers. These people have learned the perverse, unintended consequences of bureaucratic governance, e.g., ecological damage caused by predator- and fire-control programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</P><P>     Skepticism of the notion that government has a nearly boundless power to do ecological good is spreading. For example, John Crutcher, the editor and publisher of Common Ground, a New Age, environmentally sensitive monthly magazine, wrote a March cover story on property rights. In discussing the federal resource agencies, Crutcher notes:</P><P>       &quot;Rather than the public trust being protected, society's preserves have been sacrificed upon the altar of the almighty federal pie - and without even making a profit upon selling out its employer - the taxpayer.&quot;</P><P>       He explains that agencies maximize budgets rather than profits. They compete for market share, scrambling for hunks of the federal budget. Such articles are becoming common in the elite media and even in green magazines, including Northern Lights, High Country News and Sierra. In the popular media as in academia, we're moving up the environmental policy learning curve.</P><P>     One hundred years ago, Progressive era reformers told America that professional management motivated by the public interest and guided by science would work well. Today, economics and history have exposed this dictum as a self-serving myth. Rather than being boundless, the federal government's constructive role is limited to:</P><P>       (1) Providing legal means that enable people to protect themselves from pollution;</P><P>     (2) Supporting basic research;</P><P>     (3) Protecting migratory resources such as waterfowl;</P><P>     (4) Protecting our heritage.</P><P>     When going beyond these assignments, bureaucratic pathologies ultimately prevail.</P><P>     For 25 years, I've explored ways to harmonize liberty, ecology and prosperity. In my judgment, the most important principles are quite clear:</P><P>       First, unless consciously randomized, decisions are made on the basis of information and incentives. This is true whether we are trying to save our souls, soils or seals.</P><P>     But institutions differ dramatically in the quality of information and strength of incentive they generate. And each kind of institution biases the results in some way. Elective politics, for example, rewards the ambitious, rich and duplicitous while placing sincere, honest reformers at a huge disadvantage.</P><P>     The second principle is equally important but carries less analytic power: Character and personal integrity matter a great deal. There are good people who, at least in the short run, can withstand the force of institutions that generate poor information and perverse incentives. For example, I respect and admire individuals who do good work in the bowels of the Forest Service.</P><P>     The above principles tell us that stated mission gives little clue as to actual performance. Here are two examples.</P><P>     The Park Service is to employ science and sound management to protect the integrity of our most valuable natural treasure. Universities are to foster the search for truth. Yet, the Park Service tried to suppress the University Press of Colorado's publication of the book &quot;Rocky Times in Rocky Mountain National Park&quot; by Karl Hess, an ecological scientist who had done years of field work in Rocky Mountain Park. To his credit, Luther Wilson, head of the University Press, stood firm, resisted Park Service pressures, and published the book.</P><P>     In contrast, when Alston Chase published his book, &quot;Playing God In Yellowstone: The Destruction of America's First National Park,&quot; Bill Tietz, then president of a university beholden to Park Service favor, fought to keep that book out of Yellowstones' visitors' centers. This is despite the fact that Chase's book has been adopted and recommended by such universities as Harvard, Stanford, Washington and Yale.</P><P>     There is no substitute for character. But character alone cannot consistently produce good policy. Over time, the incentives generated by institutions usually trump ethics by attracting certain types of people. The Forest Service is a friendly environment for those who think science should be subservient to budgetary imperatives. Forest Service employees whose ethics lead them to think otherwise find that promotions are elusive. The Forest Service is not unique; good character will not prevail without good institutions.</P><P>     Thus, successful environmental reform must focus upon institutional design. An important task of stewardship is to create institutions that harmonize private and public interests. Private property rights, markets and voluntary cooperation can foster these ends. After 25 years of trying, I believe I can now tell how this all works.</P><P>__________<BR>John A.

No amount of concern will be enough to avoid environmental harm if information is of poor quality and incentives are perverse. How can we best channel our interest in environmental quality into constructive action? &quot;Least-cost planning&quot; offers one approach.</P><P>     Least-cost planning has two basic components. First, planners must scrutinize their assumptions and consider the feasibility of alternatives when reality does not unfold as planned - and it seldom does. Second, planners must look fairly at all alternatives and select least-cost options, not favored technologies. Least-cost plans tend to select flexible, adaptable options that can be changed when conditions change.</P><P>     Thirty years ago, E.F. Schumacher noted that small is beautiful and that approaches or technologies that fit in one place may not do so in another. Least-cost planners generally agree. The Northwest's Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) fiasco is the catastrophe that launched least-cost planning into the electric and gas utility markets. Can we apply this lesson to inflexible, capital-intensive transportation options, such as light rail, to avoid future financial catastrophes and a resultant disenchantment with government actions at all levels?</P><P>       In 1968, the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), which markets electricity for the Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of Engineers, and publicly owned utilities, began developing its Hydro-Thermal Power Program. In developing this program, BPA made two crucial mistakes.</P><P>     First, it embraced untenable assumptions about the future demand for electricity. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Northwest's consumption of electricity grew by an annual average of 7 percent. Regional power planners assumed these increases would continue indefinitely. They &quot;knew&quot; that neither technological change nor price increases would slake our thirst for electric power.</P><P>     Second, BPA looked at one option, nuclear power, and made an inflexible plan around that option. BPA envisioned utilities constructing and operating 20 undesigned, untested nuclear power plants between 1975 and 1990. The novel nature of the nuclear plants foreshadowed large unanticipated costs.</P><P>     The program carried a price tag of billions. BPA offered a carrot and a stick to the region's utilities to encourage them to commit to the program. The carrot was a financing mechanism that shifted much of the risk onto BPA's rate payers. It remains with us today.</P><P>     BPA Administrator Donald Hodel, Ronald Reagan's future Secretary of Energy, offered the stick in 1976: a warning that after 1983, BPA could no longer guarantee adequate power to the region. (He later replaced Jim Watt as Secretary of Interior.) Hodel proudly called himself &quot;a prophet of shortage.&quot; Utilities signed up. WPPSS started five of the seven nuclear plants it was to build. Puget Power tried siting two plants on the Skagit River. Utilities in Oregon tried siting two nuclear plants at Pebble Creek.</P><P>     However, BPA's program was static, and the economy, like a complex ecosystem, is dynamic.</P><P>     Economic change was as catastrophic to WPPSS as the end of the ice age was to the woolly mammoths. Rising interest rates in the 1970s and early 1980s dramatically reduced the attractiveness of capital-intensive investments such as nuclear plants. Industrial demand fell as people responded to higher energy prices. We insulated water heaters and attics, lowered thermostats, and installed double-, triple- and quadruple-paned windows. The projected annual 7 percent increases in consumption dropped dramatically; today, most utilities expect 1-2 percent annual growth.</P><P>     By 1983, WPPSS defaulted on bonds valued at $2.25 billion. Like echoes in a canyon, repercussions of that default continue to echo across the Northwest. Poor planning and perverse incentives led public officials to approve projects that squandered millions of dollars every year.</P><P>     In the end, even fierce resistance by nuclear power enthusiasts, WPPSS insiders, and Wall Street financiers could not staunch the financial hemorrhaging, technical mismanagement, and public disgust with WPPSS. WPPSS collapsed. Like the mammoths, it left many skeletons while a few collected ivory. WPPSS also left behind a valuable lesson.</P><P>     Reformers thrust least-cost planning upon BPA's central planners. Least-cost planning found lower-cost means to meet consumer demands and made it much harder to justify investment in favored technologies such as nuclear power or perhaps light rail. &quot;Low-tech&quot; conservation enabled electrical power demand to grow without the addition of untested, costly nuclear plants. Better use is made of existing facilities, a matter of no small environmental consequence.</P><P>     In a dynamic system like the economy, flexible and adaptable resources are required to meet changing demands. Least-cost planning has saved billions for Northwest electricity users and has lessened the impact of regional growth on the environment.</P><P>       It would be ethically and intellectually irresponsible not to apply the lessons from WPPSS to an inflexible, capital-intensive program in the Northwest today: light rail.</P><P> ________ <BR> John A.

It was inspired by our first Earth Day 25 years ago. Shortly thereafter, it became a rallying cry for the green revolution</P><P>      For more than 20 years, the idea was widely supported without question. But does a total ban on whaling make scientific sense? Equally important, do advocates of a ban hold the moral high ground?</P><P>       Life is much simpler when we think in black and white. With this binary model, there are good ideas, such as the promotion of liberty, and bad, such as the abuse of government's coercive power. But environmental truths are not so simple; they are often scientifically complex and highly emotional.</P><P>     Complexity and emotionalism can lead to problems, especially when cultural differences collide. Received &quot;truths,&quot; such as &quot;we must ban the harvest of whales,&quot; become cultural imperialism in green camouflage. The whaling issue illustrates these points and helps us clarify thinking on environmental matters more generally. It shows us the importance of probing the superficial appeal of environmental shibboleths.</P><P>     The notion &quot;save the whales&quot; is about as precise as &quot;save the birds.&quot; There are many species of whales, at widely varying risks of extinction. The largest is the great blue whale weighing up to 150 tons and equal in length to a Boeing 737-200.</P><P>     The deadliest is Orcinus orca, the killer whale, which often hunts in packs like an aquatic wolf. The smartest is the bottle-nosed dolphin, whose brain-to-body-weight ratio more closely approximates humans' than any other mammal. And then there's the minke, a small, plentiful whale found in many of the world's oceans.</P><P>     Before we set out to &quot;save&quot; these diverse creatures we should realize three things:</P><P>       --  Many whales species are far from endangered;</P><P>     --  There is no a priori reason to assume that hunting individual whales will extinguish an entire species; and</P><P>       --  We display an arrogant disregard for traditional cultures when we impose the values of our wealthy, highly modernized society upon them. This last point deserves further attention because Western environmentalists often assume their anti-whaling position is the correct one.</P><P>     In Western cultures, whales had substantial commercial value for several centuries. In the Middle Ages, Norwegians, Britons and Germans hunted whales, chiefly for food. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, whales, especially toothed whales such as the sperm, were hunted primarily for their oil, an important input for lighting and soap-making. (&quot;One candlepower,&quot; a unit of light, is defined as the amount of light given off by a pure spermaceti candle burning at a rate of 120 grams per hour.)</P><P>       The U.S. led the world in whaling during the early to mid-19th century, and many coastal New England towns owed their prosperity to the whaling industry.</P><P>     In a classic &quot;tragedy of the commons,&quot; many species dwindled in numbers and several were threatened with extinction. Since whales were owned only after harpooned and landed, whalers lacked incentives to preserve viable breeding populations. Any whales left could be taken by other whalers. And even if incentives for conservation had existed, scientific information about how to preserve genetically viable populations was sorely lacking. Today, we have better information and know how to create proper incentives.</P><P>     Current blue and humpback whale populations are indeed low, and some species are endangered. The former Soviet Union's recurrent violations of treaties restricting whale harvests took a heavy toll, but members of some other species are plentiful. An example is the minke whale, which has long played a significant role in the Norwegian whaling industry.</P><P>     There may be up to one million minkes. In 1994, 32 Norwegian boats killed a total of 279 minkes out of an estimated regional population of 87,000 whales. This rate of about one-third of 1 percent is biologically trivial and has no significant ecological impact. However, to the centuries-old maritime societies that evolved around whaling, minkes are culturally, economically and nutritionally significant. Minkes support these villages much as buffalo supported the late 19th century Great Plains Indians.</P><P>     Proscribing a total ban on whaling denies cultures time to adjust and ignores the relative abundance of many species. Whatever its environmental and emotional appeal, an absolute ban is cultural imperialism. Can members of &quot;Save the whales!&quot; organizations justify imposing their environmental morality on other cultures? When advocates for a ban ignore scientific evidence that the minke are no more threatened than mallard ducks, their arguments carry a tinge of ethical and intellectual arrogance.</P><P>     In the end, a total ban on all whaling oversimplifies a complex issue. First, not all whales are threatened. Second, we have the technology to create transferable property rights in whales. With such guaranteed rights, whales will not be hunted to extinction. Third, whales are central to traditions of coastal villages in Japan, Norway, and Iceland. Reasonable harvest poses little threat to the continued existence of these animals. In contrast, insensitive, imperialistic Western environmentalism surely threatens these villages when it imposes its tastes on traditional cultures.</P><P>     The lessons here are clear. It would be a mark of maturity for the environmental movement if it applied these lessons to the celebration of Earth Day's 25th anniversary.</P><P> _______<BR> John A.

Her work launched America's modern environmental movement and set the stage for the Earth Day celebration of 1970</P><P>       On April 10, 1995, just a few days short of the 25th anniversary of Earth Day, Greg Easterbrook published an article in the same New Yorker. Distilled from his recent book, &quot;A Moment upon the Earth,&quot; the article focuses on &quot;eco-realism.&quot; Easterbrook convincingly argues that we have greatly improved our environment since Earth Day, though few are ready to admit it.</P><P>     Many fiscal conservatives, free-market aficionados and libertarians are unwilling to recognize our successes. They resist evidence that government programs are sometimes effective (though rarely efficient). Many modern liberals are reluctant to admit even partial victory. Some fear a relaxation of effort while others seek to profit by perpetuating the perception of crisis. Nevertheless, the gains are real.</P><P>     Lake Washington, Puget Sound, Lake Erie, and many other bodies of water have made ecological comebacks. Airborne lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and automobile hydrocarbon emissions have declined from 24 percent to 96 percent, significantly improving air quality in America's cities. Some wildlife populations have rebounded. For example, the wild turkey, an important indicator species, was nearly extinct but is now more widely distributed than in colonial times.</P><P>     Other environmental improvements have occurred without federal encouragement. The Atlantic Monthly's April feature story discussed the impressive and ongoing reforestation of the eastern United States. The much-maligned profit motive has spurred private enterprise to reduce consumption of natural resources and lower the generation of solid and toxic waste. And in the 1980s, private land trusts exploded as an important, local method for preserving millions of acres of land.</P><P>     In spite of its successes, the post-Earth Day legacy of environmental protection has serious flaws. It emphasized rigid federal laws and regulations that are often monstrously inefficient and massively inequitable. The inefficiency, by wasting resources, means environmental protection is more likely to conflict with other important goals, especially when government budgets are tightening. Inequity, by imposing costs on a small number of people, encourages heated resistance to programs that are supposed to pursue worthwhile goals. For example, opposition to the Endangered Species Act continues to grow because the costs of species protection are concentrated on relatively few land owners.</P><P>     Until recently, inefficiency and inequity were of little concern to single-minded seekers of environmental quality.</P><P>     This is partly because we could achieve large gains in environmental quality for relatively little time, money, and inconvenience. But, as America grows cleaner, easy gains become more elusive. In economists' parlance, we encounter the problem of diminishing marginal returns. The next 5 percent of a specific environmental gain may cost more than the first 90 percent, the next 2 percent more than the previous 95 percent. Opportunity costs grow as we seek ever deepening shades of green.</P><P>     In addition, environmental regulations often hide regulatory costs by placing them on businesses, and letting the businesses pass them on to consumers in the form of higher prices. With the public largely unaware of the monetary and social costs of environmental regulations, lawmakers and bureaucrats have little reason to worry about efficiency or equity.</P><P>     Public indifference is complemented by political self-seeking and opportunism. Bureaucrats at EPA, OSHA and FDA, whose jobs depend on regulating even trivial or nonexistent risks, have powerful incentives to cast an ever wider net of ever tighter regulations, just to keep their people working and their budgets growing.</P><P>     Legislators impede our movement toward environmental quality by carving out protections for powerful constituencies. For example, the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments required smokestack scrubbers be installed at many coal-burning power plants rather than promoting low-sulfur coal. Scrubbers were chosen even though they did little for air quality because the use of low sulfur coal would have harmed eastern coal miners and the political careers of their congressmen.</P><P>     Finally, many private environmentalists must share the blame for our misguided approach to environmental protection. They seek regulations that promote their narrow interests, frequently by foisting costs on less-organized or less-politically powerful groups. Public monies and state coercion are used to promote private or organizational interests at the expense of the public good.</P><P>     Greenpeace, for example, has made efforts to restrict the industrial use of chlorine compounds, a class of substances very useful in a broad array of manufactures (which in turn contribute to America's health and welfare). Other organizations have supported legislation, such as log-export bans, that dramatically reduce property values and alienate the people who can best promote conservation.</P><P>     As additional increments of environmental quality become more expensive and the costs of these increments become more visible, public resistance will stiffen. For example, the rise of the Wise Use movement partially reflects legitimate concerns with the concentration of environmental costs on rural landowners.</P><P>     Much progress has been made since Earth Day 1970. But the easy solutions are behind us. To continue to improve our environment we must consider how we can minimize the burdens we impose on ordinary citizens as we pursue necessary environmental goals. This is the challenge for our next 25 years.</P><P>_______<BR> John A.
