<P>San Francisco - On Monday, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel struck down Cold War
export restrictions on the privacy technology called cryptography.  Her
decision knocks out a major part of the Clinton Administration's
effort to force companies to build "wiretap-ready" computers,
set-top boxes, telephones, and consumer electronics.

<P>The decision is a victory for free speech, academic freedom, and the
prevention of crime.  American scientists and engineers will now be
free to collaborate with their peers in the United States and in other
countries.  This will enable them to build a new generation of tools
for protecting the privacy and security of communications.

<P>The Clinton Administration has been using the export restrictions to goad
companies into building wiretap-ready "key recovery" technology.  In a
November Executive Order, President Clinton offered limited
administrative exemptions from these restrictions to companies which
agree to undermine the privacy of their customers.  Federal District
Judge Patel's ruling knocks both the carrot and the stick out of
Clinton's hand, because the restrictions were unconstitutional in the
first place.

<P>The Cold War law and regulations at issue in the case prevented
American researchers and companies from exporting cryptographic
software and hardware.  Export is normally thought of as the physical
carrying of an object across a national border.  However, the
regulations define "export" to include simple publication in the U.S.,
as well as discussions with foreigners inside the U.S.  They also define
"software" to include printed English-language descriptions and
diagrams, as well as the traditional machine-readable object code and
human-readable source code.

<P>The secretive National Security Agency has built up an arcane web of
complex and confusing laws, regulations, standards, and secret
interpretations for years.  These are used to force, persuade, or
confuse individuals, companies, and government departments into making
it easy for NSA to wiretap and decode all kinds of communications.
Their tendrils reach deep into the White House, into numerous Federal
agencies, and into the Congressional Intelligence Committees.  In
recent years this web is unraveling in the face of increasing
visibility, vocal public disagreement with the spy agency's goals,
commercial and political pressure, and judicial scrutiny.

<P>Civil libertarians have long argued that encryption should be widely
deployed on the Internet and throughout society to protect privacy,
prove the authenticity of transactions, and improve computer security.
Industry has argued that the restrictions hobble them in building
secure products, both for U.S. and worldwide use, risking America's
current dominant position in computer technology.  Government
officials in the FBI and NSA argue that the technology is too
dangerous to permit citizens to use it, because it provides privacy to
criminals as well as ordinary citizens.

<P>"We're pleased that Judge Patel understands that our national security
requires protecting our basic rights of free speech and privacy," said
John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which
backed the suit.  "There's no sense in `burning the Constitution in
order to save it'.  The secretive bureaucrats who have restricted these
rights for decades in the name of national security must come to a
larger understanding of how to support and preserve our democracy."

<P><B>Reactions to the decision</B>

<P>"This is a positive sign in the crypto wars -- the first rational
statement concerning crypto policy to come out of any part of the
government," said Jim Bidzos, President of RSA Data Security, one of
the companies most affected by crypto policy.

<P>"It's nice to see that the executive branch does not get to decide
whether we have the right of free speech," said Philip Zimmermann,
Chairman of PGP, Inc.  "It shows that my own common sense
interpretation of the constitution was correct five years ago when I
thought it was safe to publish my own software, PGP.  If only US
Customs had seen it that way."  Mr. Zimmermann is a civil libertarian
who was investigated by the government under these laws when he wrote
and gave away a program for protecting the privacy of e-mail.  His
"Pretty Good Privacy" program is used by human rights activists
worldwide to protect their workers and informants from torture and
murder by their own countries' secret police.

<P>"Judge Patel's decision furthers our efforts to enable secure electronic
commerce," said Asim Abdullah, executive director of CommerceNet.

<P>Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington-based Internet advocacy group, hailed the
victory.  "The Bernstein ruling illustrates that the Administration
continues to embrace an encryption policy that is not only unwise, but
also unconstitutional.  We congratulate Dan Bernstein, the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, and all of the supporters who made this victory
for free speech and privacy on the Internet possible."

<P>"The ability to publish is required in any vibrant academic discipline,"
This ruling re-affirming our obvious academic right will help American
researchers publish without worrying," said Bruce Schneier, author of
the popular textbook _Applied Cryptography_, and a director of the
International Association for Cryptologic Research, a professional
organization of cryptographers.

<P>Kevin McCurley, President of the International Association for
Cryptologic Research, said, "Basic research to further the
understanding of fundamental notions in information should be welcomed
by our society.  The expression of such work is closely related to one
of the fundamental values of our society, namely freedom of speech."

<P><B>Effect of the decision</B>

<P>Judge Patel's decision today only legally applies to Prof. Bernstein.
Other people and companies are still technically required to follow
the export restrictions when speaking or publishing about
cryptography, or when speaking or publishing cryptographic source
code.  However, the decision sends a strong signal that if the
government tried to enforce these rules against other people, the
courts are likely to strike them down again.

<P>Judge Patel has specifically not decided whether the export controls
on object code (the executable form of computer programs which source
code is automatically translated into) are constitutional.  Existing
export controls will continue to apply to runnable software products,
such as Netscape's broswer, until another court case challenges that
part of the restrictions.

<P><B>Background on the case</B>

<P>The plaintiff in the case, Daniel J. Bernstein, Research Assistant
Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, developed an
"encryption algorithm" (a recipe or set of instructions) that he
wanted to publish in printed journals as well as on the Internet.
Bernstein sued the government, claiming that the government's
requirements that he register as an arms dealer and seek government
permission before publication was a violation of his First Amendment
right of free speech.  This is required by the Arms Export Control Act
and its implementing regulations, the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations.

<P>In the first phase of this litigation, the government argued that
since Bernstein's ideas were expressed, in part, in computer language
(source code), they were not protected by the First Amendment.  On
April 15, 1996, Judge Patel rejected that argument and held for the
first time that computer source code is protected speech for purposes
of the First Amendment.

<P><B>Details of Monday's Decision</B>

<P>Judge Patel ruled that the Arms Export Control Act is an
unconstitutional prior restraint on speech, because it requires
Bernstein to submit his ideas about cryptography to the government for
review, to register as an arms dealer, and to apply for and obtain from
the government a license to publish his ideas.  Using the Pentagon
Papers case as precedent, she ruled that the government's "interest of
national security alone does not justify a prior restraint." Under the
Constitution, he is now free to publish his ideas without asking the
government's permission first.

<P>Judge Patel also held that the government's required licensing
procedure fails to provide adequate procedural safeguards.  When the
Government acts legally to suppress protected speech, it must reduce
the chance of illegal censorship by the bureacrats involved.  Her
decision states, "Because the ITAR licensing scheme fails to provide
for a time limit on the licensing decision, for prompt judicial review
and for a duty on the part of the ODTC to go to court and defend a
denial of a license, the ITAR licensing scheme as applied to Category
XIII(b) acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the
First Amendment."

<P>She also ruled that the export controls restrict speech based on the
content of the speech, not for any other reason.  "Category XIII(b) is
directed very specifically at applied scientific research and speech on
the topic of encryption."  The Government had argued that it restricts
the speech because of its function, not its content.

<P>The judge also found that the ITAR is vague, because it does not
adequately define how information that is available to the public
"through fundamental research in science and engineering" is exempt
from the export restrictions.  "This subsection ...  does not give
people ... a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited." The
failure to precisely define what objects and actions are being
regulated creates confusion and a chilling effect.  Bernstein has been
unable to publish his encryption algorithm for over three years.  Many
other cryptographers and ordinary programmers have also been restrained
from publishing because of the vagueness of the ITAR.  Brian
Behlendorf, a maintainer of the popular public domain "Apache" web
server program, stated, "No cryptographic source code was ever
distributed by the Apache project.  Despite this, the Apache server
code was deemed by the NSA to violate the ITAR."  Judge Patel also
adopted a narrower definition of the term "defense service" in order to
save it from unconstitutional vagueness.

<P>The immediate effect of this decision is that Bernstein now is free to
teach his January 13th cryptography class in his usual way.  He can
post his class materials on the Internet, and discuss the upcoming
class's materials with other professors, without being held in
violation of the ITAR.  "I'm very pleased," Bernstein said.  "Now I
won't have to tell my students to burn their notebooks."


<P><B>ABOUT THE ATTORNEYS</B>

<P>Lead counsel on the case is Cindy Cohn of the San Mateo law firm of
McGlashan & Sarrail, who is offering her services pro bono.  Major
additional pro bono legal assistance is being provided by Lee Tien of
Berkeley; M. Edward Ross of the San Francisco law firm of Steefel,
Levitt & Weiss; James Wheaton and Elizabeth Pritzker of the First
Amendment Project in Oakland; and Robert Corn-Revere of the
Washington, DC, law firm of Hogan & Hartson.


<P><B>ABOUT THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION</B>

<P>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a nonprofit civil
liberties organization working in the public interest to protect
privacy, free expression, and access to online resources and
information.  EFF is a primary sponsor of the Bernstein case.  EFF
helped to find Bernstein pro bono counsel, is a member of the
Bernstein legal team, and helped collect members of the academic
community and computer industry to support this case.

<P>Full text of the lawsuit and other paperwork filed in the case is

<P> By Terence Gallagher

<P>     BONN, Germany (Reuter) - German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet aapproved  an Internet regulatory bill Wednesday that seeks to protect users' privacy  and keep out smut and Nazi propaganda.

<P>    With its ``multimedia law,'' Germany is forging ahead with a project that
the United States and other governments have largely given up as impossible
controlling the content of the Internet without compromising civil
liberties.

<P>     Cyberspace ``is not a law-free zone,'' Education and Research Minister
Juergen Ruettgers told a news conference. ``No one should think that special
technologies put them beyond the reach of the law.''

<P>   The new law covers businesses such as telebanking and database services
as well as online services. It says that acts already prohibited in Germany
and conducting fraudulent business -- will also be illegal in electronic form.

<P>     CompuServe, the world's second largest online information service, said
recently it would consider moving its German operations to a neighboring
country if the law becomes too restrictive.

<P>   The draft law reflects German sensitivities to the confidentiality of
personal data, requiring service providers to store as little data as
possible. It also reflects the struggle between federal and state authorities
over which has the right to regulate the Internet.

<P>    The German law puts responsibility for suspect content on ``suppliers,''
but this is not clearly defined.   Online services such as Compuserve and America Online could be held responsible for legally questionable material after being warned that such material can be accessed through their systems, provided they have the technical means to block it.

<P>    The German law would pioneer the use of ``digital signatures'' -- strings
of data encrypted to establish the origin of transmitted messages. The
signatures could prevent fraudulent commercial transactions on the computer
network by matching a publicly accessible data string with a confidential
number, or key, registered with a central authority.

<P>    Such signatures could play a major role in preventing computer crime,
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said. The law would bar programs that track users' paths through the nternet, recording what sites they have visited, and would require the opportunity for anonymous use of he system.

<P>   It also calls for the electronic ``tagging'' of material unsuitable for
minors, so it could be filtered out with something similar to the V-chip now
under development in the U.S. television industry.

<P>    After consultations with state governments next week, the government
hopes the law will take effect in August 1997, ahead of the planned
deregulation of European telecommunications markets in January 1998.

<P>"This destiny does not tire, nor can it be broken, and its mantle of
strength descends upon those in its service." - Francis Parker Yockey,
                                      IMPERIUM</P>

     </b></p>

<P>     The subject of privacy has emerged, of late, as one of the hot buttons of public
debate on the information highway.  Stories about electronic medical record
networks, interception of racy voice mail messages and hackers on the INTERNET
are focussing people's attention on their privacy.  But the electronic highway is
only one illustration of the uneasy relationship between privacy and technology. 
Dealing with that potential conflict demands that we first address the technological
context in which we find ourselves.

<P>     So I'd like to give you first a glimpse of some studies on the impact of
technology on society at large.  I'll also refer to some specific studies and surveys
on technology and individual privacy and the problems these identified.  And finally,
I'd like to mention some observations from our office's perspective and our concern
that a specific privacy framework may be necessary to begin building some
defences against information warfare. 

<P>     I had the privilege recently of hearing Frank Ogden, that wonderfully engaging
futurist from Vancouver.  What Mr. Ogden had to say, however, did not comfort
me because in his opinion there is no longer any privacy in our present
technological age and there would certainly be none in the future.  Our lives, he
claimed, are open books to anyone with the wits, desire, and technology to read
them.  

<P>     For example, he mentioned, several years ago, he had obtained, through
technological means, the KGB desk books on all US foreign intelligence activities --
but not to worry, he said, because, six months prior to that, he had already
obtained the US President's briefing books on those same issues.  

<P>     So anecdote aside, according to Ogden, there are no secrets in the age of
technology and there are no borders.  Conventional political frontiers are obsolete
and laws can provide little protection, indeed, present no obstacle, moral or
otherwise, to those who will use technology to enter any database or
communications systems for pleasure or gain.   

<P>     Now as much as I admire Mr. Ogden, and it's hard not to be a great fan of his,
it seems to me that the rapture of technology has so mesmerized him that perhaps
he has neglected other equally meaningful and significant interests.  By striving to
be one with the technology, he has perhaps swung the balance to an extreme and,
while his point of view may be valid, the other extreme or at least other
considerations demand our attention.


<P>     I mention Mr. Ogden simply to emphasize the nature of two competing and
strikingly divergent views on the question of technology.  One view claims that
technology should be driving the changes that are taking place in information
management and communications processes and that we should simply hang on
for the ride.  The other suggests that technology simply offers us choices and that
human values should direct the changes that technology offers us.

<P>     In discussing these divergent views and the impact of technology on our lives, I
should mention the work of Neil Postman whose l992 book entitled Technopoly will
likely become one of the landmark studies in the field.

<P>     His thesis, simply stated, is that we are in danger of becoming what he calls a
"Technopoly", a system in which technology of every kind is cheerfully granted
sovereignty over all aspects of our lives.  He argues that while technologies are
indispensable to our lives, we must understand and control them and place them in
the context of our larger human goals, our social values, and our national
intentions.  

<P>     As well, he says, when we admit a new technology (something like the
INTERNET) into our culture, we must do so with our eyes open.  Often the
discoverer of an art or innovation is not the best judge of the good or harm that will
accrue to those who use it.

<P>     Postman also points out that technological change is not additive or subtractive
-- it is ecological.  By that he means that one significant change generates total
environmental change.  To cite an example from nature, if we remove all of a
species from an environment, we are not left with the same environment minus
that species; we have a new environment because we have reconstituted the
conditions of existence.

<P>     In the same way, a new technology does not simply add or subtract -- it
changes everything.  For example, fifty years after the invention of the printing
press, we did not have the same old Europe plus the printing press.  We had an
entirely different Europe.  Likewise after television, we did not have the same old
society plus television, we had an entirely different society.

<P>     So it is not enough, in Postman's view, simply to consider whether
communications will be more effective on electronic highways, or whether
information exchanges will be better supported on fully connected systems.  That
only brings an immediate, practical answer, and one which may deter us from
asking ourselves what other serious human and social impacts may result from the
new technology.  In building this highway, this network of networks, what changes
may we be causing to our social environment, to our human ecology?

<P>     Obviously, it is a mistake to assume that every technological change or
innovation has a one-sided effect, either good or bad.  Every technology is probably
both a blessing and a curse.  My point in raising the thoughts of Postman is simply
that we are all of us caught up in being zealots for technology wondering what
technology can do, but not reflecting on what it can undo.  

<P>     We must recognize and consider what has been poetically termed as the
"intimations of deprival".  That is, those hints and indications of what's being lost,
or what voices and values are being silenced, and then question the underlying
assumptions in the trade-offs.

<P>     Now what does all of this have to do with privacy?  Well, for many years
scholars have been considering the impact of technology on privacy.  Privacy, as
we define it, is simply the right of the individual to control the flow of information
about oneself, the right to fair, reasonable and confidential information practices. 
This claim of informational privacy assumes that all information about an individual
is fundamentally his or her property to communicate or withhold as desired -- it is
the democratic notion of self-determination or autonomy which, in the case of
information, dictates that no one should have more control over a person's
information than the person.

<P>     But the more that can be known about a person, the less that person's
autonomy.  And these days, in an information society, our individual autonomy and
our sense of control are on the line.  That is the heart of the privacy problem and
that is why privacy has become such an emotionally-charged issue.

<P>     The federal government has attempted to deal with this issue by enacting the
Privacy Act, a somewhat misleading name.  Privacy Commissioner Bruce Phillips
once joked that it might be more accurate to call it "an act respecting the
protection of personal information in the hands of Ottawa bureaucrats".  The office
and the position of Privacy Commissioner were created in 1983 basically to serve
an ombuds role to investigate complaints under the Privacy Act.  

<P>     The act is essentially data protection legislation, designed to control the
collection, retention, use, disclosure and protection of personal information.  It is
similar to most of those in effect in major Western countries.

<P>     At its heart, the federal Privacy Act is an "information handlers code of ethics".

<P>It is a code of fair information principles which recognizes the inherent right of
ownership of the information by the people from whom it was taken.  It requires
government to collect data directly from those people wherever possible.  It obliges
government to tell people why the information is needed and how it will be used. 
It imposes obligations on government to protect that data from unauthorized or
unrelated uses and disclosures.  It gives individuals the right to examine their
information.  And finally, it puts in place an independent ombudsman (our office) to
resolve problems and oversee compliance.

<P>     The law and thus our office's authority extend only to Canadian federal
government institutions (150 or so).  We have no jurisdiction (other than the purely
moral) over the provincial, municipal or private sectors.

<P>     As it stands, however, the label has encouraged Canadians to think of the
federal Privacy Commissioner as the guardian of every aspect of their privacy
rights.  They complain to us if they are denied information which they have
requested, or if they feel that a government department is collecting, keeping, or
misusing their information in a way that contravenes the act.  Since 1983, we
have investigated approximately 10,000 such complaints.

<P>     As well, people call and write us about anything that touches on their personal
privacy.  This can include junk mail, social insurance numbers, credit card
applications, video surveillance, and cross border shopping.  Recently, these calls
and letters run to more than 8000 a year. Since 1983, we have handled over
30,000 such inquiries.

<P>     We also audit government compliance to the act by examining  government
departments and how they manage their personal information holdings.  Finally, we
try to sensitize the public to privacy issues.   For example, in the past four years,
we have issued major studies dealing with the privacy implications of Drug Testing,
AIDS, and Genetic Testing.  We have also responded to Industry Canada's paper
on Privacy on the Canadian Information Highway.

<P>     At present, the majority of Canadian governments have privacy laws which
control government collection, use and disclosure of personal data and which give
individuals the right to see their own personal information.

<P>     However, the studies so far have concluded that dramatic advances in
telecommunications and information technology change the relationship between
individuals and government.  New technologies are able to deal with personal
information faster, new electronic highways will deliver that personal information
and link it more extensively, and cheaper than ever before.  

     
 <P>    The result is a growing vulnerability of information and the consequent loss of
privacy -- losses that some argue are the inevitable trade-offs against this greater
speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.  Privacy is often at the top of the list of
rights to be traded off for other perceived benefits, usually because it's not
recognized as an issue until it's lost.  But once lost, there is no remedy -- you can't
get it back, it's gone.  

<P>     So we are tempted with technology's benefits but we often overlook its
vulnerabilities.  And that leads me, finally, to the topic of this panel, attacks on
personal information.  

<P>     Perhaps I should begin by asking whether anyone care that personal information
may be under attack.  Well, Canadians do care.  A comprehensive 1993 Canadian
survey of public attitudes towards privacy (financed by a consortium of private and
public sector organizations) revealed a "pervasive sense that personal privacy is
under seige" -- 52 per cent were "extremely concerned", and about 90 percent
were at least moderately concerned over their personal privacy.  

<P>     In other words, as a contemporary issue, it is right up there with such issues as
unemployment and the environment, and actually ahead of national unity.

<P>     The survey also revealed that, beyond generalities, the public doesn't know a
lot about this issue but that where it does understand a specific matter, it has no
trouble rendering a verdict.  I give you cellular telephones as an example.  Most
people know that such devices can be monitored.  Seventy-seven percent of people
surveyed were in favour of measures to protect the privacy of such
communications; eighty-three percent did not believe that anyone should record
any private cellular phone conversations for any reason.

<P>     But what the survey revealed most dramatically was the existence in the public
of a deep sense of unease:  an awareness that advanced technologies (and those
that use them) are impinging on their lives in ways they don't yet understand; and
a desire to know more and to have much more control and personal involvement in
the decision-making process.

<P>     A later survey, conducted by Gallop for Anderson Consulting, found that almost
84 per cent of Canadians were worried about their privacy on the information
highway.  Anderson was surprised at the high level of concern, one it described as
high enough to stop highway construction in its tracks.



<P>     What seems to be clear in all of this is that the major problems that will arise
will not be related to the technology itself but with how well we are able to
consider the implications of the technology on those human values such as privacy.

<P>It will also determine whether the public will be willing participants -- or will mount
the barricades.

<P>     And this brings me finally to the topic of Information Warfare and the argument
so powerfully presented by Winn Schwartau in his provocative book.  Mr.
Schwartau argues that in the new world order, there will be no such thing as
electronic privacy, that everything we do will be recorded somewhere in a digital
repository, and that those records which define us as individuals will be
unprotected, subject to malicious modification, unauthorized disclosure and
out-and-out destruction.  

<P>     In short, we are at war.  Cyberspace is the battlefield and we are under a
virtual attack (Class 1 Information Warfare) in which we will be subjected to
something akin to terrorism against our digital privacy, the electronic essence of
our lives.  

<P>     Schwartau argues that the first Information Warriors in Cyberspace are hackers.

<P>In this new world order, hackers rule.  They know far more about computers and
how to manipulate them than the public ever will.  And their goal is to rule the
global electronic data superhighways of the future.    

<P>     Well, if this is a war, we should take the advice given over 25 centuries ago by
Asian war master Sun Tzu who said "Know the enemy - if ignorant of the enemy,
you are certain to be in peril".  

<P>     So who are these hackers?  Robin Hoods, as portrayed by the tabloid press? 
Most experts characterize them as socially inadequate young males.  Caroline
Osborn, a British Crown Prosecutor, who has long pursued and prosecuted
computer criminals and hackers, has come to regard them as "stupid little nerds
who have not yet discovered girls and beer".

<P>     Winn Schwartau seems to agree with the fact that present day hackers
 are: </P>

     -    mostly misfit males between twelve and twenty-eight<BR>
     -    smart but did lousy in school<BR>
     -    come from dysfunctional families<BR>
     
<P>     In short, guys who are basically misunderstood and can't get a date.

<P>     Our moderator, Dr. Kabay, has expanded that definition to further suggest that,
among other things, hackers are characterized by:</P>

     -    a grandiose sense of self-importance<BR>
     -    a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success<BR>
     -    a need for constant attention and admiration<BR>
     -    strong negative responses to threats to self-esteem
          feelings of entitlement<BR>
     -    interpersonal exploitiveness<BR>
     -    alternate feelings of overidealization and devaluation<BR>
     -    a lack of empathy.<BR>
     
<P>     Bruce Sterling, in his 1992 book, "The Hacker Crackdown" estimated the
hacker population at about 5000 people.  Of these, he guessed that as few as a
hundred are truly "elite" - active computer intruders, skilled enough to penetrate
sophisticated systems and  to be truly worrisome to corporate security and law
enforcement.  He also disputes the theory that hackers exist in vast swarms and
will soon dominate the cybernetic universe. 

<P>     Does this mean that we can ignore the threat?   No, because, obviously, the
so-called digital underground is not homogeneous - we have Inner city hackers
without conscience -- arrogant, disdainful, and alienated.  For the disenfranchised,
cyberspace is the only place where they have power and can make the rules.  

<P>     And then there are the Eurohackers - apparently the Netherlands has the
world's best hackers.  To them, hacking is simply beating technology.  Breaking
into a computer should not be a crime, they argue, although hurting people with
the data or hurting the systems should be illegal. 

<P>     So what is the truth about hacking and hackers?  Everything seems to point to
the conclusion that hackers are just kids, no matter what their age.  On the other
hand, they are kids with goals and weapons.  Their goals involve:

<P>1.   Theft of information and services (corporate secrets, military secrets, calling    

cards and electronic money devices) 

<P>2.   Modification of information (altering financial credit, medical records etc.)

<P>3.   Destruction of information and information systems.

<P>     Their weapons in cyberspace are almost invisible; their code of ethics is
inconsistent; they believe that their anarchy can be tolerated in cyberspace
because most other people act responsibly.

<P>     Whatever the profile, hackers have shown the chinks in the armour - if kids can
do such damage, what about dedicated, well-financed, perhaps mercenary
professionals?

<P>     So will the hacker threat evolve in that manner as technology evolves.  Some
paint a scary picture of terrorist info-criminals, attacking computer networks, the
vulnerable nervous system of modern society.  They suggest that the hacker
community is becoming more sophisticated and organized.  Will they become
international gangs of criminals who steal data, destroy systems and divert funds?  

<P>     Others state that no evidence exists that the current generation of hackers is
attempting to sabotage entire networks, although there is some evidence that the
newest generation of hackers may be more motivated by personal gain than the
traditional ethic of sheer curiosity.  

<P>     And what about subversives launching sporadic attacks on the information
superhighway; electronic invaders compromising passwords, stealing data,
monitoring telephone calls and gathering personal data on individuals.

<P>     Two alleged underground groups of hackers deserve mention: the Legion of
Doom (20 members around the USA) and the Masters of Deception (five members
aged 18-22).  The Legion of Doom used pilfered passwords and old identification
cards to gain access to computers at BellSouth and eavesdropped on
conversations, rerouted calls, etc.  The Masters of Deception broke into computers
at TRW and Nynex where they stole credit reports and confidential information that
were sold to private investigators.

<P>     The Masters of Deception were indicted for their crimes in 1992 but, according
to their most infamous member, Phiber Optic, there really was no such group and
no computer underground and certainly he had never been involved in any
organized fashion.

<P>     So are hackers, or rather Crackers, the more malevolent hackers, the terrorists
of the Information Age?  According to the foremost American expert on terrorism,
the answer is, "No".  We do not find these villains of the information age in the
ranks of today's terrorists.  Brian Michael Jenkins (Deputy Chairman of Kroll
Associates and a global expert on terrorism and its impact on the future - speaking
in OMNI November 1994) says that he does not see terrorists innovating much
with tactics.  It is not a matter of terrorists moving into the domain of computer
crime.  Politically motivated hackers might move towards terrorism but they don't
seem to be drawn by ideological causes.  And terrorists do not go out and recruit
computer literates; conspiracies, according to Jenkins, do not work that way.    
     
<P>     As well, if we accept that the characteristics of an industrial age war can be
described as large armies, several separated theatres of operation, joint operations
and relatively modern technologies, then the Information Warfare model as
presented does not meet this definition, although one could suggest it does involve
several separated theatres of operation and unquestionably modern technology.

<P>     Let me tell you of my recent vicarious foray into the sketchy world of hackers.

<P>     I obtained copies of 2600 - The Hacker Quarterly, and the Hacker Chronicles - a
CD ROM - as well as investigated the "alt. hacker" bulletin boards on the
INTERNET.

<P>     2600, the Hacker Quarterly, generally features a series of articles under various
pseudonyms.  Even the publisher goes by the fictitious name of Emmanuel
Goldstein, the character Orwell used as his political mouthpiece against omnipotent
government in the novel "1984".

<P>     As well, the reader will be forgiven if he or she was not able to actually read or
understand the magazine.  To paraphrase John Perry Barlow, it is a thing of
surpassing opacity.   And anyone who can fully understand it has probably altered
his consciousness sufficiently to preclude ever again reading Shakespeare, Blake, or
even Bob Dylan.  

<P>     Whether these articles actually help anyone break into computer systems, I can
only speculate.  Some people have suggested to me that anyone stupid enough to
try what is published in these magazines deserves whatever legal or other
consequence is likely to befall him.  

<P>     Recent articles include:

<P>     "Cordless Fun" -- how to legally monitor people on their cordless phones and    

   listing frequencies of AT & T models,  
     
<P>     "Admin without a Clue"-- claiming 40 percent of the passwords on the 
computer science system have been cracked - primarily due to arrogance of 
system operators not admitting that a security problem could exist;
     
<P>     "Hacking Prodigy" -- describes how to get a month's free service on Prodigy.

<P>     Who reads these articles?  In June, I noticed two copies of the summer issue
displayed at my local magazine stand.  In November, the same two copies were
still on display, plus two copies of the Autumn issue.  I bought a copy of each. 
This past weekend, the remaining two copies were still on display 
     
<P>     My surfing the INTERNET found widespread distribution of intrusion tool kits,
the hacker's equivalent of the burglar's black bag.  The tool kits contain programs
that purport to listen to conversations between computers on the network; they
will gain illicit entry into computers to look for valuable data or to shut the
computer down - to learn and copy passwords and access codes to get unlimited
access - and to listen to private E-mail between users.

<P>     Do  we believe there are hackers everywhere?  If we allow any kind of external
connection, there is the potential for hackers to attack our networks.  But does the
real problem lie elsewhere?

<P>     Hackers don't have any magic tricks to get into our systems - they simply
capitalize on our system's weakness.  If we have weak passwords, they'll guess
them by repeated trial and error.  And if we have no intruder detection system on
our networks, we'll never even know that they're trying to get in. 

<P>     But we do have the tools and technology to defeat the Information Warrior. 
The question is, "Why have we done so little?"  The answer could be arrogance,
apathy, or ignorance.

<P>     The message here is not that electronic privacy is an oxymoron -- the message
is that we must become more responsible for the systems we put in place.  System
compromise is often the result of our sloppiness or inattention.  Sure clever
electronic intrusions take place but the intrusions are made possible because the
users either don't understand or won't accept their responsibilities to protect
privacy and confidentiality.

<P>     We must take this stuff seriously - if we don't take due care, the alacrity and
ease of penetration is likely to be everyone's worst nightmare, as described by Mr.
Schwartau.
     
<P>     We need to have robust external controls, audit trails, authorization, and
attributable entries,  We need to create disincentives for those who have the 
inclination to hack:  disincentives like firewalls over all systems connected to the
INTERNET; disincentives like monitoring traffic in and out of our systems to see
who is snooping around looking for passwords.

<P>     I suggest we can dispose of the myth of the smart hacker because that myth
excuses us from limiting connections or avoiding the effort of building robust and
thorough security.  Penetration is not the hackers success;  penetration is more
likely our failure to erect proper systems defence.

<P>     And the first defence should be on raising the level of awareness.  Now people
have a right not to care about their personal information.  If they want to
voluntarily relinquish control over their own personal information to others, that is
their right.  But they must make that decision based on clear information.  And
no-one has the right to compromise their duty of care and confidentiality over the
personal records of others.

<P>     Mich Kabay suggests that criminal hacking is a social problem not merely a
technical issue.  I tend to agree with him when he says that all of us should be
reaching out to educate young people about the rules of network usage - we have
to extend the rules of morality and civility - of respect and communication - into
cyberspace.  
     
<P>     We are all of us bound together by norms, rules and values, even when these
are only implicitly understood, sometimes conflicting and often impaired.  Our lives
are both secured in society and connected to each other by this ethical "glue".

<P>     But technology has brought us into the Information Age, in some ways, without
much contemplation of the social responsibilities involved.  As was typical, the
technologies preceded the development of ethics.  And thus, we have the issues of
hacking, unauthorized access into private, personal computer files, systems pranks,
and vandalism, software piracy, electronic harassment, and bulletin boards of hate,
pornography and violence.

<P>     It seems we sometimes suffer from a stunning inability to place the pursuit of
human dignity at the heart of our development and progress.  It is fairly obvious
that the uses of technology are largely determined by the framework in which they
are developed.  All infrastructures could have been designed differently if the initial
design priority had been human rather than technological development.

<P>     So is there is no such thing as electronic privacy?  I am far too optimistic to
agree that there is no privacy in the electronic age or that information cannot be
kept private -- there is and it can.  One means that I envisage to accomplish that is
a scenario in which  there is a convergence of disciplines between the privacy and
security communities.  Let me explain.


  <P>   For many, "privacy", "confidentiality" and "security" come down to the same
thing -- safeguarding information.  In fact, each term has a meaning distinct from
the others.  To understand the issues raised by each, it is essential to understand
those distinctions.

<P>     Privacy (in an information context) concerns an individual right, our right as
individuals to control the flow of our personal information.

<P>     Confidentiality is an obligation of an organization to protect the personal
information with which it has been entrusted.  It is a fiduciary duty, a duty of care
to maintain the secrecy of the information.

<P>     And finally, security is the process of assessing the threats and risks posed to
information and taking the appropriate steps to keep the information safe from
harm.  

<P>     Where does that leave us in our quest to devise rules for information flows on
the information highway?  

<P>     First, we should recognize that privacy (a right), confidentiality (a duty) and
security (a process), while distinct, are complementary and offer a mosaic of
approaches to deal with the challenges we face.  All players will have to commit to
honouring the same fundamental information practices.  We must devise principles
to balance what is at stake.  Professionals in all three disciplines have a unique
combination of skills and experience which they can bring together to construct
solutions.
   
<P>     If we can clearly define the rights and the responsibilities of individuals,
corporate bodies and governments and make the whole process transparent, we
might be able to deal openly and intelligently with the issues facing us.  In all of
this, there is an absence so far of an appropriate legislative and regulatory
framework.  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner feels that one is urgently
needed.

<P>     Here, for discussion, are the kind of principles we would like to see in law to
protect privacy, confidentiality and security:
     
<P>     * A reasonable expectation of information privacy is fundamental to the   
provision, use and regulation of information systems.
     
<P>     * An assessment of the privacy impact of current or planned activities should  
be conducted before collecting or transacting personal data.
     

<P>     * An adherence by organizations to a fair information code such as the Privacy 
Act governing collection, use, disclosure, disposal and security.

<P>As well, organizations should:

<P>     * develop administrative procedures to ensure the integrity of personal   
information, that it is accurate, timely, complete and relevant to the purposes     
for which it is collected;
     
<P>     * establish technological procedures to protect the reliability and integrity of
electronic communications through encryption, smart cards and other tools;
     
<P>     * establish a human security procedure to ensure accountability for the system;
     

<P>improper use of their personal information.

<p><i>Attn: Martin Meissonnier, Christoph Jorg, ARTE Thema</i></p>


<p>Dear Sirs,</p>

<p>On the 19th November this year your Thema television program
ran a segment on the electromagnetic Bomb paper which we
sponsored to the InfoWarCon 5conference. We understand that some
of the coverage may not have been entirely accurate.</p>


<p>We would be most interested in ARTE-Thema providing our
principal, Mr Winn Schwartau, an internationally recognized
authority on the subject of Information Warfare and
Cyber-Terrorism, with the opportunity to elaborate on the context
and the importance of this paper in a television interview. Winn
is happy to answer any questions which you think may be of
interest to your audience.</p>


<p>We remind you that the paper in question is covered by
copyright, and ARTE-Thema published this material without the
prior consent of infowar.com or the author of the paper. Your
internet posting (~/thema/19961119/liens.html) also does not
mention our primary site, www infowar.com, which has posted the
paper since early October.</p>


<p>Therefore, we believe that ARTE-Thema should provide us with
the right of reply on this topic. The topic is one of major
importance and we believe that it should receive proper coverage.
We are sure that your viewers will appreciate the whole story
behind the paper.</p>


<p>Mr Schwartau will be in Sweden between dates from December 7
to December 13, 1996. Please contact me at betty@infowar.com or
813-367-7277. Perhaps you will be interested in capturing this
opportunity. I am sure a videoconference interview can be easily
arranged from your end. </p>


<p>We thank you for your cooperation in this matter.</p>


<p>Best Regards,<BR>

Betty G. O'Hearn<BR>

NJ Genetic Privacy Bill   ----  DNA data is a hot topic!
</h3>
</center>
November 26, 1996<BR>

<P>Based upon an Associated Press story published in The Trenton Times
(Trenton, NJ) as "New law shields DNA data"; Wed, 20 Nov 1996, p. A6.

<P>On Tuesday, 19 Nov 1996, New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman signed the NJ
Genetic Privacy Act into law. The law prohibits employers or insurance
companies from discriminating based upon a person genetic data. New Jersey
became the eight state in the US to adopt such a law.

<P>The law says that no one may obtain a person's genetic information without
the person's consent and that the DNA samples must be destroyed promptly
when the person requests the destruction. The law specifies fines up to
$5,000 and jail term for the unauthorized disclosure of the DNA information.
Insurance companies and employers who use DNA data to discriminate against a
person can face up to $5,000 in fines for each offense.

<P>The NJ Genetic Privacy Act was enacted out of concerns that genetic tests
for things such as susceptibility to breast cancer and other diseases could
be used by insurers and employers to deny coverage or employment opportunities.

<P>The bill's prime sponsor, NJ State Senator Jack Sinagra (R-Middlesex
County), "The Genetic Privacy will ensure that our citizens can take
advantage of the advances in genetic testing without the fear of
exploitation or discrimination. This opens up a myriad of opportunities for
new treatments and cures, but it also opens the door for potential abuse."

<P>Governor Whitman had vetoed an earlier version of the bill in September
because it contained a clause stating that one owns one's own genetic
information.  Whitman was concerned that asserting such property rights
would discourage biotech industries from working in New Jersey.  (One
scenario revolving around this concern was of a biotech company developing a
saleable product from information derived from somebody's DNA samples and
the person insists upon royalties.)

<P>------------------------------------------------------------
<P>Other Notes (This is a mental core dump concerning anything even remotely
related to genetic information issues.):  

<P>The issue of genetic privacy is a new field.  I don't believe that this new
law will do all that much, at least not until some significant tests of the
law.  Although the new law will prevent open discrimination, there is the
likelihood that many discrimination cases will be hidden under false claims.

<P>The law does not affect, to my knowledge the use of genetic data by the police.

<P>In the US military, there have been several recent courtmartials concerning
the refusal to submit to DNA sample collections.  A few months ago, the
Village Voice carried an article about two servicemen who refused to submit
to the sampling.  The case was treated as a classic "refusal to carry out
lawful orders".  From the Village Voice article, it looks a big factor in
the cases was the way that the military sought to collect the samples.  It
was done "we'll take swabs of [epithelial] cells from the inside of your
cheek, no and-ifs or buts".  A couple of servicemen objected to the sampling
when the sample takers would not or could not answer their questions about
the use of the samples.  Reportedly, the main purpose of the  samples was to
provide a good method of identifying human remains. But, it is easy for
people to extrapolate many other uses for the data, including the permanent
inclusion of the data in Federal records (just as much as the fingerprints
remain on file forever). If anybody is interested in a better summary of the
Village Voice article  or a photocopy of it, let me know. 

<P>In a recent Wired issue, the military and genetic information was mentioned
in a article about biological research for future warfare and a conference
about it given at the US Army War College.  Now, this item is very much
speculative and sounds like science fiction.  One of the concepts being
considered by some researchers is the development of genetic weapons that
could be used to "take out the next Hitler".  That is, a genetic "bullet"
(e.g.; a custom virus) that would be designed to be lethal to one person on
earth or maybe a handful of people sharing strong genetic similarities.
Again, this is still a ways off and it is an intense example but it gives an
idea of some directions in which the genetic revolution can go.

<P>Other genetic information possibilities are raised in a book review of
_Queer Science_ in the November/December 1996 issue of The Sciences (pp.
34-38). One of the controversies over research concerning homosexuality and
genetic factors for it is the possibility that if a "gay gene" is
discovered, societies and individuals might react in drastic ways.  For
example, parents discovering that their unborn child has the "gay gene"
might opt to abort. Or that the "gay gene" might be interpreted as leading
to certain physiological developments and some people would seek to use
medical treatments to alter these developments.  (The review mentioned that
back in the 1920's, there were some attempts to "cure" homosexuality by
surgery .)

<P>About a decade or two ago, there was some controversy over how to handle
"super males", males with an extra Y chromosome.  XYY males were deemed to
be prone to violence.  This raised the question of using genetic screening
to check for this trait and, then if it is found, of using special care to
prevent violence. Elsewhere, there were studies among the Hutterite
communities concerning depression and suicide that suggested genetic
patterns contributing to this.  (The Hutterites are a religious sections
*roughly* similar to the Amish.)  If a "depression gene" is found, this
could lead to better preventative medicine, to enforced therapies or to
discrimination.  One possible scenario could be employment conditions that
require medical monitoring and advance treatments for certain conditions
deemed to be found in genetic testing.</P>

<P>   Wall Street Journal, November 18, 1996, p. B4.


<P>   IBM Wants Your Body for a Very Personal PC

<P>   By Bart Ziegler


<P>   Las Vegas - It sounds a bit farfetched, but an
   International Business Machines Corp. researcher has
   devised a way to transmit information via a tiny pocket
   computer and current running through your body.

<P>   Using the setup, a person could send an electronic business
   card merely by shaking hands with someone similarly
   equipped -- the name, address and other data would be
   zapped from hand to hand, then to the other person's pocket
   computer. The technology also could replace phone cards,
   allowing your hand to transmit the calling-card number to
   the phone system when you touch the receiver of a public
   phone.

<P>   The scheme devised by Tom Zimmerman may sound a bit crazy,
   but the researcher has a track record in popularizing wild
   ideas: His "data glove" became a hit for Mattel Inc., as a
   way to manipulate Nintendo games by moving one's hand in
   the air while wearing a special glove.

 <P><B>  Electronic Identification</B>

<P>   "Anything you touch you could be telling it electronically
   who you are," says Mr. Zimmerman of the IBM system, which
   stemmed from early work he did with others at the Media Lab
   at Massachusetts Institute of Technology before he joined
   IBM. He envisions the system replacing the jumble of credit
   cards, identification cards, keys and other paraphernalia
   in people's pockets.

<P>   IBM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Louis V. Gerstner
   Jr. is so enthusiastic that he has been trotting out the
   researcher before closed-door gatherings of CEOs to
   demonstrate the electronic-handshake trick. Mr. Zimmerman
   will reprise the role in public for the first time at this
   week's giant Comdex computer trade show here.

<P><B>   Charged Body</B>

<P>   In a videotaped demonstration, Mr. Zimmerman and an IBM
   colleague show how the concept works. Mr. Zimmerman placed
   a transmitter device about the size of a pack of cards
   beneath one foot, and the colleague did likewise with a
   small receiver -- these devices in their early form need to
   make contact with the ground to ensure the weak electric
   current they generate flows in the right direction. Then,
   when they touched fingers, Mr. Zimmerman's business-card
   information was transferred from his device to the device
   under his colleague's foot, then to a laptop computer where
   it could be viewed.

<P>   The system takes advantage of the body's ability to
   transmit electricity. Mr. Zimmerman says the current his
   system uses from a battery is one-thousandth as strong as
   the current created when a balloon is rubbed against a
   sweater to make it stick on the wall. The system sends
   signals using a portion of the AM band below the frequency
   used by radio transmissions, and transmits data about as
   fast as a 2400-baud modem.

<P>   Among other uses, Mr. Zimmerman says his setup could create
   a "personal area network" over one's body to link the
   various electronic devices a person carries. For instance,
   it could allow a pager attached to one's belt to transmit
   a phone number it receives to a cellular phone carried in
   a pocket. The researcher even imagines a version of the
   small computers that could be built into shoes, with the
   electricity to power them being generated by a person's
   steps.

<P>   So far, though, it's all just a novel concept. Mr.
   Zimmerman filed a patent application for the technology
   only last week, and IBM hasn't decided whether it will
   commercialize it. But Mr. Zimmerman adds that "I probably
   wouldn't be working as hard on it and IBM probably wouldn't
   have filed a patent on it if it didn't think it could be a
   product."

New Full Body Scanning Planned<BR> for US Airport Security<BR>
But is it safe?

PRIVACY Forum Digest <BR>   Monday, 28 October 1996      Volume 05 : Issue 20<BR>
<BR>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Date:    Sun, 27 Oct 96 15:15 PST<BR>
From:    lauren@vortex.com (Lauren Weinstein; PRIVACY Forum Moderator)<BR>
Subject: "Holographic" Full-Body Security Scanning<BR>

<P>According to an article in the Oct-Nov 1996 issue of "Compressed Air"
magazine (a wonderful Ingersoll-Rand publication that covers a very wide
range of topics), the Federal Aviation Administration is planning to begin
testing the use of a full-body "holographic" imaging system at a U.S.
airport next year.  

<P>The system (an earlier version of which was discussed previously in the
PRIVACY Forum), actually uses millimeter waves (~30 Ghz) to quickly (within
a few seconds) generate a "naked" image of the scannee.  The device has been
under development for a number of years and appears to be evolving rapidly.
The transmitted millimeter radiation passes through clothes but bounces off
the body or other objects (e.g., everything from loose change to firearms,
hidden money packets, etc.)

<P>Outside of the rather obvious broader privacy implications of such a device,
two special issues should also be considered.  First, even though the
millimeter radiation used is non-ionizing (e.g. less energetic than x-rays),
there is considerable controversy about the health risks of exposure to
non-ionizing radiation at these wavelengths.  The statement is made that the
system is similar in exposure to supermarket "door opener" microwave
scanners, though this seems somewhat difficult to accept given the
completely different scanning requirements of the two devices.

<P>But another problem may be even more likely to concern the public at large
about such equipment.  As the photographs included with the article show all
too clearly, the device generates quite detailed "nude" images.  It is
decidedly uncertain how people will feel about being required to pass
through a system that creates instant 360 degree naked pictures, possibly
archived to tape as well!  The promoters of the system suggest that using
"same-sex" operators would alleviate these concerns.  Excuse me, but are we
all living on the same planet?  Talk about needing a reality check...

<P>I have no doubt that there might be special situations where such a device,
as an alternative to "pat-downs" or other intrusive personal searches, could
be useful.  But broadscale deployment of such systems in airports as a
routine body scanning procedure seems unlikely to be acceptable to most of
the public.</P>

 How to Get Less Junk Mail<BR>
By Chris Hibbert hibbert@netcom.com
</h3>
</center>

<BR>
<P>Are you getting unsolicited mail that's more trouble than it's worth?  Here
are some things you can do that will give you more control of what comes into
your home.  I don't know of anything you can do that will stop the influx
immediately, short of moving and not telling anyone (including creditors,
employer, insurers, old friends, and especially the Post Office).  If you're
willing to start slow and spend some time on it, you can slowly cut down the
amount of junk mail you get.</P>

  credit cards<BR>
  Change of Address notices<BR>


<P>The first thing to realize is that there are several different sources of
junk mail, and there are different things you have to do for each of them.
There are some broad-band tools you can use to stop a lot of junk mail at
once, but these miss some important categories.  For the rest, until you
figure out why you got a particular piece of mail, you can't take the action
that will prevent its recurrence.  It's important to realize that some
companies maintain their own lists, while other companies buy the lists they
mail to.  In the first case, you have to talk to the company that is sending
the mail, and in the second, you have to talk to whoever they bought your
name from.</P>

        Some simple actions that may help a lot<BR>

<P>One approach attempts to stop all the unsolicited mail at once.  The good
part of this approach is that it's not much work, the drawback is that you
may stop receiving some mail that you wanted, but were only getting as a
side-effect of something else.  There are several different organizations you
can contact, including the Direct Marketing Association, an organization of
direct mailers. [see Q1.]  and a few companies that charge a fee for
individually contacting companies that are sending you mail.  [See Q2.]

<P>Among the companies that have their own lists are local merchants who like to
send out periodic reminders, and the national firms that send out twice
weekly piles of advertising to all postal patrons, The two big companies in
this latter business are ADVO ("Mailbox Values") and Harte Hanks
("Potpourri").  [See Q3 for how to deal with these two.]  You won't be able
to tell which pieces are coming from mailers who have you directly on their
lists until you've reduced your junk mail to a level that makes it worthwhile
to individually call the sources of the mail you get.</P>


        Companies that sell lists<BR>

<P>Dealing with re-sold lists is a long process.  You have to find out who's
selling your name, and ask them to stop.  There are two possible approaches
to tracking down the companies that are selling your name.  You can either
ask the companies that are sending you the mail, or you can track the spread
of your name and address.

<P>If you're not getting much junk mail, you can easily call the companies that
sent you something and ask where they got your name.  As long as you're
polite, the people in the direct mail department are quite willing to tell
you this.  Often they will tell you the names of the two or three places from
whom they bought lists in the last month, and you can figure out which one
knows about you.  Other times if you read them the codes on the mailing
label, they can tell you exactly who it was.

You can also head off the problem entirely by always telling organizations
which you deal with through the mail that you don't want them selling your
name.  You can do this with a note when you order something or send your
dues, or you can send them a separate note or call their national office on
the phone.</P>


       How to track the spread of your name<BR>

<P>If you're getting a fair amount of junk mail, it's probably easier to start
by adding markers to the address used by correspondents you want to continue
to receive mail from.  A simple trick you can use is to modify your name in
some way that you keep track of.  When you receive something unsolicited in
the mail, you check your list and see where they got your address.

<P>I use different middle initials with different organizations, but you could
also change how you spell your first or last name, or add an apartment number
to your address (or add a superfluous letter to your already-numbered
apartment).  If you are dealing with a professional organization, you might
add a title, or a department name.</P>


        Asking to be removed from a list<BR>

<P>Once you've identified a particular company and want them to remove you from
their list, (either the one they mail to directly, or the one they sell)
there are a few common steps to take.  Start by calling customer service and
tell them you want to stop getting mail.  Then follow up by keeping track of
mail you get from them, or mail addressed to the name you only use with them.

<P>When you call again in a few weeks or a month (depending on how long they
said it would take), you want to be able to tell them what in particular you
received, and when, so they can figure out which list they missed the first
time.  In all cases, be polite, don't refer to "junk mail" unless the clerk
wants to know why you care, and be persistent.  If the person you are talking
to doesn't know what to do, ask to speak to their supervisor, and be willing
to patiently explain your predicament again.</P>


        Tactics that won't help<BR>

<P>I assume that your objective is to receive less mail.  You might also be
interested in encouraging mailers to send junk mail less often.  The
following are tactics that won't succeed at either of these goals, but (if
you're vindictive) might make you feel better.

<P>Using Business Reply Envelopes to complain will usually not get the attention
of the mailing company.  If you attach them to a brick or overfill the
envelope, the post office will discard them.  If you send them back empty, or
with a complaint about the catalogue you didn't want, they'll be discarded by
the people who open the envelopes.  The mail is usually opened by people who
only get paid for actual orders they pass on to the company, so they don't
often bother to relay complaints or count the number of replies that didn't
contain orders.

<P>Your use of the BRE will cost them money, but they'll never notice it, so
this won't cause them to change the way they do business.  (Unless the number
of people sending empty BRE's becomes a substantial fraction of the number
sending orders.  This might lower the effectiveness enough that they'd stop
doing mail order.  Not likely.)

<P>If you want the company to pay attention, get in touch with their customer
service people.  Most of the time, the company never even saw your name, so
they can't do much to keep you from getting future ads.  They buy lists from
other companies, and those other companies are the ones you need to get in
touch with.  They might be interested if you were offended by their ad, but
otherwise they'll just point out that many people order merchandise from them
in response to the mailing.  If you want to stop getting the mail, find out
who they buy names from, and get those people to stop selling your name.



<P>Q1.  How do I contact the big companies that sell lists?

<P>A1.  The best place to start is the Direct Marketing Association.  Their
member organizations are some of the direct mailers who send the stuff.  Call
their Mail Preference Service at their unlisted number (212)768-7277 and ask
to be added to their Suppression File.  Tell them you'll wait while they type
in your address (so they don't lose the piece of paper with your address.)
Call again in a week and ask if your name is listed.  Their mailing address
(11 West 42nd Street, New York, NY 10163-3861, or PO Box 9008, Farmingdale NY
11735-9099) also provides effective service.</P>

</PRE>
<P>[There are more, send me addresses of any you know.  I haven't dealt with any
of them, so buyer beware!]

<P>Q3.  How do I stop the loose unaddressed flyers I get twice a week?

<P>A3.  There are two different companies: ADVO ("Mailbox Values") and Harte
Hanks ("Potpourri") that send these out in different areas around the US. The
advertising is sent as a "supplement" to an address card which has the
postage-paid notice on it.

<P>These bundles are sent to every address in the affected areas, and it takes
two separate actions to stop it.  First you have to get ADVO or Hart Hanks to
stop printing the address card, and only then can you get your mail carrier
to stop delivering the advertising.

<P>Both ADVO and Harte Hanks have local offices scattered around the country,
and the best way to get off their list is to talk to the local office.  The
cards usually have the local phone number on them, or at least an address
(call directory assistance.)  Ask for the circulation department, and call
back in a week to check that they really did remove your address.  Be
prepared to wait 8 weeks for the mail to stop.  They'll occasionally
"accidentally" send out another card, but it's easier to stop them the second
time.

<P>Your postal carrier "knows" that everyone on the route is supposed to get
one, so she'll keep delivering them even if it looks like the address card is
lost.  It's against the law for them to deliver unaddressed mail, so it only
takes a phone call to the supervisor at the local post office to convince the
carrier to stop.  There will occasionally be a mistake after that (when
there's a substitute or new carrier) but it doesn't take very many calls to
convince the supervisor you really mean it.

<P>There's no need to threaten lawsuits or anything, just tell them you received
unaddressed mail.  With ADVO and Potpourri, you may have to point out that
you found out how to get off the lists before they understand, but the postal
supervisors do know what the law says.

<P>In many rural areas, ADVO uses "rural route" addressing, which means
that they don't put individual addresses on the cover cards.  (When I
talked to them, they claimed they were in the process of converting
all their areas to individual addresses, but it may take a while.)  If
your card comes addressed just to "rural route #1", you can still get
the post office to stop delivering to you, but it's more work.
Instead of getting ADVO to stop generating an address card for you,
you have to get them to tell the post office that they no longer want
you to get one of their packets.  Once you've gotten ADVO to tell the
post office, you can start bugging the carrier to stop delivering your
copy.  It's more work than when they use individual addresses, but
several people have told me that this process works.</P>


        Dealing with specific types of organizations<BR>

<P>Here's a list of some of the kinds of organizations that direct marketers buy
names from and what you can do about each.</P>

  Mail-Order Catalogues<BR>
<P>Use a distinct address with each catalogue you order from.  Your name will
occasionally be sold to someone you don't want to hear from, and you have to
know where they got your name to make it stop.  When you find that a
catalogue resells your name to places you don't like, ask them to add your
name to their suppression list.  Most don't have any trouble with this
request.

<P>One thing to be careful about: many will "correct" your name and address from
your checks, so you have to continually make sure that they're using the
name/address you chose for them.  I have my checks printed without name or
address so I can choose what each organization sees.  You're always supposed
to write down the account number anyway.</P>

  Memberships In Organizations<BR>
    (charitable, political, religious, professional, etc.)<BR>
<P>Just like mail-order catalogues; use a distinct address for each.  Many will
sell your name without warning.</P>

  Phone Book Listing<BR>
<P>Many organizations build their address lists from telephone directories.  In
addition, these lists can be cross-matched with others and occasionally
they'll make inferences based on your listing.  (sex from first name,
ethnicity from last name, profession from title, etc.)  You can get an
unlisted number, but there are directories that include those listings, they
just cost more.  A cheaper way to have an unlisted number is to pick a fake
name for the directory.  Any phone calls or mail for that name you can be
sure are junk.</P>

  Warranties/Product Registration Cards<BR>
<P>You are seldom required to send in registration cards in order to be covered
by a warranty.  Most of these cards are send to the National Demographics and
Lifestyles Company which compiles direct mail lists of people based on the
life-style, family income, and buying habits that people describe on the
cards.  Write to them at:</P>
<PRE>

            List Order Department
            1621 18th St.
            Suite 300
            Denver, CO 80202
</PRE>
  800/900 Number Services<BR>
<P>800 and 900 number services can easily find out your name and address when
you call (they use reverse directories indexed by your phone number.)  Many
of them compile and sell lists of people who are interested in their product
or watch their TV show.  Make your 800-number phone calls during a break at
work.  Don't call 900-number services unless you don't mind your name
appearing on lists of people who use the particular service.</P>

  Contests (You May Already Be A Winner!)<BR>
<P>There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch!  There are some real contests that
give out real money, but not many, and the odds are never very good.  Many
things advertised as contests these days are just fishing expeditions for
names to add to mailing lists.  Others are serious fraud.  Never give out
credit card numbers over the phone unless you're positive the company you're
calling is reputable.</P>

  Credit Cards<BR>
<P>Some credit card companies sell lists of customers to direct mailers.  They
know a lot about your lifestyle: what you buy, where you travel, and how much
you spend.  Banks don't seem to use the same information from your checks, so
if you're looking for a little more privacy...</P>

  Birth Certificates, Marriage Licenses, Property Records<BR>
<P>You can't do much about these except use a variant spelling and track down
each use of the name.  Most of the list compilers are willing to drop your
name if you ask.</P>

  Credit Bureaus<BR>
<P>Two of the major credit bureaus still sell lists based on their databases.
You can contact them at:</P>

  Change of Address notices
</PRE>
<P>The post office sells the names and addresses from its Change of Address
cards.  They even encourage bulk mailers to use the data so there will be
fewer miss-addressed letters.  If you're having trouble dealing with the junk
and want to stop getting it, contact all your correspondents individually and
don't fill out the Post office's form.</P>

<P>On Mon, 21 Oct 1996, grp-lib1@soc.mil (Mr. Fred L. Fuller) (by way of "Betty G. 
'Hearn" <betty@infowar.com>) wrote:
<P>Is this the Child Porn you are received?  This writer says it is IW attack.   

<P>All day one of the various listservs I read has featured outraged but
imprecise messages regarding offers of "questionable material" apparently
received via the list. I just received the following message from another
list which goes a great way toward explaining both the outrage and lack of
descriptive precision. It seems the spammers are at work again, in a much
more twisted mode than usual. I forwarded a copy of this msg to my network
admin staff here to let them know it was going on- you might consider doing
that also if it shows up in your neighborhood.

<P>   This seems to be a prank of a particularly malicious nature. It may be a
peculiar form of infowar as well- I imagine AOL and the FBI are already
tired of hearing about this.

<P>   For those who may not have seen or heard of the individual who posted
the message below, I'd like to help establish his bona fides. Patrick
Crispen, a student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, was
responsible for writing two free online Internet training workshops (ROADMAP
and ROADMAP96) as well as assisting in the ongoing TOURBUS list (a WWW
workshop) from which the post below originates. Tens of thousands of
Internet and WWW users have benefited from these efforts. See his home page
for details- the URL is listed below. He'd probably rather you didn't email
him directly with questions, however.</P>

From: Patrick Douglas Crispen <crispen@campus.mci.net><BR>
Subject:      ADMIN: CHILD PORN LETTER<BR>
To: TOURBUS@LISTSERV.AOL.COM<BR>

<P>Thousands of Internet subscribers around the world recently received e-mail
letters from <TipToe0001@aol.com> or <R9ch@aol.com> with the subject lines
"Child Fun!" or "Child XXX" offering child pornography for sale over the
Internet.  I want to assure the readers of this list that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>     1. The sender of the "Child Fun" letter did not get your
        e-mail address from this LISTSERV list.  The only person
        in the world who can even see this list's subscriber
        information is the listowner -- me.  :)

<LI>     2. I immediately contacted, and faxed a copy of the "Child
        Fun" letter to, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
        office in Tuscaloosa.

<LI>     3. I personally believe that the "Child Fun" letter is a
        "spoof," written by someone who decided it would be funny
        to exact some sort of revenge on "Steve Barnard."  (The
        second line of the letter -- "I sent you this letter
        because your email address was on a list that fit this
        category" -- is the classic opening line for the new
        generation of mass-mail spams).
</UL>
<P>If you receive or have received a copy of the "Child Fun" letter, simply
delete it.  The federal law enforcement agency of the United States is
aware of the letter, and is investigating the matter.</P>

 You can't even trust your answering machine these days.<BR>

</h3>
</center>

<BR>
<P>Here's a warning of a lo-brow IW attack from the 2BW at Barksdale AFB, LA. 
 This report was validated by CNN Headline last week.


<P>           This message was forwarded to me by James Murdock, the budget
          administrator at the University of Michigan.  He wrote:

<P>           My apologies if you've seen this, but if you have not its probably
          worth taking note of.  Sounds like a scam that could easily ruin your
          day.
           You can't even trust your answering machine these days.

<P>              The Scam works basically like  this:</P>
 <P>          You get home and notice that the message light is blinking on your
          answering  machine.  You listen to the message, which has several
          wrinkles, but the best one is the caller asks you to call a number
          beginning with area code 809 to receive information about a family
           member who has been ill. (They may also tell you someone has been
          arrested, died, you have won a wonderful prize, etc.)
           In any event, concerned or curious, you make the call.
<P>Sometimes the
           phone will be answered by a person who claims to speak broken
           English.  (The idea is to keep you on the line to build up charges.)
            Or, sometimes you will just get a long recorded message.  The
bottom
           lines is, when your phone bill comes, you see this incredible
charge,
           oftentimes more than $100.00 dollars!
<P>           Crooks are using the 809 numbers as "pay-per-calls" and to get
around
           the US Regulations and 900 number blocking.  Every time you
           call the number, they get a greatly inflated rebate from the foreign
          phone company.  Since the 809 numbers are in the Caribbean, they
           aren't bound by US 900# regulations that require them to warn you of
          the charge and rate involved, and also to provide a time period
           during which you may terminate the call without being charged.

<P>          The newest twist to this scam is to page people using the 809
          numbers.  With the new area code changes, people unknowingly are
 returning these calls.  When the bill comes, there are HUGE charges for
the calls.  My suggestion is that no matter how you get the
 message, If you are asked to call a number with an 809 area acode that you
don't recognize, DON'T RETURN THE CALL!  It's bad enough that the criminal
is invading your privacy, don't let them invade your wallet as well!

<P> Scams of this type are extremely hard to prosecute and since you did
actually make the call, neither your local phone company or your long
distance carrier will want ot get involved.  They'll tell you that they are
simply providing the billing for the foreign company.  You end up trying to
deal (over the phone) with a foreign company that feels they have done no
wrong.  It can turn into a real nightmare!

<P>PLEASE FWD THIS MSG TO FRIENDS AND LET PEOPLE BE AWARE OF  IT!  </P>

Memorandum on 'Arab Intranet' to be signed next week.<BR>

</h3>
</center>

<BR>
                   By a staff reporter<BR>

 <P>                   A MEMORANDUM of Understanding for the establishment of
an Arab Intranet will be
                    signed in Dubai next week during a seminar organised by
the Ajman University College of
                    Science and Technology (AUCST).

<P>                    Announcing this at a Press conference yesterday, the
chairman of AUCST and president
                    of Private Arabian Institution League of Higher
Education (PAILHE), Dr Saeed Salman,
                    said that the establishment of the Arab Intranet is a
protective strategy against the
                    invasion of Internet information.

  <P>                  "The Arab Intranet will be an accurate information
resource to protect our society and
                    correct the misleading information about the Arab
countries on the Internet."

  <P>                  He said that the two-day symposium to be held from
October 20 at the Dubai Chamber of
                    Commerce and Industry, would be attended by many
European and Arab universities.

   <P>                 The symposium, entitled 'Unitwin Universities within an
Arab Intranet' (Intranet is the
                    local network area from the main international
network), will discuss several topics such
                    as investing information resources using information
technology, strategies on
                    information technology in education and training,
network technology for teaching
                    international commerce and the future challenge of
maximising the utilisation of
                    information technology while maintaining the Arab culture.

    <P>                Other work papers will cover the role of the Arab
League in information resources,
                    private imminent institution networking strategies, the
integration of regional
                    governmental and private universities networks and the
information technology for
                    re-engineering in trading process.

          <P>         Dr Salman believed that the Arab Intranet would serve
the educational process in the
                    Arab countries.

    <P>                The idea of establishing the Arab Intranet was
originated by the AUCST based on the fact
                    that some private and government Arab universities have
the information technology
                    while others have the information.

        <P>            "In the future all Arab universities can join the
Intranet. This will serve education in the
                    first place," Dr Salman said.

          <P>          He said that the establishment of the Arab Intranet
would not be difficult because its base
                    already exists. He said the Intranet would be
supervised by the Arab League but would
                    have a separate board of trustees.

             <P>      The details on the financing and membership of the net
will be discussed at a meeting in  Cairo later, Dr Salman said.<BR>

LONDON (Reuter)<BR>
The British government Monday set up a watchdog to try to
get pornography off the Internet.<BR>

</h3>
</center>
 </table>
<BR>
<P>The Safety Net proposal actually covers a lot more than that. It basically
mandates use of PICS enabled software by everyone (using _one_ ratings
system, RSACi). 

<P>It also contains very concerning aspects with regard to privacy and
anonymity.

<P>Apart from the hotline, it is not about illegal material, because obviously
no-one is going to rate illegal material and then distribute it. It's
clearly a censorship system hiding behind a claim of industry
self-regulation. It's not voluntary when backed up by government threat,
i.e. all "responsible" service providers will require _all_ their users to
rate _all_ their web pages and Usenet articles and, by implication, if
service providers are not seen to be responsible they can anticipate being
raided.

<P>It may sound all well and good to require material to be rated to protect
children, however, given that PICS enabled software can be configured to
restrict access to unrated pages, (notwithstanding the article in the
Brisbane Sunday Mail 29/9 whose author I presume overlooked this facility
in MS IE), it defies imagination why every Net user in the UK should be
required to wade through the definitions of RSACi ratings in order to rate
material to protect children (unless of course it is material they wish to
make it available to children, or others wishing to limit their access, in
the first place). Furthermore the RSACi definitions appear to be based, in
part, on computer games classifications which are not particularly easy to
apply to _still_ images and text. (RSACi = Recreational Software Advisory
Council, Inc).

<P>I'm left wondering if the UK intends, after all UK pages are RSACi rated,
to ban access to the rest of the world -- because to access the rest of the
world (many countries in which are unlikely to mandate use of _RSACi_)
their citizens would need to disable the blocking of unrated pages. I can
see no other reason why _all_ pages and Usenet articles must be rated.

<P>Safety-Net, which is being financed by the industry, will have a hotline to
</P>
[read... financed by the users]<BR>
<BR>
<P>which callers can report suspected illegal material and wiIl contact police
if necessary.

<P>It will publish a "legality indicator" or rating for each public access area
on the Internet known as a Usenet news group.  The rating will indicate
whether the group normally contains illegal or pornographic material and
what kind.

<P>This is quite concerning. It would appear that once a news group is "rated"
as containing any illegal material, an ISP who provides access to it may be
liable - they will hardly be able to claim they didn't know they carried
illegal material. So, ISPs will cut access to that newsgroup, the material
will then most likely be posted in another news group, and so on until
Usenet (in the UK at least) ceases to exist?

<P>Internet users can contact the hotline to complain about material received
from anyone via an automatic telephone, mail, e-mail or facsimile.

<P>I would hope that users reporting illegal material will be protected from
prosecution as a result of having viewed/possessed such material. There is
however no indication of that in the Safety Net information.

<BR>
A few choice extracts follow:<BR>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>
[...]<BR>
    Policies for Word Wide Web Pages<BR>
<P>   24. The "R3 _Safety-Net_" approach endorses the Platform for Internet
       Content Selection (PICS) and the RSACi rating scheme for W3 pages.
       "R3 _Safety-Net_" recommends that Service providers:</P>
          + Promote PICS enabled software for accessing the W3.<BR>
          + Require all their users to rate their own web pages using<BR>
            RSACi.<BR>
          + Remove web pages hosted on their servers which are<BR>
            persistently and deliberately misrated.<BR>
          + Remove web pages hosted on their servers which are identified<BR>
               7 and verified to them as containing child pornography (or<BR>
            other illegal material); if the users fail to co-operate by<BR>
            removing them themselves.<BR>
[...]<BR>
       <BR>
    Policies for Usenet News groups<BR>
   27. The approach extends the PICS standard to Usenet news groups and<BR>
       recommends that service providers should:<BR>
          + Support the development of a new Internet Standard (RFC) for<BR>
            transmitting ratings for news groups according to their<BR>
            'normal content'. (This is currently being developed by Demon<BR>
            Internet and RSAC.)<BR>
          + Support the availability of rating sources for all Usenet<BR>
            groups<BR>
          + Modify News Servers to deliver group ratings to end-user<BR>
            software, when the standard becomes available.<BR>
          + Promote PICS-enabled news software, when available<BR>
          + Remove from their servers, within a reasonable time period,<BR>
            news articles identified and verified to them as containing<BR>
            illegal material.<BR>
<P>  28. These measures will interface with both the Safety-Net
       Foundation's legality ratings for the normal content of news
       groups, and with the ratings provided by users for material they
       have placed on the Internet. In keeping with the principle that
       users should be remain responsible for the material they post, "R3
       _Safety-Net_" considers that in the long-term, users should be
       encouraged to rate their news group articles as they post them.
       The approach of using ratings for the 'normal' content of groups,
       whether supplied by the Safety Net Foundation or by other sources,
       is proposed as a first step. It will assist both users and service
       providers in understanding the nature of material withinthese
       groups, and help to inform responsible actions towards them.</P>
       
    Policies on Traceability<BR>
<P>   29. A key aspect of the "R3 _Safety-Net_" approach is that it attempts
       to ensure that users take responsibility for material they post on
       the Internet. To this end, it is important to be able to trace the
       originators of child pornography and other illegal material. In
       this context, the anonymity that it is possible to achieve through
       some services can be abused to mask the identity of the
       perpetrator.
<P>   30. Anonymity itself can serve a useful purpose in a number of
       contexts. However, the abuse of anonymity in posting illegal
       material is a problem which has to be addressed. Allowing users to
       have truly anonymous (i.e.: untraceable) accounts is a danger,
       while providing services which create pseudonyms which remain
       traceable if necessary, is not. It is therefore recommended that
       service providers should:
  <P>        + Work with the Safety-Net Foundation to close known loopholes
            and to identify and investigate a range of appropriate
            measures to provide facilities for better traceability,
            including, for example:
<P>               o Provision of audit trails such as X-NNTP-Posting-Host;
                 and X-Mail2News-Path.
 <P>             o Reasonable steps which ensure users of "free trials" can
                 be identified (probably the most significant source of
                 anonymity which is abused) including, but not limited
                 to: Use of Caller Line ID, Verification of Credit Card
                 details at start of trial.
<P>               o Development of new and better forms of technical
                 counter-measures
<P>          + Ensure that anonymous servers (e.g.: re-mailers) that they
            operate in the UK record details of identity and make this
            available to the Police, when needed, under Section 28.3 of
            the Data Protection Act.</P>

Report and Guidance<BR>

"Budapest Draft"<BR>

<P>(revised on the basis of the discussions at the 19th Meeting of the Group
in Budapest 15 and 16 April 1996)

<P>Today, the Internet is the world's largest international computer
network. There are "slip roads" to this "information superhighway" in
more than 140 countries. The Internet consists of more than four
millions of Internet sites ("hosts"); more than 40 millions of users
from all over the world can use at least one of the different Internet
services and have the facilities to communicate with each other via
electronic mail. Users have access to an immense pool of information
stored at different locations all over the world. The Internet can be
regarded as the first level of the emerging Global Information
Infrastructure (GII).The WorldWideWeb as the most modern Internet user
interface is a basis for new interactive multimedia services.

<P>The participants in the Internet have different tasks, interests and
opportunities:</P>
<UL>
<LI>   * The software, computer and telecommunications industries design the
     networks and the services available.

 <LI>  * Telecommunications organisations like national telecoms provide    
     basic networks for data transfer (point-to-point or
     point-to-multipoint connections).

 <LI>  * Access (communications) providers supply basic services for storage,
     transmission and presentation. They are responsible for the Internet
     transport system (routing, delivery) and process traffic data.

 <LI>  * Information (content) providers supply information stored in files
     and databases to the users.

<LI>   * Users access different kinds of Internet services (mail, news,
     information) and use the Net for entertainment as well as for
     teleshopping, teleworking, teleteaching/ -learning and telemedecine.
</UL>
<P>
I. Problems and risks<BR>

<P>Unlike in traditional processing of personal data where there is usually
a single authority or enterprise responsible for protecting the privacy
of their customers, there is no such overall responsibility on the
Internet assigned to a certain entity. Furthermore there is no
International oversight mechanism to enforce legal obligations as far as
they exist. Therefore the user is forced to put trust into the security
of the entire network, that is every single component of the network, no
matter where located or managed by whom. The trustworthiness of the Net
will become even more crucial with the advent of new software which
induces the user not only to download programs from the Net, but also
weakens his control over his personal data.

<P>The fast growth of the Internet and its increasing use for commercial and
private purposes give rise to serious privacy problems:</P>
<UL>
<LI>   * The Internet facilitates the quick transmission of great quantities
     of information to any other computer system connected to the
     network.Sensitive personal data can be communicated to countries
     without an appropriate data protection level. Information providers
     might offer personal data from sites situated in countries without
     any privacy legislation where they can be accessed from all over the
     world by a simple mouse click.

<LI>   * Personal data may be routed via countries without any or without
     sufficient data protection legislation. On the Internet, basically
     built for academic purposes, confidential communication is not
     ensured.
<BR>
     There is no central switching center or other responsible authority
     in control of the entire network. Therefore the responsibility for
     data protection and data security is shared between millions of
     providers. Every message transmitted could be intercepted at any
     site it passes and could be traced, changed, forged, suppressed or
     delayed. Nevertheless the Internet use for business purposes
     increases exponentially and personal and other sensitive data
     (credit card data as well as individual health information) are
     transmitted via the Internet.

<LI>   * The use of Internet services does not allow for adequate anonymity
     nor adequate authentification. Computer network protocols and many
     Internet services generally work with dedicated (point-to-point-)
     connections. In addition to the content data the identification (ID)
     of the sender and the recipient is transmitted. Every electronic
     mail message contains a header with information about the sender and
     the recipient (name and IP-address, host name, time of the mailing).
     The header contains further information on the routing and the
     subject of the message. It may also contain references to articles
     by other authors. Users are bound to leave an electronic trace which
     can be used to develop a profile of personal interests and tastes.
     Although there is no central accounting of the access to news or
     WorldWideWeb, the information behaviour of senders and recipients
     can be traced and supervised at least by the communications provider
     to whom the user is connected.

<LI>   * On the other hand, the weakness of identification and authentication
     procedures on the Internet has been used to penetrate remote
     computer systems which were insufficiently protected, to spy on the
     information stored and to manipulate or delete it. The lack of
     secure authentication could also be used to access commercial
     services at the cost of another user.

<LI>   * There are thousands of special news-groups in the Internet; most of
     them are open for every user. The contents of articles may contain
     personal data of third persons; this personal information is
     simultaneously stored on many thousands of computer systems without
     any right of redress for the individual.
</UL>
<P>The participants in the Internet share an interest in the integrity and
confidentiality of the information transmitted: Users are interested in
reliable services and expect their privacy to be protected. In some cases
they may be interested in using services without being identified. Users
do not normally realize that they are entering a global market-place
while surfing on the Net and that every single movement may be monitored.

On the other hand many providers are interested in the identification and
authentication of users: They want personal data for charging, but they
could also use these data for other purposes. The more the Internet is
used for commercial purposes, the more interesting it will be for service
providers and other bodies to get as much transaction-generated
information about the customer's behaviour on the Net as possible, thus
increasing the risk to the customer's privacy. Increasingly companies
start to offer free access to the Net as a way of assuring that customers
read their advertisements which become a major financing method for the
whole Internet. Therefore they want to follow to want extent, by whom and
how often their advertisements are being read.

<P>With regard to certain risks mentioned the functions of the bodies which
on an international, regional and national level manage the Net are
important in particular when they develop the protocols and standards for
the Internet, fix rules for the identification of servers connected and
eventually for the identification of users.</P>

II. Existing regulations and guidelines<BR>

<P>Although several national governments and international organisations
(for example the European Union) have launched programmes to faciliate
and intensify the development of computer networks and services, only
very little efforts have been taken to provide for sufficient data
protection and privacy regulations in this respect. Some national Data
Protection Authorities have already issued guidelines on the technical
security of computer networks linked to the Internet and on privacy risks
for the individual user of Internet services. Such guidelines have been
laid down for example in France, in the U.K. (see the 14th Annual Report
of the Data Protection Registrar, Appendix 6) and in Germany. The main
topics can be summed up as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>   * Providing information on the Internet is subject to the national
     data protection laws and regulations. In this respect the Internet
     is not as unregulated as often stated. Ist is, to name but one
     example, illegal for a German provider of a WorldWideWebServer to
     register the complete addresses of computers which have accessed
     which Web pages and to which files are being downloaded without the
     knowledge of the person initiating that procedure (as is the usual
     practice on the Net). National regulations might include the
     obligation for information providers to register at a national data
     protection authority. National law also contains specific provisions
     with regard to international criminal, private and administrative
     law (conflict of laws) which may provide solutions in certain
     circumstances.

  <LI> * Before connecting a local computer network - for example of a public
     authority - to the Internet the risks for the security of the local
     network and the data stored there have to be assessed in conformity
     with the national law. This may include drawing up a security plan
     and assessing whether it is necessary to connect the entire network
     or only parts of it to the Internet. Depending on the purpose it
     might even be sufficient to connect only a stand-alone system to the
     Net.

<LI>     Technical measures should be taken to secure that only the data
     which could be published can be accessed on the Internet for example
     by setting up a firewall system separating the local network from
     the Net. However, it should be noted that even if such technical
     steps have been taken connecting a computer network to the Internet
     means putting an additional risk to its security.

<LI>   * If personal data on users of a service are collected it must be
     clear to them who is to use the data and what are the purposes for
     which the data are to be used or disclosed. This means giving
     notification on the screen before disclosure and providing an
     opportunity to prevent disclosure. The user should be able to make a
     hardcopy of this notification and of any other terms and conditions
     set by the provider.

<LI>   * If access to personal data on a computer system is provided - for
     example by publishing biographical details of staff members in a
     directory - the information provider must make sure that those
     individuals understand the global nature of that access. The safe
     course is to publish the data only with the informed consent of the
     persons concerned.
</UL>
<P>There are also a number of international legal regulations and
conventions that apply inter alia to the Internet:</P>
<UL>
<LI>   * Recommendation with Guidelines on the protection of privacy and
     transborder flows of personal data
     adopted by the Council of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
     and Development (OECD) on 23 September 1980
<LI>   * Council of Europe Convention No. 108 for the protection of
     individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data
     adopted 28 January 1981
<LI>   * Guidelines for the regulation of computerized personal data files
     adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 14 December 1990
<LI>   * European Council 90/387/EEC of 28 June 1990 on the establishment of
     the internal market for telecommunications services through the
     implementation of Open Network Provision (ONP) and ensuing ONP
     Directives (defining data protection as "essential requirement")
 <LI>  * Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
     24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the
     processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data
     (EU-Data Protection-Directive)
<LI>   * General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) (stating in Article
     XIV that Member States are not prevented by this worldwide agreement
     to adopt or enforce regulations relating to the protection of
     privacy of individuals in relation to the processing and
     dissemination of personal data and the protection of confidentiality
     of individual records and accounts.
</UL>
<P>The EU-Directive as the first supra-national legal instrument does
contain an important new definition of "controller" which is relevant in
the Internet context. Article 2 lit. c) defines "controller" as the
natural and legal person, public authority, agency or any other body
which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of
the processing of personal data. Applying this definition to the use of
the Internet for purposes of electronic mail the sender of an electronic
message has to be considered to be the controller of this message when
sending a file of personal data for he determines the purposes and means
of the processing and transmission of those personal data. On the other
hand the provider of a mailbox service himself determines the purposes
and means of the processing of the personal data related to the operation
of the mailbox service and therefore he as "controller" has at least a
joint responsibility to follow the applicable rules of data protection.

<P>Although not legally binding and adopted on a national rather than an
international level the</P>
<UL>
 <LI>  * Principles for providing and using personal information "Privacy and
     the National Information Infrastructure" adopted by the Privacy
     Working Group of the Information Policy Committee within the United
     States Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) on 6 June 1995
should be mentioned in this context for they are bound to influence the
international data flows. They have been discussed intensively and
fruitfully with the International Working Group on Data Protection in
Telecommunications at the Joint Meeting in Washington, D.C. on 28 April
1995.
</UL>
<P>In practice some important and effective rules are being imposed by the
Net Community themselves by way of self-regulation (e.g. "Netiquette").
Such methods are not to be under-estimated as to the role they play and
might play in future in protecting the individual user's privacy. At
least they contribute to creating the necessary awareness among users
that confidentiality on the Net as a basic standard is non-existent
("Never send or keep anything in your mailbox that you would mind seeing
on the evening news.") The EU-Data Protection Directive in turn calls for
codes of conduct (Article 27) which should be encouraged by Member States
and the Commission.</P>

III. Guidance<BR>
<P>There can be no doubt that the legal and technical protection of Internet
users' privacy is at present insufficient.

<P>On the one hand the right of every individual to use the information
superhighway without being observed and identified should be guaranteed.
On the other hand there have to be limits (crash-barriers) with regard to
the use of personal data (e.g. of third persons) on the highway.

<P>There is a strong case to prohibit the use of the Internet for the
publication of search warrants by the police (the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigations has published a list of wanted suspects on the Net for
some time). The described deficiencies in the authentication procedure
and the easy manipulation of pictures in Cyberspace seem to prevent the
use of the Net for this purpose.

<P>A solution to this basic dilemma will have to be found on the following
levels:
<UL>
<P>a) Service providers should inform each potential user of the Net
unequivocally about the risks to his privacy. He will then have to
balance these risks against the expected benefits. The Internet is a
"beautiful wilderness with lions and snakes" (Waltraut Kotschy) but there
is little awareness among users what this means.

<P>b) As "elements of network infrastructure as well as participants each
have physical locations, states have the ability to impose and enforce a
certain degree of liability on networks and their participants" (Joel
Reidenberg). In many instances the decision to enter the Internet and how
to use it is subject to legal conditions under national data protection
law. Personal data may only be collected in a transparent way. Patients'
data and other sensitive personal data should only be communicated via
the Internet or be stored on computers linked to the Net if they are
encrypted.

<P>c) Several national governments are calling for international agreements
on the Global Information Infrastructure. The French Minister for
Information Technology has argued in favour of an international treaty
similar to the International Convention on the Law of the Sea; the German
Minister for Research and Technology has called for an initiative in the
framework of the G 7 -group. These initiatives are to be supported. An
international cooperation, even an international convention governing
data protection in the context of transborder networks and services
including an oversight mechanism is essential.

<P>d) National and international law should state unequivocally that the
process of communicating (e.g. via electronic mail) is also protected by
the secrecy of telecommunications and correspondence.

<P>e) Furthermore it is necessary to develop technical means to improve the
user's privacy on the Net. It is mandatory to develop design principles
for information and communications technology and multimedia hard- and
software which will enable the individual user to control and give him
feedback with regard to his personal data. In general users should have
the opportunity to access the Internet without having to reveal their
identity where personal data are not needed to provide a certain service.
Concepts for such measures have already been developed and published.
Examples are the "Identity Protector" concept included in
"Privacy-enhancing technologies: The path to anonymity" by the Dutch
Registratiekamer and The Information and Privacy Commissioner of
Ontario/Canada (presented at the 17th International Conference on Data
Protection in Copenhagen (1995) and the "User Agent-concept" as reported
on at the joint Washington meeting of the Working Group with the Privacy
Working Group of the IITF (April 1995).

<P>f) Technical means should also be used for the purpose of protecting
confidentiality.

<P>The use of secure encryption methods must become and remain a legitimate
option for any user of the Internet.

<P>The Working Group supports new developments of the Internet Protocol
(e.g. IP v6) which offer means to improve confidentiality by encryption,
classification of messages and better authentication procedures. The
software manufacturers should implement the new Internet Protocol
security standard in their products and providers should support the use
of these products as quickly as possible.

<P>g) The Working Group would endorse a study of the feasibility to set up a
new procedure of certification issuing "quality stamps" for providers and
products as to their privacy-friendliness. This could lead to an improved
transparency for users of the Information Superhighway.

<P>h) Finally it will be decisive to find out how self-regulation by way of
an expanded "Netiquette" and privacy-friendly technology might improve
the implementation of national and international regulations on privacy
protection. It will not suffice to rely on any one of these courses of
action: they will have to be combined effectively to arrive at a Global
Information Infrastructure that respects the human rights to privacy and
to unobserved communications.
</UL>
<P>The International Working Group on Data Protection in Telecommunications
will monitor the developments in this field closely, take into account
comments from the Net Community and develop further more detailed
proposals.

   ** So Much Fuss About A Bottle Of Ketchup

<P>  Hungarian police recently sent a fax around to the local Internet
  service providers (ISPs) asking them to provide lists of their users
  in Esztergom, a small town outside of Budapest. It seems somebody
  had planted a bomb in a bottle of ketchup. Since everyone knows you
  can download bomb-making instructions from the Internet, the police
  figured they should investigate the local users. No, I'm not making
  this up.

<P>  What's more, nearly every local ISP gave the police this information.
  Fortunately my company has no users in Esztergom and so that's what we
  told the police. We got off lucky. Believe me, as much as might want
  to make a stand for privacy of information my company is NOT eager to
  do battle with the Hungarian authorities.

 <P> But that's what it might take. Because if the Hungarian police really
  understood the Internet they could have asked for even more. For
  example, it would only take a few keystrokes to forward a users' mail
  to the authorities. The police might also have asked for old email,
  since many ISPs back this up routinely.

<P>  But that's not all. Some ISPs run caching servers, machines that store
  frequently-viewed webpages so that users access them locally rather
  than across the net. An ISP's caching server could give the police a
  profile of what web pages the users have been browsing.

 <P> I'm not trying to scare anyone. My point is that sharing information
  on the Internet is a two-way street. Computers keep extensive records.
  Using the Internet often means you leave a trail behind you. This is
  part of life in the digital age.

 <P> This "electronic trail" is not unique to the Internet. Every time you
  use a credit card you create a record in several computers. Other
  computers may be storing information about you such as your medical
  history, driving record, tax filings and so on. The more we rely on
  computers to manage our affairs, the more information that may be "out
  there." This means citizens in the digital age should know their
  rights.

<P> Many governments already have laws to protect private information. For
  example, the US has many laws restricting access to sensitive
  information such as medical and credit records. You might be surprised
  to know Hungary passed a law in 1991 to prevent misuse of information
  associated with the national identity card.

<P>  Yet the growth of new technologies is outpacing legislation. For
  example, Holland and other countries are experimenting with "smart
  road" systems that can identify the licence number of a moving car for
  purposes of toll collection. Cellular phones and satellite navigation
  systems can report the locations of their users. It's not difficult to
  imagine how these and other technologies could be abused.

<P>  Of course, now you know that even your local Internet provider has
  access to some rather sensitive information about you. This leads me
  to ask: what sort of service is your Internet provider actually
  offering?

 <P> When it comes down to it, your ISP is like your doctor, your lawyer,
  your accountant or your psychiatrist. Each of these professionals
  deals with your data; each profession is governed by a code of ethics,
  written or implicit. Moreover these limits are codified in law. If
  your accountant allowed your competitors to read the company books,
  you could take him to court.

<P>  Similarly, your Internet provider has an implicit duty to protect the
  privacy of your communication. Most professionals in my industry
  recognize this. I know most of the people working in Hungarian
  Internet and I doubt very much that they are reading your mail or
  mine. But they don't know where they stand in the eyes of the law.

 <P> Internet professionals should certainly assist the police in a
  legitimate investigation. But should every Internet user in Esztergom
  be investigated just because they could (theoretically) find
  bomb-making information on the Internet?

 <P> To hammer that point home a local Internet-based magazine has
  published, in Hungarian, complete bomb-making instructions:
  <http://www.idg.hu/internetto/cyber/special/dinamit.htm>. In other
  words, if you've read this far you may be the subject of a future
  investigation. Have a nice day!
</P>

<CENTER><b>GERMAN GOVERNMENT PUSHES BLOCKAGE OF NETHERLANDS WEB SITES.</CENTER>
</b>
       <P> At the behest of, and in response to legal threats from,
the German government, internet providers in Germany have blocked the
Dutch Web site Access For All (www.xs4all.nl), removing German users'
access to the entire xs4all system. The German government demanded
this action because xs4all hosts a Web "home page" with so-called
left-wing political content that, though fully legal in the
Netherlands, is allegedly illegal in Germany. (see:
http://www.anwalt.de/ictf/p960901e.htm). As a result of this action,
*all* xs4all web sites, including several thousand that have nothing
to do with the offending home page, are unavailable to readers in
Germany.
    <P>   Please send a letter of protest to the German ambassador in
your country, ask your foreign minister to protest officially to the
German government, and distribute this alert as widely as possible
online and to the press.

    <P>    Referring to article 19(2) of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political rights, which Germany ratified in 1973, we, the
undersigned organizations, consider this censorship an illegal act.
Additionally, the value of attempting to ban content the German
government finds offensive is highly questionable. The proper response
to offensive expression is more and better expression, and prosecution
of offending criminals, not censorship.

    <P>    As a result of the overly broad censorship measure which
targets an entire Internet access provider instead of a specific
user, all 3000 and more Web site hosted by xs4all are virtually
inaccessible in Germany. The loss of clients who market in Germany has
resulted in economic damage to xs4all. The immeasurable harm of
censoring thousands of other users for the speech of one is even
greater.
   <P>     Access for All, though it has expressed willingness to assist
the Dutch police in identifying online criminals abusing the xs4all
system, has a policy against censoring its clients.
   <P>     Mirroring this position, at least one German Net provider has
responded to the government demands with skepticism, pointing out that
their compliance with the censorship request may cause them to violate
contracts with their own German users, and that the government's
liability threats are tantamount to holding a phone company liable for
what users say on the telephone.

    <P>   Instead of the futile act of censorship that has simply
drawn increased attention to the offending material and resulted
in its widespread availability on other sites throughout the
world, the German government should have acted through legal
channels and asked the authorities in the Netherlands to cooperate in
determining what legal action, if any, was appropriate.

    <P>    We are concerned that German internet providers have
cooperated so easily with government censorship efforts. Some
level of cooperation was probably assured by underhanded and
rather questionable police threats of system operator liability
for user content, but we must urge more resistance on that part
of Net access providers to such online censorship schemes. As
with libraries, there are many who would censor, but there is a
responsibility on the part of providers of access to information, to
work to protect that access, else libraries, and Internet service
providers, lose the reason for their existence.

    <P>    We ask that the German government refrain from further
restrictive measures and intimidation of internet providers and
recognize the free, democratic, world wide communications
represented by the Internet.
 <P>All governments should recognize that the Internet is not
a local, or even national, medium, but a global medium in which
regional laws have little useful effect. "Top-down" censorship
efforts not only fail to prevent the distribution of material to
users in the local jurisdiction (material attacked in this manner can
simply be relocated to any other country), but constitutes a direct
assault on the rights and other interests of Internet users and
service providers in other jurisdictions, not subject to the
censorship law in question.

   <P>     For press contacts, and for more information about the
Internet, see the homepages for the signatories to this message:</P>

<b>Background</b><BR>

<P>The information revolution has given us all manner of wonderful things, but it has also created a monster - information warfare.  At its heart, information warfare is about people - as individuals and organizations.  It is about their objectives and priorities, and it is about their vulnerabilities and fears.    Within the context of information warfare, there are many different types of "weapons", many of them purely technological; but they do not provide all the answers for offense, and they do not provide even the primary answers for defense.  We need to look behind the technology, to understand clearly what are the vulnerabilities of potential enemies and what are our own vulnerabilities as well.  We need also to look at what we are actually prepared to do; to what degree are we willing to be other than "nice guys", and to what degree are we willing to give up aspects of our own freedom in the name of security.

<P>These questions and others like them belong under the heading of "ethics in information warfare".  But the notion of ethics - a set of moral principles - is not entirely static.  It changes as peoples' values and beliefs change.  For instance, following on from the Gulf War, the American people have come to expect wars to be "brief, bloodless bargains"; they are now very reluctant to see their sons and daughters brought home in body bags, even for the sake of the United States.  This is a very different ethos from that which we had during WWII, Korea and at the start of Vietnam.  Thus, as we think about the future of information warfare, we need to be aware of the social (values and beliefs) context in which information warfare, both offensive and defensive, will be played out.

<P>We need also to consider the future of US national security, and to realize that it is concerned with much broader issues than global tensions and conflicts and potential threats from somewhere "out there".  The future of US security is also a function of how we, as Americans, act (in all aspects of life, work, trade, education...) and how others react to us.  This interaction is made possible by instantaneous communication and other information.  While we have very limited direct control over what happens outside the US, we - as a society - do have control over what we ourselves do, the way we understand and deal with others, and the motivations we have.  In the foreseeable future we can be confident that there will continue be conflicts in different parts of the world; equivalents of the crises in Kuwait, the Balkans, Somalia, Haiti...etc; some of those conflicts may even include the use of nuclear weapons.  It seems to me that the most important thing is not to identify what conflicts will happen where and when, or even to develop contingency plans for appropriate responses.  These activities are important and they should certainly be pursued; but it is even more important to develop a vision and a set of the principles that will form the basis for our responses.  This is particularly true of the whole field of information warfare, for which little has been done so far.

<P>The next part of my paper will describe some models we have been using to understand changing values and beliefs.  The final part of the paper will focus on the implications of these changes for information warfare, and for the ethics associated with it.

>The bill, known as the "Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era

>encryption policy, and its passage by the Commerce Committee would signify

>
>The bill faces significant opposition from the Clinton Administration,

>AND SECURITY ON THE INTERNET. Please take a moment to contact the committee
>by following the simple instructions below.
>
>________________________________________________________________________
>WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW
>
>It's crucial that you call the Commerce committee members below and
>urge them to pass S.1726 out of committee without amendments.  (This is
>also known as a "clean" bill.)  Any opportunity for amendments (even if
>they are good) opens us up to the possibility of hostile amendments
>that could restrict the use of encryption even further than today's
>abysmal state.  It could even prohibit the use of encryption without
>Clipper Chip-like key 'escrow' technology, which includes built-in
>surveillance and monitoring functionality.
>
>1. Call/Fax the members of the Senate Commerce committee and urge

>BACKGROUND / WHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK
>
>For the past 3 years, Cyber-Rights Activists, citizens, and industry
>leaders have been working hard to reform US encryption policy.
>
>Support has been building behind several legislative proposals this
>year because they send a clear signal to the Administration about the
>need for security and privacy in the Information Age.  The digital
>revolution is currently being held hostage by the White House's Cold
>War restrictions on privacy-enhancing encryption technology.
>
>Now, with Congress less than a month away from adjournment, everyone
>who supports encryption and privacy is working to see this bill leave
>committee in order to send a clear message to the White House that they
>are on the wrong side of the encryption issue.  Although this bill may
>not become law this year, its passage out of committee will be a
>landmark event that will clearly tell the White House that the
>Congress, the public, and the computer industry care about security and
>privacy, and need strong, reliable encryption technology in order to
>make the Internet a viable platform for commerce, education, and
>democracy.
>
>Success for our side is not certain, and the next week is not without risks.
>On September 12th, the Senate Commerce committee will hold a "markup",
>where the bill is examined, voted on, and if there are enough votes,
>passed out of committee.  Two things could happen:
>
>	-the committee could pass the bill as written,
>	-the committee could pass the bill with amendments.
>
>Any amendments are not likely to be friendly, and in particular, quiet
>sources have told privacy activists that the Clinton Administration has been
>readying a legislative assault on your right to use encryption for several
>weeks now.  A Clipper-like amendment could be attached to the bill if
>our side does not have enough votes to block all amendments.
>
>It is crucial that all netizens who consider privacy and security important
>take a moment to call members of the Commerce Committee right now and
>urge them to vote S.1726 out of committee without amendments.
>
>________________________________________________________________________
>DESCRIPTION OF S.1726, PRO-CODE BILL
>
>Privacy-enhancing encryption technology is currently under heavy restrictions
>kept in place by the White House.  Encryption that is currently allowed to
>be exported is not sufficient to protect confidential information.  This
>policy acquires an "Alice-in-Wonderland" quality when one realizes that  
>strong encryption products are available abroad both for sale and for free
>download off the Internet.
>
>The Pro-CODE Act resolves to:
>
>1.  Allow for the *unrestricted* export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
>    encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy and
>    popular World Wide Web browsers.
>
>2.  Requires the Secretary of Commerce to allow the less restricted export
>    of other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
>    generally available outside the United States, roughly up to DES
>    strength.
>
>3.  Prohibits the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
>    encryption policies on the domestic market and limiting the authority
>    of the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.
>
>________________________________________________________________________
>CHRONOLOGY OF PRO-CRYPTO LEGISLATION
>
>9/12/96 (scheduled)
>Senate Commerce committee will hold markup of S.1726 and hopefully pass it
>out of committee with no amendments.
>
>7/25/96: Full Senate Commerce committee holds positive hearings on S.1726.
>FBI Director Louis Freeh testifies along with many cyber-luminaries.

>Leahy (D-VT), Murray (D-WA), Pressler (R-SD), and Wyden (D-OR).

PRIVACY Forum Digest<BR>      
Tuesday, 3 September 1996 Volume 05 : Issue 17<BR>
Date:    Tue, 3 Sep 1996 11:22:15 -0400 (EDT)<BR>
From:    Larry Hunter <hunter@intr.net><BR>
Subject: Lexis-Nexis personal information database<BR>
<P>
Lexis-Nexis sells a commercial database called "Ptrax" which holds detailed
personal information on nearly all Americans (L-N claims it contains 300
million names).  This database includes name, current address, up to two
previous addresses, phone number, birth-date, social security number,
mother's maiden name and possible other personal information.  This database
is kept quite current.  Through the Nexis Express service, this information
could be available to any individual with a credit card.</P>

<P>As most readers will are aware, such information could easily be used for
theft of identity and other frauds.  It is possible to have one's name
removed from this database by making a telephone request.  Call
(800)543-6862, select option 4 ("all other questions") and tell the
representative answering that you wish to remove your name from the Ptrax
database.  You may also send a fax to (513)865-7360, or physical mail to
LEXIS-NEXIS / P.O. Box 933 / Dayton, Ohio 45401-0933.  Sending physical mail
to confirm your name has been removed is always a good idea.</P>

<P>As word of the existence of this database has spread on the net, Lexis-Nexis
has been inundated with calls, and has set up a special set of operators to
handle the volume.  In addition, Andrew Bleh (rhymes with "Play") is a
manager responsible for this product, and is the person to whom complaints
about the service could be directed.  He can be reached at the above 800
number, selection option 4 and then ask for extension 3385.</P>

<P>The information in this note has been been confirmed by me, and was
originally provided in forwarded messages from Russell Whitaker, Jason
Werner, Vern Winters, Katherine Florman and Reuben Snipper.</P>

<P>You might be interested to know about a list that appears to be gaining in
credibility among Internet marketers, the DEMA (Direct Email marketing
Association) list.  I detest unsolicted commercial email but joined the list
just to keep tabs on what they're up to.

<P>Topics include such things as which newsgroup email-gathering software is
the best, how to make your unsolicted email targeted for the group so it's
more easily accepted, etc.

<P>I was mildly amused once that the moderator clipped a poster's sig file
because it exceeded the "6 lines dictated by netiquette"!  I emailed and
asked, "Is it ok to waste someone else's resources but not your own?".  He
wasn't amused, though.  Needless to say my comments didn't make it to the list.

DEMA postings are archived at <a href="http://kww.com/dema/">http://kww.com/dema/</a>.

Information Revolutions, National Security and Individual Consciousness: Changing Paradigms

<H2>Assertions/ Observations</H2>

<P>
Every Information Revolution has changed the world in dramatic
ways:
<P>
&#183; how people define themselves
<P>
&#183; definitions of gender 
<P>
&#183; the size and definition of what constitutes a family
<P>
&#183; the size of the political unit
<P>
&#183; what nation is the dominant nation
<P>
&#183; what constitutes National Security 
<P>
&#183; what people are willing to fight and die for.
<H3>Introduction: The Problem</H3>

<P>
We are experiencing what some have called a crisis of will and
others a loss of patriotism. War has become a spectator sport.
We need to ask basic questions. Instead we are pursuing a policy
of &quot;reaction to CNN&quot;. If we see poverty, boat people,
suffering we want to go in a fix it.  However, if we see Americans
being killed we want to pull out.
<P>
The nature of what constitutes a threat has changed.  We can be
brought to the bargaining table by floods of poverty stricken
refugees besieging Miami.  It happened with Haiti and again with
Cuba.  Any country that wants to bargain with the US can play
on our xenophobia by sending us boatloads of their sick and poor.
This is a complete reversal of the ordinary power equation. 
<P>
As individuals, we are feeling increasingly insecure. It is not
limited to Americans. More and more people are being challenged
by their contact with a global world at the same time as the divergence
between the haves and have nots increases. These things combine
to increase fears. Both rich and poor become more likely to listen
to, would be, demagogues who call for a return to the old ways;
to societies defined by ethnic and religious values. The rich
listen because they see the old values supporting stability and
therefore being good for business and the poor listen because
they feel cheated and frightened and see change as an abandonment
of the old ways. Both groups are looking for security and yet
supporting causes which increase instability.
<P>
All of these problems stem from the Information Revolution. Because
an information revolution creates a totally new world. A world
in which the old solutions don't fit. So we shrug our shoulders
and think nothing can be done.
<P>
If we stay in a &quot;do nothing&quot; state of helplessness it
will be dangerous for our country and for peaceful orderly society.
We need to understand the dynamics of an information based society.

<P>
We must leave the default position of letting CNN determine our
foreign policy.  We need to begin conversations that ask the basic
questions.  Questions like: What is national security in a global
information world?  What is a nation in a world where information
crosses boundaries instantaneously and the largest entity is a
trans national information entity - the Internet?  How can we
begin to address global problems including but not limited to
security (e.g. environmental problems) 
<P>
And, we must change the perceptual paradigms of much of the non-western
world. We wage an information war which will facilitate their
entrance into the global information world.  It is this task I
want to address here.
<H3>Individualism vs. Nationalism</H3>

<P>
People in the western world have a different notion of the importance
of individual than do people in other parts of the world.  That
notion of the individual has been the source of both our incredible
wealth and strength and is the reason we now have a &quot;crisis
or will&quot; - we perceive each individual as unique and are
unwilling to have them die.
<P>
For example, think about Scott O'Grady - American hero.  The story
of his ordeal and rescue have become an important part of American
heroic history.  Now, let us imagine for a moment, what we would
have felt if he was not rescued.  Then all the media attention
would have been focused on how his friends and family felt at
his loss. It difficult if not impossible for us to fight a war
with such an individualized focus.  We do not just see heroes
home and happy we also see body bags.
<P>
I assert that this focus on the individual, which has reached
it's culmination in our country today, has historical, traceable
roots.  If we understand the root causes and the dynamic through
which it operates we can use that knowledge as an offensive weapon
in an information war to change the perceptual space of the peoples
of the world. It is the only strategy to prevent tomorrow's Bosnias.
<H3>The Evolution of the Individual</H3>

<P>
The evolution of the individual is based on the separation of
the major information provider from the political power structure.
In the west this began with the fall of the Roman Empire.  It
uncoupled the church (the information provider) from the political
structure. The Church had the right of direct taxation - tithing.
 Tithing made it an advantage to the church for the laity to be
economically productive. Therefore it was to the church's advantage
to foster the development of technology and the spread of information.
 monasteries of the Middle Ages often functioned as agricultural
extension centers do today, to develop and spread information
about techniques and technologies to increase productivity.  
<P>
In contrast, the Eastern Church was closely allied with the Byzantine
Empire.  Its financial existence was dependent on the political
power structure.  It developed a Christianity which supported
mysticism, asceticism and submission to the will of God instead
of good works.  Therefore the Eastern Church did not spread knowledge
to the laity it kept as a trump card in its relationship with
the empire.
<H3>The Press</H3>

<P>
The most powerful entities of the late Middle Ages, in west, were
the cities of Italy and the Iberian peninsula who were in closest
contact with the major information provider - the Church. The
press ushered in a new information age and changed the economic,
political and social structure of the continent.
<P>
At first the same places, Rome and Spain were in the forefront
of the new information age.  They explored, made new maps, and
had an active information rich culture. However with the coming
of the Reformation the Church lost its religious and information
monopoly and, in the inquisition, suppressed information and information
technology.  The Western Catholic Church made alliances with the
political powers and became like the Church of the Byzantine Empire.

<P>
The Protestant countries, Holland and England did not suppress
information technology. They became print intensive cultures in
the same way as we are a TV intensive culture.  A literate crafts
producing class developed- people who had grown up in crafts shops
and then learned to read.  They were able to use written records
to keep track of raw material and finished goods.  It set them
free of the old style of family based production. They invented
the basic structure of capitalism. The power equation and every
institution of life changed: 
<P>
&#183; Holland and then England became the most powerful nations
in Europe. 
<P>
&#183; Production went from crafts production to family owned
capitalist production.  
<P>
&#183; Social mobility increased and the notion that social place
was related to wealth rather than on birth was introduced. 
<P>
&#183; The family had been the major social and economically productive
unit. It included the biological family, apprentices, journeymen
and hired help to the strictly biological family. It became second
in importance to the economically productive unit.  
<P>
&#183; Literacy became the mark of adulthood thus defining the
non-literate as non-adults. 
<P>
&#183; Women ceased to be active in production and became identified
solely with home and family. 
<P>
&#183; Young children who had been seen as small adults emerged
as an age class 
<P>
&#183; The military became professionalized instead of being based
on personal fealty.
<P>
&#183; The political unit want from the city state to the nation
state. 
<H3>The Electric Revolution</H3>

<P>
The electric revolution continued the evolution of the individual
and shifted power from state sized units to the super power sized
units - the UK, the US and the USSR. It started with the telegraph.
The telegraph suggested a new organizational structure; the constrained
bureaucratic hierarchy. 
<P>
Hierarchies were not new but they had been based on class.  The
military hierarchy shows the traces of pre-telegraph hierarchy;
every non-commissioned person salutes every commissioned officer;
and in the notion that an officer is a gentleman.
<P>
A sense of individual importance based on professional competency
developed as a result of the new bureaucratic hierarchy.  The
individual at the bottom of the class ladder could give orders
to those at the top at the class ladder by virtue of his profession.
 For example, a conductor could tell the president of the railroad,
or the mayor of his town, to get on board. 
<P>
The new bureaucratic hierarchy constrained the power of managers.
 They could only give orders to those directly below them in the
managerial hierarchy. 
<P>
The introduction of the telephone extended the electric information
revolution and shifted the balance of economic power from London
to New York.
<P>
The electric information revolution, like the press, changed all
the institutions to favor groups with the greatest penetration
of information and information technology:  
<P>
&#183; In the United States a new national political consciousness
emerged in the north, where there was intense telegraph penetration
and organizations managed by the new hierarchies. The south stayed
in the older paradigm of family run plantations and small businesses,
states rights, and class based social structure. 
<P>
&#183; The family changed from the extended family group to the
nuclear family.  
<P>
&#183; As more and more of women's traditional work was done by
factories and machines they became more restricted. Women tried
to become re-integrated into the life of the nation through suffrage
movements and social activism. 
<P>
&#183; Child labor laws and public schools again changed and extended
the nature of childhood. 
<P>
And, as with the press there were conservative reactions: the
Civil War, Victorian morality, the Know-nothings, religious fundamentalism,
and xenophobia which resulted in immigration quotas.
<H3>The Digital Revolution</H3>

<P>
We are now in the midst of another information revolution.  Clearly
we see similar changes:
<P>
&#183; The power equation has shifted to favor the most information
intensive culture. 
<P>
&#183; The family is again being reduced from children and the
biological parents to the child and the care taking parent.
<P>
&#183; Childhood is disappearing as children experience sex and
violence vicariously on TV and in their day to day lives.
<P>
&#183; Gender roles and definitions are changing
<P>
&#183; And the individual has emerged from the faceless masses
as we see Baby Jessica or Scott O'Grady rescued, Rodney King beaten,
or follow the Bobbitt case with horror or amusement. 
<P>
<U><B>Other things are less clear</B>:</U>
<P>
&#183; Bureaucracy and organizational hierarchy has become problematic
words. Organizations need restructuring but don't quite know how

<P>
&#183; Crime statistics tell us our cities are safer than they
have ever been but we feel more threatened
<P>
&#183; We see the necessity of global regulation at the same time
we want to reduce national regulation and though we are the only
&quot;super-power&quot; we feel more helpless than ever
<P>
&#183; We know that there seems to be a need for a more global
world at the same time as it becomes less stable
<H3>Leaving the Default Position</H3>

<P>
First we must recognize that the change in paradigm is irreversible.
 We cannot go back to identity based on ethnicity or on a simple
definition of nationalism any more than we can return to the small
farm or the family business.  We must instead wage a two front
information technology war to bring the rest of the world into
the information age.
<P>
&#183; We must accept that our current paradigm is based on electric
not electronic thinking and redefine what National Security means
in the information age, based on our insights from previous information
revolutions, <I>and</I>
<P>
&#183; We must wage a campaign to foster the emergence of the
individual.
<P>
The first can be done by beginning conversations, holding conferences
like this one and others and by continuing the conversations internationally
&quot;on-line&quot;
<P>
The fostering of the individual can be done by making sure that
information providers are not fettered, controlled by, or dependent
on the existing political power structure.  
<P>
The peoples of Eastern Europe have never lived in information
free cultures. They went from the Byzantine empire to various
other forms of political control of information.  The social system
has been based on class whether that class is based on birth,
membership in the communist party, or membership in a certain
ethnic or religious group. 
<P>
Because they have never lived in an information free culture they
have never had the opportunity to develop individual identity
or a social system based on competency and professionalism. 
<P>
We can make war on these perceptual systems by giving and demanding
as a requirement for aid (military or economic) that we be allowed
to blanket the area with modern information technology tied to
the world wide information super-structure. Connecting people
to an independent source of information will foster economic and
political development.  It will develop individual identity. And,
it will be cheaper, less invasive, and more effective than any
of the dams,  power plants, wells, or agricultural projects of
the past.

Subject: FC: Helsingius shuts down anon.penet.fi server in Finland<BR>
<BR>
<P>This is a sad day in the history of the Net. Hundreds of thousands of
people had accounts on Julf's pseudonmyous server and many netizens relied
on it daily to preserve their privacy online. (Unlike cypherpunk remailers,
it's not truly anonymous since Julf keeps records of what anon id maps to
what email address.) From Azeem's report and the press release below,
Julf's move seems to be in response to a Finnish court's preliminary
decision that the privacy remailers could be violated by court order --
something the Scientologists have been pushing.</P>

<P>Still, I'd be surprised if Julf's decision wasn't prompted in part by the
hideous London Observer article that falsely accused him of being a
middleman in the distribution of child porn -- check out a scan of the
Sunday cover at:  http://scallywag.com/</P>

<BR>
Hello all,<BR>
<BR>
<P>I just got off the phone with Johann Helsingius who runs the
anon.penet.fi anonymous e-mail service.</P>
<BR>
<P>1. He has decided to close the service.</P>

<P>2. This is not related to the article in The Observer. It is, in fact,
due to a decision of a lower Finnish court on petition from the Church
of Scientology. Penet went to court last week and made the decision
today. The implication of the decision is that e-mail over the Internet
is not protect by the usual Finnish privacy laws.</P>

<P>3. The server is currently down while Julf re-writes the software. Once
it runs again, it will be phased out for private use, but groups such as
the Samaritans and human rights agencies should be able to use it.</P>

<P>4. They are appealing against the decision.</P>

<P>5. Julf expects that revisions in Finnish law to provide a safe legal
status for anonymous remailers will be in place at the earliest in
Spring next year.</P>

<P>6. Once again: this is unrelated to The Observer's scandalous reporting.</P>

                                PRESS RELEASE<BR>
                                30.8.1996<BR>


<P>Johan Helsingius closes his Internet remailer</P>

<P>Johan Helsingius from Helsinki has decided to close his Internet
remailer. The so-called anonymous remailer is the most popular
remailer in the world, with over half a million users.</P>

<P>"I will close down the remailer for the time being because the legal
issues governing the whole Internet in Finland are yet undefined. The
legal protection of the users needs to be clarified. At the moment the
privacy of Internet messages is judicially unclear."</P>

<P>The idea of an anonymous remailer is to protect the confidentiality of it
users identity. The remailer itself does not store messages but serves as
a channel for message transmission. The remailer forwards messages
without the identity of the original sender.</P>

<P>Finland is one of the leading countries in Internet usage. Therefore all
decisions and changes made in Finland arouse wide international interest.</P>

<P>"I have developed and maintained the remailer in my free time for over
three years now. It has taken up a lot of time and energy. Internet has
changed a lot in these three years - now there are dozens of remailers in
the world, which offer similar services."</P>

<P>"I have also personally been a target because of the remailer for three
years. Unjustified accusations affect both my job and my private life"
says Johan Helsingius.</P>

<P>He surmises that the closing of the remailer will raise a lot of discussion
among the Internet community. "These remailers have made it possible
for people to discuss very sensitive matters, such as domestic violence,
school bullying or human rights issues anonymously and confidentially
on the Internet. To them the closing of the remailer is a serious problem",
says Helsingius.</P>

<P>Child porn claims proven false</P>

<P>Last Sundays issue of the English newspaper Observer claimed that the
remailer has been used for transmitting child pornography pictures. The
claims have been investigated by the Finnish police. Observers claims
have been found groundless.</P>

<P>Police sergeant Kaj Malmberg from the Helsinki Police Crime Squad is
specialized in investigating computer crimes. He confirms that already a
year ago Johan Helsingius restricted the operations of his remailer so that
it cannot transmit pictures.</P>

<P>"The true amount of child pornography in Internet is difficult to assess,
but one thing is clear: We have not found any cases where child porn
pictures were transmitted from Finland", Kaj Malmberg says.</P>

<P>Ground rules need to be clarified</P>

<P>There are several large network projects going on in Finland at the
moment, such as the TIVEKE project run by the Ministry of
Communications and the Information Society Forum project run by the
Ministry of Finance. Johan Helsingius is participating the work of these
projects. Projects assess the political and social issues of networks and
the impact of these issues in the long run. These projects also need the
support of daily, practical work to help short-term decision-making.</P>

<P>Johan Helsingius is now taking an initiative in the development of the
daily network rules. He wants to set up a task force to discuss the
practical problems related to ethical and civil rights issues in connection
with the Internet.</P>

<P>"I will try to set up a task force which will include Internet
experts together with representatives of civic organizations and
authorities. The task force could take a stand on issues such as the
networks practical operation methods and the misuse of the network. I
hope that the results of this task force will support the development of
the network", he says.</P>

<P>The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides partial funding for 
several international telecommunications links which carry Internet 
traffic in support of the requirements of the U.S. research and 
education community. Recently, NSF network program personnel placed a 
temporary restriction on using these links to route Internet traffic 
to and from Iran. Upon review of this action, the NSF Division of Networking
and Communications Research and Infrastructure has removed this restriction.</P>

Subject: Re: Blocking Internet to Iran<BR>
<BR>
<P>The following posting from soc.culture.iranian (dated 8/27/96) may
be of interest to readers of this group/list.  It actually consists
of two messages--a commentary from one individual preceding a
description of the apparent decision to cut internet access to Iran.
I pass it on without editorial comment, as I've just learned of it
and don't know the background or details...           DZO</P>

<P>Today we were informed that the Internet US connection to Iran
through the Vienna University was disconnected by a strike of
a pen. This is a serious matter. We hear all the time about
how the Internet is creating more space for the individuals and
how at the end it increases the power of the individuals in
a society. We hear how the Internet is supposed to enhance
the democracy's voice in the countries that the information flow is
controlled. Until now we thought that the clergy is not
upgrading the bottleneck 9600 baud connection in Vienna in order
to control the information and we were sad about it. But
then what the Americans do ? They disconnect this small
flow !!! Are they in harmony with the most reactionary forces in Iran
which don't want any dialogue between the Iranian expatriates and
the Iranians inside Iran ? Do they want to close the window
to the outside on the Iranian people in order to create a cage
mentality there ? It seems so !! Otherwise why should
they do such a thing exactly when they are increasing the VOA
sendings over Iran through Kuwait ? It means that they
don't want the dialogue between Iranians inside and outside
Iran to continue but they want to have a control over
the propaganda line !! This is not only a sad story about
controlling information but also attacking the rights of the
Iranian community in US !! Tomorrow they may cut the telephone
lines !! These actions limit the communication
between Iranians inside and outside Iran and takes away
the option to have a dialogue open with the people of Iran
by the Iranian expatriate community. Not long ago Time magazine
had an article on the Internet in Iran and how it is
transforming the face of the country and revolutionizing
the human intercommunication. It said give the Internet 5
years and it'll revolutionize the country (in a positive
sense.) It is the power of the Information Technology which
gives the individual more leverage. This right today
has been restricted by a vicious or a thoughtless action, at
the same time that the right of the Iranian community to
write and receive mail from their families in not a distant
future has been taken away from them. I ask the Iranian
community in the US to show unity and protest against
these kinds of capricious policies which limit the prospect of
democracy, ristrict the rights of the individuals and take away your
rights. Whether as an individual or as an organization you should
let your dismay to be heard. Tomorrow more of your rights can be
in danger !!!</P>

<P>Due to U.S. Government decisions (embargo), we were ordered recently by the
U.S. National Science Foundation (Steve Goldstein) to cease providing
connectivity for Iran on our infrastructure to, and transitting the NSF
supported infastructure in, the USA.</P>

<P>So, to summarize, it is no longer possible to access networks in Iran,
which are connected to and by Ebone, (from most of?) the US part of the
Internet.</P>

<P>As an aside, we do no longer expect an upgrade for the connection from
Tehran to our site, although it wouldn't make a difference for you anyway.</P>

<h4>Part 1</H4>

I've been following the concepts of digital cash and encryption since I read the article in the August 1992 issue of Scientific American on"encrypted signatures."  While I've only followed the Digitaliberty area for a few weeks, I can already see a number of points that do (and should!) strongly concern the average savvy individual:<P>

1.  How can we translate the freedom afforded by the Internet to ordinary life?<P>

2.  How can we keep the government from banning encryption, digital cash, and other systems that will improve our freedom?<P>

A few months ago, I had a truly and quite literally "revolutionary" idea, and I jokingly called it "Assassination Politics":  I speculated on the question of whether an organization could be set up to legally announce that it would be awarding a cash prize to somebody who correctly "predicted" the death of one of a list of violators of rights, usually either government employees, officeholders, or appointees.  It could ask for anonymous contributions from the public, and individuals would be able send those contributions using digital cash.<P>

I also speculated that using modern methods of public-key encryption and anonymous "digital cash," it would be possible to make such awards in such a way so that nobody knows who is getting awarded the money, only that the award is being given.  Even the organization itself would have no information that could help the authorities find the person responsible for the prediction, let alone the one who caused the death.<P>

It was not my intention to provide such a "tough nut to crack" by arguing the general case, claiming that a person who hires a hit man is not guilty of murder under libertarian principles.  Obviously, the problem with the general case is that the victim may be totally innocent under libertarian principles, which would make the killing a crime, leading to the question of whether the person offering the money was himself guilty.<P>

On the contrary; my speculation assumed that the "victim" is a government employee, presumably one who is not merely taking a paycheck of stolen tax dollars, but also is guilty of extra violations of rights beyond this.  (Government agents responsible for the Ruby Ridge incident and Waco come to mind.)  In receiving such money and in his various acts, he violates the "Non-aggression Principle" (NAP) and thus, presumably, any acts against him are not the initiation of force under libertarian principles.<P>

The organization set up to manage such a system could, presumably, make up a list of people who had seriously violated the NAP, but who would not see justice in our courts due to the fact that their actions were done at the behest of the government.  Associated with each name would be a dollar figure, the total amount of money the organization has received as a contribution, which is the amount they would give for correctly "predicting" the person's death, presumably naming the exact date.  "Guessers" would formulate their "guess" into a file, encrypt it with the organization's public key, then transmit it to the organization, possibly using methods as untraceable as putting a floppy disk in an envelope and tossing it into a mailbox, but more likely either a cascade of encrypted anonymous remailers, or possibly public-access Internet locations, such as terminals at a local library, etc.<P>

In order to prevent such a system from becoming simply a random unpaid lottery, in which people can randomly guess a name and date (hoping that lightning would strike, as it occasionally does), it would be necessary to deter such random guessing by requiring the "guessers" to include with their "guess" encrypted and untraceable "digital cash," in an amount sufficiently high to make random guessing impractical.<P>

For example, if the target was, say, 50 years old and had a life expectancy of 30 years, or about 10,000 days, the amount of money required to register a guess must be at least 1/10,000th of the amount of the award.  In practice, the amount required should be far higher, perhaps as much as 1/1000 of the amount, since you can assume that anybody making a guess would feel sufficiently confident of that guess to risk 1/1000th of his potential reward.<P>

The digital cash would be placed inside the outer "encryption envelope," and could be decrypted using the organization's public key.  The prediction itself (including name and date) would be itself in another encryption envelope inside the first one, but it would be encrypted using a key that is only known to the predictor himself.  In this way, the organization could decrypt the outer envelope and find the digital cash, but they would have no idea what is being predicted in the innermost envelope, either the name or the date.<P>

If, later, the "prediction" came true, the predictor would presumably send yet another encrypted "envelope" to the organization, containing the decryption key for the previous "prediction" envelope, plus a public key (despite its name, to be used only once!) to be used for encryption of digital cash used as payment for the award.  The organization would apply the decryption key to the prediction envelope, discover that it works, then notice that the prediction included was fulfilled on the date stated.  The predictor would be, therefore, entitled to the award. Nevertheless, even then nobody would actually know WHO he is!<P>

It doesn't even know if the predictor had anything to do with the outcome of the prediction.  If it received these files in the mail, in physical envelopes which had no return address, it would have burned the envelopes before it studied their contents.  The result is that even the active cooperation of the organization could not possibly help anyone, including the police, to locate the predictor.<P>

Also included within this "prediction-fulfilled" encryption envelope would be unsigned (not-yet-valid) "digital cash," which would then be blindly signed by the organization's bank and subsequently encrypted using the public key included.  (The public key could also be publicized, to allow members of the public to securely send their comments and, possibly, further grateful remuneration to the predictor, securely.) The resulting encrypted file could be published openly on the Internet, and it could then be decrypted by only one entity:  The person who had made that original, accurate prediction.  The result is that the recipient would be absolutely untraceable.<P>

The digital cash is then processed by the recipient by "unbinding" it, a principle which is explained in far greater detail by the article in the August 1992 issue of Scientific American.  The resulting digital cash is absolutely untraceable to its source.<P>

This overall system achieves a number of goals.  First, it totally hides the identity of the predictor to the organization, which makes it unnecessary for any potential predictor to "trust" them to not reveal his name or location.  Second, it allows the predictor to make his prediction without revealing the actual contents of that prediction until later, when he chooses to, assuring him that his "target" cannot possibly get early warning of his intent (and "failed" predictions need never be revealed).  In fact, he needs never reveal his prediction unless he wants the award.  Third, it allows the predictor to anonymously grant his award to anyone else he chooses, since he may give this digital cash to anyone without fear that it will be traced.<P>

For the organization, this system also provides a number of advantages .By hiding the identity of the predictor from even it, the organization cannot be forced to reveal it, in either civil or criminal court.  This should also shield the organization from liability, since it will not know the contents of any "prediction" until after it comes true.  (Even so, the organization would be deliberately kept "poor" so that it would be judgment-proof.)  Since presumably most of the laws the organization might be accused of violating would require that the violator have specific or prior knowledge, keeping itself ignorant of as many facts as possible, for as long as possible, would presumably make it very difficult to prosecute.<P>

<p>You never think it's going to happen to you.  Well, my friends, it does.</p>
<p>Over the last few years I have written about a number of security relevant events which I have run into on a personal basis:</p>
<UL>
<LI>Captured "Most Wanted" cyber-felon Kevin Mitnick adapted my electronic identity to do his thing on an antique WELL account of mine. <BR>
<LI>My warhero cousin, Bill Wells, was victimized for tens of thousands of dollars by high tech thieves who adapted his identity, got credit, credit cards, bought cars and so on . . . all in his name.  The pressure finally killed him.<BR>
<LI> My wife is inundated with letters from bottom sucking lawyers in search of mauled clients after she is in a traffic accident: the next day!<BR>
<LI>My bank tellers yell out secret access codes across the lobby.<BR>
<LI>My supermarket clerks write down and openly share passcodes to the store's computers.<BR>
<LI> A local cop accesses the NCIC computers from his patrol car and then proceeds to show me how to do it step by step  . . . including his passwords.  (I pretended to be a know-nothing guy with an interest in computers.)<BR>
</UL>
<p>But in the last several weeks, the rules changed and I have been the targeted victim of, ah, how shall I call them, criminal hackers (to use Mich Kabay's clear distinction).</p>
<p>As most readers of my books and work know, I am not inherently against hacking: in fact I tend to agree with Robert Steele of OSS that hackers are a valuable commodity to the US, especially in a defensive mode. I believe that we need their skills and knowledge to work our way safely into Cyberspace, and if the recent Mitnick busts are any example, the FBI agrees at least somewhat. </p>
<p>So it came as quite a surprise to me when the first warning came.</p>
<p>"They're out to get you," I was told by an underground source. I was in-between planes and was checking in to see what was new.</p>
<p>"Who is and why?"</p>
<p>I won't give out the names in public (libel and all that) but I have passed them on to the FBI.  "They don't like you for what you write about them."</p>
<p>Huh?  I've never really trashed 'dissed' on hackers: I tell 'em just keep it all legal - that has been my credo.  So why come after me?  There was no real answer so I sort of forgot about it.  </p>
<p>That Friday night it started.  A couple of harassing calls.  A call from a group of hackers who passed on private information about Time writer Josh Quittner who himself had been the victim of hackers because of his book.  So, was the warning accurate? </p>
<p>Then I received a sheath of documents which included GTE security information, "find the hacker" source code from programs GTE supposedly uses to track them down, access codes, network diagrams and print outs from the service address utility listing me and my neighbors phones and other pertinent information.</p>
<p>And a couple more harassing calls.</p>
<p>Then, my toll records were pulled.  Many people with whom I speak want their names and numbers kept secret for their own reasons, and they have phones connected every which way to avoid detection or eavesdropping.</p>
<p>I received an angry call from one such person.  "You're on my s___ list."  Huh?  "Who'd you give my number to?"  No one,  no one.  "Well, these guys found me and they said they have your toll records."  </p>
<p>Toll records are a list of the long distance calls you make - like the monthly bill that lists where you have called.  If someone gets a hold of that list, they then have access to the numbers that are supposedly private.  In this case, the privacy was gone and I had some upset friends.</p>
<p>I first contacted GTE.  Or tried to.  I explained what was happening and asked for the security folks.  The operators were reluctant to give me any numbers and tried to get me to tell them what was happening.  No, no.  Please, just give me the number for security.  Battle, battle, and I finally got it.</p>
<p>I explained what I though was happening, and said that I had records from their system which means someone had indeed broken in.  "No, can't be.  We're secure."  Right. Besides, we don't have any toll records here. Call your carrier.</p>
<p>I use a billing service, for my long distance carrier, (no names please) and called them.  "You have to talk to us.  We won't let you talk directly with your provider."  Right.  A couple of phone calls later and I reached the carrier and told them what was happening. "Can't be us. We're secure."</p>
<p>This was getting old fast.</p>
<p>Now, think of this for a minute.  I supposedly know what I'm doing  :-)  and I know who to call, and how to explain it and so on, yet look at the runaround.  What happens to Ozzie and Harriet from Peoria when they call about security problems and don't understand it or can't explain it?  Think what they must go through!</p>
<p>Since I could prove nothing other than the GTE documents I had in hand, I had a choice of pushing the carrier hard or letting it drop.  </p>
<p>Finally I got a hold of some people at my LD carrier who knew what they were doing and we put a couple of systems in place to avoid future social engineering and hacks against the switch.  But GTE?  Nada. Nothing. </p>
<p>If you run into trouble like this, you can try your local phone company, but I wholeheartedly suggest that you contact your local FBI office and make a report.  They are getting better and better at this and will take action.  Good luck.</p>

<p>The Michie Company Introduces Data Privacy Law: A Study of United States Data Protection by  Paul M. Schwartz and Joel R. Reidenberg</p>
<p>Data Privacy Law: A Study of United States Data Protection is the first book to analyze comprehensively U.S. fair information practices law as it pertains to data protection issues in both the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Data Privacy Law was underwritten by the European Commission in preparation for the issuance of its Directive 95/46/EC (October 24, 1995) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.   The book compares coherently the fair information practices of the United States with principles common to divergent legal systems.</p>
<p>Data Privacy Law has important practical applications and will help companies that employ transborder telecommunications, conduct interjurisdictional financial transactions, or advertise across borders to define their own data protection strategies to ensure that expectations of fair information practices are met.  The book will assist lawyers, government regulators and scholars to understand data</p>
<p>flows in both the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Author Paul M. Schwartz, Professor of Law at the University of Arkansas School of Law (Fayetteville), has been a guest professor at the University of Nantes, a Fulbright Senior Lecturer at the Goethe University?s Research Center for Data Protection, and a Research Fellow of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and of the Harry Guggenheim Foundation.  He has provided advice and testimony to governmental bodies in the United States and Europe. At present, he serves as Special Advisor to a study of health care applications of the National Information Infrastructure carried out by the National Academy of Science's National Research Council. </p>
<p>Author Joel R. Reidenberg is Associate Professor of Law at Fordham University School of Law.  He serves as chair of the Section on Computers and Law of the Association of American Law Schools and is a Fellow of the Cyberspace Law Institute.  Formerly, he practiced in the Washington, D.C. office of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, where he worked with the international telecommunications group on European telecommunications liberalization and competition law issues, data</p>
<p>protection regulation, and intellectual property issues.  Professor Reidenberg served as an advisor to the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment and has testified on information privacy before various government bodies.</p>
<p>Both authors have written and lectured extensively on privacy and information technology law.</p>
<p>Priced at $90.00, this book will be a welcome resource for policy makers, legal practitioners and scholars grappling with data protection issues.</p>
<p>Michie is a part of LEXIS*-NEXIS* and publishes annotated state codes for 31 states and the District of Columbia, more than 700 titles covering national and state law topics, the Michie?s Law on Disc CD-ROM research system for 36 states, and a growing number of ?practice? CD-ROM titles.  A division of Reed Elsevier, Inc., and a member of the Reed Elsevier plc group, one of the world?s leading publishing and information businesses, Michie combines almost two centuries of traditional legal publishing with leading-edge information technology.</p>

<p>Hi there all,</P>

<P>I heard an amazing news report on the radio today, that confirmed
what I've heard and suspected for a long time - all international
communications *are* continually being monitored!!</P>

<P>The report was on "The World at One" news report on BBC Radio 4 -
about as respected, reliable and informative a source as any
mainstream media is ever likely to be. The feature spoke about a
book that's come out in New Zealand called "Secret Power" by Nicky
Hager, that has been endorsed by the former (?) Prime Minister of New
Zealand himself. It supposedly goes into great detail about an
international agreement called "Echelon" of which the US, UK,
France, New Zealand, Australia and several other nations are all
participants. According to Nicky Hager - who was interviewed on the
program - a system of monitoring stations have been set up in various
countries in the world that continually monitor ALL fax, email,
telephone and satellite communications etc, "sniffing" for keywords
using super computers. When these key words are identified the
information is automatically logged and according to Hager, sent
directly to the US intelligence services.</P>

<P>Now whilst many of us have undoubtedly come across this sort of
information before and undoubtedly many of us have probably scoffed
at such ascertions as merely impossible and blatantly paranoid,
something very significant sets this report apart. Before the book
was published, Hager went with his manuscript to the New Zealand
Prime Minister who had been responsible for signing NZ up to the
agreement (I got the impression that he is no longer in power). 
Anyway, the PM was so shocked by the revelations that the book 
contained, that he has written the forward to the book. Supposedly he 
says that he had no idea of the true nature of the agreement and the 
powers which it bestowed on the intelligence services and is 
obviously trying to distance himself from the storm that's beginning 
to brew up about it. Maybe he's just covering his arse or maybe he 
was just another puppet head of government who wasn't properly 
informed about what was really taking place in his own country, but 
either way, the fact that he has got involved with the book adds 
considerable credibility to it's claims. Those of you who have often 
said that such wide-scale monitoring is "obviously impossible" might 
be wise to re-evaluate your positions!</P>

<P>Anyway, there was no further report on the BBC Radio 4 evening news 
and nothing about it on TV, so maybe that's all we're hear about it 
over here in the UK - and maybe even less for you lot in the good old 
US of A. The book isn't in print over here, so needless to say, I'll 
be contacting a book seller over in New Zealand to see if I can get 
myself a copy and I'll keep you informed. If anyone out there in NZ could 
give me a phone number of a sizeable book shop over there, I'd really 
appreciate it and if anyone else has any info on this, please pass it 
on.</P>

<P>I wonder if "Secret Power" is now on their keyword list?  If it is 
then - "Hi there big bro'. I hope you're all having a nice day!"</P>

<P>Take care out there,</P>
</P>      See ya</P>

<P>          Mat </P>

 <P>           G7 THREAT TO ONLINE FREE SPEECH AND PRIVACY</P>

<P>      IN THE NAME OF COMBATING TERRORISM THE G7 IS PLANNING TO </P>
<P>     CURB THE FREE SPEECH RIGHTS AND PRIVACY OF INTERNET USERS</P>

<P>                           7 AUGUST 1996</P>

<P>   PLEASE REDISTRIBUTE THIS DOCUMENT WIDELY WITH THIS BANNER INTACT</P>
 <P>REDISTRIBUTE ONLY IN APPROPRIATE PLACES & ONLY UNTIL 30 SEPTEMBER 96</P>
<HR>
<P>IN THIS ALERT:</P>
<P>  Summary</P>
 <P> Background</P>
 <P> What You Can Do</P>
  <P>Where Can I Learn More?</P>
<P> Organisations</P>

<HR>

<P>On July 30th the G7 group of nations met in Paris to discuss terrorism.
Among other responses the G7 have endorsed a number of restrictions and
controls on the Internet.  These include the prohibition or censorship
of sources that may contain "dangerous" information, restrictions on
the electronic speech of unpopular political organisations, and the
imposition of "key escrow" or other means of allowing governments to
violate privately encrypted correspondence.</P>

<P>This particularly serious threat, which originates from recent events
such as a bombing at the Atlanta Olympics and the crash of TWA Flight
800, is another case in a long list of attempts to restrict freedom of
speech in electronic networks, of which there are alarming examples in
many countries including Australia, Belgium, China, France, Germany,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the USA and Vietnam, under a variety of
pretexts ranging from "pornography" to "terrorism" and incorrect
political opinion.</P>

<P>* The "offensive" material being targeted is no different from similar
material available in libraries and bookshops.  *What is legal offline
must also be legal online*.  If material cannot be censored at the
newsstand or the university library, it must not be censored in the
online newsstands and libraries of our future.</P>

<P>* Legislators and agency officials are pushing for speedy passage of
censorious and privacy-harming laws, capitalising on fear of terrorism
to exclude meaningful public input in the process and substance of
these regulations.</P>

<P>* Because the Internet is global, and every culture has its own rules
about what is and is not permissible, the open nature of the Internet
must be protected.  No local jurisdiction should be allowed to impose
its rules on the rest of the world.</P>

<HR>
<P>BACKGROUND</P>

<P>This alert is being issued by a coalition of online civil liberties
organisations that support online privacy, freedom of speech and human
rights.  The organisations are listed at the end of this alert along
with contact details.</P>

<P>Since its inception the Internet has more than doubled in size every
year.  If this growth continues, more than one billion people will be
using the Internet by the turn of the century.  Each of these users can
as easily publish material as they can read it.  The Internet has the
potential vastly to improve the workings of democratic government and
to spread liberty across the globe.</P>

<P>In light of recent bombings in the US and elsewhere, there are again
calls to ban from the Internet information on explosives, as well as
any other issues that can be related to "terrorism".  Anti-terrorist
hysteria has become the excuse for governmental attempts to circumvent
online freedom of expression, guaranteed by constitutions, laws, and
the UN Declaration of Human Rights.</P>

<P>Information on how to make bombs, as well as other things that would be
"banned", is widely available, often from the very governments pushing
for censorship.  Banning such publications from the Internet won't
make it any less widely available.  However it could become the tool
for the censorship of any debate or opinion which happens to displease
the authorities, or "pressure groups" that do not share those opinions.
This is a pure and simple violation of free speech, no matter how it
is disguised.</P>

<P>Currently, communicating via the Internet is like sending messages on
postcards.  Anyone between the sender and receiver can read the
message.  Encryption (data scrambling) technology can be used to ensure
the privacy of communications.  It's like placing  messages in
envelopes.  Although widely available the technology has not yet become
a part of the Internet because of pressures from the "intelligence" and
law enforcement agencies.</P>  

<P>Some countries, such as the United States, treat cryptography as if
were a weapon, like missile or a machine gun, and ban its export. 
Other countries, such as France, have an outright ban on cryptography. 
Such policies threaten to undermine information infrastructure not only
locally, but globally, leaving computer networks open to industrial
espionage, and as we are seeing in recent news of electronic spying on
the European Parliament, even governmental espionage, as well as
criminal exploitation.</P>

<P>What the G7 have called for is a way to read all messages sent by
terrorists.  The only way they can achieve this is to have some way of
reading messages sent by anyone.  What the G7 are demanding is that the
privacy of all communications be compromised in the name of protection
from terrorism.  However, no real terrorist is going to use such a
compromised system when uncrackable alternatives already exist and are
freely available.  Effectively G7 are demanding that we all compromise
the privacy of our communications - for NO benefit.</P>

<HR>
<P>WHAT YOU CAN DO</P>

<UL>1. Be alert to what your government is doing or planning.  Contact your
   law-makers and urge them to protect privacy and free speech on the
   Internet.  Write to or call publications in your area and suggest
   that they report on any anti-freedom government action you hear
   about.</UL>

<UL>2. Join an online civil liberties organisation.  See the end of this 
   release for contact information for several such organisations.</UL>

<UL>3. If there isn't an online civil liberties organisation in your
   country, why not start one?   Some suggestions on how to start an
   online civil liberties organisation are available at:</UL>

 <P>   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As credit card companies, credit bureaus and
government regulators debated ways to combat identity fraud, John
A. Smith was there to remind them of its consequences.</P>
 <P>  "It has taken me a year to correct most of my credit," said
Smith, whom the Federal Trade Commission flew into Washington from
Bakersfield, Calif., for a conference Tuesday on the increasingly
popular scam.</P>
   <P>Smith reported on the nightmare he lived as he tried to clear
his credit report after someone used his name, Social Security
number and credit history to obtain fraudulent credit cards.</P>
  <P> "I was treated like a suspect rather than a co-victim," he
said.</P>
  <P> The FTC hoped its conference Tuesday would help generate some
solutions to the growing problem, which costs banks and stores when
bills aren't paid and costs consumers time and aggravation trying
to clean up the mess.</P>
   <P>Suggestions ranged from encouraging consumers to check their
credit reports each year to developing expensive fingerprinting
systems to check identities. The FTC planned to form a working
group from the more than 60 participants to continue the
discussion.</P>
   <P>"I think it's fair to say that identity fraud goes to the very
heart of the issue of personal privacy. It involves the theft, the
misuse, the destruction of an individual's good name and
reputation," said FTC Commissioner Janet Steiger. "The case
studies we see are, frankly, frightening."</P>
   <P>While there were many ideas for combating the problem, most came
from people who didn't actually have to carry them out. And many
participants poked holes in the suggestions that applied to their
own industries.</P>
   <P>Among the suggestions for companies:</P>
  <UL> --Do not issue a credit report unless a consumer authorizes it.</UL>
   <UL>--Notify consumers when their credit reports are accessed.</UL>
   <UL>--Ask consumers for identification when they use credit cards.</UL>
   <UL>--Develop better computer programs that identify possibly
fraudulent applications.</UL>
   <UL>--Create a standard form for consumers to report credit fraud.</UL>
   <UL>--Have credit bureaus take victims' credit histories out of their
electronic systems, forcing issuers to examine an application
individually to check its validity.</UL>
   <UL>--Develop sophisticated systems that identify consumers by an
inkless fingerprint.</UL>
   <P>Most ideas mentioned had detractors.</P>
   <P>The fingerprint is a good idea, but how do you build an initial
database of prints? Joel S. Lisker, senior vice president for
security and risk management for MasterCard International, asked.</P>
   <P>Asking for identification during a sale could upset legitimate
customers, said Marianne Birarelli, regional fraud director for
Sears Roebuck and Co.</P>
   <P>"Sometimes you want to make sure you're not inconveniencing
everybody else," she said. "A lot of customers aren't pleased or
are embarrassed if they're asked to show ID."</P>
   <P>Most of the suggestions would cause expense for someone in the
industry. Reaching an agreement will not be easy, said David
Medine, who ran the conference for the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection.</P>
   <P>But companies will do it because it's in their financial
interest, he predicted.</P>
   <P>"They suffer huge (fraud) losses," he said. "It's costing
them money to not address these issues."</P>
   <P>Meanwhile, the FTC is planning a consumer education campaign.
Tips for consumers include the following:</P>
   <UL>--Minimize the amount of personal information a thief can steal.
Don't carry extra credit cards, a Social Security card, birth
certificate or passport in your purse or wallet.</UL>
   <UL>--Keep a list of all credit cards, account numbers and expiration
dates so you can quickly contact creditors if they are stolen.</UL>
   <UL>--Never give a credit card number or personal information over
the phone unless you made the call.</UL>
   <UL>--Check your credit report for accuracy once a year from each of
the three credit bureaus: Equifax, Trans Union and Experian
(formerly TRW).</UL>
   <UL>--Do not print your Social Security number on your checks or give
it out unless necessary.</UL>

US Soldier Accused of "Cracking" for foreign power.
</H2>
</Center>
<P>FORT BRAGG, N.C., Aug. 21 (UPI) -- The army has charged a Fort Bragg
soldier with breaking into a military computer system and giving secret
materials to another country, a published report said Wednesday.</P>
   <P>According to military documents, Pfc. Eric O. Jenott, 20, distributed
"secret computer passwords relating to the national defense," an offense
which amounts to spying, the Fayetteville, N.C., Observer-Times said.</P>
   <P>Jenott's attorney said his client is not a spy and did not intend to
hurt the United States.</P>
   <P>"He is not a criminal, just a computer hacker who happened to access
a very important and expensive, supposedly impenetrable system," Timothy
Dunn said.</P>
   <P>The army considers many details of the case classified, Dunn said.
The report did not name which country may have been involved.</P>
   <P>Jenott, of Seattle, was charged with espionage, damaging military
property, larceny and breaking into government computer systems, the
newspaper said.</P>
   <P>He has been jailed since June 26 at Camp Lejeune Marine Base and
could be sentenced to life in a military prison if convicted at a court-
martial.</P>
   <P>Fort Bragg officials said the case was under investigation and
declined to comment.</P>
  <P> In Graham, Wash., Jenott's father, John, said his son discovered an
apparent security weakness in a military communications system several
months ago, but he claimed superiors paid little attention.</P>
  <P> Later, one of his superiors appeared to be pleased Jenott discovered
the problem, his father said.</P>
   <P>Jenott was surprised when he was arrested and accused of compromising
the communications system by accessing it, according to his father.</P>
   <P>"He said, 'I'd rather face the death penalty than confess to
something I didn't do,'" Jenott's father said.</P>
   <P>Prosecutors have decided not to pursue the death penalty, the
newspaper said.</P>
  <P> Jenott is a communication switch operator in Company B, 50th Signal
Battalion, 35th Signal Brigade.</P>
  <P> A military court is scheduled decide next month whether Jenott must
continue living behind bars.</P>

Hackers Open Letter</H2>
<BR>
        <P>this is an open letter to the internet community</P>
 
        <p>this will dispel many rumors about why a paticular mail bombing
        occured in recent months.  i will not discuss each one that we
        bombed but i will discuss some of them.</p>
 
        <p>this letter is dedicated to PED who couldn't even get a
        simple article on mail bombs right in TIME magazine.
        we did not spam anyone.  we used a listserv/majordomo
        attack to MAILBOMB.  yes, there is a difference.</P>
   
       <p> the media labeled us long ago whether they know it or not
        and they will continue to do so.  we are hackers and phreaks
        and we have no long term agenda.  we do what we want when we want
        and at other people's expense. if we go down for any of our
        crimes so be it.  that is part of the path we choose and
        no one will stop us.</P>
      
        <P>why a listserv/majordomo attack?  there are several subtle
        advantages to this kind of mailbomb.  the first being
        that all mail does not come from us.  yes, we know you can
        track it back to the account we used but that does you
        nothing.  since some of the mailing lists are gated to
        bitnet and some are manually done, even after the first
        wave of unsubscribes, the victim will continue to get
        mail.</P>

        <P> the net is chaos</P>
        <P>we are on the net</P>
        <P>therefore we must be chaotic</P>

         <P>why this letter?  because no one can figure out why some
        of the people were bombed.  it should be more than clear
        but i didn't realize how out of touch "technology" 
        journalists, publishers, and other media goons really are.</P>
   
        <P>why our actions in general?  too many people on the net do not
        belong.  we remember the net back when there were only one
        thousand people on irc.  we remember the net back when there
        were hundreds of newsgroups.  we remember when we could connect
        to any site at any time and have no trouble transferring one
        or two files quickly.  too many companies are intent upon
        destroying the net and worrying only about their stuffed
        pockets.  we are just one group helping to reclaim what
        used to be.</P>
   
        <P>the net may not belong to us but we can safely say it is more
        ours than the capitalist pigs that are infesting it 
        now.  clueless yuppies are the other 'entity' that are 
        bringing the net to its knees.  if you do not know how to use 
        the net, stay off of it.  like others, we are losing control 
        of the net and want to take a last stab at revenge.  revenge 
        may be childish and immature but it is damn fun and very rewarding.</P>
  
 
        <P>on to the bombs...</P>
     
        <P>70277.2502@compuserve.com     rush limbaugh</P>
        <P>we do not believe much needs to be said here but since it took
        a call from rush to ped to inform a senior technology editor
        we can only assume it was not as clear.  fat political hag.
        this bomb had nothing to do with the cda.</P>
       
        <P>71511.460@compuserve.com      ross perot</P>
        <P>all those millions of dollars and you can not get an ear job?
        quit trying to buy the masses.  if you really care about
        this country, put your money back into it without being
        a president.</P>

        <P>corpcomm@aol.com              america online corporate communications</P>
        <P>insulting advertising on television.  aol is also the first
        to successfully complete a snail mail spam with their shitty
        disks.</P>
     
        <P>sermoner1@aol.com             aol staff in charge of scientology area</P>
        <P>the cult of scientology should be eradicated.  the law should
        step in and force them out of business since they are not a church.
        the continual abuse of non-believers and harassment of those who
        speak against the cult is illegal.</P>
     
        <P>ak@iw.com                     internet world writer</P>
        <P>one of your past articles was complete shit and you know
        nothing about what you write.  get a real job and a life.</P>
      
        <P>aollegalstaff@aol.com         america online legal staff</P>
        <P>aohell is not illegal.  quit pretending it is.  quit
        threatening people and ISPs that carry it.</P>

        <P>meetings@2600.com   </P>          
        <P>hypocrite.  you preach about non-conformity yet you
        do not allow certain cities to have 'official' 2600 meetings
        if they don't conform to your set time on friday.  as
        for letters/articles, your magazine has gone to shit.  
        start publishing real hacking information.</P>

        <P>alexander@blacklisted411.com</P>
        <P>plagiarism.  if you want to use part of someones work you
        need to credit the source.  and while you are at it, learn
        something about telephony before you write about it.</P>
        
        <P>billg@microsoft.com           william gates</P>
        <P>you corrupted the computer industry.</P>
        
        <P>ddevette@executive.com        COS sympathetic</P>
        <P>never publicly state you support what the cult of scientology
        is doing.. especially in a magazine.</P>
        
        <P>emmanuel@2600.com             eric corley</P>
        <P>wannabe leader of the hacker community who can not hack himself.
        you should know hackers do not like media attention.
        i understand if you want to give hackers a better name but
        you haven't done anything yet.  give up or do something for
        a change.  your talk show is worthless.</P>
        
        <P>first.lady@whitehouse.gov     hillary clinton</P>
        <P>this list could go on and on.</P>

        <P>what gives you the right to try to monitor what i do?
        stay on the streets where you belong.  curtis's idea 
        that you just 'run into' smut while on the net is such a joke.</P>
        
        <P>gene@aol.com                  gene steinberg / aol forum leader</P>
        <P>this was not because of alt.aol-sucks  (notice the correct
        name of the newsgroup PED)</P>
        
        <P>georgia6@hr.house.gov         newt gingrich (r-ga)</P>
        <P>cda.  you may have voted no, but you had the power to persuade
        others to vote no.  over 90% voted yes which means you didn't
        try very hard.</P>

        <P>mtvyack1@aol.com</P>
        <P>mtv constantly preaches about freedom of this and freedom
        of that while droning on and on against censorship.
        fuckin hypocrites.  censoring a marijuana leaf on some
        videos is an all time low.</P>
             
        <P>house@mailbot.com             all house members</P>

        <P>lose the bias on your dealings with mitnick and other
        hackers.  the last book you ghostwrote for can be summed
        up in one or two choice words.  'libel' and 'slander'.
        just because you know one or two people in the scene
        doesn't mean you know shit.</P>
 
        <P>microsoft@aol.com             microsoft support</P>
        <P>learn to program before you learn aol.  your programs
        suck and are written like shit.</P>

        <P>yes, you are still getting punished for your cyberporn article.
        have to say, you are a decent fellow on the phone though.</P>
 
        <P>phypolite@aol.com             peter hypolite - manager of aol's ToS</P>
        <P>your Terms Of Service belongs in a dictatorship.  quit trying

        <P>this address was setup to report any abuse of the 
        'TOS' aol keeps, but if it happens on the net.  your 
        rules don't affect the net.  don't pretend they do.</P>
 
        <P>president@whitehouse.gov      president clinton</P>
        <P>the cda is unconstitutional and you knew it bastard</P>
 
        <P>stevecase@aol.com             president aol</P>
        <P>fucking parasite.  quit leeching net resources and return
        something to the community.  your service sucks and you bring
        fuckin maggots to the net.</P>
 
        <P>jms@opus1.com                 internet world writer - cda article</P>
        <P>you said net citizens should have done more to prevent the cda.
        fuck that, the president shouldn't have signed an unconstitutional
        bill.</P>
 
        <P>quit@newsday.com</P>          
        <P>quit@interramp.com            joshua quitner</P>
        <P>your book on MOD was amusing.  too bad you didn't talk to any
        of the real LOD members.  goggins and chasin were self declared
        members.  none of the true members ever counted them as part
        of the group.  read phrack31 for more details.</P>
 
        <P>jeffgood@aol.com              jeff goodell</P>
        <P>your book was amusing too.  we had two books about the Mitnick
        saga, one from each side.  we didn't need a third innaccurate
        version floating around.</P>
 
        <P>express1@nm-us.campus.mci.net jeff slaton</P>
        <P>spam king.  stay off the net.  you lost your job because of
        your spams, want us to go further?</P>
 
        <P>vfiscus@mcn.net</P>
        <P>pro cda, pro christ, pro usenet banning.. good thing we are
        pro capital punishment.  people like you need it.</P>

        <P>74044.164@compuserve.com</P>
        <P>your book 'internet security secrets' is the most pathetic excuse
        for a security book to be published.  you know NOTHING about
        the internet.  get the fuck off it.</P>
 
        <P>tsutomu@ariel.sdsc.edu</P>
        <P>tsutomu shimomura.  the list could go on and on, but the mitnick
        saga alone is a good enough reason.  YOU belong in jail you fuckin
        hypocrite.  why don't you tell everyone the real reason you helped
        catch him, and the real reason you aren't in jail yourself.  yes,
        others know about it.  my sendmail technique very best.</P>
 
        <P>76201.3211@compuserve.com     sandy gookin</P>
        <P>anyone who needs a book to be a good parent should not have
        kids. you are contributing to the overall stupidity our society
        posseses.</P>
 
        <P>aspg70@email.mot.com          motorola lawyer</P>
        <P>your products sell fine.  do not threaten web sites with law suits
        over trivial shit.  if you didn't want your phones cloned, you
        would make it harder to do.</P>
 
        <P>crunch@well.com               john draper  aka captain crunch</P>
        <P>someone summed it up in a recent article.  "one trick pony"
        you are nothing.  you haven't been anything for a long time.
        quit this pretense of you knowing something about current phone
        systems and quit touching kids.</P>
 
        <P>dmethvin@cmp.com              sr tech editor for windows magazine</P>
        <P>'protect yourself from hackers..' article, aug 1996.  like you
        have any right to claim you know anything about hackers or security
        overall.  Bet you don't know what procmail is eh?</P>
 
        <P>mslat@echonyc.com             michelle slatalla</P>
        <P>wake up, get a clue, get your phones turned back on.  then
        quit writing until you actually do some real research into the
        hacker community.  you know nothing.</P>
 
        <P>rking@teledotcom.com          Rachael King</P>
        </P>your article about Bernie S was completely out of 
        line.  you need to learn more about what went on 
        before you go spouting off like a wannabe expert.</P>
                      
        <P>hkk@netcom.com                Co$ Lawyer</P>
        <P>not only are you a Co$ member, but you are their 
        lawyer.  you help destroy lives because a cult tells you to.  
        wake up.</P>
 
        <P>stern@urshan.com              Howard Stern</P>
        <P>"you are a putz" as another put it.  "you are an 
        ignornat fuck" as someone else put it.</P>        
 
 
        <P>you will also notice the large amount of journalists 
        and media personnel on this list.  until journalism
        drags its pitiful head out of the dirt, this treatment
        will continue.</P>
 
        <P>these are not all of the bombs.  there were other personal bombs
        as well as several done as favors to other individuals and a few
        just to throw off any patterns one might try to draw.  these
        bombs will continue in the future.  we do not care if it affects
        the mail lists or the mail list managers as it is a necessary
        evil.  future bombs may utilize a newer usenet bomb that is
        just as annoying.</P>
 
        <P>the bottom line?  do not try to monitor, censor, regulate or
        control any aspect of the net.  it is an international network
        and no single government can control it.  if you try to, you
        will receive the same treatment.  next time it will be worse.</P>
      
 
        <P>yes.  this is a hacked account that we will never touch again.
        any conclusions about who we are based off this account will
        be wrong.  and to clear up any rumors about which accounts
        were used where, this is the ONLY letter we have sent about
        the bombs.  the letters forged from dis.org, netcom.com, and
        upt.org were fakes.  to verify who i am, Philip Elmer-Dewitt
        can verify me by this: i am the "friend of time" who talked 
        to him on the phone.</P>

<H2><center>Executive Order</H2> 
<B>July 15, 1996
Establishment of  President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection ("Commission").</B></Center>
<BR>

Certain national infrastructures are so vital that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the United States.<P>

These critical infrastructures include:
<UL>
<LI> telecommunications,<BR>
<LI> electrical power systems,<BR>
<LI> gas and oil storage and transportation,<BR>
<LI> banking and finance,<BR>
<LI> transportation,<BR>
<LI> water supply systems,<BR>
<LI> emergency services (including medical, police, fire, and rescue), and<BR>
<LI> continuity of government.<BR>
</UL>

Threats to these critical infrastructures fall into two categories:<P>

1. physical threats to tangible property ("physical threats"),<P>

2. and threats of electronic, radio-frequency, or computer-based attacks<P>
on the information or communications components that control critical<P>
infrastructures ("cyber threats").<P>

Because many of these critical infrastructures are owned and operated by the private sector, it is essential that the government and private sector work together to develop a strategy for protecting them and assuring their continued operation.<P>


NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:<P>


Section 1.  Establishment.  There is hereby established the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection ("Commission").<P>

        (a) Chair. A qualified individual from outside the Federal Government shall be appointed by the President to serve as Chair of the Commission. The Commission Chair shall be employed on a full-time basis.<P>

        (b) Members.  The head of each of the following executive branch departments and agencies shall nominate not more than two full-time members of the Commission:<P>

<UL><P>
       <LI> (i)     Department of the Treasury;<BR>
        <LI>(ii)    Department of Justice;<BR>
       <LI> (iii)   Department of Defense;<BR>
        <LI>(iv)   Department of Commerce;<BR>
        <LI>(v)    Department of Transportation;<BR>
        <LI>(vi)   Department of Energy;<BR>
        <LI>(vii)  Central Intelligence Agency;<BR>
        <LI>(viii) Federal Emergency Management Agency;<BR>
         <LI>(ix)  Federal Bureau of Investigation;<BR>
         <LI>(x)   National Security Agency.<BR>
</UL><P>
One of the nominees of each agency may be an individual from outside the Federal Government who shall be employed by the agency on a full-time basis.  Each nominee must be approved by the Steering Committee.<P>


Sec. 2.  The Principals Committee.  The Commission shall report to the President through a Principals Committee ("Principals Committee"), which shall review any reports or recommendations before submission to the President.  The Principals Committee shall comprise the:<P>

<UL><P>
        <LI>(i)     Secretary of the Treasury;<BR>
       <LI> (ii)    Secretary of Defense;<BR>
        <LI>(iii)   Attorney General;<BR>
        <LI>(iv)   Secretary of Commerce;<BR>
        <LI>(v)    Secretary of Transportation;<BR>
       <LI> (vi)   Secretary of Energy;<BR>
       <LI> (vii)  Director of Central Intelligence;<BR>
       <LI> (viii) Director of the Office of Management and Budget;<BR>

        <LI>(xi)   Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs.<BR>
</UL><P>

Sec. 3.  The Steering Committee of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection.  A Steering Committee ("Steering Committee") shall oversee the work of the Commission on behalf of the Principals Committee.  The Steering Committee shall comprise four members appointed by the President.  One of the members shall be the Chair of the Commission and one shall be an employee of the Executive Office of the President. The Steering Committee will receive regular reports on the progress of the Commission's work and approve the submission of reports to the Principals Committee.<P>


Sec. 4. Mission. The Commission shall:<P>

        (a) within 30 days of this order, produce a statement of its mission objectives, which will elaborate the general objectives set forth in this order, and a detailed schedule for addressing each mission objective, for approval by the Steering Committee;<P>

        (b) identify and consult with: (i) elements of the public and private  sectors that conduct, support, or contribute to infrastructure assurance; (ii) owners and operators of the critical infrastructures; and (iii) other elements of the public and private sectors, including the Congress, that have an interest in critical infrastructure assurance issues and that may have differing perspectives on these issues;<P>

        (c) assess the scope and nature of the vulnerabilities of, and threats to, critical infrastructures;<P>

        (d) determine what legal and policy issues are raised by efforts to protect critical infrastructures and assess how these issues should be addressed;<P>

        (e) recommend a comprehensive national policy and implementation strategy for protecting critical infrastructures from physical and cyber threats and assuring their continued operation;<P>

        (f) propose any statutory or regulatory changes necessary to effect its recommendations; and<P>

        (g) produce reports and recommendations to the Steering Committee as they become available; it shall not limit itself to producing one final report.<P>


Sec. 5. Advisory Committee to the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure  Protection.<P>

        (a) The Commission shall receive advice from an advisory committee ("Advisory Committee") composed of no more than ten individuals appointed by the President from the private sector who are knowledgeable about critical infrastructures. The Advisory Committee shall advise the Commission on the subjects of the Commission's mission in whatever manner the Advisory Committee, the Commission Chair, and the Steering Committee deem appropriate.<P>

         (b) A Chair shall be designated by the President from among the members of the Advisory Committee.<P>

        (c) The Advisory Committee shall be established in compliance with the  Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.).The Department of Defense shall perform the functions of the President under the Federal Advisory Committee Act for the Advisory Committee, except that of reporting to the Congress, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator of General Services.<P>


Sec. 6. Administration.<P>

         (b) The Commission and the Advisory Committee may hold open and closed  hearings, conduct inquiries, and establish subcommittees, as necessary.<P>

         (c) Members of the Advisory Committee shall serve without compensation for their work on the Advisory Committee.  While engaged in the work of the Advisory Committee, members may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the government service.<P>

        (d) To the extent permitted by law, and subject to the availability of  appropriations, the Department of Defense shall provide the Commission and the Advisory Committee with administrative services, staff, other support services, and such funds as may be necessary for the performance of its functions and shall reimburse the executive branch components that provide representatives to the Commission for the<P>
compensation of those representatives.<P>

        (e) In order to augment the expertise of the Commission, the Department of Defense may, at the Commission's request, contract for the services of non-governmental consultants who may prepare analyses, reports, background papers, and other materials for consideration by the Commission.  In addition, at the Commission's request, executive departments and agencies shall request that existing Federal advisory committees consider and provide advice on issues of critical infrastructure protection, to the extent permitted by law.<P>

        (f) The Commission, the Principals Committee, the Steering Committee, and the Advisory Committee shall terminate 1 year from the date of this order, unless extended by the President prior to that date.<P>



Sec. 7.  Interim Coordinating Mission.<P>

        (a) While the Commission is  conducting its analysis and until the President has an opportunity to consider and act on its recommendations, there is a need to increase  coordination of existing infrastructure protection efforts in order to better address, and prevent, crises that would have a debilitating regional or national impact.  There is hereby established an Infrastructure Protection Task Force ("IPTF") within the Department of Justice, chaired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to undertake this interim coordinating mission.<P>


        (b) The IPTF will not supplant any existing programs or organizations.<P>

        (c) The Steering Committee shall oversee the work of the IPTF.<P>

Members shall be designated by their departments or agencies on the basis of their expertise in the protection of critical   infrastructures.  IPTF members' compensation shall be paid by their parent agency or department.<P>

        (e) The IPTF's function is to identify and coordinate existing expertise, inside and outside of the Federal Government, to:<P>

                (i) provide, or facilitate and coordinate the provision of, expert guidance to critical infrastructures to detect, prevent, halt, or confine an attack and to recover and restore service;<P>

                (ii) issue threat and warning notices in the event advance information is obtained about a threat;<P>

                (iii) provide training and education on methods of reducing vulnerabilities and responding to attacks on critical infrastructures;<P>

                (iv) conduct after-action analysis to determine possible future threats, targets, or methods of attack; and<P>

                (v)  coordinate with the pertinent law enforcement authorities during or after an attack to facilitate any resulting criminal investigation.<P>

        (f) All executive departments and agencies shall cooperate with the IPTF and provide such assistance, information, and advice as the IPTF may request, to the extent permitted by law.<P>

        (g) All executive departments and agencies shall share with the IPTF information about  threats and warning of attacks, and about actual attacks on critical infrastructures, to the extent permitted by law.<P>


         (h) The IPTF shall terminate no later than 180 days after the termination of the<P>
Commission, unless extended by the President prior to that date.<P>


   Sec. 8.  General.<P>

        (a) This order is not intended to change any existing statutes or Executive orders.<P>

        (b) This order is not intended to create any right, benefit, trust, or  responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.<P>

McNulty <a href="../class_1/class1_b.html-ssi">"Changing Values and Their Implications for the Ethics of Information Warfare."</a> The information revolution has given us all manner of wonderful things, but it has also created a monster - information warfare.  At its heart, information warfare is about people - as individuals and organizations. McNulty presents a clear picture at what we are actually prepared to do; to what degree are we willing to be other than "nice guys", and to what degree
are we willing to give up aspects of our own freedom in the name of security.<BR>

<P>December 31, 1996
 
<P>    WASHINGTON (Reuter) - Most Defense Department information was pulled off the
Internet world-wide computer network Sunday after a hacker break-in attempt
damaged an Air Force page, the service said Monday.
<P>     The Air Force said most of the information was expected to be back on the
network late Monday.
<P>     The Defense Department has more than 80 World Wide Web sites on the public
Internet including a Gulf War Illness site, information about each of the
military services, press releases and military contract announcements.
<P>     The Air Force said most of the web sites were taken off the Internet after
a hacking attempt destroyed its home page, the page that guides computer users
to Air Force information available on the computer network.
<P>     It said federal authorities were investigating.

UK: SKY'S NO LIMIT FOR HACKERS.<BR>
By RICHARD GRANT.<BR>
</H3>
</Center>
<BR>
December 31, 1996<BR>
<P>COMPUTER hackers claim to have cracked satellite TV broadcaster BSkyB's security
codes so they can receive its channels on the cheap.
Software released on the Internet last week allows viewers with a satellite dish
and a set-top decoder to pirate Sky's premium L27-a-month sports and movie
service, using a smartcard for its basic L12 service.
<P>The pirate software is advertised as a `program to activate all Sky channels'.
It works on any home PC linked to a L60 mail-order black box that re-programs
the Sky smartcard.
<P>Sky has often been forced to upgrade its smartcards and electronic
counter-measures to defeat hackers and card copiers.
The latest smartcard, first made available in October 1995, has been the most
successful and long-lasting until this week.
<P>It was thought to be hacker-proof until it was reprogrammed to intercept Sky
pay-per-view events for free, including the Bruno v Tyson fight at L9.99.
Sky says its policy is to `take all technical and legal steps' to protect its
services. [Microsoft boss Bill Gates is reported to have become the latest
victim of the Unamailer, a US Internet terrorist, who jammed his personal e-mail
letter box with thousands of messages putting it out of action on Christmas Eve.

UK: CONNECTED - PARTY POOPERS - <BR>SECURITY HACKING USED TO BE ALMOST
RESPECTABLE.<BR>
</H3>
</Center>
<BR>
December 30, 1996<BR>

<P>No longer, says Michael McCormack.<BR>
On a cold Friday in Manchester, 50 of Britain's leading computer hackers joined
forces with their international counterparts for a night of drinking,
tale-swapping and, of course, a bit of electronic mischief.
<P>That mischief saw the Labour Party sharing the hackers' hangover, as its Web
site was given extensive - and unauthorised - alterations. Tony Blair's image
was replaced with that of his Spitting Image puppet and muppets were substituted
for the shadow cabinet.
<P>Between that exploit and other, less public online amusements, the hackers found
time to discuss their concerns about the changes in the British hacking scene.
What worries them most is their chance of making a career in computing. The
majority of hackers are in their late teens and early 20s, some completing
degree courses in IT. They worry that the computer-security knowledge they have
gained will go to waste, as employers increasingly refuse to hire candidates
they suspect of hacking.
<P>One veteran hacker explained: "Until fairly recently, computer-security
professionals and hackers had similar backgrounds. Most of them had been hackers
themselves at some point and most of us have worked with them on projects. Now
that's changing.
<P>"The new breed of security professional is all classroom-taught, they wear suits
and ties and they think of us as the enemy. They're not really part of the
culture of hacking at all. It used to be that your paper qualifications when you
went for a job
mattered less than what
you actually knew, and
everybody understood where you picked up the knowledge. Now it just comes down
to where you were trained and whether or not you fit the company mould."
A leading British security consultant, who asked not to be named, argued that
there were compelling commercial reasons for this: "There is a huge potential
for liability that wasn't there before - the commercial losses a company can
sustain now from an online information leak are immense. Also, the nature of the
security business has changed. We have to work with people at all levels,
educating them about what they need to do to stay secure. Most hackers that I've
met don't have the patience or the social skills to do that." Hackers are
predicting the increasing lack of sympathy between their community and the
security men will lead to more malicious hacking, and some are concerned that
hackers' already poor reputation can only get worse.
<P>One hacker, currently semi-retired after a close brush with authority, said the
next generation of hackers especially worried him: "When I was learning how to
do this, there was still an ethic that it was fine to explore and learn but
wrong to go in and do damage. I'm no angel, but I wasn't destroying files. The
new kids don't seem to play by the same rules."
<P>To repair their image, British hackers want to work together more often to
commit what they describe as "socially responsible hacks". The Labour hack,
promised to be the first in a series aimed at British political parties, is an
example of what they intend to do.
<P>Hackers are also talking about setting up a consultancy, where security
professionals could turn to get the most up-to-date information on hacking
methods and security flaws. Paranoia about law enforcement interest and the more
general problem of getting these essentially solitary young men organised have
so far prevented the proposal moving forward.

USA: EDITORIAL - HACKER VS. CRACKER.<BR>
By Bob Woods<BR>
</H3>
</Center>
<BR>
December 30 1996
<BR>
<P>Our readers have their hackles up when hacker is mentioned in our stories.
Hackers, they argue, are good people who just want to learn everything about a
computer system, while crackers are the ones who are breaking into computer
systems illegally.
<P>The problem arises when the public and people who shape society get a hold of
terms like "hacker" - a word once viewed as non-threatening turns into one that
conjures up visions of altered World Wide Web pages and crashed computer
systems.
<P>"Que's Computer and Internet Dictionary, 6th Edition," by Dr. Bryan
Pfaffenberger with David Wall, defines a hacker as "A computer enthusiast who
enjoys learning everything about a computer system and, through clever
programming, pushing the system to its highest possible level of performance."
But during the 1980s, "the press redefined the term to include hobbyists who
break into secured computer systems," Pfaffenberger wrote.
<P>At one time hackers - the "good" kind - abided by the "hacker ethic," which said
"all technical information should, in principle, be freely available to all.
<P>Therefore gaining entry to a system to explore data and increase knowledge is
never unethical," according to the Que dictionary.
<P>These ethics applied to the first-generation hacker community, which Que said
existed from roughly 1965 to 1982. While some of those people do still exist,
many other people who describe themselves as "hackers" are a part of the current
generation of people who destroy, alter, or move data in such a way that could
cause injury or expense" - actions that are against the hacker ethic, Que's
dictionary said. Many of those actions are also against the law.
<P>Today's hacker generation - the ones bent on destruction - are more accurately
called "crackers." Que defines such a person as "A computer hobbyist who gets
kicks from gaining unauthorized access to computer systems. Cracking is a silly,
egotistical game in which the object is to defeat even the most secure computer
systems. Although many crackers do little more than leave a "calling card" to
prove their victory, some attempt to steal credit card information or destroy
data. Whether or not they commit a crime, all crackers injure legitimate
computer users by consuming the time of system administrators and making
computer resources more difficult to access."
<P>Here's the rub: whenever the media, including Newsbytes, uses the term "hacker,"
we are hit with complaints about the term's usage. E-mails to us usually say
"I'm a hacker, yet I don't destroy anything." In other words, the people who
write us and other media outlets are a part of the first generation of hackers.
But the media reflects society as much as, if not more than, they change or
alter it. Today's culture thinks of hackers as people who destroy or damage
computer systems, or ones who "hack into" computers to obtain information normal
people cannot access. While it's probably the media's fault it started the
trend, there's no going back now - hackers are now the same people as crackers.
Besides, if a person outside of the computer biz called someone a cracker,
images of Saltines or a crazy person or an investigator in a popular British
television series would probably come to mind. For most people on the street,
the last thing they would think of is a person they know as a hacker.
So, what's to be done about the situation? Not a whole heck of a lot,
unfortunately. The damage is done. If more people in the "general public" and
the "mainstream media" read this news service and saw this article, some headway
might be made. But even if they did, cultural attitudes and thoughts are very
difficult to change. For those people in the US - remember New Coke? Or the
metric system? If you're outside the US, can you imagine calling football
"soccer"?
<P>And to the first generation of hackers - those of us "in the know" in this
industry do know about you. When we report on hackers nowadays, we're not
talking about you, and we do not mean to insult you. Honest.

December 28, 1996<BR><BR>

<P>
The need for security varies due to the threat climate at various US military
facilities. Most of the time we worry about the threat of infiltration or
intelligence collections or foreign agents or terrorists. In the mid 1970s
and even into the early 1980s, military SpecOps personnel and  Special Agents
were tasked by the Pentagon to infiltrate bases overseas and in the US as a
test of US security forces. In some cases agents were able to gain access to
nuclear weapon storage areas. In other infiltrations the agents entered the
military bases in a very overt style. The Palestinian head dress and a green
fatigue clothing was worn in some tests. In other tests agents wearing Soviet
uniforms entered the bases through the front gate and received a smart salute
from the guards. Often a limo was rented by the agent personnel who put a
flashing red light on the roof and a small flag taped to the front bumper. I
performed many such infiltrations through Europe and the Middle East and even
in the US. I will say that in 75 tests carried out in the US, our teams were
able to roll through with PLO or Russian uniforms and our VIP looking status
symbol-the limo. The one exception was the USMC facility at 29 Palms in
California where a Marine did not care if he offended anyone and nearly shot
both me and another counterintelligence CT/AT agent ! After our
explainations, our credentials and badges, and a letter from the JCS we were
able to get off the asphalt and and file a favorable report on the perimeter
security of this facility !

<P>These penetrations were the idea of the JCS at the Pentagon after they had
admitted the security forces might be lax in some services. The "Red Cell"
operations carried out later by SEALs were basically the same idea-infiltrate
and then get the troops motivated to increase the idea or theory of security.
Our early attempts consisted of climbing fences, passing through sensor
areas, "sneaking and peeking", and leaving proof of our access to "secure
sites". In one case I was able to autograph a nuclear device due to a very
laid back civilian GSA guard force. Simulated IEDs were placed on or near oil
storage tanks, the base commanders home, the base security police
building,etc. After early 1982 we stopped the penetrations feeling that we
had enhanced the overall security posture of the facilities we had tested.
Commanders called us a variety of names claiming we  "did not play fair" in
that we sent no warning to the facility we were coming. Terrorists don't
either. Today we still see pizza delivery cars, taxis, and UPS trucks waved
through gates with little or no checking.

<P>The tests are to begin again. Teams from the Defense Special Weapons Agency
are to start infiltration of world wide sites in Jan 97 due to the incident
at the Khobar Towers. Although tests are done frequently at nuclear storage
facilities, most bases have not continued testing themselves. With a variety
of SpecOps personnel, investigators will again try to gain entry to US,
Middle Eastern, Asian, and European posts and bases. Due to my background in
performing these tests I hope everyone can perform like the Marine at 29
Palms. Terrorism can take place anywhere-anytime. Security is serious
business. This series of inspections can only aid our target hardening by
pointing out problem areas. 

<P>I would suppose there will be some people again claiming this to be unfair.
But as we all know, real terrorists foreign and domestic do not always play
fair.

<P>All police facilities are stressing polite contact. Last time I took 10 guys inside a
classifed site by riding in back of a UPS truck. The driver thought it was a
big joke. What upsets me are the taxis and pizza deliveries. You can even
ride one into the CIA driven by a foreign and illegal driver.

<P>Apocalypse For World's Infrastructure -All Done With a Computer?

<P>C.L. Staten, ERRI Senior Analyst

<P>(ENN) It starts with unexplained "glitches" in a banking computer in New
Mexico, spreads to the world-wide funds transfer system, telephone and
fax communications are then shut down at will, air traffic control
systems blink on and off as if possessed, and eventually...ultimate
control of many nation's weapons is transferred to an unknown power.  A
fictional account, or a very real possibility?

<P>Well, actually, this is a novel by William Lovejoy, published by
Kensington Publishing Corporation, called "Back \ Slash."  The book,
which details a frantic search for the ultimate computer cracker, take
the reader through the halls of power in Washington and on to the
capitals of the other major countries of the world.  It offers a fairly
realistic glimpse into the new FBI Computer Crime Squad and the computer
and intelligence capabilities of a number of renowned agencies. It also
clearly points out the very real threat of a "computer apocalypse" and
one way it might be perpetrated.  All in all, it paints a dim picture of
America's preparedness to combat computer terrorism.

<P>In fairness, some parts of  "Back \ Slash" are not technically
competent, nor are all of the segments of the scenario feasible in the
real world, but such is fiction. The author does do a good job of
building suspense, explaining technical aspects,  and even provides us
with a couple of underlying sex plots to keep the manuscript
interesting.   In final analysis, this is one that we would recommend to
our computer-literate friends in the emergency, military, or
intelligence community....make sure to drop a hint and then look for it
under your Christmas tree next Wednesday.


<P>(ERRI Note: Unless otherwise indicated, ERRI/ENN has no financial or
other self-serving interest in the books, movies, tv programs, or other
products we review.  They are simply presented to advise our readers
about new or innovative materials that might be of interest or use.)

<P>RTos 24/12/96 06:53   


<P>    SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) - An outspoken computer security expert, citing his
just-completed study, says up to two-thirds of certain Web sites, including
reputable institutions like banks and the media, are vulnerable to hacker
attacks.
<P>     Dan Farmer -- who stirred controversy in 1995 as co-author of software
dubbed SATAN that enables people with basic skills to infiltrate computer
systems -- surveyed more than 2,200 Web sites.
<P>    The survey released last week covered a relatively small portion of the
sprawling Web but focused on sites where security is more of a concern.
<P>     Farmer probed 660 bank sites around the globe, 312 North American online
newspaper sites, 274 credit union sites, 47 U.S. federal government sites and
451 Internet sex clubs.
<P>     In a summary, Farmer said that, out of his sample of about 1,700 Web sites
he selected, "over 60 percent could be broken into or destroyed." As a control,
he probed a random sample of 469 sites.
<P>     Farmer said he used relatively crude, non-intrusive methods and did not
actually break into the sites. He also said he would not publish the names of
the sites he surveyed.
<P>     "I barely electronically breathed on these (computer) hosts," he said in
his report, adding that, considering more intrusive tests, some 70 percent to 80
percent of sites may have security flaws.
<P>     Other computer security experts found Farmer's results credible and
authoritative, David Kennedy, director of research, education and consulting at
the National Computer Security Association, said in a telephone interview
Monday.
<P>     Experts and computer industry executives said the study shed more light on
a problem well known within the industry but insufficiently understood by the
public at large.
<P>     The threat of hacker attacks was highlighted earlier this year when
intruders broke into the Justice Department and Central Intelligence Agency Web
sites and altered them, prompting the CIA to close its site temporarily.
<P>     Farmer stressed that Web sites are being used primarily for marketing and
advertising purposes and that, although some bank sites may allow visitors to
look up balances, the sites do not provide access to internal financial systems.
<P>     Deborah Triant, president of CheckPoint Software Technologies Ltd.'s U.S.
operating unit in Redwood City, Calif., said banks routinely keep Web sites on
separate computer systems.
<P>     "Our experience is the banks are so paranoid that they won't even allow the
access that they should be able to allow and would be quite safe if you had a
modern firewall" protecting their networks from intruders, said Triant, whose
company is the market leader in firewall technology.
<P>     "So, if their Web site is vulnerable, that doesn't mean that anything else
at the bank is vulnerable, or that their customers' accounts or the transactions
their customers are doing are vulnerable," she said.
<P>     Nevertheless, with the advent of electronic commerce over the Internet
expected to gain momentum in 1997, lax security remains a critical issue,
experts said.
<P>     Farmer separated security flaws into two categories -- a red category where
he said a site was "essentially wide open to any potential attacker" and a
yellow category deemed less serious but with potential for disastrous
consequences.
<P>     Of the 660 bank sites, 68 percent were deemed vulnerable and nearly 36
percent were in the red category.
<P>     Some 51 percent of credit unions were vulnerable, 62 percent of the federal
sites, nearly 70 percent of newpapers and 66 percent of sex clubs. Sites in the
red category ranged from 20 percent for credit unions to 38 percent for federal
sites and 39 percent for online newspapers.
 <P>    Of the random sample of 469 Web sites used as the control, a far smaller
percentage -- 33 percent -- were found to be vulnerable, and 17 percent of the
group was in the red category.
<P>     Farmer said part of the problem is that Web sites are trying to do too much
at once, increasing their complexity and making security far more difficult to
achieve.
 <P>    But, even with security concerns, credit card transactions over the Net are
much safer than those carried out in shopping malls, said the security
association's Kennedy.
<P>     Farmer also said he plans to incorporate some newer testing tools into a
new version of SATAN, which stands for Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing
Networks, early next year.
<P>     The program enables people who manage corporate networks to locate
weaknesses and fix them. But it has been controversial because it can also
easily be used by malevolent intruders trying to cause damage.
<P>     Triant said there have been no reported security breaches at any of the
more than 15,000 institutions with CheckPoint network security installed and
said such precautions should provide adequate protection.

<BR>
<P>Last year, my friend upgraded his GirlFriend3.1 to GirlFriendPlus1.0
(marketing name: Fiancee1.0). Recently he upgraded Fiancee1.0 to
Wife1.0 and it's a memory hogger, has taken all his space; and Wife1.0
must be running before he can do anything. Although he didn't ask for
them, Wife1.0 came with plug-ins such as MotherInLaw and BrotherInLaw.

<P> Some features I'd like to see in the upcoming GirlFriend4.0:

<P> -A "Don't remind me again" button

<P> -Minimize button

<P> -Shutdown feature

<P> -An installshield feature so that Girlfriend4.0 can be completely
uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose cache and other objects)

<P>Antedotes:<BR>
I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still installed,
they tried using the same I/O port and conflicted. Then I tried to
uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 but it didn't have an uninstall program. I
tried to unstall it by hand, but it put files in my system directory.

<P>Another thing that sucks --all the versions of Girlfriend that I've used
are totally "object orientated" and only support hardware with gold plated
contacts.
 
<P> ***** BUG WARNING ********
 
<P>Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 1.1
before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before
doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse to install,
claiming insufficient resources.

<P>(Thanks to DonK at the NCSA for this gem)<BR>

<P>December 26, 1996
 
<P>Based on US defense industry reporting of suspicious activity, the
Defense Investigative Service (DIS) has continued to observe trends of
low-level collection interest and activity by foreign companies and
governments.  These foreign collection methods of operation (MO) exhibit
subtle changes to adapt to rapidly changing international political and
economic environments.

<P>        Foreign collection continues to focus on economic and Science and
Technology (S&T) information and products.  Programs associated with
dual-use technologies are often consistent targets for both foreign
government and foreign commercially sponsored collection activity.
Although traditional foreign threats continue their collection activities,
DIS continues to observe the expansion of non-traditional foreign threat
collection in industry.  Subtle changes in collection MOs are evidenced by
a transition in reliance on the covert and illegal to overt and legal
activity.  While the clandestine efforts of foreign intelligence services
(FIS) are still ever present, there is a significant reliance on the use of
overt and perfectly legal collection methods.  This transition is not
limited to foreign commercially sponsored activity, but includes FIS
activity also. Areas of foreign collection activity and interest, as
identified from US defense industry reporting, included the following areas
from the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL):</P>
<PRE>
Aeronautics Systems
Armaments and Energetic Materials
Chemical and Biological Systems
Directed and Kinetic Energy Systems
Electronics
Guidance, Navigation, and Vehicle Control
Information Systems
Information Warfare
Manufacturing & Fabrication
Marine Systems
Materials
Nuclear Systems
Sensors and Lasers
Signature Control
Space Systems
Weapons Effects and Countermeasures
</PRE>
<P>        Additionally, defense industry reporting continues to reflect
increasing trends of foreign collection activity involving proprietary
strategic management information, to include bid proposals, price
structuring, and marketing plans.

<P>        While many, if not  most interactions between US defense industry
and foreign interests are benign and advantageous, reported collection MOs
associated with various defense industry security countermeasure (SCM)
concerns include:
<UL>
<P>unsolicited requests for S&T information,<BR>
inappropriate conduct by foreign national visitors at US Government contractors,<BR>
exploitation of joint ventures and joint research,<BR>
outright acquisitions of technology and companies,<BR>
using the INTERNET to identify and target information for collection,<BR>
targeting cultural commonalities,<BR>
targeting at international exhibits, seminars, and conventions,<BR>
solicitation and marketing of services,<BR>
"marketing survey" ploys for competitive intelligence,<BR>
communications with foreign employees,<BR>
and targeting of former US contractor employees.
</UL>
<P>        Unsolicited requests for US defense industry S&T program
information are the most frequently reported MO associated with foreign
collection activity.  These requests generally reflect a wide range of
interests, and often represent an information management problem for the US
defense industry.  A growing number of incidents involve faxing, mailing,
E-mailing, or phoning such requests to individual US persons rather than
corporate marketing departments.  Usually associated with alleged
employment opportunities, there is also an increasing trend involving
"headhunters" soliciting information from employees.

<P>        US defense industry reporting of suspicious activity continues to
indicate that foreign visits to US industry represent a significant
security risk if threat appropriate and sound risk management is not
practiced.  With few exceptions, security compromises reported from foreign
visit incidents could have been prevented if US personnel had been properly
pre-briefed as part of the risk management process.  Potential exploitation
methods include:

<P>hidden agendas as opposed to the stated purpose of the visit,
last minute and unannounced persons added to the visiting party,
"wandering" visitors who become offended when confronted,
and initiating conversations with escorts beyond the approved scope of the
visit.

<P>        Many of these techniques are specifically designed to produce
potentially embarrassing incidents for the host, in order to obtain
collection objectives as a result of the host attempting to be
conciliatory.  Additionally, foreign sponsored work shops, tours, and the
like are potential responses to a disapproved visit request.  Another
variation involves the foreign activity attempting to exploit different
visit procedures for US Government-sponsored, non-sponsored, and commercial
visits, using each category as an alternative mechanism to each other to
gain access to excluded and protected information.  Finally, many foreign
collectors take advantage of the potential misinterpretation that a US
Government-sponsored foreign visit to a US contractor means that any
inquiry or activity by the foreign party "must be OK."

<P>        Joint ventures, joint research, co-production and various exchange
agreements potentially offer significant collection opportunities for
foreign interests.  As with frequent foreign visits and other international
programs, joint efforts place foreign personnel in close proximity to US
personnel and afford potential access to S&T programs and information.
Access can be intentional or unintentional, and for both, legal or illegal.
US defense industry reporting of SCM concerns continues to indicate that
assimilation of foreign personnel into the work environment, without
security sustainment training programs, usually results in a relaxation of
security awareness among US employees; often resulting in a security
compromise.

<P>        Foreign acquisition  of technology and companies in the US defense
industry continues to generate significant SCM concerns regarding foreign
access to US markets or sensitive and proprietary information.  Once a
foreign entity gains ownership, control, or influence over a US company
with classified contracts, that ownership, control, or influence must be
mitigated through an insulating instrument approved by the Defense
Department.  If such an approved insulating legal instrument is not
implemented, the US company and the foreign investor face the possibility
of contract cancellations and loss of future classified contracts.

<P>        The growing popularity and expansion of the INTERNET is reflected
in a significant increase in US defense industry reports of SCM incidents
associated with computer-based collection attempts.  Using the INTERNET
provides a direct method of communication for foreign collection efforts.
INTERNET access to a company's bulletin board, home page, and employees
provide a foreign collector many avenues to broaden a collection effort.

<P>        International exhibits, conventions, and seminars are rich
collection targeting opportunities for foreign collectors.  These functions
directly link programs and technologies with knowledgeable personnel.
Consequently, US defense industry reporting reflects collection activity at
these events is usually expected and rampant.  Good risk management
processes which accurately consider what information is being exposed,
where, when and to whom is essential for implementing threat appropriate,
cost effective, and rational security countermeasures to balance marketing
requirements.

<P>        Foreign individuals with technical backgrounds offering their
services to research facilities, academic institutions, and even cleared
defense contractors, at little or no apparent cost was reported with
greater frequency during  the past year.  Additionally, US technical
experts are often requested by foreign entities to visit the foreign
country and share their technical expertise.  US defense industry reporting
indicates that while many requests are routine and benign, some are viewed
with suspicion and represent significant SCM concerns.

<P>        "Marketing surveys," faxed or mailed to US companies by foreign
"consulting" companies, of various types often may exceed generally
accepted terms of marketing information.  Often, there are strong
suspicions that the "surveyor" is employed by a competing foreign company.
Surveys may solicit proprietary information concerning corporate
affiliations, market projections, pricing policies, program or technology
director's names, purchasing practices, and types and dollar amounts of US
Government contracts.  Customer and supplier bases for a company may also
be surveyed about the subject company.

<P>        Incidents involving the coopting of former employees who had access
to sensitive proprietary or classified S&T or program information remains a
potential counterintelligence concern.  Frequently, targeting cultural
commonalities to establish rapport is directly associated with the
collection attempt.  As a result, quite often foreign employees working for
US companies are specifically targeted by foreign collectors.  Defense
contractor employees working overseas may be particularly vulnerable to
foreign offers of employment as their contracts expire.  Former employees
may be viewed as excellent prospects for collection operations and
considered less likely to feel obligated to comply with US Government or
corporate security requirements.

<P>        As the international political and economic environment continues
to change and mature, US defense industry strategic management processes
will be increasingly challenged to balance international marketing and
partnerships with sound security countermeasures.  Good risk management
practices will ensure that cleared employees are properly trained and
empowered to recognize and report suspicious activity.

<P>        If you believe that any of the above situations apply to your
company, you should immediately notify your DIS Industrial Security
Representative through your company Facility Security Officer.  Likewise,
notify DIS should you have any indication that your company or any of your
employees may be the target of an attempted exploitation by the
intelligence service of another country.  Reports of actual, probable, or
possible espionage should also be submitted to the FBI.

<P>This brochure was prepared by the Counterintelligence Office  of the
Defense Investigative Service based solely on  reporting from the defense
industrial security community.

<P>This brochure is approved for public release.

<P>What : A computer/telephony/security conference. (show this part to your 
       boss.)

<P>Where: Fort Brown Hotel, Brownsville Texas. 

<P>When : 28 & 29 December, 1996

<P>Who  : The usual gang of cretins.

<P>Why  : It's winter, and it is 12 degrees outside.  The dumpsters are frozen
       shut, and there are icicles on the payphones.  Brownsville is at the
       Southern-most tip of Texas, right up against...Mexico.  Yes, Mexico,
       land of cheap cerveza, four-dollar strippers, and liberal drinking
       laws.  Mexico, where you too can own your very own Federal law
       enforcement official for a fistful of pesos.

<P>     ----------------------------------------------------------------

<P><CENTER>                         General Information</CENTER>


<P>The Fort Brown Hotel will have available to us, 125 rooms at the holiday in @ 
$55 a room, and $75 rooms at the ramada @ $45 each.  The Fort Brown was 
previously an actual fort when it was closed down by Uncle Sam.  It became one
large hotel until it was recently purchased and split into the Holiday Inn and
the Ramada.  The Fort Brown was chosen because it is across the street from 
the bridge to Mexico.  You can call the Fort Brown Ramada at: 

<P>	210-541-2921

<P>You can call the Fort Brown Holiday Inn at:

<P>	210-546-2201

<P>Call for reservations, make sure to tell them your with CuervoCon.

<P>Friday and Saturday the con will be in the 'Calvary' room.  While Sunday we 
have the 'Fortress Room' where all the big speakers will be.  Friday and 
Saturday we will have a few speakers and activities.  Friday Night mainly, 
so we can have people arrive on time.  We hope to have the con room open 24 
hours a day.

<P>Brownsville is right on the Mexican border, adjacent to the Mexican town
Matamoris.  The Gulf of Mexico is 25 miles away.  Brownsville has a population
just over 100,000.  The police force includes 175 officers, and a wide variety
of federal law enforcement agencies have a strong presence there as well.
The climate is semi-tropical, and the RBOC is SouthWestern Bell.

<P>Matamoris is the other half of brownsville.  Home of over 1/2 a million 
people, it is known since the early 1900's as a pit of sin.  The federale's 
are not to be fucked with and it is serviced by TelMex.  It is known for its 
bars, strip clubs and mexican food.  Matamoros also has an airport incase 
you live in Mexico and care to go, via aeromexico.

<P>Directions:<BR>
In Texas Driving - Go anyway you can to get to US 77 South. Take 77 South 
till it ends in Brownsville. From there you will turn right on International.
Proceed all the way down international, right before the bridge, turn left.
The Fort Brown will be on the left.

<P>For those flying in - We are going to try to have a shuttle going. Also just
tell the cab driver, Fort Brown.

<P>The Con Registration Fee, aka the pay it when you walk in our we will beat you
up, is only 10$ and an additional 5$ for the 'I paid for eliteness sticker' 
which will let you into the special events, such as hack the stripper.

<P>'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...<BR>
How to live in a world that's politically correct?<BR>
His workers no longer would answer to "Elves".<BR>
"Vertically Challenged" they were calling themselves.<BR>
And labor conditions at the north pole<BR>
Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.

<P>Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,<BR>
Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.<BR>
And equal employment had made it quite clear<BR>
That Santa had better not use just reindeer.<BR>
So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,<BR>
Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!

<P>The runners had been removed from his sleigh;<BR>
The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.<BR>
And people had started to call for the cops<BR>
When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.<BR>
Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.<BR>
His fur trimmed red suit was called "Unenlightened."

<P>And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,<BR>
Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose<BR>
And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,<BR>
Demanding millions in over-due compensation.<BR>
So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,<BR>
Who suddenly said she'd had enough of this life,<BR>
Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,<BR>
Demanding from now on her title was Ms.

<P>And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion<BR>
That making a choice could cause so much commotion.<BR>
Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,<BR>
Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.<BR>
Nothing that might be construed to pollute.<BR>
Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.<BR>
Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.<BR>
Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.<BR>
Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.<BR>
Nothing that's warlike or non-specific.

<P>No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.<BR>
Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.<BR>
And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,<BR>
Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.<BR>
For they raised the hackles of those psychological<BR>
Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.



<P>No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt;<BR>
Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.<BR>
Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe;<BR>
And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.<BR>

<P>So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed;<BR>
He just could not figure out what to do next.<BR>
He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,<BR>
But you've got to be careful with that word today.<BR>
His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground;<BR>
Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.

<P>Something special was needed, a gift that he might<BR>
Give to all without angering the left or the right.<BR>
A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,<BR>
Each group of people, every religion;<BR>
Every ethnicity, every hue,<BR>
Everyone, everywhere...even you.<BR>
So here is that gift, it's price beyond worth...

<P>"May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth."</P>

<P>Clyde Stites shared this with me last Christmas.  It was so well received
that I thought I would forward it again this year.  I hope you enjoy it as
much as we did last year at Christmas.

<P>Dearest John,

<P>I went to the door today and the postman delivered
a partridge in a pear tree.  What a thoroughly
delightful gift.  I couldn't have been more
surprised.

<P>Oh, aren't you the extravagant one!  Now I

five golden rings; one for every finger.  You're
just impossible, but I love it!  Frankly, all
those birds squawking were beginning to get on

<P>Dear John,

<P>When I opened my door there were actually six
geese a laying on my front steps.  So you're back
to the birds again huh?  Those geese are huge!
Where will I ever keep them?  The neighbors
are complaining and I can't sleep through the
racket.  Please stop.

<P>John,

<P>What's with you and those birds?
Seven swans a swimming.  What kind of God
damn joke is this?  There's bird shit all over
the house and they never stop with the racket.
I can't sleep at night and I'm a nervous wreck!
It's not funny.  So stop with those birds.

<P>I think I prefer the birds.  What the hell am I
going to do with eight maids a milking?  It's
not enough with all those birds and eight maids
a milking, but they had to bring their damn
cows.  There is shit all over the lawn and I
can't move around in my house.  Just lay
off me, smart ass.

<P>Hey Shithead,

<P>What are you, some kind of sadist?  Now there's
nine pipers playing.  And Christ, do they play!
They've never stopped chasing those maids since
they got here yesterday morning.  The cows are
getting upset and they're stepping all over these
screeching birds.  What am I going to do?  The
neighbors have started a petition to evict me.

<P>                   You'll get yours,

<P>You Rotten Prick,

<P>Now there's ten ladies dancing.  I don't know why
I call those sluts ladies.  They've been balling
those pipers all night long. Now the cows can't
sleep and they've got the diarrhea.  My living
room is a river of shit.  The Commissioner of
Buildings has subpoenaed me to give cause why
the building shouldn't be condemned.

<P>I'm siccing the police on you.

<P>Listen Fuckhead,

<P>What's with the eleven lords a leaping on those
maids and ladies.  Some of those broads will
never walk again.  Those pipers ran through the
maids and have been committing sodomy with
the cows.  All twenty-three of the birds are dead.
They've been trampled to death in the orgy.  I
hope you're satisfied, you rotten vicious swine.

<P>Dear Sir:

<P>This is acknowledge your latest gift of twelve
fiddlers fiddling which you have seen fit to inflict
on our client, Miss Agnes McHolstein.  The
destruction was, of course, total.  All further
correspondence should come to our attention.  If
you should attempt to reach Miss McHolstein at
Happy Dale Sanitarium, the attendants have
instructions to shoot you on sight.  With this
letter, please find attached a warrant for your
arrest.

<P>How traditions are made....
 
<P>It was supposed to be a happy time, but it wasn't. Santa was really pissed.
It was Christmas eve and NOTHING was going right. Mrs. Claus  had burned
all the Christmas cookies.  The Elves were bitching about not getting paid
for the overtime they had put in while making toys, and the reindeer had
been drinking all afternoon and were dead drunk. They had taken the
sleigh out for a spin earlier in the  day and crashed it into a tree,
breaking off one of the runners.
 
<P>Santa was  beside  himself  with anger. "I CAN"T believe it!  I've got to
deliver millions of  presents all over the world in just a few  hours from
now and all my reindeer are drunk, my Elves are on strike, and I don't even
have a Christmas tree!  I sent that stupid Little Angel out HOURS ago to
find a tree and she still isn't back!   What am I going to do?"
 
<P>Just then the Little Angel opened the front door and stepped in from the
snowy  night, dragging  a Christmas tree.  She says: "Yo, Santa where do
you want me to stick the Christmas Tree this year???"
 
<P>And thus the tradition of Angels perched atop Christmas trees came to
pass...</P>
<BR>
Best Regards,<BR>

December 21, 1996
<BR>
<P>My daughter & I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas & 
decided to have a small dessert.  Because both of us are such cookie lovers, we 
decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie". It was so excellent that I asked if 
they would give me the recipe and the waitress said with a small frown, "I'm 
afraid not."  

<P>Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe?  With a cute smile, she said, 
"Yes."

<P>I asked how much, and she responded, "Only two fifty, it's a great deal!"  I 
said with approval, just add it to my account. Thirty days later, I received my 
VISA statement from Neiman Marcus and it was $285.00.  I looked again and I 
remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. 
As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, "Cookie Recipe $250.00."

<P>That's outrageous!! I called Neiman's Accounting Dept.and told them the waitress 
said it was "two-fifty," which clearly does not mean "two hundred and fifty 
dollars" by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of  the phrase. Nieman-Marcus 
refused to budge. They would not refund my money, because according to them, 
"What the waitress told you  is not our problem.  You have already seen the 
recipe - we absolutely will not refund your money at this point."  I explained 
to her the  criminal statutes which govern fraud in Texas, I threatened to 
refer   them to the Better Business Bureau and the State's Attorney General 
for engaging in fraud.  I was basically told, "Do what you want, we don't give a 
crap, and we're not refunding your money."

<P>I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get any of my money 
 back. I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have 
$250.00 worth of fun."  I told her that I was going to see to it that every 
cookie lover in the United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie 
recipe from Neiman-Marcus... for free.

<P>She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I said, "Well, you should have  
thought of that before you ripped me off, and slammed down the phone on her.

<P>So, here it is!!!  Please, please, please pass it on to everyone you can 
possibly think of.  I paid $250 dollars for this... I don't want Nieman-Marcus 
to *ever* get another penny off of this recipe.</P>
<PRE>
$250 DOLLAR COOKIE RECIPE:
            2  cups butter
            4  cups flour
            2  tsp. soda
            2  cups sugar
            5  cups blended oatmeal **  
            24 oz.chocolate chips
            2  cups brown sugar
            1  tsp. salt
            1  8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)  
            4  eggs
            2  tsp. baking powder
            3  cups chopped nuts (your choice)  
            2 tsp. vanilla</PRE>
<P>       ** Measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder. Cream the 
butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla; mix together with flour, oatmeal, 
salt, baking powder, and soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.  Roll 
into balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake for 10 minutes at 
375 degrees. Makes 112 cookies. 

<P>Merry Christmas!</P>

<P>December 20, 1996
 
<P>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Six Danish men who hacked their way into Pentagon
and business computers were sentenced to short jail terms Thursday and ordered
to pay fines and perform community service.
<P>   The men had faced sentences of up to four years in prison, but the longest
sentence given was three months to one man.
<P>   Another was sentenced to 40 days, three were ordered to perform up to 200
hours of community service, and the sixth was fined $172.
<P>   The men's lawyers argued that the hackers did not exploit the information
they obtained and said they had, in fact, done the hacking victims a favor by
exposing the vulnerability of their computer systems.
<P>   The case had been described as one of the largest hacking cases in Europe.
<P>   The men were sentenced by a court in Roskilde, 25 miles east of Copenhagen.

<P>December 20, 1996
 
<P>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuter) - The FBI said Wednesday it was investigating charges
that sabotage caused a 40-hour outage last weekend on Web Communications Inc.
(WebCom), a Silicon Valley service hosting 3,000 World Wide Web sites.
<P>     WebCom said it believes a hacker using a college computer network in
British Columbia, Canada, flooded its server, a central computer, in San Jose,
Calif., with requests for connections from phony addresses.
<P>     It said the attack ended Sunday after MCI Net, a unit of MCI Communications
Corp., blocked telephone traffic between WebCom and CA-Net of Canada at the
request of WebCom and its local service provider.
<P>     WebCom Executive Vice President Thomas Leavitt said the sites the company
hosts were unreachable much of Saturday and Sunday, causing customers, some of
which operate retail sites, to suffer "extensive" damages.
<P>     "One customer said he lost about $20,000 in revenue due to a special event
that was not able to occur. Others said they lost business on one of the busiest
shopping weekends of the year," Leavitt said.
<P>     WebCom said the incident was due to a common type of Internet sabotage
known as "denial of service" or "SYN flood," in which a computer hacker jams a
central computer with requests for connections from addresses that do not exist.
<P>     These types of attacks are easy to carry out and hard to trace, Leavitt
said.
<P>     "You can fake where the messages are coming from," Leavitt said, and almost
any with access to the Internet and some technical sophistication can do it.
<P>     Others in the industry have experienced similar attacks, WebCom said.
Public Access Networks Corp. of New York City experienced such an attack in
September.
<P>     WebCom, headquartered in Santa Cruz, Calif., said its own investigation
helped by three Internet service providers traced the origin of the flooding
message to a computer on a college network in British Columbia linked to BC-Net,
a local Internet service provider there.
<P>     Leavitt said that as of Wednesday a network administrator at Malaspina
University-College in Nanaimo, British Columbia, had identified the computer
used for the sabotage and that it was broken into by someone without authorized
access to that computer or to the college network. The individual has not been
identified.
<P>     FBI spokesman George Grotz said Wednesday that the FBI was working with the
information tracing the requests for connection to British Columbia but noted
the actual perpertrator may have nothing to do with the college or BC-Net.
"BC-Net may just be another link in the case," he said.
<P>     Leavitt said if the industry, or specifically Internet service providers,
adopt certain "source filtering" coding they can prevent people from using one
network to send message that appear to come from somewhere else.

<P>December 19, 1996
 
<P>By Steve Gold.
<P>Police investigating the systematic hack of the Labour Party World Wide Web
site, which was hacked on three separate occasions last week, have started the
process of tracing down the hacker, Newsbytes has learned.
As reported last week by Newsbytes, during the first raid, which occurred 12
days ago, the Labour Party Web site hacker changed the title "Road to the
Manifesto" to "Road to Nowhere." He also tinkered with links to other sites on
the Web so they read "The Labour Party sex shop," and transferred visitors to a
series of pages carrying pornography.
<P>Despite Labour sealing administrator access to the Web site at
<A HREF="HTTP://www.labour.co.uk">http://www.labour.co.uk</A>, the hacker, who had a US accent, regained access and
almost rewrote the site, adding images of Labour head Tony Blair taken from the
Spitting Image comedy puppet series, under the banner headline of "Hacked
Labour: Same Politicians, Same Lies."
<P>The hacker also re-routed Web links which were supposed to detail information on
the various personalities within the Labour party to information on the puppets
on Jim Henson's Muppet Show, on the Henson Web site in the US.
Newsbytes notes that the running of the site is contracted out to two companies,
On-line Publishing, which maintains the pages, and Poptel, which provides the
Web space on its servers. Both companies have said they are investigating how
the hacker gained access to the pages.
<P>Newsbytes has discovered that BT has traced the first hacker call of Saturday,
December 7, to an Internet cafe in Manchester, with the call time logged at 5am.
Curiously, the cafe was shut at the time, but Newsbytes notes that there was an
all-night "2600" hacker party going on in Manchester at the time, forcing
investigators to the conclusion that the hack may have been part of a
demonstration for the hackers.
<P>So far, neither the police nor the Labour party will comment on these
revelations, which were published in the "Londoner's Diary" of the London
Evening Standard.
<P>Newsbytes has discovered, however, that at least one person attending the 2600
hacker party is under investigation by the London Fraud Squad.

<P> A hacker in the US could attack other UK political party Web sites in the wake
of the attack on the Labour Party's site. New Media Age has received information
that the hacker may target the Conservative Party site next. Labour's site was
taken offline on Tuesday and police called in after two raids on the site.
The source said: "It is someone trying to express their political freedom. They
are looking to target other sites, like the Conservatives."
A spokesman for Online Publishing, which designed the site, said the hack was
expertly done. Despite press reports to the contrary, he said no password
compromise took place.
<P>The Web site was altered on Saturday evening, but the changes only lasted for 20
minutes before Potptel, which hosts the site, managed to refresh the site.
Malcolm Corbett, Poptel's marketing director, confirmed the attack and said
Poptel was investigating security measures.
Security on the Conservative Party site has also been stepped up since the
attack, according to Peter Collingwood of WebWorks, its developers.
While not yet under direct attack, the Party's site
(<A HREF="HTTP://www.conservative-party.org.uk">www.conservative-party.org.uk</A>) is being aped by a rival site called
Conservative Information (<A HREF="HTTP://www.conservative.org.uk">www.conservative.org.uk</A>). Choosing the link `A Party
to Believe In' takes a user to the Referendum Party site.

December 19, 1996
 
<P>   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- It is a computer company's worse nightmare: to be
erased. Completely.
<P>   But that's what police said happened to Digital Technologies Group, a small
Internet service provider and computer design company. They've arrested a man
who lost his job at the company just before the problems started.
<P>   One night in October, the company's owner, Mark Ambrose, was at home trying
to call up the company's home page on the Internet's World Wide Web when an
error message flashed on the screen. When he tried to retrieve one of his major
accounts, the file was gone.
<P>   Ambrose then rushed to the office to log on to the system, only to find more
error messages.
<P>   "Everything had been erased," he said. Even the backup copies were deleted.
<P>   The company lost about $17,000 in business equipment and records. Months of
work were also gone. The business was closed for a week while a new computer
system was set up.
<P>   Ambrose reasoned that only someone with intimate knowledge of the company's
system, including client and employee passwords, could have created such havoc.
<P>   The only man who filled that description, he said, was Charles Morrell, the
primary computer technician, who was handed a pink slip the day before the
computer files started disappearing. He was let go because the work he had been
hired to do was completed, Ambrose said.
<P>   On Tuesday, Morrell was arrested on a charge of computer crime. He was
accused of sabotaging the business by infiltrating the computer system from
home. He could face up to 20 years in prison.
<P>   Morrell's lawyer, Richard E. Cohen. He said the charges are "totally
baseless" and stem from a business dispute.

How Santa knows

  You'd better watch out,
  You'd better not cry,
  You'd better not pout;
  I'm telling you why.
  Santa Claus is tapping
  Your phone.

  He's bugging your room,
  He's reading your mail,
  He's keeping a file
  And running a tail.
  Santa Claus is tapping
  Your phone.

  He hears you in the bedroom,
  Surveills you out of doors,
  And if that doesn't get the goods,
  Then he'll use provocateurs.

  So--you mustn't assume
  That you are secure.
  On Christmas Eve
  He'll kick in your door.
  Santa Claus is tapping
  Your phone.

                DECEMBER 15, 1996
</PRE>
<P>     To subscribe to this monthly newletter on information 
technology and society, send the message "subscribe" to 
<A HREF="MAILTO:enodelist@garnet.berkeley.edu">enodelist@garnet.berkeley.edu</A>

   
<P>     In a remarkable turn of societal imagination, many 
conservatives have begun picturing the computer age as the 
rejuvenation of small-scale entrepreneurial capitalism against 
the institutions of the nation state.  Whether it's Alvin Toffler 
talking about "demassification" or George Gilder citing the  
"quantum revolution" or Newt Gingrich promoting decentralization 
of economic decision-making to local regions, there has been a 
steady stream of conservative analysis making the case that new 
technology has made government's role, especially the federal 
government's role, irrelevant and even dangerous to the healthy 
functioning of the economy.  

<P>     Even THE ECONOMIST, a magazine with an early enthusiasm for 
the Internet and usually a somewhat more balanced eye, has 
described the success of the Internet as the "triumph of the free 
market over central planning. Democracy over dictatorship."  The 
new conservative view has been that the private sector is the 
font of technological and economic innovation.  The federal 
government should get out of the way and leave economic 
development to the private sector, maybe occasionally  working 
with local governments promoting innovation and job creation 
locally.  

<P>     What is repressed in this bit of economic myth making is not 
only the key role the federal government played in each step of 
the growth of the computer industry, and, to an even larger 
extent, in the birth and formation of the Internet, but also the 
fact that left to private industry, much of the computer 
technology would  never have come to market and, in the case of 
the Internet, the result would have been less innovative and less 
of an economic engine for growth.  In fact, it's unclear that the 
integrated communication and information exchange that is the 
hallmark of the federally-created Internet would have even 
occurred out of the private visions and competition of industry.  

<P>     The Internet is in many ways the product of central planning 
in its rawest form: planning over decades, large government 
subsidies directed from a national headquarters, and experts 
designing and overseeing the project's development.  The 
government not only created whole new technologies to make the 
Internet a possibility, it created the standards  for forms of 
economic exchange of information that had never been possible 
before.  

<P>     The comparison has been at times to the interstate 
highway system but the analogy would hold only if employees of 
the federal government had first imagined the possibility of 
cars, subsidized the invention of the auto industry, invented the 
technology of concrete and tar, and built the whole system with 
only a few stray dirt roads existing anywhere on the assumption 
that private industry would build along.   

<P>     It's worth remembering that the headlines just a few years 
back in 1993 about the Information Superhighway were not over the 
Internet and software companies like Netscape but about mergers 
and financial deals between those who controlled the cables to 
the home, on the assumption that those who monopolized control of 
the physical hardware connecting homes and business would reap 
monopoly profits in selling information services.  As Fortune 
magazine described the ultimately unsuccessful merger of TCI 
cable and Bell Atlantic telephone back in 1993, "It was the bold 
stroke of two captains of industry bent on securing their share 
of whatever booty washes ashore when the interactive age finally 
arrives...When the dust settles, there will probably be eight to 
ten major operators on the highway, some earning their way mainly 
by collecting tolls for the use of their networks."

<P>     In many ways, this private vision harked back not to the 
original federal highway system but to the first transit system 
that criss-crossed the nation's land--the railroads.  And in 
fact, that historical legacy gives some sense of what a privately 
designed system would have looked like.   In the 1840s and 1850s, 
the first large railways were built, usually with incompatible 
track widths where trains entering the same city could not switch 
directly to another company's rail track. This was not accidental 
but a deliberate strategy by merchants sponsoring one railroad to 
avoid having another company (usually sponsored by merchants in a 
rival city) siphon off freight.   It would take decades before 
the gauges of different train companies were all standardized and 
freight could be easily transferred from line-to-line for longer 
distances. Even as such standardization was achieved by the 
1880s, giant railroad companies sought to create competing 
railway systems that could control enough territory to control 
the flow and pricing of significant portions of freight against 
competing systems, becoming the first major oligopolies in the US 
economy.

<P>     Later columns of ENODE will talk about some broad ways the 
federal government contributed to the creation of the Internet, 
but this month I just want to emphasize a number of cases where 
the private sector either missed where the technology needed to 
go, or, worse yet, came close to derailing the publicly funded 
Internet system.

<P>     In the early sixties, researcher Paul Baran had begun 
planning how to build the technology necessary for the goal of 
networking computers. Baran worked at Rand Corporation, a 
research company setup to monitor and preserve the US 
government's operations research capability.  Worried about the 
survivability of US communication networks in the case of nuclear 
war, Baran envisioned the movement from analog telephone signals 
to digital signals that could perform in a networked system of 
digital transmission.  Instead of a central switching node where 
the whole wire between two points would be reserved specifically 
for the sound signals of a specific conversation, such a system 
would be a "distributed network" with each node connected to its 
nearest neighbors in a string of connections, much like the 
child's game of telephone.  Allowing fuller use of all lines in 
the network instead of holding lines open from end-to-end for 
each message, such a system would have each node would keep track 
of the fastest route to each destination on the network (and be 
constantly updated with information from adjoining nodes) and 
help route information without need of central direction.

<P>     RAND was enthusiastic about Baran's ideas but when AT&T was 
approached about its feasibility, AT&T executives dismissed the 
idea and even refused to share information on their long distance 
circuit maps--Baran had to purloin a copy to evaluate his ideas 
which he and RAND were convinced were right.   Based on RAND's 
recommendation, the Air Force directly asked AT&T to build such a 
network but AT&T still refused saying it wouldn't work (except 
for a faction of scientists at Bell Labs).  This may have been 
technical myopia by the business-oriented executives, but it was 
an economically self-interested myopia.  Such a distributed 
network threatened (and today does threaten) the central economic 
assets of the telephone industry: central computers and central 
switches. It highlights the fact that corporate research labs, 
the main alternative to long-term government funding of 
technological alternatives, rarely if ever invest in fundamental 
technology that will likely undermine the natural economic 
monopolies they currently enjoy.

<P>     In the meantime, British physicist Donald Davies had begun 
promoting a similar idea of a computer network with "packets" of 
information.  He soon learned of Baran's similar ideas and was 
encouraged enough to get support by the British Post Office, 
notably a state run agency which ran the telephone system in 
Britain.  In 1968, the first computer distributed network was 
established on computers located at the National Physical 
Laboratory where Davies worked. 

<P>     It was at the US military's Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (ARPA) that distributed computing would be taken to the 
next level. Larry Roberts, a researcher from the military-funded 
Lincoln Labs at MIT, was hired to work on the computer networking 
project.  Starting out at four west cost sites: UCLA, UC Santa 
Barbara, University of Utah, and the Stanford Research Institute, 
the plan was to install a new computer at each site as part of 
the network.

<P>     In 1968, ARPA advertised the bid for building the 
specialized computers  to be used to run the network.  IBM and 
other big computer companies declined even to make a bid, saying 
it wasn't possible at a reasonable price.  Again, like AT&T, this 
was partially the myopia of those grounded in older technology 
but it was also a self-interested economic fear of the new 
timesharing minicomputer technology (itself recently heavily 
funded by ARPA) that was challenging the dominance of companies 
like IBM.  They rightly feared that networking would make many 
government agencies and businesses rethink the need to actually 
own their own mainframe computer.

<P>     In the end, the small (600 employees) consulting firm of 
Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) did the work.  BBN was intimately 
tied to MIT and it was sometimes called the "third university" in 
Cambridge.  With the promise of a large government contract and 
the top technical talent of mostly MIT graduate students, BBN was 
able to take on a task that only a large company could have done 
without such a government contract.  By October 1969, the network 
connection between SRI and UCLA was established and within 
months, all four nodes were on-line.  By the time the network was 
demonstrated publicly for the first time at the International 
Conference on Computer Communications in October 1972, there were 
twenty-nine "nodes" in the network (dubbed at this point ARPANET) 
clustered in four areas: Boston, DC, Los Angeles and San 
Francisco.  What would evolve into the Internet had been born.

<P>     Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, ARPA would build a national 
community of public-minded experts who helped shepherd open 
Internet standards  that would radically expand the network to a 
wide range of users.  In doing so, it was clear that the public-
spirited professional norms promoted by ARPA and the community of 
researchers was critical in keeping individual profit-taking from 
undermining that openness.  In 1973, ARPA's networking head Larry 
Roberts was hired by BBN to run a private packet switching 
network subsidiary called TELENET (which would evolve into 
SprintNet).  In coming to BBN, Roberts carefully deflected a bid 
by BBN to take over the ARPANET privately.  And his ARPA 
successor J.C.R. Licklider, a key researcher in building the 
ARPAnet and one-time BBN employee, was faced with his old 
employer BBN refusing to publish the original computer code for 
the networking computer routers they had designed, while at the 
same time becoming more and more reluctant to fix software bugs 
on the ARPANET.  Licklider, in the name of the openness of the 
Net, threatened to hold up BBN's federal contract funds unless 
they released the code publicly.  BBN published the code, 
enhancing the tradition of open codes in the development of 
standards.

 <P>    Ironically, as networks spread in the 1980s, it was the 
government experts at ARPA and universities who backed the 
flexible, tested TCP/IP protocol, while big private companies 
like MCI, IBM and Hewlett Packard adopted an untested, 
bureaucratically inspired standard created in international 
committees called OSI.  Vincent Cerf, the creator of the TCP/IP 
system who is now a Vice-President at MCI, had been hired in 1983 
to build MCI's message networking system and he remembers, "So I 
had to build MCI Mail out of a dog's breakfast of protocols."    
It was only with the technical dominance of the Internet that 
most private industry would convert over to the public TCP/IP 
protocol.

<P>     The other key thing to understand is the government's role 
in being the source of much of the commercial business explosion 
in Internet-related business.  This goes beyond merely creating 
the Internet itself but to directly being the source of the 
energy that the private sector is directing to this area of 
economic innovation.  Mitch Kapor, the founder of the software 
company Lotus, has argued,  "Encouraged by its successor, the 
rapidly expanding government/academic [Internet], the commercial 
internet...represents the natural development and expansion of a 
successful government enterprise."

<P>     The political economist Karl Polanyi argued half a century 
ago that "The road to the free market was opened and kept open by 
the enormous increase in continuous, centrally organized and 
controlled interventionism."  The reality is that the Internet is 
no accident but neither was it a technological inevitability.  It 
was the product of a US federal government, in association with 
other nation's experts, guiding its evolution, in demanding that 
its standards be open and in the public domain, and that its 
reach be extended broadly enough to overwhelm the proprietary 
corporate competitors.

<P>     It is under such an open system that small companies can 
create Internet-related software products and know that they will 
be compatible with other products given the pervasiveness of the 
standards.  The fate of the companies that were building 
Microsoft's proprietary network--dropped by Microsoft and left 
with a useless set of products when Microsoft switched to 
Internet standards--shows the shadow life of companies that 
depend on the whims of corporate standards.   The open standards 
of the Internet and the easy distribution of products assures 
that new companies have the ability to at least attempt to take 
on established players without having the technology itself used 
as a block against them.

<P>     This is critical for a whole range of information-based 
industries that Stanford economist Brian Arthur has argued are 
governed by the law of increasing returns for investment.  The 
argument (which Arthur submitted as part of a legal brief to the 
Justice Department against Microsoft's original proprietary 
system and its incorporation into its Windows 95 operating 
system) is that because of a range of built-in advantages for 
early innovators, companies that attain initial control of a 
market have a massive advantage over latecomers.    Because 
business customers for software demand compatibility with other 
products they use and because they have to invest training time 
to use the initial product, those customers are often reluctant 
to change products,  so early entrants to a market often have an 
overwhelming advantage in holding onto their market dominance.    
By assuring a degree of compatibility of all programs and cutting 
distribution costs, the Internet mediates against the worst 
monopoly effects of this increasing returns effect.

<P>     This privatization of the Internet threatens further 
evolution of the Internet.  This extends from the coordination of 
networking to avoid capacity overload to the danger that 
standards and protocol design are being shaped more and more to 
commercial needs.  While the overall compatibility of systems 
through the IP protocol is unlikely to be undermined in the near 
term, related standards such as Web browsers are being 
increasingly designed with commercial interests in mind.   When 
Netscape or Microsoft design their browsers, they are marketing 
not to individual users (who generally receive the browsers for 
free) but to the purchasers of related software that depend on 
the standards determined by the browsers.  If the base of a 
particular broser standard is high enough, corporations will buy 
particular server software from the producer of that standard 
browser so that consumers can access the bells and whistles 
associated with that brand of browser. This is in many ways 
analogous to broadcast television where stations sell "audiences" 
to advertisers.  This is a recipe for concentration of standards 
in few hands, since the federal government has largely bowed out 
of intervention to assure broad participation in the design of 
standards for the Web.  

<P>     What is worth emphasizing is that the federal government did 
a very good job for twenty-five years in designing and guiding 
the standards and development of the Internet.  Putting some 
regulatory teeth back into government standards committees is an 
infinitely preferable alternative to letting Microsoft's or 
Netscape's corporate strateges in selling server software to 
other companies determine the standards with which the rest of us 
have to live.

Major Internet Server Platform Vulnerable to Hacker Attacks<BR>
</H3>
</Center>
<BR>
<P> Microsofts Flagship Product Windows NT Server is Vulnerable to Serious 
 Hacker Attacks Because of Security Flaws
 
<P> San Francisco, December 17, 1996:   Microsoft NT, one of the internets 
 most dominant platforms has been discovered to be extremely vulnerable to
 hacker and security attacks.  Taking their cue from publicly released 
 Microsoft documents, the internets most famous hackers are writing and 
 releasing code to exploit the weaknesses of Microsofts flagship product, 
 Windows NT Server.  "We fully intend to release the code and programs 
 that exploits NTs weaknesses" said a noted hacker anonymously named 
 "Bob". The security problems were exposed in a December 16th Information 
 Week article written by Stuart Johnston 
 (<A HREF="HTTP://techweb.cmp.com/iw/610/10iunt.htm">http://techweb.cmp.com/iw/610/10iunt.htm</A>) and while no specifics were 
 made public, many hackers who have read the article were incensed at the 
 indifferent response given by a Microsoft spokesman.
 
<P> Dark Tangent, president of Defcon and organizer of an annual hacker 
 gathering said, "Its unfortunate that Microsoft is ignoring the problem 
 and has some marketing guy making lackadaisical pronouncements on a very 
 serious issue that can potentially undermine thousands of internet sites 
 and corporations." 
 
<P><B> Microsofts Folly</B>
 
<P> The details of NTs weakness were outlined in a little known publicly 
 released Microsoft document entitled, Common Internet File System 
 Protocol (CIFS/1.0).  Hacker "Bob" said, "We simply took the details of 
 the document and built programs to exploit the weaknesses."  The weakness
 leaves Microsofts NT Servers vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and 
 authentication attacks that could allow malicious hackers, disgruntled 
 employees or industrial spies to steal data, get and forge legitimate 
 users identities and passwords or simply render entire web sites or 
 systems inoperable.  Asked where and when the programs will be released, 
 hacker "Bob" said, "We hope to publish the attacks in either 2600 
 magazine or the freely available hacker zine called as phrack."
 
<P> Various internet underground sources claim that various versions of the 
 attack are freely circulating in the hacker community and is now the 
 subject of both design and debate in various internet news groups and 
 forums.  Another noted hacker named "nachos" from the hacker group 
 dis.org said, "There is already working code to snarf user names and 
 passwords. There is now design work undergoing to package these in trojan
 horses and other delivery mechanisms.  This should serve as a wake-up 
 call to corporate America.  Take heed or be kneed".

<P><B>Moderator's comment:</B>


<P>Bravo, bravo, bravo! It's about time someone pointed out the obvious about
Windows NT. This operating system has been sweeping the workstation world.

<P>According to an International Data Corporation (IDC) report, "Windows NT on
Intel platforms is the biggest impending threat to traditional workstation
vendors."(1)
 
<P>What has motivated this invasion? A recent Dataquest survey reports that
users of Windows NT running on a RISC platform are the most satisfied of all
users of advanced desktop and workstation systems. This study concludes,
"High-end Intel-based PCs and RISC PCs running Windows NT have clearly made
inroads into the traditional markets of Unix workstations."(2)

<P>In fact, Windows NT is making more than "inroads." It might be more accurate
to characterize this as the Windows NT "invasion." Check out the numbers.

<P>If today's invasion is unchecked, an IDC report projects that the Unix-based
Web server market share will fall from the 65% of 1995 to only 25% by the
year 2000. The Windows NT share is projected to grow to 32%.  This weak
future for Unix Web servers is reinforced by an IDC report reporting that
market share of all Unix systems is now falling at a compound annual rate of
decline of -17% for the foreseeable future, while Windows NT is growing in
market share by 20% per year. Reasons given for this are the support,
training and marketing backing of NT.(3)

<P>Of course a big problem with Windows NT steamrollering Unix is the security
issue. Because Windows NT source code has not been publicly released, it has
been difficult to evaluate its security problems. By contrast, Unix flaws
are widely discussed -- and exploited. So this has led to a perception that
Windows NT is actually a more secure system than Unix-type operating systems.

<P>But perhaps with the impending release of details on Windows NT security
flaws, the Windows NT invasion may be held at bay. Long live Unix!

<P>By Jim Fay, Assoc. Editor

<P>The Web Page belonging to the British Labour Party was reportedly hit by
a hacker on two different occasions recently. The unknown hacker(s),
which was only identified as a male with a US accent, hit the Web Page a
week ago, and changed the title of the Page, and tampered with the links
to other pages, directing them to Web Pages containing pornography. The
Page was restored within twenty minutes of the finding the damage.

<P>However, the hacker hit the Page again last week, this time  criticizing
Labour Party politicians. The Labour Party has asked the Police to step
in and investigate the continued invasion of the Web Page. Newsbytes
Magazine is also reporting that a third attempt was  made on the Page.

<P>SGT. Assaf Banor Dies After Two Years in Coma

<P>By Yechiel Spira, SNS News Service and C.L. Staten, ERRI

<P>(SNS News Service - Shomron-Israel) Sgt. Assaf Banor, IDF, age 20, died
today of wounds sustained in the January 22, 1995 Bet Lid suicide
terrorist attack. Assaf was very critically injured in the second blast
at Bet Lid as he ran towards the injured victims of the first blast to
render first aid. He regained consciousness for eight days in Hadassah
Ein Keren Hospital and then slipped back into a coma and was transferred
to Bet Levenstein Rehabilitation Hospital.

<P>For almost two year he lingered in a coma until this morning when he
finally succumbed to his wounds. Assaf would have been 21 next month.
Assaf brings the death toll from the Bet Lid attack to twenty-two.
(Source: SNS News Service and Channel 12 TV News..12/16..8:00pm)

<P>(ENN) ERRI analysts said that the tragic death of SGT. Banor, does point
out, however, a potentially glaring error in training that was exploited
by an extremist bomber. In this case, Banor rushed into an unsecured
scene of an unexplained explosion and was killed by a secondary device,
triggered just for the purpose of killing rescue and security personnel.


<P>The Bet Lid situation was not the first, nor the last occurence of
command or delay-detonated devices being used to attack medical and
rescue personnel. A similar circumstance just occurred in N. Ireland,
where a medical facility was targeted with a second bomb, to be set-off
as victims and medics arrived. It has apparently become a common tactic
among some of the more radical terrorist groups.

<P>It should point out the tactical necessity of sweeping and clearing of
an explosion scene and immediately securing an inner and outer
perimeter. In the Bet Lid bombing, a second assailant remained on the
scene and eventually ran into a crowd of emergency responders and IDF
personnel, then detonating his device, killing SGT. Banor and 21 others.
Had the scene been cleared and secured, he would not have been able to
carry out his deadly mission.

<P>In future terrorist incidents, it is highly recommended by ERRI that
medical and emergency response personnel be constantly aware of the
possibility of a secondary explosive device and that law enforcement and
military personnel set about establishing multiple secure perimeters and
beginning a bomb search at the earliest possible tactical opportunity.
To do otherwise can prove fatal, as evidenced by this Israeli incident.

<P>San Diego Arson Officials Warn of "Bottle Bombs"

<P>By C.L. Staten, Senior Analyst

<P>(ENN) Bomb technicians from the San Diego, CA Metro Arson Task force are
reporting an increase in the number of people buildng and exploding
so-called "bottle bombs." In a 12/14/96 report in the San Diego Tribune,
bomb experts say that have seen several improvised explosive devices in
recent days, all of them built from 2-liter plastic soda bottles, using
a variety of chemicals.

<P>Paul Copher, ENN Counter-Terrorist Analyst-at-Large, and former IED
instructor for the federal government, told ENN that these devices can
be dangerous and often cause injuries to unsuspecting persons as they
are struck by flying shards of plastic. Worse, says Copher, the shrapnel
may not be detectable in X-rays and could result in potentially deadly
infections. Victims may also be splashed by caustic chemicals when the
devices detonate, according to Copher. The contents of these
"bottle-bombs" could cause blindness or even death, if the victim is
close enough to them as they go off.</P>

<P>     MOSCOW (Reuter) - Foreign espionage still poses a major threat to Russian
national interests five years after the end of the Cold War, the head of the
agency that succeeded the Soviet-era KGB said Tuesday.
 <P>    Federal Security Service (FSB) chief Nikolai Kovalyov, speaking at a rare
news conference, said organized crime and terrorism were also seriously
undermining Russia's security as it moved toward a free-market economy.
<P>     "Suppressing the activities of foreign intelligence on the territory of our
country continues to be the main task of the FSB. Unfortunately we cannot expect
any diminution in their activities in the coming years," Kovalyov said.
<P>     He said the FSB had exposed some 400 employees of foreign intelligence
organizations and 39 Russian citizens working for them in the past two years.
<P>     The FSB has also uncovered more than 100 attempts by Russian citizens to
pass on intelligence to foreign organizations on their own initiative, Kovalyov
added.
 <P>    He singled out the case of Platon Obukhov, a Foreign Ministry official
charged with high treason earlier this year after passing secrets to Britain.
Kovalyov said Obukhov had seriously damaged Russia's national interests.
<P>     The case triggered a Cold War-style expulsion wave in which London declared
four Russian diplomats persona non grata in response to Moscow's decision to
expel the same number of British Embassy employees.
<P>     Kovalyov said Russia had recently lodged an official protest with Turkey
over suspected espionage activity in the sensitive Northern Caucasus region that
includes breakaway Chechnya.
<P>     Russia is currently withdrawing its troops from Chechnya after a failed
21-month military campaign to crush the region's independence bid.
<P>     Asked about the danger of increased terrorist activity in the region,
Kovalyov said it was in the interests of the Chechen separatist government to
tackle the problem.
<P>     "They have to show that they can control the situation in their country ...
If there is an explosion of terrorist activity in Chechnya it will be a big blow
to their authority," he said.
 <P>    Earlier Tuesday six Western staff members of the International Committee of
the Red Cross were shot to death  in their beds in the worst incident involving
foreign aid workers in the turbulent oil-rich region.
<P>     Russian and Chechen officials are also trying to negotiate the release of
21 Russian Interior Ministry troops seized by rebel gunmen over the weekend.
<P>    Kovalyov said the FSB had already helped free 111 Russians taken hostage by
separatists during nearly two years of war.
<P>     He said he was alarmed by an upsurge in terrorist acts carried out with no
apparent motive as these were particularly difficult crimes to solve.
 <P>    Moscow's subway trains and trolleybuses were the target of several
mysterious bomb attacks earlier this year. Kovalyov said the FSB would shortly
publish the results of its investigation into the attacks, which threw security
chiefs into panic at the time.
<P>     But Kovalyov said President Boris Yeltsin's decision last year to set up a
special anti-terrorist center in the FSB had greatly facilitated Russia's fight
against terrorism.
<P>     The FSB is also battling to control organized crime, whose tentacles reach
into the highest echelons of power as criminal groups lobby government agencies
to protect their shady business interests, he said.
<P>     Some 500 government officials are currently under investigation on
suspicion of taking bribes, usually involving huge sums of money, Kovalyov said.

  5-7 page document with info from CIA's net of spies and illustrated photos
  from satellites operated by the pentagon. pdb almost always indicates
  source of info - unlike other reports. each president treats pdb uniquely.
  president's reaction a gauge of which subjects of interest and degree
  happiness with CIA's performance. it is a vehicle for raising issues,
  focusing president's attention and his and his foreign policymakers
  response become "extraordinarily important" is setting tasks for the Intel
  community. pres carter wrote notes on the pdb and questioned its
  usefulness. bush was a faithful reader. ronald reagan liked the

  demeaned pdb and said publication was not loyal to him. Washington Post

  solutions, inc., who has been asked to comment on how open sources can help

  therefore open source intelligence, appear to have finally achieved
  mainstream status in the U.S. in recent months, steele has been the
  featured speaker at a top secret conference on the future of U.S. Intel
  held at NSA. steele, a former CIA case officer with three overseas tours
  and many agent recruitments to his credit, is unusual for having also

<P>	After twenty years of service in the U.S. Intelligence
Community, including years of experience in three of the four
Directorates of the Central Intelligence, years as a military
intelligence officer, and a culminating period as the founding
Deputy Director of the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence Center,
Mr. Robert D. Steele turned to open sources--to publicly and
legally available information--as the best foundation for a
national intelligence community.  The Commission on Intelligence
agreed with him, castigating the U.S. intelligence community
for being "inexplicably slow" to provide its analysts with
access to open sources, labeling this a "critical deficiency",
and stating in no uncertain terms that open sources should be
"a top priority for the DCI [Director of Central Intelligence]
and a top priority for funding".  It is in this light that
the recent decision of the Executive Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, where primary responsibility for open
source access and exploitation lie, must be considered: the
de facto dismantling of the Community Open Source Program
Office planned for 1998, and the draconian reductions of the
Foreign Broadcast Information Service, a precious national
resource, also planned for 1998.

<P>	Mr. Steele, the leading advocate for creating smart
nations by providing unclassified intelligence support to
government decision makers, corporate leaders, public
diplomacy partners, coalition military allies, and citizens,
today released the following memorandum and an explicit budget
which identifies savings goals that would reduce the U.S.
intelligence community budget from $30 billion a year to $20
billion a year by the year 2000, while realigning one billion
dollars a year to a National Knowledge Foundation under the
oversight of the Vice President--the "content" element which
has been absent from the National Information Infrastructure.

<P>	In releasing this proposal, Mr. Steele's intent is to
ensure that the forthcoming hearings to confirm the nomination
of the new Director of Central Intelligence are undertaken in
full awareness of the urgent need to radically alter the balance
between spies and scholars while creating an unclassified
"virtual intelligence community" which is responsive to the
needs of the public and public diplomacy.


<P><B>                             FOR THE RECORD</B>

<P>     The memorandum which follows, based on contributions from highly
qualified experts (not myself) has been distributed recently to key
Administrative and Legislative decision-makers--it proposes specific
measures for reducing the U.S. Intelligence Community budget from
$30B a year to $20B a year, while simultaneously ear-marking $1B 
a year for a robust open source intelligence (OSINT) program.

<P>     Sadly, despite strong efforts by myself and many others since 
1992, the U.S. Intelligence Community has decided to completely 
ignore the recommendations of the Commission on Intelligence 
regarding the critical nature of its deficient access to open
sources, at the same time that the President has chosen to avoid
confronting the U.S. Intelligence Community and indeed has in his 
neglect allowed an unheard-of turnover rate of one per year for 
five years in the critical position of Director of Central 
Intelligence.

<P>     There is no one now in the Intelligence Community, and no one 
known to me outside the Intelligence Community, poised to bring to 
the position of Director of Central Intelligence the unique 
combination of brains, brass, vision, and character necessary
to ensure that we enter safely and prosperously into the 21st 
Century.  I therefore choose to publish this memorandum, as my
contribution to the dialogue and in the hopes that a candidate 
for the position of Director of Central Intelligence can emerge--
a candidate who is committed to informing governance and the public,
not simply collecting secrets for secrets' sake. 

<P>      If the U.S. Intelligence Community does not radically alter 
its spending patterns, and dramatically increase its exploitation 
of both open sources and world-class experts without security 
clearances, then the day will come when the President and other
key members of the government will testify to Congress that they do 
not use classified intelligence, they do not need classified 
intelligence, and they will not pay for classified intelligence.  
On that day, we will find ourselves in the worst of all possible
conditions: deluged by open sources of mixed reliability, and 
completely bereft of the unique and necessary perspectives which 
can only be offered by an all-source intelligence community capable 
of secretly collecting "the hard stuff" while providing its 
world-class multi-lingual analysts with the broad contextual and
encyclopedic contributions which only open sources can offer readily
and at very low cost.

<P>     This memorandum (below) is very real--if radical change is not 
forthcoming, this memorandum represents a "best case" scenario, 
rather than the now-more-likely scenario of more severe cuts 
without rationalization, and without an appropriate investment 
in open sources.  I have given up on the U.S. Intelligence Community,
and I now turn my attention to teaching government consumers of 
intelligence how to help themselves to OSINT.

<P>Signed<BR>

<P><B>		RIGHTSIZING INTELLIGENCE RESOURCES</B>

<P>	The evolving international environment, on-going
commercial and technological developments, and recent public policy
initiatives make it an ideal time to rightsize the intelligence
budget and streamline the intelligence community for the 21st
Century.  Some of the major trends affecting US intelligence are:
<UL>
<P>	--  the absence of a dominant foreign adversary;<BR>
	--  an aparently larger number of smaller, more diverse,
and less predictable threats;<BR>
	--  an increasing reliance on coalition peacekeeping
and joint warfare operations;<BR>
	--  the greater availability, accessibility, and
reliability of open source information;<BR>
	--  exploding commercial communication capabilities
and a rapidly maturing Internet;<BR>
	--  increasing government reliance on commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies - a trend reinforced by
widening technological advantages for many commercial systems;<BR>
	--  the increasing technical capabilities of rapid
reaction smallsats;<BR>
	--  fiscal and political pressures to downsize and
streamline government; and<BR>
	--  emphasis on more responsive and performance-oriented
government functioning.
</UL>
<P>	A downsized intelligence community of approximately
two-thirds the size of the current $30B enterprise that is
attuned to and confirms with these trends appears both
attainable and desirable.

<P>	The major steps that would need to be taken to realize
these goals are:

<P>1.  Infrastructure and support services (about 25% of the
intelligence budget) should be commercialized and postured
to take advantage of technological developments.  For example:

<P>	--  Dedicated intelligence communications, a necessity
30-50 years ago, should be drastically curtailed in favor of
widely available international commercial communications,
including direct broadcast satellites, that are increasingly
robust and more technologically innovative and adaptable to
changing environments.  (SAVINGS GOAL BY 2000: $500M per year)
[NOTE: all savings estimates are on an annual basis for year 2000]

<P>	--  Costly printed product production and distribution -
dailies, reports, compendia, maps, images, etc. - should be
markedly reduced in favor of electronic information dissemination
and storage.  (SAVINGS GOAL: $300M per year)

<P>	--  Dedicated, government-owned launchers and launch
facilities should, as far as possible, be commercialized, a step
in tune with the trend of decreasing military and increasing
commercial launches.  (SAVINGS GOAL: $1.0B per year)

<P>	--  Specialized computer hardware and software should be
limited to government0-unique applications, and increased use
of COTS in many intelligence applications should become the norm.
(SAVINGS GOAL: $500M per year)

<P>	--  Commercialize many other support services, such as
background investigations, facility security, transportation
services, facility and equipment maintenance, supply services,
etc.  (SAVINGS GOAL: $500M per year)

<P>	Many of these changes would provide a short-term double
benefit because past investments in dedicated government
capabilitiese would continue to be utilized without replacement
and the transition to contract commercial services would occur
gradually.

2.  Conventional human source collection, both overt and
clandestine - about 10% of the budget - should be drastically
reduced in favor of increased open source exploitation.

<P>	--  Downsize significantly large elaborate overseas
stations (both CIA and military) and establish single fully
integrated country cells composed of CIA, DIA, NSA, DEA, and
FBI under-cover operational officers to supplant the current
disparate, often competing and uncooperative overseas cadre.
(SAVINGS GOAL: $500M per year).  [OSS Inc. modifies this element to
propose a 50% reduction in CIA clandestine personel and a
doubling of law enforcement clandestine personel, with retention
of sufficient financial resources to provide for fully non-official 
cover operations and a global presence.]

<P>	--  Foreign Broadcast Information Service and document
procurement and translation operations should be privatized.
(SAVINGS GOAL: $200M per year).  [OSS Inc. modifies this element to
retain FBIS, together with the National Collection Division
and a community-wide controller for External Research &
Analysis funds, as a lean but very powerful element reporting
directly to the DCI and serving as the source of first-resort
for the National Intelligence Council, in full collaboration
with the National Knowledge Foundation to be established
OUTSIDE the intelligence community and under the direct
oversight of the Vice President of the United States.]
	
<P>	--  Service HUMINT activities should be folded in
with single CIA/DIA/NSA/DEA/FBI cadre.  (SAVINGS GOAL: $300M per year)

<P>	--  An off-setting increase in open source exploitation
should be explictly funded with a goal of reaching $1.0B by 2000.
[OSS Inc. modifies this element to specify that a combination of
a strong internal intelligence open source element at the Community
level, and the transfer of $1.0B to the Vice President for use in
funding the National Knowledge Center as the content element of
the National Information Infrastructure, is the only means by
which we can in fact "harness the distributed intelligence of the
Nation".  Schools, universities, businesses, the media, and others,
both domestic and internationally, must deal with a nurturing
non-intrusive, non-intelligence foundation if the concept of a
"virtual intelligence community" is to succeed.  Funding for the
procurement of commercial imagery by the National Imagery and
Mapping Agency is specifically excluded from this arrangement
UNLESS they adopt and fulfill the requirements of the EARTHMAP
Report and strive to meet the needs of the non-defense Departments.]

<P>3.  The increasing availability of commercial satellite and other
non-intelligence (open skies, NASA's MTPE and SAR) imagery,
image processing and geographic information processing and
production should be allowed to supplant previous dedicated
intelligence capabilities (about 20% of the intelligence budget).

<P>	--  Pause imagery and infrared warning satellite
procurement for three years (tentatively 1998-2000) to allow
drawdown of existing satellite inventories, promote increased
development/use of non-intelligence imagery capabilities, and
re-engineer to smaller, more flexible payloads for some mission
needs.  (SAVINGS GOAL: $2.0B per year).

<P>	--  Increase acquisition/support for commercial imaging
(funded in open source above).  [OSS Inc. modifies this element
to suggest that the national space summit must finally come to
grips with the integration of intelligence, non-intelligence,
and commercial space capabilities as a whole, and should look
explicitly to France and Canada as key partners in developing
a government-driven mesh of commercial imagery including radar
which relieves classified capabilities--which should be shared
more liberally with allied governments--of wide area and other
general requirements.]

<P>	--  Downsize intelligence image processing and increase
reliance on commercial processing and software for data
exploitation to better adapt to rapid changes in the volume
and character of demand.  (SAVINGS GOAL: $250M per year)

<P>4.  Re-engineer the US SIGINT system - about 35% of the
intelligence budget - for rapid, selective response/reaction
vice massive, worldwide volume collection and processing.

<P>	--  Descope on-going NSA conventional SIGINT operations
to conform to more diverse, decentralized threats.  (SAVINGS
GOALS: $1.0B)

<P>	--  Stretch procurement of replacement satellites in
light of inventories and create a centralized ground
architecture of ground stations utilizing evolving sat-to-sat
communications capabilities; posture for quick reaction
low-earth-orbit supplements in crises.  (SAVINGS GOAL: $1B per year)

<P>	--  Stretch some advanced high volume collection initiatives
in favor of small rapid response collection packages.  (SAVINGS
GOAL: $1.0B)

<P>	[OSS Inc. modifies this element to sanction the NSA
focus on information warfare but to require that the service
information warfare centers and the Defense Information
Systems Agency be fully integrated into a National Electronic
Defense Office which is co-equal to the newly-established
Federal Bureau of Investigation's Electronic Security and
Counter-Intelligence Program--DoD should be charged with
realigning $1.0B per year to the FBI for the latter program.]

<P>5.  Substantially reduce the standing armies of intelligence
production personnel and other resources - about 10% of the
intelligence budget - in favor of increased reliance and
support on commercial and contract analytical services.
(SAVINGS GOAL: $1.0B).  

<P>6.  Increase international data sharing and intelligence
collaboration in all phases of collection and production
in anticipation of the continuing need for and reliance on
coalition operations.

<P>	--  Establish explicit division-of-effort agreements 
in intelligence with NATO (or a portioin thereof), Korea,
Japan, and Australia/New Zealand for selected targets/areas
of mutual interest.  (SAVINGS GOAL: $750 million per year)

<P>	--  Experiment with more limited agreements with
Latin America, Middle East, and African countries in areas
of common interest.  (SAVINGS GOAL: $250M per year).

<P>	[OSS Inc. modifies the above element to note that
open source burden sharing agreements--as opposed to clandestine
and technical burden sharing agreements--do not exist today,
and to observe that the single most promising area for global
intelligence cooperation between governments and in support
of the United Nations is in the open source arena; hence, in
addition to sharing the load on the classified side, the U.S.
should aggressively pursue open source burden sharing agreements
which include hard-copy document acquisition, digitization, and
translation.]</P>

<P>
Perhaps those of us who believe we are on the threshold of a 
Revolution In Military Affairs made possible by recent leaps
ahead in information technology need to consider the following
excerpt from today's  Defense Daily:


<P>U.S. soldiers keeping the peace in Bosnia have benefitted little from advances
in information technology, despite Pentagon efforts to equip them with the
latest capabilities, according to a recent analysis of the operation. 

<P>The wide array of advanced communications and intelligence systems used in
Bosnia has benefitted the higher-ups in the chain-of-command, while
subordinate units--who do the dirty work of carrying out the 1995 Dayton Peace
Accords--have operated much as they did 20 years ago,
according to Information Operations in Bosnia--A Preliminary Assessment. 

<P>"Elaborate information flows between higher command levels do not always
translate into better support for the warfighter," the assessment states. "In
fact, life in Bosnia has not changed very much for the American soldier
because the information revolution largely stops at division level." 

<P>The assessment was authored by Army Col. Kenneth Allard, who recently retired
as the senior military fellow at the Institute for National Strategic Studies.
It was published in the November issue of the Institute's Strategic Forum and
reflects Allard's own insights after spending time with the 1st Armored
Division in Bosnia. 

<P>The findings contradict numerous statements by Pentagon officials and press
reports that contend the NATO peacekeeping operation has introduced the
military to the information age for the first time. 

<P>Information Too Little and Too Late

<P>As an example of how tactical battlefield information and intelligence rarely
gets to the soldiers who need it, Allard tells the story of a brigade
commander who recently requested satellite pictures of his area of
responsibility but didn't receive them for three weeks. And when they finally
arrived, the imagery was six months old. 

<P>"Despite the imperative of supporting the warfighter, the river of information
available to U.S. military forces in Bosnia often diminishes to a trickle by
the time it reaches the soldiers actually executing peacekeeping missions,"
the report says. 

<P>Allard says the reasons for this include communications pipelines too "narrow"
to efficiently carry digital data to the field, widespread use of "outmoded"
tactical equipment, and automated systems "easily overwhelmed" by what data is
available. 

<P>"But these are some of the more pernicious effects of an unwritten but
well-understood rule: the higher the headquarters, the more elaborate the
information trappings--and vice-versa," the report  says. 

<P>Allard found other reasons for the less-than-optimal information flow in
Bosnia. 

<P>Military forces have historically been hampered by adverse weather conditions
and other natural enemies, Allard points out.  But in Bosnia, it is worse
because automation systems have been arranged "ad hoc" in command centers and
field outposts that are spread out along lengthy supply lines. 

<P>"Such ad hoc arrangements make it more difficult to maintain computers and
electronic equipment or to defend them," according to the report. Allard
describes the Army's automation network as a "system of kluges," rather than a
"system of systems." 

<P>One result of the ad hoc structure is a fast-growing number of computer
viruses. "Conventional wisdom among U.S. units is that 50 percent of their
personal computers have suffered from viruses of one kind or another," the
assessment states. 

<P>Lastly, Allard believes more attention must be given to doctrine and training
when considering information operations. "Advances in information technology
are of military value only to the extent
that they are accompanied by coherent doctrine, organizations, equipment, and
people--to say nothing of the time needed to make them function as a team," he
writes.

<P>AP Cyberspace Writer

<P>   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An computer attack against WebCom, one of the nation's larger World Wide web service providers, knocked out more than 3,000 Web sites for 40 hours this weekend during the usiest shopping season of the year. 

<P>   The attack began Saturday morning at 12:20 a.m., said Web Communications'
chief operating officer Chris Schefler from the company's offices in Santa Cruz,
Calif. Service resumed at 4 p.m. Sunday. 

<P>   WebCom helps companies and individuals set up Web sites and provides storage
space on its computer from which the sites run. The outage was particularly hard
on retailers who promote and sell products on WebCom-based home pages. 

<P>   The attack, launched by an unknown individual or party, blocked service by
sending as many as 200 messages a second to the WebCom server, or host computer.

<P>   This specific "denial of service" attack, known as a SYN-flood, leaves the
computer unable to respond to the flood of messages, which queue up and
eventually render it unable to function at all. 

<P>   This is the same type of attack which took down a popular New York Internet
service provider, Public Access Networks Corp., or Panix, for more than a week
in September. 

<P>   When WebCom first went down, it triggered a message to company technicians
who were automatically paged by one of the company's computers monitoring the
network. 
<P>   The technicians immediately began searching for the origin of the problem. WebCom engineers contacted PSINet, the Internet service provider that supplies WebCom's connection o the Internet. Ten hours later, PSINet traced the attack's route to Internet communications lines owned y MCI Communications Corp., the nation's second-largest telecommunications company. 

<P>    MCI traced the offending messages to an Internet service provider based in
Ontario, Canada, called CANet. From there, they traced them to a small network
provider in Vancouver, British Columbia called BC.Net. 

<P>   WebCom believes the attack was launched from a BC.Net account that had been
broken into by an unknown party. Engineers were unable to stop the flood of
messages, so MCI blocked all traffic from CANet to WebCom, finally allowing
WebCom customers' sites to come back online Sunday afternoon. 

<P>   The outage was a huge blow to the customers who use WebCom as the site of
their Web-based businesses. 

<P>   "The timing was horrendous. In my situation, it's basically the largest mail
order weekend for my business," said Tina Koenig of Hollywood, Fla., who runs
Cybercalifragilistic, which sells computer-themed gift products and holiday
greeting cards that can be sent via the Internet. 

<P>   "It might be akin to placing a bomb in a retail store, preventing people from
making their purchases," she said. 

<P>   WebCom had actually experienced a similar, though shorter, attack the weekend
before, said Thomas Leavitt, WebCom's lead network engineer. That assault had
left it somewhat prepared for the weekend's breakdown. 

<P>   That's been the story throughout the Internet, said a Dale Drew, a senior
security engineer with MCI who helped WebCom trace the attack. 

<P>   SYN-flood attacks are very technically sophisticated and formerly only a few
hackers had the necessary technical skills to attempt them. But a few months ago
two hacker magazines published the source code for this type of attack and since
then at least four networks have been hit, Drew said. 

<P>   "As soon as the code was published, anyone, whether or not they had the
talent, could basically take down a network. We're seeing lots of really young
kids, 14- and 15-year-olds, who really don't have the ability to hack into the
systems themselves, but they're using this code to do it," he said. 

<P>   WebCom intends to find the person responsible, Leavitt said. 

<P>"This was a completely irresponsible act by whoever did it that inflicted
major damage upon hundreds and thousands of individuals and businesses," he
said. 

<P>   "If we can find out who it was, we will seek legal redress."

<P>AP Cyberspace Writer

<P>   The computer assault that cut WebCom's customers off from the World Wide Web
is a kind of "denial of service" attack called a "SYN-flood." 
<P>   SYN-flooding involves sending a continuous stream of forged messages to a
targeted computer, keeping it constantly busy and locking out legitimate users. 
<P>   It exploits the so-called "synchronization feature" of the transmission
control protocol, the agreed-upon set of rules by which the Internet runs. 
<P>   When users connects to a Web site, they are actually asking the computer on
which that Web site is stored to send files containing the requested Web page. 
<P>   That give and take begins with a three-stage interaction between the computer
looking for data and the computer sending data. 
<P>   When the first computer begins to talk to the second, it sends a message that
means "Hello." The second computer answers with the equivalent of, "Hello, how
are you?" 
<P>   Now that both computers have established they're listening and synchronized,
they exchange confirmation of the connection and only then do they begin to
transmit Web pages. 
<P>   In a SYN-flood attack, hackers send a series of forged messages to the
target. Because the messages are forged, they don't have a real return address
for the computer to send its "Hello, how are you?" response to. 
<P>   Because of the way the transmission control protocol is written, the computer
under attack waits -- as long as a minute -- for the second computer to respond.

<P>   Because the first computer is being flooded with these forged and
unanswerable messages -- as many as 200 a second -- its storage buffers fill up
as it struggles to complete the connection. It quickly ceases to answer new
requests for connections by legitimate users while it attempts to deal with the
congestion problem -- meaning anyone trying to access a WebCom site wouldn't get
through.

<P>AP US & World November 17, 1996 17:22:00 
 
 
<P>WASHINGTON         Two huge threats are looming before the U.S. intelligence
community as national security adviser Anthony Lake prepares to become
director of central intelligence.

<P>The first is a Marine reserve sergeant out in San Diego. Armed with a
personal computer and a network of contacts around the world, Eric Nelson
(no kin to me) has developed an E-mail system that consistently beats the
Defense Intelligence Agency's reporting on terrorism, chemical and
biological warfare, political profiles, background on hot spots, nuclear
weapons, international crime and political analysis.

<P>"He really covers the ground," says Marine Col. G. I. Wilson at the
Pentagon. "And best of all, he is quick. His secret is that he only uses
open [i.e., unclassified] sources. He has been immensely successful. All the
armed services use him."

<P>Nelson's threat to the $30 billion intelligence community? His operating
cost is about $20 a month. He pays it out of his own pocket.

<P>The second threat is Robert Steele, a retired Marine and CIA intelligence
officer who beat the CIA in a head-to-head competition devised by retired
Air Force Gen. Lew Allen.

<P>On a Thursday afternoon in 1995, Allen asked the CIA and Steele to come up
with a complete intelligence report on Burundi by 10 a.m. Monday. CIA could
use all its spies, satellites and communications intercepts; Steele could
use only open sources.

<P>"We wiped out the intelligence community," Steele says. "By Monday, they had
little more than the CIA Fact Book, which tells you Burundi exists. My
network, using [commercial information services] Lexis-Nexis, Jane's, Oxford
Analytica and some others, came up with the names of 10 top scholars
available for debriefing, maps showing areas of tribal influence and the
tribal order of battle, the most recent political and economic analysis,
100% coverage by satellite imagery and a list of all Soviet topographical
maps that could be digitalized for air operations."

<P>Allen's memory is that Steele's victory over CIA was not quite that
dramatic, but he agrees: It is astonishing how much vital intelligence
information is now instantly available from open sources.

<P>Steele's threat to the intelligence community: He believes he can shave $10
billion a year off the current intelligence budget by relying far more on
open sources. "The CIA only spends 1% of its budget on open-source
collection, and that already produces 40% of its usable product," he says.

<P>Traditional CIA secret intelligence is often counter-productive. To protect
its sources and methods, CIA often can't reveal key information  especially
to law enforcement. Its analysts are not allowed to mingle as freely as they
could with the business and academic communities.

<P>Meanwhile, the President and other intelligence "consumers" are flooded with
information from open-source CNN and print journalism that often gives them
all they need to know long before the secret sources can deliver.

<P>If the consumers could tap into Sgt. Nelson's "listserv" or Steele's Open
Source Systems, they might start wondering whether they really need a $30
billion intelligence community with all its satellites, spies and station
chiefs.

<P>But the point here is not the budget savings. It is how to get the best,
fastest and most usable intelligence without needlessly tangling our feet in
expensive cloaks and stumbling on our costly daggers. Perhaps Steele says it
best: In this age of the Internet, there's no need to send spies where a
school boy could go. Naturally, this worries the spies.

<P>   WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 (UPI) -- The long arm of U.S. law enforcement is now
reaching into cyberspace.
<P>   The Justice Department and Voice of America already have set up an
international fugitive alert service.
<P>   And now the service includes a World Wide Web site that has been switched on
for computer users and law enforcement around the world.
<P>   The department and Voice of America launched a weekly broadcast,
International Crime Alert, in August. The VOA broadcasts around the world in
about 50 languages.
<P>   Once a fugitive is featured on the broadcast, his or her photograph and
identifying information is posted on the home page of the United States
Information Agency (www.usia.gov).
<P>   In the Justice Department, the "fugitive unit" in the Office of International
Affairs will be coordinating extradition for high-profile U.S. and foreign
fugitives.
<P>   The unit is designed to work closely with a broad spectrum of law enforcement
agencies, including the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the State
Department and INTERPOL.
<P>   The fugitive unit also has its own home page (<A HREF="HTTP://www.usdoj.
gov/criminal/oiafug/fugitives.htm">http://www.usdoj.
gov/criminal/oiafug/fugitives.htm</A>).

<P>The following news report may not be republished or redistributed, in whole or
in part, without the prior written consent of Reuters Ltd.
 
<P>    NEW YORK (Reuter) - A major security flaw exists in the Internet's World
Wide Web, threatening the privacy of users' passwords, credit card numbers and
other secure information, a Princeton University professor says.
<P>     Edward Felten, of Princeton University's Safe Internet Programming Team,
says that surfers can be tricked into surrendering key information to computers
"spoofing" their favorite sites.
<P>     The story was originally released in Thurday's Boston Globe.
<P>     Felten said a malicious Web site can be created that nearly replicates an
Internet address and visual interface, thereby mirroring the site a user seeks.
 <P>    There, the unsuspecting user, when prompted, enters private information,
which is recorded by the fake site, Felten says. Or, the user might download
incorrect or virus-infected information to their computer.
<P>     The flaw applies to all major Internet browsers, Felten says, including
Netscape Communications Corp.'s Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Corp.'s
Internet Explorer.
<P>     Netscape and Microsoft were not immediately available to comment on the
report.
<P>     Felten and his Princeton team in March discovered a security flaw in Sun
Microsystems' Java programming language that would have allowed a hacker to
booby-trap a Web page and grab control over computers that connected to the
site.
<P>     Sun fixed the bug in the language, which was used in Netscape's Navigator.

<P>[Some background: many universities are contemplating or implementing "One
Card" systems whereby all of the means of identification issued by various
campus entities are consolidated to a single card, which is then used for
 access to automated service kiosks and many other purposes.  These cards
have the potential to simplify tasks and provide new services, but they
also raise very significant privacy issues, particularly when their use is
extended to include new functionalities such as opening doors and making
phone calls.  The California State University system is currently planning
a unified One Card system that would potentially apply to all of the CSU
system's 20+ campuses and 300,000+ students.  The system would be funded
by including the functionalities of a telephone calling card and a bank
debit card with the student ID card, and then allowing long-distance
phone companies and banks to bid for access to potentially 300,000+ new
customers.  The California State Student Association, which consists
of student government representatives from all of the CSU campuses, has
raised several objections to the One Card plan, and these are described in
the resolution whose text I have enclosed.  I was an invited speaker at a
CSSA meeting just before the meeting where this resolution was considered,
and I offered some advice about how certain parts of the resolution might
be framed.  The resolution itself, however, is the students' work, and I
myself do not take any position on the issue.]

Subject: One Card Resolution<BR>

<P>[...]

<P>RESOLUTION REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE CSU ONE CARD

<P>November 10, 1996

<P>Whereas,	It is not the California State University system's mission to 
provide convenience banking, long distance calling plans or debit card 
services to its students; and

<P>Whereas,	Education through public institutions should be free from 
undue influence by private industry in order to ensure the preservation of 
intellectual freedom and academic integrity; and

<P>Whereas,	The One Card potentially jeopardizes regional business 
communities thereby compromising local economies and availability of 
jobs; and

<P>Whereas,	The services promised in the One Card proposal are readily 
available in the surrounding communities, should the individual student 
desire such services; and

<P>Whereas,	Offering concession contracts to outside companies, such as 
vending and food services, could have negative impacts on the auxiliaries 
of some CSU campuses which currently derive revenue from these 
activities; and

<P>Whereas,	Current Federal and State laws are inadequate to ensure the 
security and privacy of students' confidential information and therefore put 
at risk the privacy and personal autonomy of individuals within our CSU 
community; and

<P>Whereas,	Some schools have already adopted the One Card without 
adequate student consultation; and

<P>Whereas,	The principles of consultation, open dialogue and sharing of 
information between the CSU and students need examination; therefore be 
it

<P>Resolved,	That the CSU, with adequate student participation, should 
assess and detail how One Card systems will comply with "Fair Information 
Practices"; be it further

<P>Resolved,	That a Privacy Impact Statement should be prepared to 
describe, in detail, all anticipated and unanticipated effects and outcomes 
regarding privacy as it relates to implementation of the One Card; be it 
further

<P>Resolved,	That the CSU should formally adopt a Privacy Code, which is 
developed in consultation with and the approval of the students of the CSU.  
Such a Code must not only define how privacy will be handled, but must 
also provide for a system of auditing data security as well as detailed 
penalties for violation of the Code; be it further

<P>Resolved,	That the afore mentioned Code should guarantee due process 
where information from the One Card system is used for law enforcement 
purposes or for other investigative procedures; be it further

<P>Resolved,	That the afore mentioned Code should guarantee that 
information generated by the One Card system and its vendors will be 
prohibited from unauthorized use by outside companies or use for purposes 
of creating profiles for private or commercial use either inside or outside the 
CSU; be it further

<P>Resolved,	That the CSU should provide a rational assessment of the 
application of One Card technologies and address the use of privacy 
measures such as digital cache and pseudo-identification; be it further

<P>Resolved,	That the Chancellor's office should provide CSSA with a RFP 
to conduct independent research, including on-site visits, in order to 
investigate experiences with similar information systems on other 
campuses nation-wide; be it further

<P>Resolved,	That, with the adequate consultation of its student 
government, every campus must have the independent choice to decide 
whether or not to implement the One Card; be it further

<P>Resolved,	That where implementation occurs, specific safeguards be 
included which ensure the integrity of the academic environment of our 
public school system, and which render it free from undue corporate 
influence including corporate ownership, control or profiteering through 
the use of state assets including, but not limited to, computers, card readers, 
databases, related equipment, software and information; be it further

<P>Resolved,	That the CSU administration should not use the 330,000 
students of the CSU system as a leveraging tool to attract private investment 
in the CSU's infrastructure; be it further

<P>Resolved,	For those campuses where implementation has already 
occurred, or is projected to occur, that the administration of any net 
revenues derived by the CSU or individual campuses from these ventures 
be overseen by the Student Fee Advisory Committee; be it further

<P>Resolved,	That copies of this resolution be sent to CSU Chancellor Barry 
Munitz; all CSSA Representatives; all CSU Associated Students Presidents 
and Councils; all CSU Campus Presidents; the CSU Board of Trustees; the 
Honorable Tom Hayden; the Honorable Leroy Green; the Honorable Brian 
Sentenich; the Honorable Valerie Brown; the Honorable Stephen Peace; the 
Honorable Brooks Firestone; the Honorable Margeritte Archie Hudson; the 
Honorable Cruz Bustamante; the Honorable Louis Caldera; the American 
Civil Liberties Union; Beth Givens, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse; Phil 
Agre, U.C. San Diego; and all media.</P>

<P>[I may seem like a hardened political animal, but in reality I'm a naif
who is surprised all over again every time somebody lie to me.  That's
partly because I find it more intellectually challenging to theorize about
politics without permitting myself the easy explanation that it's all a
pack of lies.  But large parts of me genuinely resist such explanations.
That's why I find the Clinton Administration's copyright policy so hard
to get my mind around.  I don't even have categories in my mind for the
kind of brazen sleaze that has issued from that quarter from the start.
The best I can understand it, Clinton, knowing full well that he couldn't
take complete control of the government, pre-sold various parts of his
Administration to the highest bidder during his campaign.  The copyright
interests purchased a controlling interest in his copyright policy; having
gotten an early start, they hit the ground running on day one.  Only the
work of a few law professors and activists kept the principle of fair use
from disappearing in the electronic domain.  Having failed to pass their
legislation in domestic politics, the copyright interests are trying to
pass an even more extreme version of that same legislation through the back
door -- as a treaty that would take precedence over US law.  This might
seem like a bizarre situation, but in reality all that's exceptional about
it is its ability to arouse indignation.  We stood by impotently while the
political action surrounding the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996 was
narrated in terms of cliff-hanging negotiations and last-minute compromises
between the RBOC's and the long distance companies, with the Senators all
hanging around in their offices, ready to sign off on whatever they came
up with.  Now we're making the awkward transition to the next level of
the privatization of the public policy process.  I am reminded of an old
Saturday Night Live parody of Dickens in which one David Copperthwaite got
his first job feeding parts of his body to dogs.]<P>

INFORMATION POLICY NOTES<BR>
December 5, 1996<BR>

<P>The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is meeting from
December 2 to 20 on three treaties that would greatly restrict the public's
rights to use information.  The following is the annoucement for a press
briefing I gave on the treaties at the United Nations, in Geneva,
thrusday, December 5, 1996.  IMHO, the briefing went well.  jamie

<P>James Love, Director, Consumer Project on Technology
Center for Study of Responsive Law, Washington, DC
In Geneva, until Sunday, at 734-9813; thereafter 01.202.387.8030

<P>     Intellectual Property is the "capital stock" of the next century, and
the rules are important -- too important to decide in a hastily convened
conference such as this WIPO meeting.  The WIPO delegates are being asked
to ratify proposals for every country, which have never been tried in any
country.

<P>     The U.S. Government, a major force pushing for the treaties, hasn't
moved the Internet copyright legislation out of a single Congressional
Committee yet, due to strong domestic opposition from a wide coalition of
data users and computer companies.  The U.S. Congress has never held a
public hearing on the database proposal, and almost no one in the U.S.
government has a clue what it actually does.  In Europe, no country has
yet found a way to implement the EU database directive, without causing a
meltdown in their domestic information industry.

<P>     The three proposals being considered at the WIPO meetings would
severely restrict the public's traditional rights to use information.  In
countless areas of controversy, they resolve thorny questions about user
rights against the users, and in favor of the new supercharged
"right-owners."

<P>     The treaties are so poorly conceived as to raise questions about the
competence of the drafters.  People are alarmed that the drafters do not
understand computers or the Internet.  No one who used and understood the
Internet would propose strict rules making RAM and temporary cache copies
of documents a presumed infringement of copyright.  No one who understands
the information industry would propose the sweeping new property rights on
facts and other public domain information (So broad that daily newspapers
would have to obtain a license to report the box scores from sporting
events).  No one who considers privacy important would have proposed
strict liability for Internet Service Providers (which would predictably
lead to very intrusive surveillance of Internet transmissions).  The early
"anti-circumvention" provisions of the treaty were so extreme that they
would have made general purpose personal computers illegal.  Errors of
these magnitude reflect a lack of understanding about the very technology
the WIPO delegates are being asked to regulate.

<P>     The Conference organizers are deliberately misleading the public
about the status of copyright law on the Internet.  Some press briefings
imply that without the treaties, rampant infringements of copyrighted
works would be legal.  This is patently false.  Courts routinely hear
cases about the application of current copyright laws on the Internet.
New issues are raised, and these issues are resolved through normal court
processes.  These treaties are not designed to bring copyright to the
Internet.  They are designed to change copyright law, and to create very
restrictive rules for the use of information.

<P>     Reports on the Internet about the WIPO proceeding illustrate the
hypocrisy of the meeting.  Faxed copies of news stories about the
conference from the New York Times, the Los Angles Times, the Financial
Times and other newspapers are widely distributed at the same WIPO meeting
where delegates seek to make similar "fair use" transmissions on the
Internet illegal.  Last month I asked a U.S. State Department official,
who was standing at a xerox machine, making a copy of an article on the
Treaty, how long the State Department could function if it didn't
routinely engage in endless coping and faxing of copyrighted materials
from U.S. and foreign sources.

<P>     News reporters are typically surrounded by stacks of faxes and xerox
copies of copyrighted materials, which are circulated without permissions
from copyright owners.  These are mostly considered "fair uses" of
copyrighted materials, and not infringements.  A zero tolerance for
unauthorized use of copyrighted materials would be a disaster for news
reporting, and for most research and management activities.

<P>     Do we really want to live in a world where governments from the U.S.
to Burma insist on precise paper trails of who receives, forwards and
shares information with whom?

<P>     The existing frameworks for copyright law in most countries is
surprisingly robust to changes in technologies, and provides a much better
framework than the untested and unbalanced treaties considered at this
diplomatic conference.

<P>     These and other issues will are being discussed.

<P>          Appendix B - Unauthorized Copying

<P>     It isn't that the Internet has led to large scale unauthorized
reproductions of copyrighted materials -- that happens every day off the
Internet.  It is simply that the Internet makes it extremely easy to
detect unauthorized reproduction of works.  For examples, thousands of
persons make unauthorized copies of cartoons with xerox machines or for
overhead slides, to decorate offices or assist in presentations.  But when
a few individuals post unauthorized copies of Far Side Cartoons on their
personal Web pages, the New York Times reports this in a page one story as
evidence that the Internet needs to be regulated.  It is only that the
Internet makes such unauthorized uses very transparent - and hence, easy
to police.  The daily examples of unauthorized reproductions of
copyrighted works (much of this appropriate and legal under current fair
use doctrine) OFF the Internet exceed that occurring ON the Internet by
staggering margins.  What is important to police are inappropriate uses of
copyrighted materials, and the current copyright law provides ample tools
to accomplish this task.</P>

<P>----------------------------------------------------------------------


<P>Subject: US Supreme Court Schedules CDA Appeal: The Showdown Begins in Jan.
<P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<P>The US Supreme Court on Friday scheduled briefing in the government's 
appeal of the 3-judge Philadelphia federal court ruling that the 
Communications Decency Act provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 
1996 are unconstitutional, in the merged ACLU v. Reno and ALA v. Dept. 
of Justice cases against the recent Internet censorship law.


<P>* Briefing Schedule for Supreme Court Appeal of CDA Constitutionality 
  Challenge (ACLU v. Reno, ALA v. DoJ merged case), as of Dec. 1996:
<P>  Jan. 21, 1997 - Appellant (government) brief due

<P>  Feb. 20, 1997 - Appellee (EFF, ACLU, ALA, CIEC, et al.) brief due

<P>  Mar. 7, 1997 - Appellant reply brief due.

<P>  Mar-Apr., 1997 - Oral arguments in the case will be scheduled


<P>It is important to note the announcement was not about whether the Supreme 
Court has chosen to review the lower court's decision in ACLU v. Reno -- 
the Court has *no choice* as to whether it will review that decision, so 
long as the government's appeal is not a frivolous one.  According to 
Article III of the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court can be compelled 
by Congress to hear certain kinds of appeals, even though normally 
Congress lets the Court set its own docket. Pursuant to Article III, the 
Telecom Act, like the Voting Rights Act and certain other legislative 
measures, grants the government an "appeal as of right" whenever a 
provision of the act is found unconstitutional by a lower court . This 
is very different from the normal petition-for-certiorari process by 
which cases normally come before the Court.  Congress intended that the
contentious provisions of the Telecom Act be settled quickly, and wrote 
provisions into the law itself to ensure this.

<P>More importantly, the Court's announcement is not any indication, 
despite CDA supporters' claims, that the Supreme Court wants to overturn
the lower court's ruling.

<P>What is significant about the news is that the Supreme Court has 
expressed 1) an interest in hearing oral arguments as well as 2) an
interest in speaking *directly* to the issues raised by the case (as
distinct from deciding the case summarily).

<P>Legal teams from both of the original, now merged, cases will continue to 
work cooperatively on countering the Justice Department's appeal.

<P>EFF remains very optimistic of the outcome of this case, as the CDA fails 
not one but *all* constitutionality tests.

<P>Subject: EFF Analysis of Draft "Database Protection" Treaty
</P>-----------------------------------------------------------

<P>Having failed to win the day in Congress, the US Administration is 
strongly pushing for international treaties to "reform" copyright law -
in ways that favor not the public interest, but a handful of commercial 
interests concerned with grabbing a property right to information itself 
- some of it information owned by you, the taxpayer. Patent and Trademark 
Commissioner Bruce Lehman, the primary architect of the would-be 
rewiring of global intellectual property law has brushed aside almost all
criticism of these measures, even from the industrial interests he 
claims would most benefit from the changes.

<P>EFF, in response to a US Commerce Dept. "Request for Comments" has analyzed
the likely effects of the GII copyright overhaul, which range from making 
it impossible to obtain public information under the Freedom of 
Information Act if that data was processed by contractors, to making it 
illegal to browse a publicly accessible web page without explicit 
permission.  EFF's response to the Commerce Dept. RFC are appended below.
EFF also submitted additional comments, as a member of the Digital Future 
Coalition. The DFC analysis is available at <A HREF="HTTP://www.dfc.org">http://www.dfc.org</A>


<P>* Background

<P>The PTO's theory has been that investment in information and communication
technology such as the Internet will be stimulated by granting more explicit 
copyright protection to online media, including an all-new, sweeping 
protection of databases that amounts to granting ownership over facts to 
those who catalog them.  The Computer and Communications Industry 
Association, which includes AT&T and Sun, begs to differ, saying that the 
draft treaties would produce a liability morass that would-be investors 
will scramble to steer clear of.  

<P>The provisions were first proposed in a Commerce Dept. "Green Paper", later 
surfacing in a "White Paper" with virtually no substantive fixes despite 
criticism from virtually all corners (see IPWG papers and critiques, 
<A HREF="HTTP://www.eff.org/pub/Intellectual_property">http://www.eff.org/pub/Intellectual_property</A>), then proposed as 
the doomed NII Copyright Act of 1996 and related US legislation (see 
<A HREF="HTTP://www.eff.org/pub/Intellectual_property/NII_copyright_bill">http://www.eff.org/pub/Intellectual_property/NII_copyright_bill</A>).

<P>At all stages, researchers and public interest organizations have drawn close
attention to the fact that the proposals would directly undermine the 
public's fair use rights, important educational excemptions, Supreme Court
precedent, and even the ability to test encryption systems. Hardly the 
way to foster increased online commerce.

<P>According to a Dec. 5 USIA report, Lehman is "mildly optimistic" that his 
end-run around Congress will succeed.  The Commissioner's single-minded 
zeal in turning controversial ideas of how copyright should be "reformed" 
for the Information Age into international law may be flagging. Lehman 
admits that the database-related provision have raised "legitimate concerns"
and appears to be taking seriously the research community's complaints 
that it would make their work difficult if not impossible.  However, the 
Administration appears completely blind to fair use concerns in their 
rush to grant businesses ownership of facts themselves.

<P>The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) considering the 
language of the draft treaties is not readily reachable by citizen advocacy.
However, should WIPO fail to heed the warnings and accept these shoddy
efforts at appeasing the database lobby at the expense of the rest of the 
world, remember that Congress rejected these proposals once. As treaties 
have to be ratified before they take effect, Congress can reject them 
again.  Please take a few moments to contact your legislators, and urge
them to reject both the WIPO Literary and Artistic Works Treaty and the 
WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Databases, should either
survive the Dec. WIPO conference and be presented to Congress for 
ratification.  Copyright may indeed need some updating, but ramrodding 
ill-conceived and already-rejected proposals down the throat of the world 
is not the way to do it.

<P>More information on the WIPO copyright "reform" is available at 
<A HREF="HTTP://www.eff.org/pub/Intellectual_property/WIPO">http://www.eff.org/pub/Intellectual_property/WIPO</A> for the basics, or

Mr. Keith M. Kupferschmid<BR>
Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks<BR>
Box 4, Patent and Trademark Office<BR>
Washington, DC  20231<BR>
<HR>
November 22, 1996<BR>

<BR>
Dear Mr. Kupferschmid,<BR>
<BR>
<P>I am writing in response to your request for comments on the Chairman's Text
of the Diplomatic Conference on Certain Copyright and Neighboring Rights 
Questions.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a civil liberties 
organization that works on issues involving personal rights and freedoms in 
digital technologies.  We are very concerned about several aspects of the 
current proposals, and we appreciate the opportunity to provide you with our 
views.


<P>Problems With the Database Treaty Proposal

<P>There are many problems with the "Sui Generis Protection of Databases"
treaty proposal.  This treaty should be taken off the agenda in Geneva 
until interested parties within the United States have had the opportunity 
to discuss and debate the serious implications of its passage.  There have 
been no public hearings on this proposal.  It is premature to take any
official U.S. stance at this time.

<P>This treaty would completely undermine the 1991 U.S. Supreme Court decision
in Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service.  In Feist, the Court 
rejected a claim of copyright for data from a telephone directory's white 
pages, finding that facts cannot be copyrighted and that obvious items, such 
as listing names, addresses, and telephone numbers in alphabetical order, 
are not sufficiently creative to qualify for copyright protection.

<P>The Feist decision was based on the grounds that facts cannot be copyrighted
or otherwise removed from the public domain.  By creating a new property 
right for facts, the treaty will impose regulations on the use of facts.  
Under the treaty, private monopolies for the maintenance of public data will 
be sanctioned, and individuals will have to pay for facts in the public 
domain.

<P>This is particularly troubling because in the United States many government
databases are maintained by private contractors.  The pieces of information 
contained within those databases rightfully are part of the public domain; 
there is no other source for this information.  The private vendors who 
receive government contracts to maintain information owned by the people 
should not be given a property interest in that government information.
Furthermore, under the proposed database treaty, the government will be 
permitted to avoid compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 
if it uses private contractors, since the contractors will be said to have 
property rights to the public information.

<P>In addition, there are problems with several definitions contained within
the treaty.  The definition of "database" is all-encompassing and will 
include many things that are not traditionally considered to be databases, 
such as collections of government documents.  The term "substantial" is 
troubling, in that it takes into account the database maintainer's 
perceived lost value in the marketplace.  Under this definition, it is 
reasonable to assume that even small portions of information used from a 
database would be considered a substantial portion of the database and 
would constitute violation of the treaty.  With no fair use rights, database
users would be precluded from using any bits of information they receive 
from a database if the database maintainer has charged for that information.

<P>It is also unclear as to when the term of protection begins to start again.  
It seems from the language of the treaty that any changes to a database 
(i.e., any addition of data) will reset the clock for protection purposes.  
This will give database maintainers an infinite copyright in their databases.

<P>The treaty also includes strong civil and criminal penalties for third-party
disseminators of this information.   Internet service providers and others 
who merely provide the conduit for communications should not be held liable 
for any unauthorized actions of their users.  Yet this treaty attempts to 
establish system operator liability under international law.

<P>Finally, as in the proposed "Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works" treaty, the database proposal is accompanied by very strict
prohibitions against the "importation, manufacture or distribution of
protection-defeating devices . . . by any person knowing or having
reasonable grounds to know that the device" may be used for
circumventing the rights created in the treaty.  This turns current
Supreme Court law (See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, 
Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984)) on its head; today a technology is 
legitimate to make, import and distribute if it has ANY legitimate uses 
-- not if ALL of its uses are legitimate.  Under this novel theory, 
common office supplies like correction fluid and scissors could be 
outlawed because they can be used to eliminate copyright markings on 
documents.  The Supreme Court made the correct call for society; the 
social good of an entire technology should not be suppressed merely 
because it causes quantifiable or alleged harm to one party.

<P>Furthermore, the "protection-defeating device" restriction obviously 
covers both reverse-engineering tools and encryption technology.  
Reverse engineering is the process of discovering exactly what a 
competitor has built by detailed examination of an end-user product.
Eliminating the legal right to reverse-engineer makes it much easier
to establish monopolies enforced by the state.  This harms society by
slowing the flow of improved products, benefiting the few at the
expense of the many.  The restriction also makes it illegal to
"crack" or seek to crack encryption systems, an essential part of 
building real security into encryption systems (including copy 
protection systems).  Only if a security system is constantly open to 
public testing and scrutiny can its worth be assured and its security 
be improved.  It's clear that this part of the law would not stop 
criminals from circumventing technical copy protection systems; the 
much larger crime they are involved in is the theft of the 
intellectual property itself.  But it would stop professors, students, 
and competitors from studying copy protection systems to analyze their 
flaws and propose improvements.  And it would prohibit consumers from 
being able to obtain products which they would use in completely legal 
and legitimate ways; for example, to recover access to their own 
encrypted files.


<P>Problems with the Literary and Artistic Works Treaty Proposal

<P>As with the "Sui Generis Protection of Databases" treaty proposal, EFF has
many concerns about the "Protection of Literary and Artistic Works" treaty 
proposal to be considered by the diplomatic conference.

<P>The way it is currently written, Article 7 would inhibit browsing on the
World Wide Web.  Article 7 requires signatories to treat temporary copies, 
such as the ephemeral random access memory (RAM) copies made on servers 
as a piece of information moves through the Internet, as a "reproduction" 
that could violate the exclusive reproduction right.  Temporary 
reproduction for technological purposes should not be given copyright 
protection.  All electronic communications would be copyright violations 
under this provision.

<P>Article 10 would substantially expand the exposure of online service
providers.  Article 10 creates a new exclusive right of communication to 
the public, which appears to be broader than either the distribution right 
or public performance right now granted by the U.S. Copyright Act.  This 
new right, when combined with Article 7's treatment of RAM copies as
reproductions, significantly increases the likelihood that an online 
service provider would be found directly liable for a subscriber's 
infringement.

<P>Article 12 would undermine many of the exceptions of the U.S. Copyright Act.
Article 12 would apparently eliminate exceptions that currently permit the 
use of copyrighted works for distance learning and performance of music in 
religious ceremonies.  These are but two examples.  It may also narrow the 
application of the fair use doctrine with respect to both commercial and 
non-commercial uses. 

<P>Article 13 contains the exact same troubling language as the proposed "Sui
Generis Protection of Databases" treaty (discussed above) that would make 
reverse-engineering and the cracking of encryption illegal.

<P>In conclusion, the Electronic Frontier Foundation believes that it is
premature for the United States to take a public stance on the issues
involved in the "Sui Generis Protection of Databases" treaty proposal.
If the United States does take a stance, we strongly urge that it
propose the rejection of the current draft.  We hope that the U.S.
delegation will pull that proposal from discussion in Geneva until a
national debate has taken place.  EFF has the same level of
reservations about the "Protection of Literary and Artistic Works"
treaty proposal in its current form.

<P>Thank you for consideration of our views on these important issues.  Please
feel free to contact me if I can provide you with any additional information.

<P>Sincerely,</P>

<P>* EFF Hosts anon.penet.fi Defense Fund

<P>As reported in previous issues of EFFector, Johan Helsingius, operator
of the (former) pseudonymous remailer anon.penet.fi will appeal a Finnish 
court ruling that Penet's thousands of users, who depended on the remailer
to protect their privacy, have no expectation of privacy under Finnish law,
in response to Church of Scientology legal actions to gain access to
the real identity of a Penet user accused of copyright infringement.  
Helsingius is also considering legal action against a UK newspaper who 
slandered the remailer and it its operator in an attempt to paint yet 
another "Internet is an evil den of child pornographers" schlock stories.
Helsingius, who has long had a policy against illegal abuse of the 
remailers services was needlessly investigated for child pornography as a 
result of the unfounded accusations - and cleared of any wrongdoing.

<P>As the US is the largest aggregate of Net users who may wish to support
Helsingius's appeal of the Finnish court's anti-privacy ruling and 
recovery of damages for defamation (of not just himself but essentially 
all privacy advocates and Internet users by implication), EFF will serve
as a clearinghouse for US donations to the Penet Legal Defense Fund.

<P>Donations may be made by sending checks or money orders to:

<P>IMPORTANT! Checks/MOs should be made out to "EFF" or "Electronic Frontier 
Foundation", and clearly marked "Penet Fund" or "Penet Legal Defense Fund"
in the note space at the bottom.  Otherwise they could be mistaken for
donations to EFF itself.  

<P>WE CANNOT PROCESS DRAFTS MADE OUT TO "PENET FUND". We would have to have 
a business license and a new account in that name.  Please also note that 
small donations such as $5 would be consumed by currency conversion fees

Penet, Finnish funds), your best bet is to contact Helsingius directly at

<P>* SPA Drops ISP Lawsuits - Code of Conduct Still Advanced

<P>In late Nov., the Software Publishers Association dropped two suits
against internet service providers (ISPs). SPA had intended to hold the 
ISPs liable for the alleged coyright infringments of users. SPA had also 
been advancing an "ISP Code of Conduct" demanding, among other things, 
the appointing of a staff member to monitor and censor not only what all 
of the ISPs customers said and posted online, but also to screen all 
pass-through Net traffic being routed through their sites.

<P>Though SPA had already dropped suit against one service provider, 
Community ConneXion, by mid-Nov., and backpeddaled from one of the other
suits so forcefully as to give the access provider what amounts a lot
of free advertising in an SPA press release about settling 
the case, the industry group curiously still proposes it's "Code" 
(renamed "ISP Guidelines for Intellectual Property Protection", 
apparently in the hope to make it sound more attractive. Industry likes 
"guidelines" it can subscribe to but bridles at being force-fed a "code 
of conduct").

<P>The ISP industry just isn't going for this ostensible carrot, and the 
SPA's stick has no sting.  The Association of Online Professionals issued
a warning to Internet access companies to avoid the SPA "Code" like the 
plague, as it undermines the ISP raison d'etre (to provide open access to 
communications) and would greatly increase ISP liability for user actions, 
with no return.  EFF analyzed the problems inherent in the "Code", and 
also criticized SPA's "kill the messenger" legal tactic of suing 
providers for the actions users beyond their control - and for such 
"crimes" as making WWW links to pages that might be infringing or even 
providing information about software cracking.  Electronic Frontiers 
Georgia proposed a counter-policy addressing the SPA document's
complete lack of any requirement that copyright infringement complainants
show any evidence that they actually have a valid claim.  

<P>As of e-press time, SPA has yet to respond to any of the above, though
their dropping of the remaining suits against ISPs is certainly a good sign.

<P>Upcoming Events<BR>
---------------

<P>This schedule lists EFF events, and those we feel might be of interest to
our members.  EFF events (those sponsored by us or featuring an EFF speaker)
are marked with a "*" instead of a "-" after the date.  Simlarly, government
events (such as deadlines for comments on reports or testimony submission,
or conferences at which government representatives are speaking) are marked
with "!" in place of the "-" ("!?" means a govt. speaker may appear, but
we don't know for certain yet.)  And likewise, "+" in place of "-"
indicates a non-USA event.  If it's a foreign EFF event with govt. people,
it'll be "*!+" instead of "-".  You get the idea.

<P>"Censorship, like charity, should begin at home; but, unlike charity, it 
should end there."<BR>
  - Clare Boothe Luce

<P>Find yourself wondering if your privacy and freedom of speech are safe 
when bills to censor the Internet are swimming about in a sea of of 
surveillance legislation and anti-terrorism hysteria?  Worried that in 
the rush to make us secure from ourselves that our government 
representatives may deprive us of our essential civil liberties? 
Concerned that legislative efforts nominally to "protect children" will 
actually censor all communications down to only content suitable for 
the playground?  Alarmed by commercial and religious organizations abusing
the judicial and legislative processes to stifle satire, dissent and 
criticism?

<P>Subject: What YOU Can Do<BR>
------------------------

<P>* The Communications Decency Act & Other Censorship Legislation

<P>The Communications Decency Act and similar legislation pose serious 
threats to freedom of expression online, and to the livelihoods of system 
operators.  The legislation also undermines several crucial privacy 
protections.  The CDA is likely to be found unconstitutional by the 
Supreme Court. But, bowing to pressure from theocratic organization,
Congress is likely to introduce and attempt to pass a slightly modified 
version.  Let your legislators know you will not stand for censorship,
nor for the wasting of millions of tax dollars on years of Supreme Court 
litigation over laws that should never have even been proposed much less 
passed in a democracy.

<P>Business/industry persons concerned should alert their corporate govt.
affairs office and/or legal counsel about such censorship measures, 
TODAY, while there is still time to plan.

<P>If you do not have full internet access (e.g. WWW), send your request
for information to <A HREF="MAILTO:ask@eff.org">ask@eff.org</A>.

<P>IMPORTANT! KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR LOCAL LEGISLATURE.  All kinds of wacky
censorious legislation is turning up at the US state and non-US 
national levels.  Don't let it sneak by you - or by the online activism 
community. Without locals on the look out, it's very difficult for the 
Net civil liberties community to keep track of what's happening locally 
as well as globally.


<P>* Find Out Who Your Congresspersons Are

<P>Writing letters to, faxing, and phoning your representatives in Congress
is one very important strategy of activism, and an essential way of
making sure YOUR voice is heard on vital issues.

<P>If you are having difficulty determining who your US legislators are,
try contacting your local League of Women Voters, who maintain a great 
deal of legislator information, or consult the free ZIPPER service
that matches Zip Codes to Congressional districts with about 85%
accuracy at:<BR>

Subject: Bloomberg letter on the WIPO treaty<BR>
Reply-To: rre-maintainers@weber.ucsd.edu

<P>[I won't beat this WIPO treaty into the ground any more.  All I can say is
that something is badly wrong when I'm getting vehement letters of protest
from such a broad spectrum of players, from scientists to phone companies,
while the responsible officials blandly deny that anything controversial
is happening.  I'm particularly annoyed at the New York Times article
the other day that basically upheld the official position that we're 
just looking at a straightforward matter of copyright versus no-copyright.
This is the article that featured Gary Larson's plea to his fans to stop
posting his cartoons on the net without permission, as if such a simple
case were all that was at stake.  Thank heavens for the Internet's ability
to circumvent this kind of propaganda, at least a little bit.]

Subject: Michael Bloomberg on WIPO database treaty

<P>From:    James Love <love@tap.org>

<P>----------------------------Original message----------------------------<BR>
The following letter by Michael R. Bloomberg, on behalf of Bloomberg L.P.,
expresses opposition to the WIPO database treaty. Bloomberg is a major
publisher of financial and business information, and one of the few U.S.
news organizations which has taken an official corporate position on the
WIPO database treaty.  (for a list of other comments on the treaty, see<BR>
<A HREF="HTTP://www.public-domain.org/database/database.html">http://www.public-domain.org/database/database.html</A>)

<P>Among the more interesting points by Mr. Bloomberg:

<P>-        Bloomberg is aware of no commercially significant piracy
         of US-owned databases that would be meaningfully reduced by
         early adoption of the proposed treaty.

<P>-        Bloomberg perceives a real danger that the legislation
         contemplated by the proposed treaty would unreasonably
         curtail access to basic factual data.

<P>-        Bloomberg is unaware of any evidence that existing
         economic incentives have proven inadequate.

Crystal Park Two<BR>

Arlington, Virginia 20231<BR>

<P>Re: Comments of Bloomberg L.P. on the Proposed Treaty for the Sui Generis<BR>
Protection of Databases

<P>Dear Ms. Lowrey

<P>This letter is submitted by Bloomberg L.P. ("Bloomberg") in response to
the October 10, 1996 Request for Comments on the Chairman's Text of the
Proposed Treaty for the Sui Generis Protection of Databases, which is
currently scheduled for consideration at a Diplomatic Conference of the
World Intellectual Property Organization ("WIPO") in Geneva December
20-20, 1996 (the "December Conference").

<P>Bloomberg appreciates this opportunity to express its views on a matter of
great importance to the United States and all the people of the world .
Being in the business of data collection and dissemination makes Bloomberg
particularly sensitive to the law as it relates to information and ideas.

<P>I. THE INTEREST OF BLOOMBERG

<P>Bloomberg collects news and information concerning business, finance,
current events, entertainment, sports, human interest stories, securities
and securities markets from a wide variety of sources and supplies this
information to customers in various ways, including over the BLOOMBERG
network, by television and radio broadcast, through books and magazines,
through seminars and conferences, and through electronic data transfer. In
so doing, Bloomberg acts both as a creator/supplier of databases and as a
consumer/user of databases maintained by others.

<P>Bloomberg supports WIPO's efforts to focus attention on the issue of
database protection but does not favor the call for immedieate adoption of
the proposed database protection treaty.

<P>II. US SUPPORT FOR ADOPTION OF THE PROPOSED TREATY WOULD BE PREMATURE
BEFORE THERE IS ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE AND FORM A CONCENSUS ON THE
UNDERLYING ISSUES.

<P>The November 14, 1996 issue of BNA's Patent, Trademark, & Copyright
Journal reports there was considerable debate about the value and
consequences of database protection at the November 12, 1996 public
briefing on the three proposed treaties to be considered at the December
Conference. The contentiousness of this issue is not surprising, given the
novelty of the concept of database protection to concerned parties in the
US.

<P>Bloomberg respectfully submits that the newness of the database proposal
and the evident uncertainty about the form an substance of the rights and
obligations it would create counsel that the database proposal should be
discussed, but not voted upon, at the December Conference.

<P>At the November 12 briefing, Chairman Liedes reportedly noted that experts
in Europe have been considering sui generis database protection for a
number of years and that the European model had its origin in domestic
laws of the Nordic countries. These issues have received dramatically
less, if any, attention in the US, where such distinctive factors as the
Patent and Copyright Clause of the Constitution require particular and
careful public evaluation.

<P>III. THERE IS NO APPARENT REASON TO RUSH TO A VOTE ON THE DATABASE
PROPOSAL.

<P>Bloomberg is unaware of any commercial or technological threat requiring
the current rush to adopt the proposed treaty.

<P>The treaty's proponents apparently argue that the European community's
"Database Directive" contemplates national legislation in the EC that
would discriminate against database proprietors in countries without
comparable domestic legislation. This would not seem to threaten existing
rights of US database proprietors and, in any event, only adoption of
domestic US legislation would address this issue. Although such
legislation was recently introduced into the House, no comparable bill has
been introduced in the Senate and the subject seems to have attracted
little public attention, suggesting there is no urgency to enactment of
such legislation.

<P>The treaty's proponents also point to the threat of international piracy.
However, Bloomberg is aware of no commercially significant piracy of
US-owned databases that would be meaningfully reduced by early adoption of
the proposed treaty.

<P>Bloomberg finds the existing combination of copyright law, contractual
limitations, administrative practices and technological security to be
adequate at present to protect its commercial interests. Bloomberg
believes these existing protections also are likely to suffice during the
time needed for careful evaluation and public debate of the need for sui
generis database protection.

<P>IV. PRECIPITOUS ACTION COULD UPSET THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF
DATABASE PROPRIETORS AND BROADER SOCIETAL INTERESTS IN THE FREE FLOW OF
INFORMATION.

<P>Bloomberg perceives a real danger that the legislation contemplated by the
proposed treaty would unreasonably curtail access to basic factual data.
Such concerns clearly have been expressed by the scientific and academic
communities. Scientific, political and cultural progress all depend on
access to information, increasingly on a global scale. Given the complete
absence of evidence that the flow of such information is inhibited by the
absence of the proposed treaty, care should be taken to ensure the
proposal will help rather than hinder the advancement of science and other
important societal interests.

<P>Around the world, intellectual property protection generally embodies the
notion of a limited monopoly on creative expression or novel inventions in
order to create an economic incentive to create useful works that will
eventually be dedicated to the public. Sound public policy should ensure
that the monopoly conferred is no greater than is necessary to create the
desired incentives. However, Bloomberg is unaware of any evidence that
existing economic incentives have proven inadequate.

<P>CONCLUSION

<P>For the foregoing reasons, Bloomberg respectfully submits that the US
should support discussion of the proposed database treaty at the December
Conference but oppose any effort to bring the treaty to a vote and, if a
vote is nonetheless taken, the US should oppose adoption of the treaty at
this time.

<P>Respectfully submitted,

<P>BLOOMBERG L.P.

<P>Michael R. Bloomberg

<B>Introduction</B><BR>
============<BR>

<P>The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer
viruses and Trojans. However, interspersed among real virus notices are 
computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are 
still time consuming and costly to handle. At CIAC, we find that we are 
spending much more time de-bunking hoaxes than handling real virus
incidents. This advisory addresses the most recent warnings that have
appeared on the Internet and are being circulated throughout world today. We
will also address the history behind virus hoaxes, how to identify a hoax,
and what to do if you think a message is or is not a hoax. Users are
requested to please not spread unconfirmed warnings about viruses and
Trojans. If you receive an unvalidated warning, don't pass it to all your
friends, pass it to your computer security manager to validate first.
Validated warnings from the incident response teams and antivirus vendors
have valid return addresses and are usually PGP signed 
with the organization's key.</P>

<B>PKZ300 Warning</B><BR>
==============<BR>

<P>The PKZ300 Trojan is a real Trojan program, but the initial warning about it
was released over a year ago. For information pertaining to PKZ300 Trojan 
reference CIAC Notes issue 95-10, that was released in June of 1995.  

<P><A HREF="HTTP://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes10.shtml">http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes10.shtml</A>

<P>The warning itself, on the other hand, is gaining urban legend status. There
has been an extremely limited number of sightings of this Trojan and those 
appeared over a year ago. Even though the Trojan warning is real, the
repeated circulation of the warning is a nuisance. Individuals who need the
current release of  PKZIP should visit the PKWARE web page at
<A HREF="HTTP://www.pkware.com">http://www.pkware.com. </A>

<P>CIAC recommends that you DO NOT recirculate the warning about this
particular 
Trojan.    </P>      

<B>Irina Virus Hoax</B><BR>
================<BR>

<P>The "Irina" virus warnings are a hoax. The former head of an electronic 
publishing company circulated the warning to create publicity for a new 
interactive book by the same name. The publishing company has apologized for
the publicity stunt that backfired and panicked Internet users worldwide.
The original warning claimed to be from a Professor Edward Pridedaux of the 
College of Slavic Studies in London; there is no such person or college. 
However, London's School of  Slavonic and East European Studies has been 
inundated with calls. This poorly thought-out publicity stunt was highly 
irresponsible. For more information pertaining to this hoax, reference the 
UK Daily Telegraph at <A HREF="HTTP://www.telegraph.co.uk">http://www.telegraph.co.uk. </A>   </P>

<B>Good Times Virus Hoax</B><BR>
=====================<BR>

<P>The "Good Times" virus warnings are a hoax. There is no virus by that name
in existence today. These warnings have been circulating the Internet for
years. The user community must become aware that it is unlikely that a virus
can be constructed to behave in the manner ascribed in the "Good Times"
virus warning. For more information related to this urban legend, reference
CIAC Notes 95-09.

<P><A HREF="HTTP://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes09.shtml">http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes09.shtml</A></P>
    
<B>Deeyenda Virus Hoax</B><BR>
===================<BR>

<P>The "Deeyenda" virus warnings are a hoax. CIAC has received inqueries 
regarding the validity of the Deeyenda virus. The warnings are very similar 
to those for Good Times, stating that the FCC issued a warning about it, 
and that it is self activating and can destroy the contents of a machine 
just by being downloaded. Users should note that the FCC does not and will 
not issue virus or Trojan warnings. It is not their job to do so. As of this
date, there are no known viruses with the name Deeyenda in existence. For a 
virus to spread, it  must be executed. Reading a mail message does not
execute the mail message. Trojans and viruses have been found as executable
attachments to mail messages, but they must be extracted and executed to do
any harm. CIAC still affirms that reading E-mail, using typical mail agents,
can not activate malicious code delivered in or with the message.</P>

<B>Ghost.exe Warning</B><BR>
=================<BR>

<P>The Ghost.exe program was originally distributed as a free screen saver 
containing some advertising information for the author's company (Access 
Softek). The program opens a window that shows a Halloween background with 
ghosts flying around the screen. On any Friday the 13th, the program window 
title changes and the ghosts fly off the window and around the screen.
Someone apparently got worried and sent a message indicating that this might
be a  Trojan. The warning grew until the it said that Ghost.exe was a Trojan
that  would destroy your hard drive and the developers got a lot of nasty
phone calls (their names and phone numbers were in the About box of the
program.) A simple phone call to the number listed in the program would have
stopped  this warning from being sent out. The original ghost.exe program is
just cute; it does not do anything damaging. Note that this does not mean
that ghost could not be infected with a virus that does do damage, so the
normal antivirus procedure of scanning it before running it should be
followed.</P>

<B>History of Virus Hoaxes</B><BR>
=======================<BR>

<P>Since 1988, computer virus hoaxes have been circulating the Internet. In 
October of that year, according to Ferbrache ("A pathology of Computer 
Viruses" Springer, London, 1992) one of the first virus hoaxes was the 
2400 baud modem virus: <BR>

<B>        SUBJ: Really Nasty Virus<BR>
        AREA: GENERAL (1)</B>
        
<P>        I've just discovered probably the world's worst computer virus 
        yet. I had just finished a late night session of BBS'ing and file 
        treading when I exited Telix 3 and attempted to run pkxarc to 
        unarc the software I had downloaded. Next thing I knew my hard 
        disk was seeking all over and it was apparently writing random 
        sectors. Thank god for strong coffee and a recent backup. 
        Everything was back to normal, so I called the BBS again and 
        downloaded a file. When I went to use ddir to list the directory, 
        my hard disk was getting trashed again. I tried Procomm Plus TD 
        and also PC Talk 3. Same results every time. Something was up so I 
        hooked up to my test equipment and different modems (I do research 
        and development for a local computer telecommunications company 
        and have an in-house lab at my disposal). After another hour of 
        corrupted hard drives I found what I think is the world's worst 
        computer virus yet. The virus distributes itself on the modem sub-
        carrier present in all 2400 baud and up modems. The sub-carrier is 
        used for ROM and register debugging purposes only, and otherwise 
        serves no othr (sp) purpose. The virus sets a bit pattern in one 
        of the internal modem registers, but it seemed to screw up the 
        other registers on my USR. A modem that has been "infected" with 
        this virus will then transmit the virus to other modems that use a 
        subcarrier (I suppose those who use 300 and 1200 baud modems 
        should be immune). The virus then attaches itself to all binary 
        incoming data and infects the host computer's hard disk. The only 
        way to get rid of this virus is to completely reset all the modem 
        registers by hand, but I haven't found a way to vaccinate a modem 
        against the virus, but there is the possibility of building a 
        subcarrier filter. I am calling on a 1200 baud modem to enter this 
        message, and have advised the sysops of the two other boards 
        (names withheld). I don't know how this virus originated, but I'm 
        sure it is the work of someone in the computer telecommunications 
        field such as myself. Probably the best thing to do now is to 
        stick to 1200 baud until we figure this thing out.

<P>This bogus virus description spawned a humorous alert by Robert Morris III :</P>

        Date: 11-31-88 (24:60)  Number: 32769<BR>
        To: ALL Refer#: NONE<BR>
        From: ROBERT MORRIS III Read: (N/A)<BR>
        Subj: VIRUS ALERT       Status: PUBLIC MESSAGE<BR>
        
<P>        Warning: There's a new virus on the loose that's worse than 
        anything I've seen before! It gets in through the power line, 
        riding on the powerline 60 Hz subcarrier. It works by changing the 
        serial port pinouts, and by reversing the direction one's disks 
        spin. Over 300,000 systems have been hit by it here in Murphy, 
        West Dakota alone! And that's just in the last 12 minutes.
        
<P>        It attacks DOS, Unix, TOPS-20, Apple-II, VMS, MVS, Multics, Mac, 
        RSX-11, ITS, TRS-80, and VHS systems.
        
<P>        To prevent the spresd of the worm:</P>
        
        1) Don't use the powerline.<BR>
        2) Don't use batteries either, since there are rumors that this 
          virus has invaded most major battery plants and is infecting the 
          positive poles of the batteries. (You might try hooking up just 
          the negative pole.)<BR>
        3) Don't upload or download files.<BR>
        4) Don't store files on floppy disks or hard disks.<BR>
        5) Don't read messages. Not even this one!<BR>
        6) Don't use serial ports, modems, or phone lines.<BR>
        7) Don't use keyboards, screens, or printers.<BR>
        8) Don't use switches, CPUs, memories, microprocessors, or 
          mainframes.<BR>
        9) Don't use electric lights, electric or gas heat or 
          airconditioning, running water, writing, fire, clothing or the 
          wheel.<BR>
        
<P>        I'm sure if we are all careful to follow these 9 easy steps, this 
        virus can be eradicated, and the precious electronic flui9ds of 
        our computers can be kept pure.
        
<P>        ---RTM III

<P>Since that time virus hoaxes have flooded the Internet.With thousands of 
viruses worldwide, virus paranoia in the community has risen to an extremely

high level. It is this paranoia that fuels virus hoaxes. A good example of 
this behavior is the "Good Times" virus hoax which started in 1994 and is 
still circulating the Internet today. Instead of spreading from one computer

to another by itself, Good Times relies on people to pass it along. </P>

<B>How to Identify a Hoax</B><BR>
======================<BR>

<P>There are several methods to identify virus hoaxes, but first consider what 
makes a successful hoax on the Internet. There are two known factors that
make a successful virus hoax, they are: (1) technical sounding language, and
(2) credibility by association. If the warning uses the proper technical 
jargon, most individuals, including technologically savy individuals, tend
to believe the warning is real. For example, the Good Times hoax says that 
"...if the program is not stopped, the computer's processor will be placed
in an nth-complexity infinite binary loop which can severely damage the 
processor...". The first time you read this, it sounds like it might be 
something real. With a little research, you find that there is no such thing
s an nth-complexity infinite binary loop and that processors are designed 
to run loops for weeks at a time without damage.
When we say credibility by association we are referring to whom sent the 
warning. If the janitor at a large technological organization sends a
warning to someone outside of that organization, people on the outside tend
to believe the warning because the company should know about those things.
Even though the person sending the warning may not have a clue what he is
talking about, the prestigue of the company backs the warning, making it
appear real. If a manager at the company sends the warning, the message is
doubly backed by the company's and the manager's reputations. 

<P>Individuals should also be especially alert if the warning urges you to pass
it on to your friends. This should raise a red flag that the warning may be 
a hoax. Another flag to watch for is when the warning indicates that it is a

<P>Federal Communication Commission (FCC) warning. According to the FCC, they 
have not and never will disseminate warnings on viruses. It is not part of 
their job. 

<P>CIAC recommends that you DO NOT circulate virus warnings without first 
checking with an authoritative source. Authoritative sources are your
computer system security administrator or a computer incident advisory team.
Real warnings about viruses and other network problems are issued by
different response teams (CIAC, CERT, ASSIST, NASIRC, etc.) and are
digitally signed by the sending team using PGP. If you download a warning
from a teams web site or validate the PGP signature, you can usually be
assured that the warning is real. Warnings without the name of the person
sending the original notice, or warnings with names, addresses and phone
numbers that do not actually exist are probably hoaxes.</P>

<B>What to Do When You Receive a Warning</B><BR>
=====================================<BR>
 
<P>Upon receiving a warning, you should examine its PGP signature to see that
it is from a real response team or antivirus organization. To do so, you
will need a copy of the PGP software and the public signature of the team
that sent the message. The CIAC signature is available from the CIAC web
server at:

<P><A HREF="HTTP://ciac.llnl.gov">http://ciac.llnl.gov</A>

<P>If there is no PGP signature, see if the warning includes the name of the 
person submitting the original warning. Contact that person to see if he/she
really wrote the warning and if he/she really touched the virus. If he/she
is passing on a rumor or if the address of the person does not exist or if 
there is any questions about theauthenticity or the warning, do not
circulate it to others. Instead, send the warning to your computer security
manager or incident response team and let them validate it. When in doubt,
do not send it out to the world. Your computer security managers and the
incident response teams teams have experts who try to stay current on
viruses and their warnings. In addition, most anti-virus companies have a
web page containing information about most known viruses and hoaxes. You can
also call or check the web site of the company that produces the product
that is supposed to contain the virus.

<P>Checking the PKWARE site for the current releases of PKZip would stop the 
circulation of the warning about PKZ300 since there is no released version 3
of PKZip. Another useful web site is the "Computer Virus Myths home page" 
(<A HREF="HTTP://www.kumite.com/myths/">http://www.kumite.com/myths/</A>) which contains descriptions of several known hoaxes. In most cases, common sense would eliminate Internet hoaxes.

<P>The views expressed in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official
    policy or position of the Department of the Army, the Department of Defense, or the U.S.

<P>Armies historically have been criticized for preparing for the last war. Since the early 1980s,
however, the U.S. Army has broken this pattern and created a force capable of winning the next
war. But, in an era characterized by a volatile international security environment, accelerating
technological advances (particularly in acquiring, processing, and disseminating information), the
emergence of what some are calling a "revolution in military affairs," and forecasts of increasingly
constrained fiscal resources, it seems ill-advised to plan only for the "next Army."

<P>The purpose of this monograph, therefore, is to begin the debate on the "Army After Next."
Initiating such a discussion requires positing the outlines of future security conditions and the Army's
role in that environment. This also means challenging convictions that provide much of the basis for
the "current Army," as well as some of the assumptions that undergird planning for the "next Army."

<P>The authors recognize that not all will agree with their assumptions, analysis, or conclusions. Their
efforts, however, are not intended to antagonize. Rather, they seek to explore the premises which
will shape thinking about the "Army After Next." The ensuing exchange of ideas, they hope, will
help create a force that can continue to be called upon to serve the interests of the Nation in an as
yet uncertain future.

<P>The Strategic Studies Institute strongly encourages readers to participate in a continuing discussion
on the future of American landpower and the challenges it holds for the U.S. Army.</P>

<CENTER><P>                                <B>SUMMARY</B></CENTER>

<P>The global security system of the early 21st century will be configured into three tiers, each defined
by economic form and degree of governability. The first tier will include the technologically
advanced states of Western Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim. Intense economic
competition may occasionally lead to political conflict and even spark full-blown information
warfare, but there will be no traditional warfare within the first tier. Second tier regions will retain
most features of Cold War era nation-states. Periods of rapid internal political transition will occur
cyclically and often will be violent. Second tier states may occasionally resort to conventional,
inter-state war, and will retain large land armies equipped with some sophisticated weapons
systems. Many of them will develop weapons of mass destruction. The third tier will experience un-
governability, occasional anarchy, endemic violence, severe ecological degradation, the
politicization of primal loyalties, and political fragmentation. Third tier states may engage in short,
spasmodic wars with each other.

<P>Interdependence will be the defining characteristic of the future global security system. Because of
interdependence, the global security system will continue to experience cycles with periods
dominated by violence followed by widespread resolution of conflicts. The goal of the United
States, the only power involved everywhere, will be to take maximum advantage of periods of
peaceful conflict resolution and shorten periods of violence. American landpower can play a key
role in these efforts.

<P>While the internal dimension of American security will probably change less over coming decades
than the external one, several trends are important. Political leaders and the public are likely to
remain intolerant of protracted or costly military ventures except when crucial national interests are
clearly threatened. Pressure for near total disengagement from the third tier will be particularly
strong.

<P>If the future security environment takes the form just described, five strategic challenges will be
most important for the Army:

<P>Reconcile long-term and short-term imperatives. Strategists must maximize the chances of
long-term success while minimizing short-term risk. If the future global security system is relatively
benign, the Army can minimize the resources it devotes to long-term modernization and force
development. But if conflict dominates the future global security system, the United States must
accept greater short-term risk and focus on force development and modernization. Current
American strategy may be slightly skewed in favor of the short term.

<P>Maximize efficiency. American military forces will remain small in comparison to the number and
scope of tasks they will be given. This creates an overriding need for efficiency. One way to
augment efficiency is through coalitions. Technology probably holds greater promise of bringing
dramatic improvements in efficiency, but it requires extensive investment. Reliance on technology
also can generate unintended adverse effects. New technology can make current (and expensive)
technology obsolescent. Or, challengers might seek low-tech, asymmetric responses to
counterbalance the American advantage.

<P>Maximize the political utility of landpower. A military force has political utility when political
leaders and the public deem the expected costs acceptable. It is impossible to predict precisely
what the American public and its leaders will define as acceptable costs in coming decades, but
Army leaders must be aware that this fluid equation can change rapidly, and the type of force they
create, train, and equip must, in part, be determined by the need to maximize political utility. 

<P>Undertake a controlled institutional revolution. The historical boundaries of landpower may be
stretched as the basic concept of national security expands to include, e.g., protection against
violent threats to national information and information systems, the environment, and public health.
The Army must decide whether to expand and accept the new roles of landpower or specialize in
one or two functions and allow some other institution to assume the new roles. Phrased differently,
the Army will have to decide whether warfighting is the function for which it exists or simply one
function (albeit an important one) among several.

<P>While the need for a controlled institutional revolution in the U.S. Army is becoming clear, its
precise direction is not so obvious. If the functions of landpower continue to diverge in terms of the
skills, concepts, and organizations they require, it will become increasingly difficult to craft a military
organization that can perform all of its required tasks. If tasks other than warfighting become more
strategically important, the relationship between the Army's warfighting component and its peace
operations/ conflict resolution/grey area threat component may need radical change.

<P>Preserve public support for effective landpower. To retain the public support necessary for
continued investment in landpower and for recruiting from a shrinking pool of candidates, senior
Army leaders must persistently and convincingly explain the roles that landpower plays in deterring
violence, defending against aggression that does occur, reassuring allies and friends, and helping
resolve conflicts.

<P>As senior Army leaders explain the enduring significance of landpower to political leaders, the
media, and the public, they must counter several popular myths concerning American strategy and
the role of landpower plays in it.
<UL>
     <P>The United States can disengage from the conflict prone parts of the world, thereby
     obviating the need for direct involvement.

     <P>The world will see no more conventional wars.

     <P>Allies or international organizations can compensate for a decline in U.S. ground forces.

     <P>Landpower can be allowed to atrophy during the current period of fragmented threat, and
     be reconstituted if necessary.
</UL>
<P>The current Army leadership recognizes the need for fundamental change. But this is only the first
(and easiest) step. The next one is to reach consensus on exactly what the most pressing strategic
challenges are. This essay suggests five. The development of coherent programs to deal with these
challenges is the greatest legacy that the 20th century Army can leave the nation.</P>

<P>Featuring original investigation, reporting and
analysis, SOURCES BRIEFINGS is published by the same staff that produces
SOURCES eJOURNAL, the ONLY all-original electronic report on international
intelligence issues

<P>"Our stories and briefs are prepared by seasoned veteran correspondents and
intelligence and military analysts who provide exclusive, breaking
intelligence that will put you in front of the power curve," states
Publisher Glenn EJM Davis.

<P>SOURCES BRIEFINGS is already stacking up as a unique and highly focused
medium where subscribers get regular, hard-hitting, information-packed work
every two weeks. Says Managing Editor Anthony L. Kimery (formerly
Washington correspondent for the Paris-based Intelligence Newsletter), "We
cover everything from terrorism to the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction; from organized crime to political crime; from behind the
scenes views of covert operations to the back-door wheeling and dealing of
defense contractors."

<P>SOURCES BRIEFINGS Issue I, Volume 1 reports on TERRORISM at home and
abroad: the threat of gang violence escalating to fifth column status in
the US with the help of agents of IRAN and the Nation of Islam; Mexican
GANGS living next to the US border receiving arms from sources in the
Middle East; SMUGGLERS coming across the Mexican border carrying
sophisticated weapons in back packs; PLO preparations for war; a senior
cleric in Iran issuing a "fatwa" threatening the government of Saudi
Arabia; the Iraqi state-run English language daily, Kayan International,
warning if "America's traditional disrespect for Muslim civilian life [does
not stop] without further delay... Muslims will be forced to find other
ways to make this point clear to US. leaders... and more.

<P>In BRIEFINGS section, COLLECTION, domestic imagery is reportedly at risk by
the Whitewater investigation. Other articles discuss a counterintelligence
investigation at the White House, a Congressional review of SAPS (Special
Access Programs - military black bag operations); and the relevancy of the
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

<P>Under COVERT OPS, SOURCES BRIEFINGS examines CIA and House Banking
Committee probes of MENA and together with an Inslaw Update, expands on
SOURCES eJOURNAL's year-long coverage of these two currently breaking
stories. Look for information on the Pentagon's new spy agency; CIA's
handling of NOCs (Non-Official Cover organizations); a morale problem in
Special Forces; and secret U.S. arms caches in Europe.

<P>Under ORGANIZED CRIME, and DRUG TRAFFICKING & MONEY LAUNDERING, are reports
on US. concerns about growing Russian corruption, and DEA probes that have
recently re-activated Barry Seal's bank accounts. Under FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
SOURCES BRIEFINGS looks at Israel's secret PLO deals; secret meetings between
Israel and Jordan; danger facing Netanyahu in Egypt; Japan's negotiations
to remove Futenma Air Base... and more.

<P>SOURCES BRIEFINGS is published by SOURCES eJOURNAL, an on-line magazine
covering information, disinformation and intelligence featuring all
original reporting. The look and feel of the magazine calls to mind classic
journals like Harper's and Saturday Review. Recently SOURCES eJOURNAL was
awarded an OMNI Magazine Omnivision Award for Excellence in On-line
Journalism, and is listed at the top of USA Today's Interesting Places To
Go.


<P>SOURCES eJOURNAL can be accessed on the World Wide Web
(http://www.dso.com). SOURCES BRIEFINGS is available by fax or email at an
annual rate of $395. A semi-annual subscription is $250; a quarterly
subscription, $150. A pre-publication sample of SOURCES BRIEFINGS is
currently available for the asking.

<P>For samples and subscription information please email Joshua Rinsky at
sales@dso.com, or call (415) 981-6411; mail checks to DSO, Inc., 601 Van
Ness Ave., #E3425, SF CA 94102.

To be exploited and oppressed by your boss. Derived from the experiences of

The old man
revised the specs for the fourth time this week."

<B><P>Link Rot<BR></B>
The process by which links on a web page became as obsolete as the  sites
they're connected to change location or die.

<B><P>Chip Jewelry<BR></B>
A euphemism for old computers destined to be scrapped or turned into
 decorative ornaments. "I paid three grand for that 286, and now it's
 nothing but chip jewelry."

<B><P>Crapplet<BR></B>
A badly written or profoundly useless Java applet. "I just wasted 30  minutes
downloading this stinkin' crapplet!"

<B><P>Plug-and-Play<BR></B>
A new hire who doesn't need any training. "The new guy, John, is  great. He's
totally plug-and-play."

<B><P>World Wide Wait<BR></B>
The real meaning of WWW.

<B><P>CGI Joe<BR></B>
A hard-core CGI script programmer with all the social skills and  charisma of
a plastic action figure.

<B><P>Dorito Syndrome<BR></B>
Feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction triggered by addictive  substances
that lack nutritional content. "I just spent six hours  surfing the Web, and
now I've got a bad case of Dorito Syndrome."

<B><P>Under Mouse Arrest<BR></B>
Getting busted for violating an online service's rule of conduct.  "Sorry I
couldn't get back to you. AOL put me under mouse arrest."

<B><P>Glazing<BR></B>
Corporate-speak for sleeping with your eyes open.  A popular pastime  at
conferences and early-morning meetings. "Didn't he notice that half  the room
was glazing by the second session?"

<B><P>404<BR></B>
Someone who's clueless. From the World Wide Web message "404, URL Not Found,"
meaning that the document you've tried to access can't be located. "Don't

mention of your name.

fart on the Mitnik  bust?" Variation of old hacker slang that had more
negative connotations.

there any other terminals I can use? This one has a  bad case of keyboard
plaque."

Losing one's train of thought. Occurs when the person you are  speaking with
won't let you get a word in edgewise or has just said something so
astonishing that your train gets derailed. "Damn,  I just blew my buffer!"

<BR>
<P>Venue: University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland

<P>Date: June 20th - 21st 1997

<P>Sponsored by the Institution of Electrical Engineers, IEEE Society on
Social Implications of Technology , IEEE UK and Republic of Ireland
Section and IEEE Region 8 .

<P><B>CALL FOR PAPERS</B>

<P>The last decade has seen immense change in the world, and in Europe in
particular. The social and technical landscape is altering so far and
so fast, that it is almost impossible to keep track. What effect will
this have on industrial and developing societies? How will it effect
the natural environment? What effect will these changes have on
technologists and engineers? How will this change into the new
millennium? ISTAS '97 aims to tackle these questions and draw together
opinion from both sides of the Atlantic, as ISTAS moves to Europe for
the first time in its history.

<P>Papers are particularly encouraged on the following topics:</P>

<B>GENRAL INFORMATION</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>We warmly invite you to participate in ECSCW'97, the Fifth European
Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work.
<P>The success of ECSCW'97 depends upon you submitting your work for
consideration. We encourage submissions from researchers and practitioners
in academia, industry, consulting or government on topics related to the
theory, practice, design or support for collaborative work. ECSCW is an
international conference; we welcome submissions from all countries.
Papers, tutorials, workshops, posters, videos and demonstrations of
original CSCW work will be presented and debated over the five days of the
conference. With the exploding interest in networked computers the
conference will be an important forum for the presentation and discussion
of the state of the art and future visions for Computer Supported
Cooperative Work.

<P>CSCW is a multidisciplinary area surrounding the use of computers to
support cooperative work. The community encompasses interests in systems
development and design, the theory and practice of CSCW, the installation
and use of CSCW systems, the application of novel technologies and the
relation between the social and the technical. Submissions from all areas
of CSCW are welcome. Possible topics include (but are not limited to):</P>

        Development of novel cooperative applications<BR>
        Empirical studies of cooperative work<BR>
        Evaluation techniques  for cooperative systems<BR>
        Impact of technologies on individuals, organisations  and society<BR>
        Innovative technologies to support cooperative work<BR>
        Integrative reviews of specific aspects of CSCW<BR>
        Methodology and tools for the analysis of cooperative work<BR>
        Technologies of architectures to support cooperative work<BR>
        Theories of coordination and collaboration<BR>
<BR>
<P>The language of the conference is English. All submissions should be in
English, in the correct format, including full contact details for the
primary contact, and will only be accepted on paper.

<P>Lancaster, Gateway to the English Lakes, is the venue for ECSCW'97.
Lancaster is an historic city with magnificent buildings including a
medieval castle and Benedictine priory, as well as superb views of the
surrounding coast and mountains. With Manchester International Airport just
an hour away it also has excellent communications.

<P>Even if you do not plan to submit work to the conference we hope that you
will attend. Put the dates on your calendar now! We look forward to
welcoming you to Lancaster in September 1997.<BR>

submitting questions must be able and willing to ask their questions during
the Question Time session.


<P><B>STUDENT VOLUNTEERS</B>

<P>The smooth running of the Conference will depend on student volunteers.
Full-time students are invited to apply to act as Student Volunteers. They
will receive free registration, optional cheap accommodation, and an end of
Conference party in exchange for approximately 20 hours work during the
conference. Please apply to Stephen Viller, Student Volunteers Chair,  at
the Conference Office address above, or email viller@comp.lancs.ac.uk

December 09 1996<BR>
<BR>
<P>You recall that at the beginning of October, Vice President Gore made an announcement  that the Administration offered a compromise that would permit computer companies  to export data scrambling (encryption) software  with a hitch; the companies had to agree to establish systems that would enable keys to the codes, be given to law enforcement officials with a court warrant. 

<P>The compromise is in a precarious state as the numbers of American companies are rejecting it. One of the companies, IBM who had a major part in brokering the compromise, is having second thoughts because the Administration has not kept up with their part of the bargain relevant to the compromise.  IBM officials aren't talking but other computer software companies are beginning to get vocal.

<P>Roel Pieper, chief executive  and vice chairman of Tandem Computers based in Cupertino, California told the NY Times, "We really feel that there has been a bait and switch situation and I'm not going to be silent about it.  The Government is mortgaging the future of the computer industry."  Tandem products are widely used in the banking industry and other markets.

<P>Sun Microsystems, another major player in the encryption software business who previous supported the compromise with major reservations, is now opposing it.  

<P>The compromise included a plan for transferring oversight of data-scrambling export from the State Department to the Commerce Dept.  Computer companies see the Commerce Dept. as more supportive of American business and industry.

<P>A number of computer companies had viewed the compromise with the Administration as better than years of impasse between the industry and Government on the issue of exporting encryption software.  On November 15, an executive order was signed.  Within that document, the government officials will be given the upper hand in delivering the key-recovery system.  The order prescribes a system that may permit law enforcement officials to unscramble messages while transmission is active rather than after as the previous compromise stated. The order also has another downside.  It indicated that requests for export while being reviewed, would not take into account whether technology comparables were already in place overseas.  It had been expected by the industry that foreign availability would be a prime consideration.  Such is the case when the Dept. of Commerce reviews exports of high technology products.

<P>Vice President Gore was sent a letter by the Business Software Alliance.  The BSA based out of DC, represents major software publishers. The letter stated that the Alliance felt the Administration was going in the wrong direction on the issue of data encryption. Second VP of BSA, Robert W. Holleyman 2nd, told the NY Times, "It appears that significant backtracking has occurred since the October 1 announcement, and therefore, we seriously doubt that the regulations will work, meet consumer commands, or be accepted by the private sector unless the Administration changes its approach immediately."

<P>It has been reported, unofficially, that a group of computer manufacturers met earlier this past week at the White House.  One person described the session as rather "difficult."  The group met to discuss the executive order and the draft regulations that will be issued by the Government by the end of the year.  

<P>At the present time, these data scrambling technologies are becoming critical as foreign and US companies rush to develop  electronic commerce systems that will be utilized over the Internet. Computer and telephone communications without fear of eavesdropping are a hot item.

<P>The development director of Internet security for Hewlett-Packard, Doug McGowan, stated "We do understand that the Government has legitimate concerns, but what we care about is that we can compete on a global scale with our products.  We will yell loud and clear if it gets to a point where we can't."

<P>Where is all this going?  Hard to say now....but it does not look good. Where we go from here on this issue will have a bearing on American technologies.  Let's hope the Administration reviews this carefully and overturns the executive order.  A compromise was reached.  Let's go with the compromise!!  Or,  what we will have all over again?  C L I P P E R....</P>

December 07, 1996<BR><BR>

<P>     The US Army Peacekeeping Institute (PKI) participated in this 
     conference, the following report is submitted.
     
     
<P>     "Peacekeeping in Europe and Europeans in Peacekeeping" sponsored by 
     the UN Training School, Ireland, 19 November 1996.   
     
<P>        a.  Session I, "Peacekeeping Since the Cold War,"  Professor 
     Halliday.  He made the following points to outline the changes in 
     peacekeeping since the Cold War:
     
<P>                -  Peacekeeping operations (PKOs) have proliferated.  The 
     focus has  shifted from third world to Europe with OSCE alone involved 
     in 10 operations.          In addition, there has been a change in 
     character--more robust ROE and greater     involvement of the great 
     powers.
     
<P>                -  Kuwait gave a strong impetus to PKOs--especially the 
     intervention in    northern Iraq to help the Kurds and the precedent 
     of safe havens.  Much of this      was crystallized in the Secretary 
     General's 1992 "Agenda for Peace"--which also      stimulated 
     preventative diplomacy/deployments (as in Macedonia) and post      
     conflict peace building to "unfreeze the situation."  His advocacy of 
     a standing         force and better financing are still current 
     issues. 
     
<P>                -  The lessons of Bosnia are many.  Europe's diplomatic 
     disarray lost an   opportunity to influence developments early.  Then 
     there was a large gap between      UN Security Council's commitments 
     and what could be delivered.  For the UN,  there was a loss of 
     peacekeeping credibility and "innocence" as all three parties          
        deceived and manipulated the UN and as peacekeepers became part of 
     the        conflict. UNPROFOR had no capability to counter the adverse 
     propaganda of the  parties.  The key message is that most culprits 
     don't get punished to the  degradation of credibility of the PKO 
     force.
     
<P>               -With respect to reform in the UN, there has been a 
     paralysis--great words     and little action. There remains the 
     critical issue of political will to support PKOs,  a standing force, 
     and financial reform in the UN.
     
<P>                -  For the future, the attitude and actions of the US is 
     critical to the future     utility of peacekeeping.  Preemption can 
     work, but it is not a panacea.     International institutions must be 
     reformed, and the layering and overlap of these    organizations can 
     facilitate situations were there is no center of responsibility and    
        thus nothing is done. There has been a "compliance liability" in 
     agreements that    promotes cheating and almost assures agreements 
     will eventually be unraveled.      The future of peacekeeping is thus 
     mixed. 
     
<P>        b.  Session II, "Peacekeeping-- the European Approach," CAPT 
     Wilson.  He stressed :
     
<P>                -  NATO only does PKOs in areas identified by OSCE.  The US 
     is         ambivalent about the WEU as the European defense pillar of 
     NATO.  The         legitimate involvement of WEU in defense issues is 
     still unclear--but WEU as a        defense entity did participate in 
     the Gulf War (minesweeping operations) and in      the naval blockade 
     of the Balkans.
     
<P>                -  With the Berlin Declaration, there will be a more formal 
     involvement of     the WEU in European defense matters.  The 1992 
     Peaceburg Declaration      earmarked NATO forces for WEU operations.  
     The 1994 Kirchburg Declaration     brought eastern European nations 
     into partnership with the west as associate        members and 
     observers.  The Birmingham Declaration was an agreement to             
        beef up the military capability to include intelligence sharing. 
     
<P>                -  The interlocking European security arrangements can not 
     work without       the US, and it requires the full integration of 
     France.
     
 <P>               -  Europe has yet to act as a corporate body in PKOs.  
     There is much      pressure to act as one, instead of bilaterally as 
     is now the case.
     
 <P>               -  In so-called Peaceburg missions, there has been much 
     talk, but little   substance in meaningful coordination.  Decisions to 
     participate in PKOs are based      on national interests.
     
<P>                -  There is a broader issue of the air and maritime aspects 
     of PKOs.   Logistics and backup has come from the sea.  There is, 
     however, a question of     effective command and control of PKOs by 
     the WEU.  IFOR demonstrated the    possibility of a NATO/non-NATO 
     joint task force (JTF) which worked well.
     
<P>                -  The WEU has also suggested an African pillar for PKOs.  
     There is a         joint French-British paper on this topic for 
     assistance to the OAU.
     
<P>        c.  Session III, "The American Perspective of European 
     Multinational Peacekeeping," was an impromptu presentation which was 
     shaped by the comments of the preceding speakers.  Points that I 
     stressed included:
     
<P>                -   The importance of Europe to the US and its central role 
     in US foreign      policy, as illustrated by our participation in the 
     IFOR operation, our ongoing        commitment to NATO, and the forward 
     positioning        of troops in Europe--the        largest 
     concentration outside the US.
     
<P>                -  The US view of peace operations (POs) in Europe is 
     shaped by our      national strategy of "Engagement and Enlargement" 
     and PDD 25 (briefly        explained). The US doctrinal views of POs 
     was briefly summarized, and the IFOR       operation was   discussed 
     as the nexus of a wide range of PO issues in Europe.
     
<P>                -  Some of the lessons learned from post-Cold War POs 
     include:  the      absolute need for clarity in the mandate; the 
     problems of strategic planning,    especially if there is not a good 
     strategic assessment as the front piece; the value         of the PfP 
     program; the need for agreement on standards and procedures; and the   
        need for the military to understand its need for interface with a 
     variety of non-    military organizations (and the use of CIMIC/CMOCs, 
     PSYOP/PA/Information       campaign, and a plan for dealing with the 
     media).
     
<P>                -  Peace enforcement conducted as a peacekeeping operation, 
     as is the case     with the implementation of the Dayton Accords, 
     offers a new element to    peacekeeping optimized for situations like 
     Bosnia.  The coercion/deterrence   factor of a strong combat 
     capability, and the need for peacekeepers who are well     trained in 
     their combat skills (as well as the specialized expertise useful in 
     PKOs)      has been important to keep the parties in line.  This 
     operation, and its doctrinal       underpinning, is well worth looking 
     at closely by armies well-versed in traditional    peacekeeping in 
     order to remain relevant to the needs of the present and future.
     
 <P>               -  Some of the questions in the Q & A periods were directed 
     at aspects of      our doctrine, the use of PSYOP resources, the US 
     view of operating under non-       US commanders, how the US prepares 
     for PKOs, the attitude of the US military  towards the press, and 
     where do we see peacekeeping going in the next century.</P>

December 06 1996<BR>

<P>Although many concepts of the information warfare (IW) are known in many
commercial enterprises and in their MIS departments, most corporations and
their information personnel are still quite unfamiliar with the terminology
and most fundamental concepts of the information warfare and its
applications in commercial enterprises and business activities. The quality,
accuracy, reliability and timeliness of the information and any related
analysis have become increasingly important in the dynamic and fast changing
global business environment. The protection of this valuable and often
costly asset have become very important for most companies, CEOs, MIS
personnel and information security specialists. The purpose of this brief
newsletter is to bring up some important issues and concepts of the IW and
some basic elements of information protection systems and methods to
minimize negative impacts of the IW on the company's information assets.

<P>The information warfare can be used as an integral element of any strategy
to influence the market place, competitors, customers, general public and
suppliers to achieve the business objectives. Basic concepts of the IW may
include 1. the distribution and dissemination of the disinformation and
misinformation, 2. the destruction or modification of some key information,
3. unauthorized uses or theft of the valuable data and information and 4.
the penetration of competitors' or other opponents' information systems and
databases. The intent of the IW is often to penetrate the company's
information processing systems and to influence key decision making
processes in ways that are beneficial for an organization that is organizing
the IW campaign against another organization. The methods of the IW may also
include many traditional problem solving methods such as law suits or
lengthy arbitration processes to delay R&D projects or other development
activities. No matter what techniques and methods are chosen for the IW, it
is important that these methods are integrated into the company's tactical
and strategic communication processes to implement effectively the company's
business strategies and tactics.

<P>The information and communication processes have become increasingly
important and critical for any international business. In addition,
processes and systems that show how the information is used and processed
have become more complex and dependent upon advanced technologies that
provide many efficient ways for decision makers to obtain and process the
quality information and then make accurate and reliable decisions on
specific business matters. This reliance on the information and related
processes has also created new threats for many organizations globally.
International businesses can use some elements of the IW against their
competitors, competitor's suppliers or other related organizations and
individuals. These IW attacks may establish new barriers for market entry,
limit the accurate and quality information that is available for individual
decision makers about some market place and specific industries and cause
other harmful impacts on these international businesses such as the misuse
of corporate financial resources and assets. In addition, some international
organizations may operate together with governmental agencies to collect the
information and to initiate programs and activities to destruct or steal the
information assets, destruct decision making processes or other analytical
processes resulting in ill-advised and incomplete decisions and business
activities. 

<P>It shall be important for any organizations to implement management systems
and techniques to prevent any harmful impacts from the hostile IW attacks.
These systems may include various strategic and risk management systems such
as the Information Security Systems (ISS), Business Intelligence Systems
(BIS), Quality and Environmental Management Systems (Q&EMS), specific
Internal and External Communication Systems, Legal Management Systems and
many others. In most of these systems, the assigned Management
Representative and/or Officer is responsible for ensuring that the system is
established, implemented and maintained. Specific procedures and
instructions shall be developed and implemented for specific elements of the
systems and the effectiveness of these systems should be reviewed
periodically by the executive management and if necessary, additional
improvements can be initiated to improve the effectiveness and performance
of the system. The scope of some systems can be broader than others and they
may be integral elements of other strategic management systems. For example,
some elements of the ISS such as tape backups and the information
classification can be a part of the Quality Management System to prevent the
accidental or intended unauthorized deletion, destruction or modification of
the quality data and information. These systems should be integrated into
one strategic management system to collect, obtain, analyze, disseminate and
protect the key information and intelligence and then to make sound and
quality decisions on various business, market and competitiveness related
issues. In addition, encryption, cryptography and other information
protection applications can be used to prevent any unauthorized monitoring
and eavesdropping and protect the information and intelligence during its
communication and delivery processes from its generators to its receivers.

<P>How would the IW attack affect your organization, if this attack would
destroy the major portion of your key business information or if it would
delay the availability of this information for several months? Would you be
prepared to lose millions of dollars, when your decisions are based on the
disinformation or other harmful influences? These are the questions that
every international business should be concerned about and evaluate serious
applications and techniques on how to prevent and minimize impacts of these
IW attacks or influences. CEOs and lead MIS personnel should assess their
organizational environment and specific threats from competitors or from
other market place players. The defensive IW strategy should be integrated
into an overall business strategy by the top executives to maintain and
improve the company's competitiveness in the market place and to ensure fair
and unharmed commercial trade practices. The strategic management systems
can be established and implemented to ensure the protection, reliability,
accuracy and quality of the business information and to minimize actual and
potential risks. It shall be important for any international organization to
use the defensive IW against any hostile and harmful competitors or other
organizations and agencies.

<p><b><i>Competitive Intelligence Review, </i></b>a quarterly
journal<b><i> </i></b>edited under the auspices of the Society of
Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP) and published by
John Wiley &amp; Sons, is the premier voice of the Competitive
Intelligence profession and the main venue for original material
covering all aspects of the CI field. <b><i>CIR</i></b> is
currently looking for authors to write articles, columns, and
&quot;how to&quot; pieces.</p>


<p><b><i>CIR</i></b>&#146;s readership<b><i> </i></b>understands
the basics of CI, but fresh perspectives are always welcome. Any
innovations involved with your work in CI? Have you had

insights and opinions with your fellow CI professionals.</p>

<p align="center"><b><i><u>CIR</u></i></b><u> publishes two types
of papers:</u></p>

<p><b>Articles</b> (at least 2,000 words, or 8-to-10
double-spaced, typed pages) that
contribute to the professional literature and which are
frequently based on 
independent research or in-depth case studies.</p>


<p><b>Departments</b> (usually no longer than 1,500 words, or
4-to-6 typed pages)
that emphasize practical information and which are particularly
useful when
based on the author&#146;s own experiences. Departments can
include concise
case studies, book and software reviews, and recurring columns.</p>

<P>Hi Caroline,

<P>May every blessing be heaped upon you for coming out with this Happy Hacker
mother lode of info. Many, many thanks.
<P> Windows' Telnet: I've been able to telnet to a specific port -- in fact
that's how I ran the fake email stunt, sending a very happy little girl a
letter from Santa. (Much wonderment; who said hacking had to be
baaaaaaad!!??)
<P>Speaking of Santa: He's gonna be bringing me the book "Running Linux" with
the accompanying CD Rom, which has a Linux system as well as a GNU (?)
personal C compiler. (Yes, I'm taking your advice on that and trying to
learn C, too. If my 50-y-o brain goes KAZ-art! my lawyers will be in touch.
And they're Canadians. Whoooo--ooooh.)
<P>I guess my questions are (finally, Mabel, he's gotta question):</P>
<UL>1. Will that be a suitable Linux?<BR>
2. Should I try for another?<BR>
3. What is the meaning of life?<BR>
4. If yes, is that shaken or stirruped?<BR></UL>
<P>Finally, thanks again for all your work/effort/labor/of/love. Perhaps I'll
hear from you ....</P>
Alan<BR>

<P>Moderator's answers:

<P>1) You poor, poor thing. You're going to install Linux for Christmas? I've
found alcohol aids the process.

<P>2) Some people find that Redhat is the easiest brand of Linux to install.
But I had a horrible time with it. Walnut Creek Slackware was easiest for
me. I of course am speaking relatively when I call it "easiest."

<P>3) The meaning of life is 42. Scientists recently verified this through a
determination of the Hubble Constant.

<P>4) Booze consumed while installing Linux should be inhaled along with
nitrous oxide. It is absorbed faster through the membranes of the lungs.
Trust me on this, I am also an expert in human physiology.

<I><P>Carolyn: the utils listed at that page give a Win95 user ping,
nslookup/whois, finger, and archie. That is hardly "almost everything"
that a shell account offers.</I>

<P>    You're right, but they can make being stuck with PPP only accounts 
more bearable.</P>

<I><P>How about the other popular things a shell account offers?

<P>procmail, dig, sed/awk, cut, grep, head/tail, more/less, sort, crontab,
screen, traceroute, cc/gcc, gopher, etc. Add to that the robust nature
of unix, the ability to modify existing programs, and a true multithreaded
OS, and you will see why Win95 is not a replacement for the shell.</I>

<P>    The fact that I was able to write my own script to go through the WWW 
access logs, and not only tell me how many hits my site received but also 
the exact address of the visitor, what files they looked at and at what 
times.  I suppose you might be able to do this with NT or another OS, but 
the fact of the matter is that if you usually don't pay for that type of 
report you won't be able to get it.  That is the case with our ISP ($25 a 
month for web tracking with tons less info than I can generate for free).

<P>    Unix is definitely the most flexible and 'low level' operating system 
that I've been exposed to.  Unfortunately, that scares some people 
because it allows their users to do more than they might want them to.  
Sadly this is the situation here.  Our management has been scared into 
thinking that WinNT is the only real safe OS and wants to get rid of Unix 
altogether..</P>

<P>Hail!
<P>Nothing goes on in DC-Stuff except flame wars, basically, so you might 
wanna warn future subscribers of that.  There are discussions on why SF 
is better than any city in the modern world, and in the weeks leading up 
to the con there are discussions about trips/rides there, but that's 
about it.  Almost as high noise/signal ratio cypherpunks, and the little 
signal is not as good, I think...


<P>(Another anonymous post)


<P>You may want to remind people that ping and traceroute are included 
with Windows95.  They have to be accessed through a DOS window while a 
PPP connection is active.

<P>For ping, at the command prompt, the command is "ping."

<P>For traceroute, since DOS is still limited to 8 character filenames, 
the command is "tracert".

<P>The general command line options apply.

<P>As to Jericho's comment:
<P><I>I know you can get some of these utils for DOS, but even then.. it just
isn't the same. This is the second time I have seen you try to justify
keeping Windows95 if you want to become a "hacker". That is just wrong.</I>

<P>Carolyn has never said Win95 and the available apps for it are an
acceptable substitute for a shell account or running a PPP connection
through Linux, but not everyone is as elite as you Jericho.  She has 
merely given solutions for those not able to or not ready to move up to 
those levels.

<P>Why does it have to be an either-or proposition?  Win95 and Linux can
co-exist peacefully on the same hard drive.  I can't afford to go
hunting for and buying a bunch of productivity applications (like
bitmap editors on a par with PhotoShop, a word processor on a par with
MS Word, etc.) for Linux.  Win 95 just has more of the software I need
available.  Plus, I had drivers for my video card when I got Win95. 
Support for my video card wasn't added to Xfree86 until the 3.1.2G
beta, and wasn't officially added until the 3.2 release last month.

<P>Linux has its uses, thus I've given it a few hundred megs spread
across my two hard drives (how many of the HH subscribers are old
enough to remember when a 5 meg hard drive in a PC was high-tech?  We
got a Sperry PC clone in the computer lab at my high school in '84 and
we thought that internal 5 megger was just the coolest - as opposed to
the 160k 5.25" floppies we otherwise had to use --- major nostalgia, I 
used to do my AP Computer Science homework using Turbo Pascal on a 
Commodore 64). 

<P>I see no reason why encouraging newbies and tentative hackers to get
their feet wet in Win95 first is wrong, or why having both OS's is a
bad thing.

<P>It may be pre-school level stuff in your opinion, but how many people
were coloring inside the lines at three?  Cut Carolyn and the newer
people some slack.  Just getting Linux up and running is a real
challenge for some people.  Configuring the programs and services
necessary for higher-level hacking can be a real bear, even for people
who have some familiarity with UNIX from work or shell accounts.  Let
people move at their own speed.  They'll get there. 


<P>From XXX.Com

<P><I> Actually what is even more humorous is exploring the relationships among 
 dimensional.com, lemming.com, and why one has most of its ports shut down 
 but the other is wide open. And what *IS* that program running on 
 lemming's port 22? People want to know.</I>

<P>The relationship between dimensional and lemming is pretty basic.
lemming gets its dedicated service from dimensional. No conspiracy
theories there.

<P>port 22 responds with SSH and a version number.. could that be.. no..
*gasp*.. Secure Shell? You know.. a little application that allows secure
telnets to a machine? I would hardly classify that as "wide open".
However, if you do manage to break through port 22, and defeat SSH, please
write a white paper on it for the next Phrack.

<P>(Editor's note: I'm afraid that http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh/#further-info has
beaten Phrack to the punch with  a description of how to break into
Jericho's computer. YOU CAN GO TO PRISON NOTE: in Colorado, breaking into
the computer of someone who has not given you permission to do so is a FELONY.)

<P>Why does it have most of its ports shut down? Lemme think.. maybe because
most aren't needed? What should I enable beyond ftp, telnet, ssh, and
sendmail? Nothing. There is no need for 99% of the services offered on a
unix box, at least for me. 

<P>(I was asking why dimensional.com is wide open, not lemming.com.)

<P>So by not enabling these other daemons, I am making my box "more secure".
Are we following yet?

<P>Oh, and Carolyn, feel free to portscan my box until your heart is content.

them. However, he who flames can expect a teensy bit of return flaming.)


<I><P>You lie Carolyn. Tell these people the truth.

<P> (email majordomo@dis.org with message "subscribe dc-stuff"), people get
 really worked up over port assignments. I also discovered that I had only

<P>You preach about port assignments and how well you know "port surfing".
You then post to the list a port that apparently baffled you, and people
chimed in with the correct answer.

<P> I also learned from that flame war that most people don't know where to 
 go for a free copy of ssh (secure shell program). If you run some kind of 
 Unix on your personal computer, and you want to remotely log in without 
 getting hacked, get your free version 1.2.17 from ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh. 
 Warning! This is a big file!

<P>B******T. YOU were the one who didn't know about SSH. YOU were the one who
couldn't read the output of port 22 and determine what it was. YOU were
the one who asked "And what is port 22. People want to know."

<P> If you want to know why it is a bad idea to run version 1.2.14, go to 
 http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh/#further-info. I sure hope no one on this list 
 uses that old version any more.

<P>From the FAQ you quoted the URL to:

<P>6.1 What known security bugs exist in which versions of ssh?

<P>All versions of ssh prior to 1.2.12.92 had a security flaw which allowed
local users to get access to the secret host key. This is fixed in
1.2.13 and later.

<P>If you run ssh 1.2.13 on Alpha OSF 1.3 or SCO in C2 security mode, local
users can gain root access. This is fixed by applying
ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/ssh-osf1-c2-setluid.patch or by upgrading to
1.2.14 or later.

<P>Versions of ssh prior to 1.2.17 had problems with authentication agent
handling on some machines. There is a chance (a race condition)
that a malicious user could steal another user's credentials. This should
be fixed in 1.2.17.

<P>=-=

<P>Ok Carolyn. The SSH on lemming suffers from a race condition that a
malicious user could steal another user's credentials.

<P>1) Are you a user on lemming?

<P>2) Do you know who has accounts there?

<P>3) Do you know which of them use ssh?

<P>4) Can you exploit this race condition?

<P>5) Even if you did steal their credentials, could you do anything with it?


<P>Answers!

<P>No. No. No. No. No.

<P>You did this with Daemon9, and now me. Don't pretend you can hack our
boxes. If you can, I have already told you how to prove it, and already
told you that I would love to see you do it. I will post to HH and
DC-stuff telling that you did, if it happens. Until then, quit making
these half idle threats that you know something about bypassing security.</I>


<P>(Moderator's note: I keep on forgetting that there are people who have never
heard of the literary device of the "rhetorical question."  Also, if Damien
Sorder (jericho) had been reading his shell log files he would have known
that I paid a visit to lemming.com long ago. I even left a greeting. But I
was a good girl and did not put the "#" prompt on my screen. But -- I never
said I was some sort of a super hacker, did I? I merely teach beginner
hacking. You and Phrack editor daemon9 are the guys who are so worried
someone might think I actually know something about hacking.)</P>

Subject: Re: Telnet question<BR>

<P>I believe I am posting correctly, if not forgive me.  I am normally not a
fan of mailing lists.  There is a telnet program for windows that will let
you telnet to any port you like.  I'm sure you have heard of it, it is
called Netterm.  Although I am an avid supporter and user of linux, Netterm
is the best telnet program available when stuck in windows.

<P>Hi there.  Just wanted to point out a Web-based WHOIS service, provided by
the InterNIC itself.  The web page address is
<http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois>.  The also list there some good
instructions on other good snooping tools like nslookup.

<P>BTW: Here's some info that may or may not be use to your readers - do with
it as you will.  I'm not any expert hacker by any means, so you may want to
double-check if everything is correct...</P>

<P>If you want to get a list of all the computers that are available at a site,
try the following:

<P>If you have an email address or a domain name, you can find all the
computers hosted in that subnet.  In the example of an e-mail address, let's
use my address as an example - <sferrier@achilles.net>.

<P>"achilles.net" is the domain name.  So, from a UNIX command-prompt, type
"nslookup".  This will give you something that looks a little like this
(less the dotted lines):

<P>----------
<P>Default Server:  nic.achilles.net
Address:  198.53.206.6


<P>----------

<P>The ">" character is your new prompt.  If you type "?", you should get a
help screen that looks something like:

----------<BR>
<P>There are all sorts of goodies in there.  But, to concentrate on getting
those machine names...

<P>First, you want to find out the name server (the machine that will hold the
list of all the computers that have dedicated addresses) for that domain.
To find that out, try the following:</P>

----------<BR>
> set quertype=mx<BR>
> achilles.net<BR>
Server:  nic.achilles.net<BR>
Address:  198.53.206.6<BR>
<BR>
achilles.net    preference = 5, mail exchanger = mailhost.achilles.net<BR>
achilles.net    preference = 20, mail exchanger = mail.ottawa.istar.net<BR>
achilles.net    nameserver = nic.achilles.net<BR>
achilles.net    nameserver = nic.fonorola.net<BR>
mailhost.achilles.net   internet address = 198.53.206.6<BR>
mail.ottawa.istar.net   internet address = 204.191.213.2<BR>
nic.achilles.net        internet address = 198.53.206.6<BR>
nic.fonorola.net        internet address = 198.53.64.7<BR>
><BR>
----------<BR>

<P>The "set quertype=mx" line tells it that you want to know what route
incoming mail would take to get it.  It also gives us some other usefull
information.  For example, you can tell from this who is the ISP for my ISP
- namely <istar.net>.  It tells you that incoming mail will be routed to the
machine <mailhost.achilles.net>.  It also tells you the master DNS
nameserver - <nic.achilles.net>.  Now that we know the nameserver, try this:</P>

----------<BR>
> server nic.achilles.net<BR>
Default Server:  nic.achilles.net<BR>
Address:  198.53.206.6<BR>
><BR>
----------<BR>

<P>This will tell it to disconnect from your local DNS and connect to the
remote DNS server for the domain in question.  From here, try this:</P>

----------<BR>
>ls achilles.net<BR>
----------<BR>

<P>And presto!  You have a list of all the computers in their sub-net that have
dedicated addresses!  Now, more often than not, many of the names in here
will be useless - ie: they will be for dialup accounts or whatnot, or
perhaps have multiple names for the same IP address, but you will most
definately come up with at least a few good machine names to play with.
Some sites will give you a list of literally hundreds of entries.  For
these, it would be much more usefull to have the date stored in a file
rather than displayed to the screen.  To accomplish this, simply modify the
above command to read:</P>

----------<BR>
>ls achilles.net > achilles.txt<BR>
[nic.achilles.net]<BR>
#######<BR>
Received 370 records.<BR>
><BR>
----------<BR>

<P>This will store all the retrieved data into the file "achilles.txt" in the
current directory.  It also nicely tells you how many names were obtained
:-)  To quit "nslookup", simply enter the command "exit".

<P>For more fun, try "set quertype=hinfo", then entering one of the specific
machine names that you found!

<P>Have fun!

<P>(Another anonymous one)

<P>i read a document which arrived in my mailbox in which you comment on
the ability to access finger via telnet.  you said that many telnet
programs for the pc don't support telneting to a port.

<P>i only have one, in addition to the undocumented telnet at the win95 dos
prompt.  it is netscan tools 2.40a from northwest performance software
(kirk v. thomas)  i tried telnet <hostname> 79 with this program and i
got a connect to port 79.  couldn't get any response out of port 79 but
that's just me.

<P>by the way i like this shareware program very much.  it has it all,
finger, traceroute, server lookup, ping, the whole shebang (sp?).  i
forget what i paid for it but it was sort of trivial ($25?).

<P> (more anonymous)

<P>Here's an update of sorts for you, re W95 (hey, some of us gotta produce
text and spreadsheets too! Not to mention QUAKE!)

<P>You said:

<P><I>You need a telnet program on a computer that runs some sort of Unix. I've
tried the telnet program in Windows but it refuses to let me telnet to a
specific port. The Compuserve and America Online telnet programs won't
do it.</I>

<P>While its best to learn the ins and outs of Unix at the least so one can
perpetrate, ahem, use the resources at say, that community library down
the street, one may want to try at home or office too.  If the task of
telnetting to a port is difficult, then sysadmin'g linux will be a task
of biblical proportions. Sooooo...

<P>In win95 you have two options: Get run off of the start menu.  Type
telnet (no need for dir path) and hit enter.  The choose Connect |
Remote System.  Type the domain in the top box (Host Name).  Type the
port in the Port edit box. hit enter, and boogie.  **NOTE** You have to
be a good typist because there is no local echo in this mode; for ports
25 and 79 anyway.  (I defer the question of port 69).

<P>If you want a local echo then set up Hilgraeve's Hyper Terminal
program.  Once you have a VT100 shell connection you can use your local
host's telnet, and have local echo.  (For OS2'ers, you've got Hilgraeve
too.)

<P>For unix meddling, Hilgrave, versus the MS telnet, is my personal fave.

<P>BTW-- I prefer this to be distributed confidentially if at all.  Thanks
for taking my risks, Ms. Meinel.

<P>aloha,
Neurocracy (Sure, finger me and find out who I am, but why ruin the
drama?)

<P>PS: If I have my history right, MS-DOS is a sort of Unix, albeit SCO or
System V's inbred, illegitimate and developmentally malfunctional
relative.

<P>Top Ten Reasons Why the Star Wars Characters Would Kick Butt in the
Star Trek Universe

<P>10) In the Star Wars universe, weapons rarely, if ever, are set on
        "stun".

<P>9)  The Enterprise needs a huge engine room with an anti-matter unit
        and a crew of twenty just to go into warp-- the Millennium Falcon does
        the same thing with R2-D2 and a Wookie.

<P>8)  After resisting the Imperial torture droid and Darth Vader,
        Princess Leia still looked fresh and desirable-- after pithy Cardassian
        starvation torture, Picard looked like hell.

<P>7)  Jabba the Hutt would eat Harry Mudd for trying to cut in on his
        action.

<P>6)  Luke Skywalker is not obsessed with sleeping with every alien he
        encounters.

<P>5)  One word: lightsabers.

<P>4)  The Federation would have to attempt to liberate any ship named
        Slave I.

<P>3)  The Death Star doesn't care if a world is class "M" or not.

<P>2)  Darth Vader could choke the entire Borg empire with one glance.

<P>1)  Picard pilots the Enterprise through an asteroid belt at
        one-quarter impulse power.  Han Solo floors it.</P>

December 04 1996<BR>
<BR>
<P>This is a warning on a nasty hoax that has been distributed on several
mailing lists and in usenet news. The hoax message is falsely
attributed to me (Mikko.Hypponen@datafellows.com).

<P>This false warning urges people to stay off Microsoft's
home page and not to use Microsoft Internet Explorer,
because the 'Microsoft home page is possibly infected
by a virus'. This is nonsense.

<P>If you have seen this warning, please pass on this message,
and please do not redistribute the original warning any more.

<P>The origins on this nasty hoax is as of yet unknown.
The original hoax warning is quoted here in full:

<P>   ---begin hoax---

<P>   Red Alert for anybody using Microsoft's Internet Explorer as
   their web browser.

<P>   This came in on the virus forum at the University of Hamburg
   from a fairly reliable source: Mikko H. Hypponen
   (Mikko.Hypponen@datafellows.com) in Finland. (datafellows is
   an anti-virus company)

<P>   The first indication that something was amiss was when the computer
   of an MIS professional friend of Mikko's was completely wiped --
   including BIOS and CMOS -- on 11-20-96. It took a great deal of
   arguing with Microsoft until 11-22-96 (logged at 0930 hours) when
   they finally admitted something was wrong and took "their homepage
   into their lab."

<P>   Mikko's first report was at 11:13 on 11-22-96. By 13:17 on 11-22-96
   the following message was received:

<UL> 
<P>   ---------------------------------------------------------

<P>      Okay, it's official (last conversation with techs at 1200 hrs,
       11-22-96, virus confirmed) Western Digital and Microsoft
       confirm that a new virus is on the web and they cannot
       isolate it. The only thing they know for sure is that it
       completely wipes out a computer. As of this time, they cannot
       determine how best to get rid of the thing once it is in your
       system.

<P>   [irrelevant "in-joke" cut]

<P>         They are recommending that until they can isolate it (it appears
         to be coming from several locations) you just stay off the web.

<P>   ---------------------------------------------------------
</UL>
<P>   This sounds like a trojan rather than a virus, but it is extremely
   destructive nonetheless.

<P>   Unless you can filter addresses so your webbrowser will not
   go to Microsoft's home page, stay off Microsoft's home page
   until further notice. (As Mikko post updates, I'll forward
   them.)

<P>   Incidentally, Mikko and his friend *were* frequent users of Microsoft's
   Web browser.

<P>   ---end hoax---

<P>Oh, by the way. I prefer Netscape and Lynx...

<P>INSIDE THE NAVY via Individual Inc. : In an effort to find a way to keep 
small teams of Marines supplied without a large logistical footprint 
ashore, the Commandant's Warfighting Lab, in support of Sea Dragon 
efforts, is looking into several parafoil-based supply delivery systems to 
provide "just-in-time resupply" for troops in the field.
<P>According to Capt. Michael Fernandez, 12-man teams of Marines will operate 
ashore on their own, without resupply, for two to three days at a time. 
These teams will not be resupplied by combat service support groups in the 
traditional sense, where a large supply base is built up on shore 
following an amphibious landing.
<P>"They [supporting elements] will be on ships," Fernandez said. "This is 
the means [parafoils] we plan to use to support the teams ashore from over 
the horizon, they would request supplies that would be delivered directly 
to them, depending on the situation."
<P>Fernandez is the air officer of the combat service support enterprise of 
the Sea Dragon Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force. He spoke with 
Inside the Navy on Nov. 25.
<P>"All the systems are not your traditional unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) 
in the sense of having a hard wing," he said. "The UAVs we're looking at 
are based on a parafoil wing, parafoil being a square parachute that can 
be guided."
<P>Guided Parafoil Air Delivery System (GPADS) is one of the systems being 
studied. Fernandez said GPADS is a non-powered, reusable, Global 
Positioning System-guided supply system that "is deployed from an airborne 
platform, either a helicopter or C-130 type cargo aircraft. Once deployed, 
GPADS is programmed to fly certain way points or it can select its own 
course to fly. Once deployed, GPADS acquires GPS satellites required for 
[navigational] tracking, it also takes into account real-time winds and 
then updates its flight profile as best as it can to reach its intended 
impact point."
<P>GPADS was developed at the U.S. Army Natick Research, Development and 
Engineering Center in Natick, MA. It is available in three variants for 
light, medium and heavy loads.
<P>Fernandez said the light version of GPADS is the most appropriate for Sea 
Dragon purposes. It can deliver up from 750 to 1,500 pounds of cargo and 
offers a "precision smart bomb effect in terms of a drop-and-forget 
capability that enhances the ability of the military to respond to a 
broader spectrum of air delivery missions by providing a covert, 
all-weather insertion capability for non-traditional air delivery loads 
such as sensors and munitions," according to a GPADS information paper.
Powered Parafoil, developed by Southwest Research Institute, is another 
GPS-navigated system being looked at. Fernandez said it is essentially a 
fan used to power a swamp boat, attached to a parafoil. "The fan blows air 
aft to inflate the parafoil, while at the same time providing forward 
thrust, together this provides lift." Powered Parafoil requires about 30 
meters for takeoff and is intended to return to its launch point after 
completing its supply run.      
<P>Fernandez told ITN the system was 
originally intended to be landed and off loaded at each supply point, 
however this might not be possible in every clime and place the Marines 
need resupply. Therefore, Fernandez is looking into air-dropping supplies 
from the Powered Parafoil, without the need for the system to land and 
take off several times per run. In concept, Powered Parafoil is intended 
to be launched and recovered by ship. It can carry 500 pounds of cargo, 
and travel up to 200 nautical miles.
<P>A self-deploying GPS-guided glider called Semi-Ridged Deployable Wing 
(SRDW) is also being looked for supply runs. SRDW is deployed from a 
helicopter or cargo aircraft much like the Guided Parafoil. However, 
instead of deploying a parafoil, it uses a semi-ridged glider. Fernandez 
said different power sources for the glider are investigated.
Fernandez said these systems are extremely quiet and nearly impossible to 
detect when operating at night, at least 500 feet above ground.

<P>DEFENSE DAILY via Individual Inc. -- The Marine Corps' modernization plan 
is "very affordable" and should be able to withstand budget pressures in 
the near term, according to a top general.
<P>"It's a modest program," Gen. Richard Neal, Assistant Commandant of the 
Marine Corps, told Defense Daily in an interview last week.
While he admits that spending levels for Marine Corps ground vehicles have 
been "low" in recent years, Neal believes that issue should "come to 
closure" in 1999. The Marine Corps pays for ground vehicles through its 
own funding line or with "green dollars." Aviation programs are paid for 
in the Navy budget or with "blue dollars."
<P>The Marine Corps has been eager to boost to annual spending on ground 
vehicles to at least $1 billion (Defense Daily, May 4, 1995). This year, 
in FY '97, the Marine Corps has $716.9 million in procurement, its highest 
level in recent years. In FY '94, procurement spending was $441.2 million. 
Procurement spending climbed to $558.6 million in FY '95 and $654.1 
million in FY '96.
<P>With bills for several high ticket aviation programs, such as the V-22 
tiltrotor, coming due around the end of the decade, some observers believe 
the Marine Corps budget could be headed for a train wreck, with a 
disproportionate part of the "blue/green" split going to aviation.
<P>But Neal disagrees. He said that the procurement budget starts to "get well" in FY '99, an 
important year in the development for some of the ground programs, such as 
the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle and the Lightweight 155 millimeter 
howitzer program with the Army.
<P>"We see '99 as a watershed year," he said.
<P>As for fixed wing aviation, the Marine Corps' top requirement is the Joint 
Strike Fighter, which will replace aging AV-8 Harrier jump jets. Neal said 
that the service cannot afford the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the Navy's top 
aviation priority. The Navy, which flies the single-seat version of the 
plane, wants the F/A-18E to replace F/A-18C. The Marine Corps flies the 
two-seat F/A-18D, which would be replaced by the F/A-18F.

<P><B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>Today, despite the end of the Cold War, there continues to be no shortage
of threats to stability and security across the globe. A consensus is
forming which defines many aspects of these emerging threats. The most
obvious thing about the entire gamut of threats is that many of them are
essentially stateless in origin and devolutionary in nature. Many of these
current threats are smaller in scale, befitting actions originating at the
lower end of the spectrum of conflict championed by stateless actors.

<P>Martin Van Creveld in his seminal work, "The Transformation of War",
contends we are seeing the end of a monopoly on violence by larger nation-
states. This monopoly is being replaced by a panorama of stateless actors
responsible for threats to our security.

<P>The stateless actors largely responsible for these threats might represent
a relatively wide-spread movement with global reach and significant
resources though with no single identifiable nation-state or government
to support them. They might be an isolated small group with few resources
save the willingness to inflict damage, injury or death in the name of a
cause or for criminal gain. Witness the activities of international gangs.
Finally, the threat from rogue states is onerous as well.

<P>Central Intelligence Agency Director, John Deutch while recently
addressing Congress notes the recent proliferation of biological,
chemical, and nuclear weapons is accentuated by the growing danger
posed by so called rogue states like Iran, Iraq, and Syria. All seeking
to acquire weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

<P>One of the most important things to keep in mind is that we shouldn't go
overboard on hysteria and fear mongering in the face of all this. The
horrors implicit in various emerging threats are, unfortunately, relatively
easy to perpetrate and, if attempted, likely to capture the attention of
the media.  If proof of that statement is needed, observe the surprising
number of journalists in the past few months who have taken it upon
themselves to 'test' the security of various airports by wandering
into off-limits areas unchallenged, secreting fake bombs or smuggling
fake weapons into controlled areas or even aboard aircraft.

<P>All these escapades have been carried out against a backdrop of terrorism
theories surrounding the recent downing of aircraft and bombings both home
and abroad. 

<P>Let's face it, if someone seriously desired to perpetrate terrorist acts,
the newspapers would be full of headlines of such horrors every day. Due
care and vigilance is indeed necessary to prevent the most common acts,
and alert security personnel and modern equipment and security techniques
foil a significant number of would-be terrorists every year.

<P>Even so, we cannot afford to be complacent about existence of an emerging
threats. Going on a permanent war footing both at home and abroad is
hardly a reasonable response. Calm, cool, reasoned evaluation, threat
assessment and planning are in order here. Over reliance on technology
is not a prudent response either, as reflected by General Krulak's remarks
in Defense News (7 Oct). The human factor- supplemented with good planning,
training, and useful equipment- is the most likely counter to these
emerging threats.

<P>It seems reasonable to assume that if the emerging threats are
devolutionary, the only successful responses will be devolutionary
in nature as well. The ability to identify, anticipate and cope with
emerging threats will have to be moved downward to the level at which
initial contact with the threat is likely to present itself. Infrastructures
allowing an escalating ability to respond rapidly to isolated incidents of
any sort which may be quite serious will have to be developed or refined
as necessary.

<P><B>DOMESTIC ISSUES</B>
<P>Many small town fire departments, as well as some Guard and reserve units,
with their 'mutual aid' response agreements and compacts, demonstrate a
good example of the basic concept. Escalating capabilities that allow a response 
to contact and expand as needed should be developed and made accessible
in both civil and military areas.

<P>Domestically the areas of civil utility systems (water, power,
transportation etc.), financial institutions, population centers
and other vulnerable areas require threat assessment and response
planning. Law enforcement, fire/rescue, Guard/Reserve as well as
other governmental and non-governmental assets must anticipate and
prepare to cope with new threats and different responsibilities involving
a variety of contingencies perhaps involving biochemical, nuclear, and
conventional EOD incidents along with evacuation operations.

<P>Flexible, multitiered response plans to a variety of contingencies must
be developed, enhanced, coordinated and simulated. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) is the logical federal lead agency to drive this
planning, working down through state government to the level of local
governments. Again, small town fire departments, with their 'mutual aid'
response agreements, demonstrate a good example of the basic concept.
Escalating capabilities that can contact and/or expand to meet the situation
must be planned for and executed when needed.

<P>The capabilities in areas of selected types of domestic emergency responses
such as SWAT, hostage rescue, medical rescue disaster and firefighting have
received more emphasis in most localities and infrastructure exists which
allows escalating levels of response to meet various levels of need for
incident response and management. That capability should be expanded and
broadened to include emerging threats as well.

<P>Attempting to centralize public safety and RC/Guard capability to respond
to threats or attacks will likely result only in extended response times,
inadequate response to multiple incidents and the creation of yet another
inviting target. Plans for various biochem and emerging domestic
contingencies should be developed and domestic contingencies exercised
to surface planning shortfalls and familiarize various agencies with
unforeseen demands arising from the necessity of working together
in major domestic emergencies.

<P>Assuming at face value that in many domestic emergencies "only the
military can handle that "it's too big a problem for the civilian
sector" is not prudent. If that's the case, we need to train and
develop the capability in the civilian sector where it can handle
most domestic incidents.

<P>"All of this points out the need for immediate funding of new and
different kind of training and equipment for local Police/Fire/EMS
personnel," comments Clark Staten of the Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI). 
"They are the front-line
of defense if the unthinkable happens...and some fanatic were to
attack our country with these weapons of mass destruction (WMD),"
he added. "Bottom-line... we need to develop an totally integrated
response against terrorists and terrorism...this must include local
emergency agencies, the military, and the medical  research community...
if we are to be truly prepared for the threat of a chemical or biological
attack," Staten concluded.

<P>If effective integrated response and recovery abilities are to be made
possible, they will have to be created at the local and state level in a
building- block approach. The beginnings of the training infra-structures
are already in place with Reserve and Guard units located all across the
country. Nevertheless, more work is needed to coordinate and field
capabilities that may prove necessary.  OSD can play a significant
role in the coordination and facilitation of this effort. However,
response and execution must remain at the local level.

<P>One of the areas where there needs a great deal of legal and operational
thought with respect to identifying emerging threats is the thinning line
between police and military activities domestically in combating these
threats.

<P>The use  of military forces in any continuing capacity within the borders
of this country raises questions. If additional civil manpower, training
or equipment is needed, means should be found to provide. Paul Anderson,
ENN Associate Editor, suggests expert help that local agencies would need
must come from the Center For Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, the U.S
Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at
Ft. Derrick, Maryland, or a new specially trained team of U.S. Marines
called the Chemical/Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF). Unfortunately,
it might be several hours before these highly trained specialists could arrive on
the scene of the incident. In the mean time, local fire, EMS, and law enforcement
agencies would be responsible for the management of the emergency.

<P>Nevertheless, if additional manpower, training or equipment is needed for
domestic emergencies, means should be found to provide it, to include
planning and coordinating with Navy, Marine, Reserve Components and Guard 
forces in appropriate roles. Likewise, the collection and analysis of domestic
intelligence to thwart domestic terrorism must be conducted responsibly
to avoid abuses of civil liberties and privacy.

<P><B>FORCE PROTECTION</B>
<P>Today the threat of domestic terrorism is fueled by the threat of terrorism
overseas. Deployed DoD personnel are increasingly inviting targets and must
be secured as well. In the wake of the terrorist attack at the air base
in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon is undertaking initiatives to
provide quick and effective response to protect DoD personnel around
the globe. New policy avenues must be explored to allow a more adequate
range of responses to threats from beyond our shores.

<P>A good deal of work has gone into this area already and some successes
have resulted. Cooperation between military assets and civil law
enforcement overseas has been heightened in order to better confront
the threat.  Increased military emphasis on conflict at the lower end
of the spectrum is necessary to more ably cope with emerging threats,
and has yet to be adequately emphasized. This often means people intensive
efforts (HUMINT, patrols, infiltration, psyops, civil affairs, security
details) not high technology per se is required to address some of the
emerging threats sponsored by stateless actors.

<P>Many difficult policy decisions will have to be made by the OSD leadership
before putting military personnel in harm's way again in the future. Factors
too numerous to discuss here enter into those decisions. Military personnel
thrust into many of the scenarios envisioned by the theoreticians and
associated with emerging threats will need different equipment, training
and support in addition to that which is currently in place.

<P><B>SUMMARY</B>
<P>The solutions to the problem of protecting ourselves and our society from
emerging WMD threats will be complex and demanding. We think that is one
of the few certainties in the whole equation of the emerging threat.

<P>A great deal of effort will have to be focused on understanding the origin
of these emerging  threats and of negating them without violence wherever
and whenever possible. Discovering the existence of real threats is
necessary but essential privacy and other such civil liberties must
not be sacrificed in the attempt. Likewise we cannot afford to run
roughshod over other nations abroad.

<P>At some times and in some circumstances happier solutions will not be
possible and violence will have to be met with violence. When that is
the case it must be applied within the bounds of legitimate use-of-force
doctrine, with civil law enforcement officers and military personnel
subject to strict accountability.

<P>We understand clearly that this is a very tall order. Yet to fail in the
direction of over control and invasiveness will certainly cause larger
problems and more surely damage our society as we know it than any possible
amount of terrorism.

<P>The causes that brought these emerging threats to the forefront took a
long time to develop. They will take an even longer time to solve as well.

<P>Thank you to ENN for permission to share this.</P>

<P>   LONDON (AP) -- Hackers have distributed two unreleased U2 songs
on the Internet, possibly after tapping into computers at the Irish
rock group's recording studio, the Sunday Times said.
<P>   The songs, "Discotheque" and "Wake Up Dead Man," have
appeared on Internet sites in at least four countries, the
newspaper said. The songs are to appear on an album scheduled for
release in the spring.
<P>   Since their illicit appearance on the Internet, the songs have
also been copied onto compact discs, the Times said. The bootleg
CDs are going for $10 at street markets in Ireland and Britain.
<P>   "It is an infringement of our copyright," Marc Marot, managing
director of Island Records, told the Times.
<P>   Island Records did not immediately return calls for comment
Sunday. The Sunday Times said the record company is trying to shut
down the Internet sites.
 <P>  Conventional, low-tech theft of the songs has been ruled out,
the newspaper said.
<P>   Band managers are investigating the possibility that hackers
tapped into computers at U2's Dublin studio, it said. They may have
gained access through cables that have been feeding images of the
band's recording sessions to an Internet site maintained by Island
Records.
<P>   Since 1981, U2 has sold 70 million records and grossed more than
$1.5 billion.

   <P>*This is my first take on the treaty, and I would appreciate comments
   and corrections. This is a very important matter that hasn't received
   much attention. jl
   
  <P><B>INTRODUCTION</B>
  
   
   
   <P>The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) will consider in
   December 1996 a new treaty that would require most countries
   (including the United States) to severely curtail the public's rights
   to use pubic domain materials stored in "databases." Some experts say
   it is the "least balanced and most potentially anti- competitive
   intellectual property rights ever created." The U.S. Patent and
   Trademark Office (PTO) is accepting public comments on this treaty,
   and a digital copyright treaty that is also troubling. Comments are
   due by November 22, 1996, and can be submitted by electronic mail to:
   <a href="MAILTO:diploconf@uspto.gov">diploconf@uspto.gov</a> . Copies of the treaty, commentary, and the PTO
   federal register notice is available from
   <a href="http://www.public-domain.org">http://www.public-domain.org</a>. This memorandum provides background
   information on the treaty and the problems it presents.
   
  <P><B>BACKGROUND</B>
  
   
   
   <P>The database treaty is being pushed by large publishing companies, in
   response to the 1991 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Feist
   Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service . In Feist , the Court
   rejected a claim of copyright for data from a telephone directory's
   white pages, saying that facts cannot be copyrighted, and that obvious
   items such as listing names, addresses, and telephone numbers in
   alphabetical order, are not sufficiently creative to qualify for
   copyright protection. The decision rejected the "sweat of the brow"
   theory of copyright.
   
   <P>Compilations of data or documents, including materials from the public
   domain, can receive protection under copyright if the creator of the
   compilation can show originality in the selection and arrangement of
   the data. Comprehensive databases, which can be expensive to create,
   confront problems under copyright laws because (almost by definition)
   they are not original in terms of the selection of the materials.
   
   <P>Electronic database publishers have sought to protect their data
   through contracts with their customers. These contracts often place
   restrictive conditions on the reuse or redissemination of the data.
   See Pam Samuelson, "Legally Speaking: Legal Protection For Database
   Contents," 39 Communications of the ACM (Nov. 1996), for a discussion
   about this approach. In other cases, database vendors permit online
   searching, but do not distribute the complete database itself.
   
   <P>Publishers are looking for stronger protection, and are lobbying hard
   to obtain a new "sui generis" (this is Latin for "one of a kind," and
   is a term used to describe statutory protections which are not defined
   under patent, copyright or trademark laws) property right to protect
   the contents of databases. The publishers' first success was the
   adoption of a controversial proposal for database extraction rights in
   the European Union (EU), and by gaining the support of the Clinton
   Administration and the EU to propose a very similar measure as an
   amendment to the Berne Copyright Convention. Legislation to implement
   this form of data use regulation was introduced in the 104th Congress
   [HR 3531], but there were no hearings on the measure. [On November 6,
   1996 we were told by the White House that the Clinton Administration
   did not support the language of HR 3531.]
   
   <P>Despite the controversial and far reaching nature of the database
   protection proposal and the lack of discussion on its impact in the
   United States, the Clinton Administration is asking for quick approval
   of the database treaty at a December 1996 meeting in Geneva hosted by
   the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The main
   Administration advocate in support of the publishers' position is
   Bruce Lehman, Chair of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), a person
   widely considered an intellectual property rights zealot.
   
  <P><B>THE COMPLEXITIES (AND DANGERS) IN CREATING A NEW PROPERTY RIGHT FOR DATA</B>
  
   
   
   <P>While many persons are sympathetic to the general idea of a sui
   generis form of protection for databases, there is enormous concern
   about the complexities of creating a new property right that has the
   potential to create private monopolies on data and documents that have
   traditionally been in the public domain. It is often said that "the
   devil is in the details," and this is certainly true for the database
   protection proposal. A handful of database vendors have quietly
   crafted a proposed treaty and law that creates a nightmare for
   researchers and value added publishers. In discussing the development
   of the EU database proposal, J. H. Reichman and Pamela Samuelson say
   that "lobbying pressures converted the final version into one of the
   least balanced and most potentially anti-competitive intellectual
   property rights ever created." [ "Intellectual Property Rights In
   Data: An Assault On The Worldwide Public Interest In Research And
   Development , forthcoming in Vanderbilt Law Review, 50 ].
   
   <P>The database vendors have sought to vastly expand the ability of
   database owners to regulate and restrict the public's rights to use
   data, without the types of safeguards which exist in copyright law
   today. In this respect, it is important to understand that as a "sui
   generis" property right, the database extraction rights are not part
   of the of the copyright regime, and the entire doctrine of fair use of
   data will not apply to data protected under the proposed database
   extraction rights treaty and legislation. Moreover, under the WIPO
   proposal these new data rights would be retroactive, affecting
   countless databases already in existence.
   
  <P><B>DIGRESSION ON WEST PUBLISHING AND THE DEFINITION OF A DATABASE</B>
  
   
   
   <P>The Feist decision was particularly troubling for West Publishing, a
   company that wants to maintain its monopoly on the citations and
   corrected text for many court decisions. (See:
   <a href="http://essential.org/cpt/legalinfo/legalinfo.html>[http://essential.org/cpt/legalinfo/legalinfo.html)</a>   West is the only comprehensive publisher of federal circuit and district court
   opinions and state court opinions from all 50 states. The page numbers
   of the West court reporters are the basis for authoritative citations
   used by scholars and lawyers. As a reporter of decisions, West also
   makes corrections to the text of court opinions, typically after
   working with the judge who wrote the opinion. West wants to prevent
   others from using their page numbers or the corrected text of court
   opinions, and it is often in court trying to prevent its would be
   competitors from doing so.
   
   <P>West is now involved in at least two law suits over its assertions of
   copyright of the page numbers, and one law suit over the issue of the
   copyright to the text of the corrected court opinions. [See
   http://www.hyperlaw.com for background on this]. Most copyright
   experts think that West will lose its court case on the issue of its
   page numbers, and West will also be hard pressed to claim it can
   copyright the corrections to the text of court opinions --
   particularly for the US federal courts, since U.S. copyright laws
   exclude the works of federal employees.
   
   <P>Most people think that the corrected text of court opinions, and the
   citations to those opinions, should be in the public domain, and that
   the West monopoly has delayed the development of new information
   products and services for legal researchers. No one seriously argues
   that the court opinions would not be published without a West
   monopoly. West is among the private sector publishers who have
   successfully lobbied the EU and the Clinton Administration to extend
   the database protection proposals to print products by defining a
   database so broadly that it will include any collection of facts,
   data, or documents regardless of the media. If the database protection
   proposals are enacted, West will have a firm monopoly on decades of
   judicial citations and corrections to judicial opinions.
   
  <P><B>THE DATABASE EXTRACTION RIGHTS PROPOSAL</B>
  
   
   
  <P> The August 30, 1996 version of the WIPO treaty is available on the Web
   at <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/wipo6.html">http://www.loc.gov/copyright/wipo6.html</a>, and it is worth reading
   since it represents the most radical change in intellectual property
   rights in data, ever.
   
 <P><B>WHAT IS A DATABASE? WHAT ISN'T A DATABASE?</B>
  
   
   
  <P>The treaty would protect "any database that represents a substantial
   investment in the collection, assembly, verification, organization or
   presentation of the contents of the database." This term should be
   understood "to include collections of literary, musical or audiovisual
   works or any other kind of works, or collections of other materials
   such as texts, sounds, images, numbers, facts, or data representing
   any other matter or substance" and "may contain collections of
   expressions of folklore." The "protection shall be granted to
   databases irrespective of the form or medium in which they are
   embodied. Protection extends to databases in both electronic and
   non-electronic form" and "embraces all forms or media now known or
   later developed. . . Protection shall be granted to databases
   regardless of whether they are made available to the public. This
   means that databases that are made generally available to the public,
   commercially or otherwise, as well as databases that remain within the
   exclusive possession and control of their developers enjoy protection
   on the same footing."
   
  <P> In other words, a lot of water will go under this bridge.
   
  <P><B>WHAT ARE EXTRACTION AND UTILIZATION RIGHTS?</B>
  
   
   
   <P>"The maker of a database eligible for protection under this Treaty
   shall have the right to authorize or prohibit the extraction or
   utilization of its contents." What is "extraction"? Extraction is
   defined as, "the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a
   substantial part of the contents of a database to another medium by
   any means or in any form." "Extraction . . . is a synonym for
   `copying' or `reproduction' . . . by `any means' or `any form' that is
   now known or later developed."
   
   <P>"Utilization" is defined as "making available to the public all or a
   substantial part of the contents of a database by any means, including
   by the distribution of copies, by renting, or by on-line or other
   forms of transmission," including the right to control the use of the
   data "at a time individually chosen by each member of the public."
   
  <P><B>WHAT IS A "SUBSTANTIAL PART" OF THE DATABASE?</B>
  
   
   
  <P>The treaty sets out tests for determining if an extraction is
   "substantial," and these tests are both highly anticompetitive, and
   extremely broad in scope.
   
   <P>The "substantiality" of a portion of the database is assessed against
   the "value of the database," and considers "qualitative and
   quantitative aspects," noting that "neither aspect is more important
   than the other. . . This assessment may also take into account the
   diminution in market value that may result from the use of the
   portion, including the added risk that the investment in the database
   will not be recoverable. It may even include an assessment of whether
   a new product using the portion could serve as a commercial substitute
   for the original, diminishing the market for the original."
   
   <P>Then the treaty adds that a "substantial part" means any portion of
   the database, "including an accumulation of small portions . . . In
   practice, repeated or systematic use of small portions of the contents
   of a database may have the same effect as extraction or utilization of
   a large, or substantial, part of the contents of the database."
   
   <P>In the US implementing legislation, the only types of data use that
   would not be regulated would be "insubstantial" parts, "whose
   extraction, use or reuse does not diminish the value of the database,
   conflict with a normal exploitation of the database or adversely
   affect the actual or potential market for the database." Under this
   language, a database owner could say that it might in the future want
   to charge for each transmission of a fact or an element of a database
   as part of its "normal exploitation" of the database. With the
   Internet and digital cash this claim is likely to be made. The public
   would not have "fair use" rights, since fair use is only defined in
   matters involving copyright.
   
 <P><B>FOR HOW LONG? 15 YEARS, 25 YEARS, OR FOREVER?</B>
  
   
   
   <P>The Treaty would require a minimum term of protection (15 years in the
   EU proposal, and 25 in the United States proposal) for the database.
   But this is extended each time the database is revised or enhanced.
   According to the draft treaty, "any substantial change to the
   database, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively, including any
   substantial change resulting from the accumulation of successive
   additions, deletions, verifications, modifications in organization or
   presentation, or other alterations, which constitute a new substantial
   investment, shall qualify the database resulting from such investment
   for its own term of protection."
   
   <P>The provision on revisions raises the specter that protection for many
   databases will be perpetual. This could indeed be the case if the
   original versions of the database are only "licensed" by the vendor
   for a limited period of time, so that the only available versions
   would be the new ones, which would have a new term of protection.
   [Database vendors write these restricted use licenses now].
   
  <P><B>WHO WILL "OWN" FACTS?</B>
  
   
   
   <P>The supporters of the Treaty note that persons can independently
   collect data for a rival database, and the US legislation says
   "nothing in this Act shall in any way restrict any person from
   independently collecting, assembling or compiling works, data or
   materials from sources other than a database subject to this Act."
   Unfortunately, this will only be helpful in those cases where there
   will be a separate non-protected source for the data or documents.
   
  <P> If the entity which creates the initial data or documents qualifies
   for the database extraction right, the data itself will be
   monopolized. The example given above regarding the West Publishing
   reporters of court decisions is one example, where the citations
   (which are based upon the West page numbers) and the corrections to
   opinions (which are only reported by West) cannot be obtained from any
   third parties. But the problem is much broader than court opinions.
   All sorts of data will be protected at the source under the database
   treaty, and may never enter the public domain.
   
   <P>There are also the practical problems relating to the costs of
   independent data collection. The telephone companies obtain directory
   information when you become a subscriber, and it is practically
   impossible to independently collect this data. Databases of IP
   addressees collected by Network Solutions will be covered, giving
   Network Solutions broad new rights in how that data is utilized by
   ISPs.
   
 <P><B> WHAT ABOUT GOVERNMENT INFORMATION?</B>
  
   
   
  <P> Much of the lobbying for the sui generis database proposal is designed
   to enable database vendors to protect collections of government
   documents. The treaty would permit countries to have special rules for
   "databases made by governmental entities or their agents or
   employees." However, this exemption will not include cases such as the
   West Publishing reporting of court decisions, where West is acting as
   an unofficial agent for the courts.
   
   <P>In the US enabling legislation, protection is not given to a database
   made by a governmental entity, but protection could not be excluded
   from companies if a database's "contents have been obtained from a
   governmental entity." There is no provision to exempt databases
   created by private parties; like West, LEXIS, and literally thousands
   of other firms; when they act as contractors to government agencies.
   For example, West is a contractor for some courts in receiving
   electronic filing of briefs. Under the U.S. legislation, the database
   of briefs collected by West for the Courts would be protected.
   Likewise, the SEC EDGAR public disclosure filings which are managed by
   LEXIS would be covered.
   
   <P>The Clinton Administration has gone to court in at least two cases
   avoid releasing documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
   when West Publishing has asserted intellectual property rights claims
   to elements of the data. In the FLITE case, the Clinton administration
   successfully argued that it did not have to release U.S. Court
   opinions collected by the Air Force at public expense that contained
   West "corrections" and enhancements. (See:
   <a href="http://www.essential.org/listproc/info-policy-notes/0185.html">http://www.essential.org/listproc/info-policy-notes/0185.html</a>, and
   the Tax Analysts page on this topic, at http://www.tax.org/pal). It
   appears as though government entities will be permitted to avoid FOIA
   completely if they use private contractors, and write contracts which
   permit agency access to data (extraction), but do not permit
   disclosure to the public. [For a discussion of an earlier legislative
   initiative by West Publishing to achieve a similar result, that was
   defeated after citizen protests, see:
   <a href="http://www.essential.org/listproc/info-policy-notes/0137.html">http://www.essential.org/listproc/info-policy-notes/0137.html</a>, and
   <a href="http://www.essential.org/listproc/info-policy-notes/0139.html">http://www.essential.org/listproc/info-policy-notes/0139.html</a>]
   
 <P><B> WHAT ABOUT FAIR USE RIGHTS?</B>
  
   
   
  <P> As noted several times, the public has rights, often taken for
   granted, under the copyright "fair use" doctrine. This includes
   commercial and non-commercial fair use. The fair use rules involve
   public interest balancing tests. The sui generis database proposal
   doesn't include or incorporate public fair use rights. It is difficult
   to know how this will play out in practice.
   
  <P> Under the treaty language, governments "may, in their national
   legislation, provide exceptions to or limitations of the rights
   provided in this Treaty in certain special cases that do not conflict
   with the normal exploitation of the database and do not unreasonably
   prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder." The key terms
   here are "normal exploitation of the database," and "legitimate
   interests" of the rightholder.
   
   <P>In the U.S. legislation, "a lawful user of a database made available
   to the public or placed in commercial use is not prohibited from
   extracting, using or reusing insubstantial parts of its contents,
   qualitatively or quantitatively, for any purposes whatsoever." But as
   noted earlier, the term "insubstantial" is constrained by the scope of
   the business opportunities that are perceived by the database vendor.
   Not only is "insubstantial" limited to those uses which do not
   diminish the value of the database, but insubstantial must also not
   "conflict with a normal exploitation" of the database, or adversely
   impact the "actual or potential" market of the database. Moreover, the
   "normal exploitation" of the database seems to be defined in such a
   way that the vendor can assert that a transmission of a database
   element on the Internet would be an infringement if the company has a
   mechanism or even aspirations to charge for the information, and the
   cumulative impact of many small transactions would diminish the value
   of that service.
   
  <P><B>RETROACTIVE PROTECTION</B>
  
   
   
   <P>The treaty would require countries to provide protection prospectively
   for databases already on the market. Countries could exempt older
   databases from protection for up to two years.
   
  <P><B>PROHIBITIONS ON TECHNOLOGIES TO DEFEAT PROTECTION</B>
  
   
   
   <P>As in the proposed Internet copyright treaty and legislation, the
   database proposal is accompanied by very strict prohibitions against
   the "importation, manufacture or distribution of protection- defeating
   devices." This is defined as "any device, product or component
   incorporated into a device or product, the primary purpose or primary
   effect of which is to circumvent any process, treatment, mechanism or
   system that prevents or inhibits any of the acts covered by the rights
   under this Treaty." The US legislation contains similar provisions,
   plus a whole section which would make it a federal crime to interfere
   with "database management information." Persons would face up to 5
   years in jail and a $500,000 file for doing such things as providing
   or disseminating false database management information, or removing or
   altering any such information. It would seem that simply tearing the
   cover off a telephone book (a protected database under the treaty) be
   a violation of this provision.
   
  <P><B>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</B>
  
   
   
   <P>If you think this proposal needs more debate before it is forced upon
   us and the rest of the world, contact your member of Congress and
   submit comments to the PTO asking that the database treaty be taken
   off the WIPO agenda for this December. You should point out that there
   have been zero public hearings before the Congress on this
   far-reaching proposal. You also might read the attached October 9,
   1996 letter in opposition to the treaty by the Presidents of the
   National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and
   the Institute of Medicine. You will also find good background
   materials at Brian Kahin's web page for the State Department Advisory
   Committee on International Communications and Information Policy.
   
   <P>As noted above, you can send comments by electronic mail to:
   <a href="MAILTO:ldiploconf@uspto.gov">ldiploconf@uspto.gov</a>. They must be in by November 22, 1996. Copies of
   the treaty, commentary, and the PTO federal register notice is
   available from <a href="http://www.public-domain.org">http://www.public-domain.org</a>. Public-Domain is an
   independent citizen's organization being formed to fight this treaty,
   and more generally to protect the public domain in matters concerning
   intellectual property.</P>

  <P> Letters of Presidents of National Academy of Sciences, National
   Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine in opposition to the
   database treaty.</P>
   
   October 9, 1996<BR>
   <BR>
   The Honorable Michael Kantor<BR>
   Secretary of Commerce<BR>
   Department of Commerce<BR>
   14th Street and Constitution Avenue<BR>
   NW Washington, D.C. 20230<BR>
   
   <P>Dear Mr. Kantor:
   
   
   
   <P>We are writing to express our serious concern about pending changes to
   international and domestic intellectual property law that are being
   supported by the Department of Commerce. Although we understand that
   the wide availability and easy transmittal of digital databases can
   present difficulties for database vendors, we believe that the August
   30, 1996 Draft Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect to
   Databases, which was prepared under the World Intellectual Property
   Organization (WIPO), has the potential to undermine our nations
   progress in scientific and technical research and education if
   appropriate exceptions and limitations are not clearly articulated. As
   you may know, the proposed WIPO treaty contains major provisions,
   intended to do the following.
   
   <P>Prohibit unauthorized extraction, use, or reuse of any database, or
   any substantial portion of a database (as defined by the database
   vendor), and effectively establish the basis for a pay-per-use system;
   - Make perpetual protection the norm for databases, by making a
   15-year initial term of protection renewable with every substantial
   change or addition to a database, actions that occur frequently with
   most electronic databases; - Apply to all privately generated data, or
   repackaged U.S. government data (outside the United States, government
   databases would be protected by this law as well); and - Include
   strong civil and criminal penalties, including provisions for
   third-party liability (e.g., liability incurred by the unwitting
   intermediary or disseminator).
   
   <P>While we certainly do not dispute the right of database compilers and
   vendors to obtain reasonable protection of their products, the
   proposed law fails to provide for any public-good exceptions, such as
   the fair use exemption traditionally enjoyed by the research and
   education communities for their limited use of copyrighted works.
   Database publishers would effectively obtain an absolute and perpetual
   monopoly in their data compilations, including preexisting data sets.
   The proposed changes would significantly inhibit researchers seeking
   to reuse and combine data for publication or for research (an
   especially acute problem for researchers using large, continuously
   updated observational data sets), as well as educators wishing to use
   portions of data sets for instructional purposes. The new law also
   would overturn a series of Supreme Court cases that limit intellectual
   property rights in the interest of free competition.
   
  <P>We believe that these changes to the intellectual property law, if
   enacted in their present form, would seriously undermine the ability
   of researchers and educators to access and use scientific data, and
   would have a deleterious long-term impact on our nations research
   capabilities. Moreover, the proposed changes are broadly antithetical
   to the principle of full and open exchange of scientific data espoused
   by the U.S. government and academic science communities, and promoted
   internationally. We are aware that these and additional concerns
   regarding changes to the intellectual property law, have been
   communicated to the President and Vice President by the Digital Future
   Coalition, the American Society for Information Systems, the
   Association of Research Libraries, and the American Association of
   Universities.
   
  <P>What is especially disconcerting is that these radical legal changes
   have been proposed by the Department of Commerce for formal discussion
   and negotiation at the WIPO Diplomatic Conference this December,
   without any debate or analysis of the laws potentially harmful
   implications for our nations scientific and technological development.
   Indeed, although the unintended consequences appear very grave to
   those studying these issues, very few individuals at the science
   agencies or in the academic community appear even to be aware that
   such changes are about to take place, nor has there been any effort
   made to solicit their views.
   
 <P> If the current Draft Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of
   Databases is adopted by WIPO, these changes will move substantially
   toward becoming the new international norm in intellectual property
   law by the end of this year. Therefore, we request that no precipitous
   action be taken at the planned WIPO Diplomatic Conference before the
   range of consequences of the proposed changes is fully understood and
   appropriate modifications are made.
   
  <P> The underlying issues that have given rise to the potential changes in
   intellectual property law will also be described in a report to be
   published by the National Research Council later this fall. The study
   committee that prepared that report plans to hold a one-day symposium
   at the National Academy of Sciences to explore these issues in greater
   detail with key officials from the Administration and Congress. In the
   meantime, we hope that you will take the steps necessary to avert what
   could otherwise become an unnecessarily damaging and contentious
   development in intellectual property law.
   
 <P>  Sincerely,

<P>I had gotten several messages about the famous 809 area code scam, but
they were all sketchy and sounded like an urban myth.  But this version
is sufficiently detailed that it's unlikely to be an urban myth, even
if I haven't checked their facts for myself.  In any case, my point in
sending it out is not to warn of this particular scam, but to raise the
theme of pay-per scams in general.  Lots of commonplace scenarios for
the near-future of the Internet involve mechanisms that transfer money
easily and instantaneously from my bank account to your bank account.
As these mechanisms come online, scams will arise, seeking out niches
like mutating germs and then replicating madly in any niche that proves
sufficiently remunerative.  Think, for example, of "rights management"
technologies -- the ones that permit intellectual property owners to
sell online access to their goods in small increments.  Perhaps you are
presented with a Web page that says, among other things, "Our year-long
investigation reveals Microsoft's plan for world domination; US$0.03 for
full details, click here".  You click, US$79.95 is transferred from your
account to a numbered account in the Cayman Islands, and you are none the
wiser until your monthly statement arrives.  By the time the word spreads
about this scam, the scammer (who is sitting on a nice deck, overlooking
a beach somewhere and typing away on a laptop) has long since generated
another one.  Maybe the scams are customized, with information about your
buying habits, demographic profile, and history of entering contests all
used to fit you into the optimal "market segment".  Some people will be
told that the year-long investigation reveals impeachable offenses by the
President; other people will be told that the Nobel Prize for Medicine
has just been awarded to that Swiss doctor who recently announced a cure
for cancer.  Of course, the same flexibility that permits the Internet to
serve as a platform for these proliferating scams also supports mechanisms
for containing them.  America Online, for example, can advertise a code of
practice for organizations selling things through its interface, promise
to provide dispute resolution services to its customers, and so on, while
happily informing the public about the shark-infested waters outside its 
walls.  The very mention of America Online, though, suggests to me that
my imagination is stuck in the past.  Someone who gets burned buying a
too-good-to-be-true offer from Too-Good-To-Be-True Online Enterprises
Inc will no doubt get labeled as a whiner.  But that's just one model
among many; returning phone calls to a toll-free or long-distance phone
number is another.  From now on, every model of Internet interaction that
has any possibility of transferring money or anything else of value, such
as personal information, will have to be designed with scammability in
mind.  It's not good enough to design a rights management technology, for
example, based on simple scenarios of use and simple security scenarios
such as people listening in to capture credit card numbers.  This is a
much wider range of fraud prevention issues that, while highly developed
in certain very specialized areas such as credit card and long-distance
telephone companies, will now have to become democratized and applied to
a much wider variety of design problems.  Let's not allow the Internet
to get the same swamp-fever reputation as 900 telephone numbers.]</P>

More On The "809" SCAM: Internet ScamBusters Uncovers<BR>
Additional Serious Implications For The Infamous "809" Scam<BR>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>

<P>On Monday we sent out a Special Alert to notify subscribers of the
"809" Scam.  We've been doing a lot of research on this scam all
week, and getting *a lot* of email.  Last night we uncovered
information which results in much broader implications of this scam
than we've seen reported anywhere.  So, we're sending out this
additional issue of Internet ScamBusters to warn you about the new
developments.

<P>Brief review: The "809" scam has many permutations but they all
involve a message to you (either by email, phone or pager) that you
immediately call a number in the "809" area code to avoid some bad
consequence (such as litigation, or to receive information about
someone who has been arrested or died) or to gain some good benefit
(such as winning a wonderful prize).

<P>The "809" area code is in the Caribbean, yet most people are not
aware that they are making an international call when they dial the
"809" area code.  "809" calls can be "pay-per-call" numbers (such as
900 numbers in the US) - and there are no legal requirements that
callers be informed that they are being charged extra.  When you
return a "pay-per-call" 809 call, they try to keep you on the phone
as long as possible, and you are charged very high rates for the
call, reportedly up to $25 per minute.

<P>New information:  Until recently, the "809" area code covered the
entire Caribbean.  However, that's changed.  There are now a series
of new area codes for different countries in the Caribbean.  That
means there are now additional area codes which victims can
unknowingly call with the same results as the original "809" scam.
The "268" area code is already reportedly being used by scam artists.
  And you can be sure that the scammers won't take long to start
using these new codes in a big way.</P>

<PRE>According to representatives at AT&T, here are the new area codes and
their effective dates:
Country         Code      Effective Date
Bahamas         242       October 1, 1996
Barbados        246       July 1, 1996
Antigua         268       April 1, 1996
Cayman Islands  345       September 1, 1996
Monsterrat      664       July 1, 1996
St. Lucia       758       July 1, 1996
Puerto Rico     787       March 1, 1996
St. Kitts/Nevis 869       October 1, 1996
Jamaica         876       October 1, 1996 (conflicting reports-
                          may still be 809)

Bermuda now has the area code of 441.

A few more countries will be changing their area codes in 1997:
N. Commonwealth
of Mariana Is.  670       July 1, 1997
Trinidad &
Dominica        767       October 1, 1997
Tobago          868       June 1, 1997 (however, this may have
                          already have occurred according to AT&T)
</PRE>
<P>Several countries are keeping the 809 area code, such as the
Dominican Republic, Grenada, Virgin Islands, Martinique, St. John
(although St. John may change to 268), St. Thomas, and St. Vincent.

<P>(Please note: We spoke with three representatives at AT&T, and they
all gave us slightly different information. For example, they varied
on whether the effective date for Antigua's change was March 1 or
April 1, 1996 and whether Jamaica has a new area code.  However, our
concern is with the major concepts rather than with the specific
details.)

<P>And there's more.  AT&T supplied us with a long list of
"pay-per-call" numbers.  The numbers on this list may include adult
sex lines, resume lines, and other "pay-per-call" numbers.

<P>Summary: Be very careful returning phone numbers to area codes you
don't recognize, especially when you receive calls, emails or pages
with urgent messages that you call these numbers.  Call your long
distance phone company's operator to find out where the area code is
located (or look it up on the net), and only call numbers that make
sense to you.</P>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>

Two additional "pay-per-call" number scams:<BR>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>
<P>SCAM: Some 800 numbers reportedly roll over to "809" and other
foreign "pay-per-call" numbers with little or no warning.</P>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>

<P>A representative at AT&T warned us of a common scam she encounters.
Here's how it works:  You see an ad on the Internet or in a newspaper
for an overseas job opportunity as a "secret shopper" or a "mystery
shopper." You call the listed 800 number to either learn more or to
apply for the job.  You are left on hold for 15 to 20 minutes.  You
are either warned that the call is being rolled over to a toll call,
or you're not warned. However, even when people are warned, they
don't realize that the roll over is to an international,
"pay-per-call" number.  When you are finally connected, you're told
all the positions have been filled.  When you receive your phone
bill, you have a very large charge.</P>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>
<P>SCAM: "809" and other "pay-per-call" numbers can be used to cheat
businesses who offer fax back services.</P>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>

<P>Thanks to Lee Jones, who alerted us to this scam: Many companies
offer a computerized fax-back service where the company faxes
requested documents to a phone number entered by the caller.  The
caller can get the fax-back service to call back their "pay-per-call"
number.  When the business calls this "pay-per-call" fax number to
send the documents, they are charged the very inflated rates.  You
should consider protecting your business from this scam by blocking
area codes such as those listed above.</P>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>

<P>An update on the Internet version on the 809 scam we described in the
last issue of Internet ScamBusters:

<P>On October 8th, we looked up the domain name and ISP of "Global
Communications," the company that had posted the "809" message we
included in the last issue. We discovered that the domain name,
demon.net, is owned by Demon Systems Limited, in London.  We tried
calling Demon many times, but their phone was always busy.  We
emailed them asking what they intended to do about this scam, but we
received no reply (other than their automated response that they had
received our email).

<P>We also searched the newsgroups to see whether they had posted any
additional information.  We found three relevant posts. Here is part
of the response from Mike Whitaker, Duty Postmaster, Demon Internet
Ltd., postmaster@demon.net:</P>

----------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<P>This message originates from one of our customers and is clearly a
'scam' to persuade people to call the number listed. Demon take a
very dim view of such behaviour, and appropriate action is being
taken.</P>
----------------------------------------------------------<BR>

<P>Demon Internet has closed "Global Communications" account and is
considering further action.

<P>You can be sure that "Global Communications" and other companies like
them will be back soon with different names, phone numbers, email
addresses and messages.  Again, it's not the specifics of this scam
that are important - it's watching out for the general principles.

<P>Incidentally, if you're curious, several people called the 809 phone
number "Global Communications" posted to discover what actually
happened when you called.  Ryan J. Donmoyer, in MONEY Daily on
October 9th, reports:

<P>"Callers to the number are led to believe they are talking to
a live person, but in fact it is a clever recording that
responds to the caller's voice. Among other things, an
irate-sounding man with a British accent warns, 'Your
check will come round or we'll come round to get it.' The
recording seems designed to keep callers on the line as
long as possible, and is reportedly billed at $25 per minute."

<P>Others reported that this "man" with a British accent kept telling
them to hold on while he picked up other phone calls and supposedly
yelled at his staff. He continued to yell at the callers as well,
saying "send the money," and yelled into other ringing phones as long
as the callers remained on the line.</P>


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>

<P>Corrections and Clarifications to Issue #8 Of Internet ScamBusters:

<P>- According to our sources at AT&T, the number listed in the email
(809 496 2700) is located in the Dominican Republic, not in the
British Virgin Islands or the Bahamas as we reported.

<P>- We had a typo in the last issue that implied that the Bahamas and
the British Virgin Islands were the same country - obviously, that's
not true. (Thanks to Kathryn Morris for pointing this out.)

<P>- Finally, we hope it goes without saying that we do not view all
Caribbean businesses as fraudulent.  Obviously, most Caribbean
businesses are honest.  Nor did we name the West Indian language as
"broken English."  What we said was the person who answers the phone
in these scams sometimes speaks broken English and pretends not to
understand you to keep you on the line.  We certainly did not, and do
not, view West Indian language as "broken English."</P>

<P>BTW, we are often asked how we can publish Internet ScamBusters and
yet sell stuff on the Net.  The answer is simple: We respect Internet
culture, offer only very high quality products, and give exceptional
guarantees on everything we offer.  We are passionate about helping
businesses achieve outstanding success by providing tremendous
value to customers.  At the same time, we're committed to helping
people avoid getting ripped off by Internet scams,
misinformation and hype. <BR>

Subject: E-mail bombing prosecuted<BR>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>


<P>Saw an article in the local paper yesterday saying Illinois State
University, in Bloomington, IL, has a criminal case going against
someone for sending e-mail "bombs" to ISU computer systems.

<P>I don't have the article with me, but it said the suspect, a disgruntled
ex-student, set up a program to send hundreds and hundreds of e-mail
messages into ISU systems, causing them to slow or crash.  The bombs hit
ISU PD twice.  The suspect was identified by a staff member in the
residence hall department, who tracked down the source of the e-mail and
turned the info over to police.

<P>The suspect was charged with something like "criminal tampering with a
computer."

<P>Congratulations to ISU for this, and apologies to all for not having
details....I'll look for the article again later.<BR>

2d Session<BR>

<P>To prohibit economic espionage, to provide for the protection of United
States proprietary economic information in interstate and foreign commerce,
and for other purposes.</P>

IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES<BR>

February 1, 1996<BR>

<P>Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. SPECTER) introduced the following bill;
which was read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary</P>

A BILL<BR>

<P>To prohibit economic espionage, to provide for the protection of United
States proprietary economic information in interstate and foreign commerce,
and for other purposes.

<P>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,</P>

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.<BR>

This Act may be cited as the `Industrial Espionage Act of 1996'.<BR>

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.<BR>
<BR>
(a) FINDINGS- Congress finds that--<BR>

<P>(1) sustaining a healthy and competitive national economy is imperative;

<P>(2) the development and production of proprietary economic information
involves every aspect of interstate commerce and business;

<P>(3) the development, production, protection, and lawful exchange, sale, and
transfer of proprietary economic information is essential to maintaining the
health and competitiveness of interstate commerce and the national
economy;

<P>(4) much proprietary economic information moves in interstate and foreign
commerce and proprietary economic information that does not move in
interstate or foreign commerce directly and substantially affects 
proprietary
economic information that does;

<P>(5) the theft, wrongful destruction or alteration, misappropriation, and
wrongful conversion of proprietary economic information substantially
affects and harms interstate commerce, costing United States firms,
businesses, industries, and consumers millions of dollars each year; and

<P>(6) enforcement of existing State laws protecting proprietary economic
information is frustrated by the ease with which stolen or wrongfully
appropriated proprietary economic information is transferred across State
and national boundaries.

<P>(b) PURPOSE- The purpose of this Act is to promote the development and
lawful utilization of United States proprietary economic information
produced for, or placed in, interstate and foreign commerce by protecting it
from theft, wrongful destruction or alteration, misappropriation,
and conversion.

<P>SEC. 3. PREVENTION OF ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND PROTECTION OF
PROPRIETARY ECONOMIC INFORMATION IN INTERSTATE AND
foreign commerce.

<P>(a) IN GENERAL- Title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting
after chapter 89 the following new chapter:

Reuters World Report  96.09.25 19:20 <BR>

    By Karl Penhaul<BR>
 <p>    BOGOTA, Sept 25 (Reuter) - A Colombian guerrilla group
currently involved in a bloody offensive in the mountains and
jungles, suffered a setback in its propaganda battle when its
new-tech voice on the Internet was mysteriously silenced.
  <p>   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which has
periodically paralysed half the country with road blocks, found
its route to the information superhighway barred.
  <P>   The Communist insurgents, who rose up in arms in 1964,
embraced new technology last year in their fight to otherthrow
the government by launching a home page on the Internet.
   <P>  But in unexplained circumstances, which a spokeswoman for
the Mexico City-based Internet provider Teesnet said may or may
not be linked to external pressures, the plug was pulled on the
service on Monday -- a day after being publicised in Colombia's
leading daily, El Tiempo.
   <P>  The FARC's Mexico City-based international spokesman Marco
Leon Calarca admitted the loss of the Internet page was a
serious reversal but vowed the computer-age conflict was far
from over.
  <P>   "This is an attack on freedom of expression because we were
not doing anything illegal. I cannot say exactly how it happened
but the hand of the Colombian government is in this," he said.
 <P>    "The FARC is used to difficulties and this is just the
latest challenge. One way or another we will get back on to the
Internet."
 <P>    The Colombian guerrillas used their worldwide web site to
publish their political magazine Resistencia, whose distribution
is banned in Colombia, and to offer explanations about their
latest armed actions.
  <P>   FARC, labeled narcoguerrillas since the 1980s when U.S.
ambassador Lewis Tambs highlighted the group's alleged
connections with Colombia's drugs trade, have been dubbed
Cyberspace guerrillas since their appearance on the Internet.
   <P>  "Cyberspace guerrillas may seem a fun name but I think it
is pejorative and belittles what we're doing," said Leon
Calarca. "We are looking to topple the government and set up a
new Colombia.
 <P>    "Using weapons naturally comes within the logic of the
armed struggle. Just fighting through the Internet would be like
shooting rubber bullets. Not using it would be like continuing
to fight the army with a 12-bore shotgun," he said.
  <P>   In the four weeks since the FARC unleashed its latest
offensive with an attack on a jungle base in southern Putumayo
province, more than 150 soldiers, police and civilians have
died.

<p> <b>AMHERST, N.Y., Aug. 16 /PRNewswire/ </b>-- Technology thieves stole the newest
and fastest entrance ramp to the Information Superhighway.  The loss of what
some are calling the most revolutionary communications system linking consumer
televisions with the Internet is conservatively estimated at $250 million.</P>
    <P>A team of American and Chinese scientists from Interactive Television
Technologies, Inc. (I-TT) were close to completing more than four years of
research and development on the BUTLER, which exponentially increases data
processing speed and eliminates the need for a computer to access the
Internet.</P>
   <P> But someone broke into the company's Amherst, New York, offices between
8:15 and 1O p.m. Tuesday, August 13th and stole items including three
computers containing the plans, schematics, diagrams and specifications for
the BUTLER's technology, plus a number of computer disks with access codes.
However, the thieves left other computer equipment and disks in the office.</P>
    <P>"It had to be industrial espionage," said J. Balan Chirayath, I-TT's
President & CEO.  "The thieves took what they were looking for and then a few
other items just to make it look like a simple burglary."</P>
   <P>The research was done in conjunction with the University at Buffalo and
visiting professors from the People's Republic of China.  Coincidentally, the
company moved the research from an office on Capen Boulevard in Tonawanda
because of security concerns.  They were in temporary offices until
renovations to the company's new high-security office building were complete.</P>
    <P>"This project has been kept top secret from day one because of its
commercial potential," said Steven M. Cohen, I-TT's corporate counsel.
"Unscrupulous companies would pay millions for the technology and prototype to
make hundreds of millions in profit."</P>
    <P>The BUTLER would allow anyone in the world who can operate a television
to:  access World Wide Web, send or receive e-mail, purchase and pay for goods
and services, control inventory, obtain or transmit health care information,
medical insurance claims, and execute other business and personal transactions
without leaving the comfort of their easy chair.</P>
   <P> Similarly, I-TT can utilize this technology with existing cable and
satellite systems to provide everyone simple two-way worldwide communications,
on a real-time chat basis similar to what's currently available using standard
telephone lines.</P>
    <P>The BUTLER looks like a cable television box that can be connected to any
television.  It was developed to allow even computer illiterates to access the
Internet, without the hours of training necessary to master the intricacies of
computers and software.  Now any individual who can operate a television set
could use this technology.</P>
   <P> The company will reconstruct its four years of research using data that
was backed up at the end of July.  However, it now will be forced to apply for
a patent on the technology ahead of their scheduled time frame.</P>
  <P>  The company must also accelerate talks with several strategic partners.</P>
  <P>  "Protecting our brainchild is our top priority," Chirayath said.  "I-TT
will bring this technology to the market, not some thief in the night, I
guaranty that!"</P>
<P>    I-TT, is a New York Corporation, founded in 1996 to provide interactive
television capability to residential and commercial users.  The company's
philosophy is simple, "existing television sets will become the empowering
tools for everyone."</P>

<p>American spies hack into Euro computers to steal trade secrets</p>
<p>AMERICAN intelligence agents have hacked into the computer of the European parliament and European commission as part of an international espionage campaign aimed at stealing economic and political secrets, according to investigators, write Tim Kelsey and David Leppard. The European parliament has called in British communications experts to improve its security and to block further attempts by American government agents to spy on its workings.</p>
<p>Security officials at the parliament's Luxembourg offices say they have discovered several recent instances in which its communications systems was compromised by American hacking. They have also found evidence that the Americans used information obtained from hacking to help them in negotiations last year on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Lord Plum, leader of the British Tory MEPs in the European parliament, said he was shocked by the disclosure. "I will be taking this up directly with the American ambassador [to the European Union]." he said. The CIA has already been accused by the Japanese and French governments of hacking into their communications networks ion an attempt to obtain confidential trade secrets.</p>
<p>The European parliament's computer network links more than 5,000 MEPs, officials, researchers and other staff to each other and to the European commission-headquarters in Brussels and the council of ministers. Traffic across the network by telephone and computers include details of the private medical and financial records of many MEPs and officials, and discussion documents on confidential issues, including trade, tariff and quota agreements. The records of closed committees of inquiry into BSE and fraud are also stored on the system.</p>
<p>European parliament sources say the Americans accessed the network by compromising the information exchanged that link the parliament's internal networks with the Internet and external computers. The devices called "routers", filter entry to the European parliament's network, it is understood the Americans were able to obtain access to what is called the simple network management protocol (SNMP), the language that enables the networks to talk to each other. They were able to exploit the fact that parts of the system were manufactured by two American firms. The breach came to light when officials belived that American negotiators</p>
<p>had been given advance warning of confidential European Union positions in last year's trade negotiations. "It was established that the system had been penetrated just days before the talks." an EU source said. "Our principal concern is not to establish what has already been copied but to ensure that it does not happen again. This is an on-going problem." A spokeswoman for Antonio Cavaco, director of data processing at the commission, confirmed that allegiations of hacking had been investigated. However, she said she was unable to provide any details.

<p> The days when spy vs. spy meant the CIA vs. KGB are no longer. In this
day and age of corporate espionage it all too often means French intelligence
against IBM, or even Mitsubishi against Ford Motor Company. Economic and
industrial espionage is being carried out around the world and US companies
are prime targets, not to mention easy ones.</P>
    </P>US companies have remained blissfully unaware of corporate espionage
practices for some time. Unless a company worked as a defense contractor,
there was no reason to worry about "spies." But France, Japan and several
other countries have been at it for decades, and now the threat posed by
economic and industrial espionage is beginning to be taken seriously by US
executives.</P>
  <P> In Japan the underlying philosophy is, why spend 10 years and $1 billion
on research and development when you can bribe a competitor's engineer for $1
million and get the same, if not better, results. In France, the philosophy
is that while France and the US may be military allies, we're economic
competitors. Meanwhile, South Korea recently intensified efforts to collect
information from foreign companies for South Korean corporations _ a fact
discussed openly on South Korean television.</P>
   <P>Even Russia is getting on the industrial espionage bandwagon. President
Boris Yeltsin three months ago ordered top Russian officials to "close the
technology gap with the West and told them to make better use of industrial
intelligence to do so," according to Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Chairman Sen. Arlen Specter, who spoke at a recent hearing on the issue.</P>
   <P>The potential losses for all American industry could amount to as much as
$63 billion, according to a study by the American Society for Industrial
Security. The actual dollar amount is heavily debated, but very few would
argue it isn't significant.  Taken in light of Secretary of State Warren
Christopher's recent comment at a Capitol Hill hearing that "our national
security is inseparable from our economic security," the problem can't be
taken lightly.</P>
   <P>The FBI has taken the lead role in what is a relatively new campaign to
stop economic espionage. The bureau is currently investigating allegations of
economic espionage activities against the US by individuals and organizations
from 23 different countries. Even local FBI offices _ including the one in
Boston _ are helping in the campaign to protect the nation's trade secrets.</P>
  <P> Corporate America has been especially vulnerable to economic and
industrial espionage because it lived a rather sheltered life from what is
considered in many countries to be an acceptable way of doing business. But
as more and more US corporations see their secret marketing plans and
research and development work stolen for a mere fraction of what it cost
them, they are beginning to realize the gravity of the threat. Words such as
penetration, mole, hacker, and spy are slowly being added to the corporate
lexicon of senior executives. And Congress is now considering legislation
that would make easier the prosecution of those who perpetrate economic
espionage.</P>
   <P>Those "spies" employ a variety of methods _ some legal, some not _ to
steal a company's secrets, or collect information. One of the most valuable
and damaging methods is to recruit an agent inside the target company by
either bribing or blackmailing an employee. Foreign governments have also
been known to allow students to study abroad and take internships in target
companies as an alternative to compulsory military service. Once these
students graduate they are frequently urged to take jobs at the companies
they interned with, thus providing them with a constant supply of
information.</P>
   <P>International exchange organizations, friendship societies, import-export
companies, and other such organizations are frequently used by foreign
governments in order to get close to certain companies. "These organizations
spot and assess potential foreign intelligence recruits with whom they have
contact," said FBI director Louis Freeh.</P>
   <P>Companies will also use legitimate business agreements, such as licensing
and on-site liaison officers, to provide opportunities to gather information
illicitly. One such case involved Recon Optical. The company signed a
4-year, $40 million contract with a foreign government to design an airborne
surveillance camera. The terms of the contract allowed three foreign Air
Force officers to work in Recon's company plant. After continual cost
disputes and other problems, Recon canceled the contract and dismissed the
three officers. As the officers were leaving, security guards at the plant
caught them removing boxes of company documents. It turned out that during
the officers' stay they had been passing information to their
government-owned defense company. The documents enabled the company to build
its own system without Recon Optical.</P>
   <P>An even more complicated problem for law enforcement is the growing use
of offshore hackers to break into US corporations' computer systems and steal
trade secrets. The fact that the attack can come from outside the US makes an
already difficult prosecution next to impossible. In some cases the hackers
are even backed by the countries they're working from.</P>
   <P>Not all the methods are so high-tech or filled with spy tradecraft. Some
simple, if rather bold, ways have proved just as damaging.  Raymond Damadian,
president and CEO of Fonar Corp., said "To protect the
technology of our magnets (used in MRI machines), which was precious to the
company, we required that all of our magnet installations take place behind
locked doors. A Siemens executive proudly told me that that precaution was
easily overcome. He reported that he took the technician out to dinner,
filled him with alcoholic beverages and thereby secured an invitation to
enter the room and inspect the scanner for as long as he wished, which he
did."</P>
   <P>Legal methods such as Freedom of Information Act requests are also a
vulnerable point for US corporations. When Mitsubishi decided in 1986 to
enter the space industry it began an intensive effort to gather information.
FOIA requests became a major resource because they allowed the company to get
information from NASA. According to some estimates, Mitsubishi filed over
1,500 requests in 1987 alone.</P>
   <P>The US Patent Office is another weak point. "The Japanese and others
spend a great deal of time in the US patent office, which is considerate
enough to provide free copies of all US patents," said National Intellectual
Property Law Institute President James Chandler.</P>
   <P>According to Dan Whiteman, the corporate information security officer for
General Motors Corporation, "Unfortunately, no matter how elaborate the
precautions taken, it is nearly impossible to stop economic espionage when
the rewards of wrongful conduct are so high _ and the perceived risks of
being held accountable are so low."</P>
   <P> The low level of accountability that Whiteman refers to reflects a lack
of effective laws.</P>
  <P> "The FBI has attempted to use various criminal statutes currently in
force to counter economic espionage, but these laws do not specifically cover
the theft or improper transfer of proprietary information, and therefore are
insufficient to protect these types of items," said Freeh.</P>
   <P>"In several instances, the FBI has conducted investigations only to have
prosecutions or permission to use further investigative procedures declined
by Federal prosecutors because of lack of statutory criminal predicate."</P>
   <P>Another problem facing the prosecution of cases dealing with economic
espionage is that the confidential information stolen is commonly made public
during the hearing. "Proprietary economic information derives value from its
confidentiality; if this is lost during legal proceedings, then the value of
the information is greatly lessened," said Sen. Specter.</P>
  <P> Thomas Brunner from the US Chamber of Commerce said, "It may well be the
ironic consequence of our legal rules that in order to obtain justice the
victim of economic espionage will have to make public the very information
whose theft it is complaining about." He even adds that, " . . . it is at
least theoretically possible that where the US Attorney is determined to
pursue a prosecution, the victim could be forced to make such a disclosure
even when it did not actively request the enforcement action."</P>
   <P>The FBI, however, is making a lot of progress in dealing with awareness
through its DECA _ short for Development of Espionage, Counterintelligence,
and Counterterrorism Awareness _ program.   The program works to enhance
corporate security directors' awareness to the threat and helps them to
counter it. The most recent addition to the DECA program is DECA Fax. The new
service faxes unclassified counterintelligence information to companies who
fear they are targets of espionage. The information in the fax is designed to
help them spot the perpetrators, revealing, for example, the methods or guise
used by "spies" known to be in circulation. Boston's FBI office has
recently begun the program for corporations in the area.</P>
  <P>  In response to the legal problems facing agencies charged with combating
economic and industrial espionage, Sen. Specter and Sen. Kohl have
introduced the "Industrial Espionage Act of 1996" in Congress to help
prohibit economic espionage and protect proprietary information. If passed,
the bill will go a long way in establishing a basis for prosecution in
economic espionage cases.</P>

<BR>
 Friday 15 Nov 1996, London-UK<BR>
<BR>
 Hello Joe Shea,<BR>
<BR>
<P> On Sat, 9 Nov 1996 at 14:23:29 -0800 (PST), you wrote:   ... "I am
editor of The American Reporter, a daily newspaper on the Internet.  I
would like to ask you if, indeed, you were the person who was the first
to post a note concerning the possibility that a missile strike may have
been responsible for   the shooting down of TWA Flight 800. I can find
no earlier  mention of that possibility than your July 22 posts to CPSR.
  I would appreciate your urgent response, as i was unable to contact
you by telephone (I got a "switched off" message). "

<P> I am editor-producer of Shanti RTV news agency in London, UK.  I
verified the positions of the US navy within the firing range  in the
area at the time of the "friendly-fire", and reported the  findings
within hours with update on 22 July 96. I am sorry about  this delay in
reply. I was repeatedly  hospitalised after massive  heart attack on
Saturday 03 Aug 96.  I was discharged from my  local hospital this
afternoon. The "friendly-fire" possibility was  totally ingnored by most
mainstream media groups for almost ten  weeks. Shanti RTV tries harder
to be first with the news without  mainstream media resources and
fundings!

<P> Now please allow me to correct your Clark Staten's published  report
dated Friday 08 Nov 1996. Staten's report, it seems, is  based on ERRI's
libelous and defamatory disinformation and their  alleged probe.
Firstly, I am not "Parveez Syad", and I am now  known as "Parveez
Hussein". I have never "operated" from  Birmingham, England. I am not
subject of any government  investigation. I am not an Iranian. I was
never an Iranian  national. I am not an Iranian propagandist or
extremist. The  ERRI is spreading libelous, slanderous disinformation.
So, what  is their real, hidden agenda? Why are they trying to shift
focus  away from the possibility of "friendly-fire"? Are they trying to
refute or discredit Pierre Salinger? Why? Why are they and your
publication trying to mis-spell my name? What is their/your  real,
hidden motive?

<P>So, who is going to apologies for the coherent disinformation campaign
by the intelligence agencies and their assets?</P>

Kind regards<BR>
<BR>
 Parveez Syed<BR>

============================================================<BR>
<BR>
Editorial Reply; An open letter to Mr. Syed<BR>
<BR>
<P>Thank you, Mr. Syed, for confirming the main assertion of our story that
you were the FIRST person to make "friendly fire" allegations in regard
to the tragic crash of TWA Flight 800.  It is interesting, indeed, that
you freely admit that within hours of the disaster, and again on July
22, 1996, without any shred of visible evidence, that you were making
allegations that a U.S. Army or U.S. Navy missile took the lives of 230
American and French citizens.

<P>In regard to your charges that you are not an "Iranian" or "Iranian
national," the intent of our our reference was not necessarily to
reflect your country of ethnic origin or nationality, but rather that
you are/were acting for, or on behalf of Iran or other Islamic
Fundamentalists.  A review of your website and various writings,
distributed to hundreds by e-mail and fax, would confirm for the
discerning reader that you have been engaged for some time in a
questionable, on-going campaign of anti-American, anti-Israel, and
anti-Jewish rhetoric.  That. by definition, is "propaganda."

<P>In regard to your charges, Mr. Syed,  that ERRI is attempting to spread
"libelous, slanderous disinformation," and that we have a "hidden
agenda," in regard to the TWA Flight 800 disaster, we would only suggest
that the reader review our previous factual reports in this area.  We
believe that any unbiased review of the available facts will reveal that
your Flight 800 allegations are intended to misdirect the reader to
unsubstantiated, baseless, and ill-advised conclusions.  You should
know, that in the United States (and most of the rest of the world),
that nothing is libelous or slanderous if it is truthful.

<P>Finally, Mr. Syed, it is clear that you have attempted to discredit the
government of the United States and her allies, and to spread fear and
mistrust in America, for some time. This latest, transparent, and
scurrilous attempt to blame the deaths of the passengers of Flight 800
on our government has failed...as well it should.  In the process, you
have exacerbated the pain and anguish of the families and friends of
those killed in the Flight 800 disaster. We will leave it to the reader
to ask...what is YOUR motive in charging our government with killing its
own citizens?  Is it an unbiased attempt to present the facts, or an
attempt to shield those that may have perpetrated this atrocity? If it
is the former...where are the facts or any evidence to support your
allegations?

<P>Respectfully,</P>

<P>     DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuter) - Germany's top prosecutor
has warned companies they must tighten security precautions in
the face of industrial espionage from Russia and Eastern Europe
which is costing them billions of dollars a year. 
<P>    Federal Prosecutor Kay Nehm said the end of the Cold War
had reduced military and political tension between East and
West but foreign intelligence services were more active than
ever in trying to steal secrets from German companies. 

<P>:: One study estimates US$5.31 billion in losses due to economic espionage
against German firms.  Nehm called the estimate "very conservative."

<P>:: He warned that all sectors of business are at risk, not just the large
industrial companies, but also small and medium sized firms.

<P>:: Nehm says foreign intelligence services have turned to economic espionage to
justify their existance in the post-Cold War era.  He singled out Russia.

<P>     "To try to hold onto their power and to increase it,
Russian intelligence services are moving into new fields --
fields which pay for themselves," he said.

</H3>
</center>
From        ENN Special Report<BR>
11/10/97 - 15:00CST<BR>
<BR>
Part 1

<P>The following is a repost of an earlier article that sheds some light on
the questionable allegations contained in the anonymous Internet post
that was used as "evidence"  in recent statements by Mr. Pierre
Salinger.  We present it here in order to facilitate an open and honest
examination of this tragedy.</P>
==========================================================<BR>
From: RONALD LEWIS    INTELLIGYST@worldnet.att.net<BR>
Subject: DEBUNKING THE TWA FLT 800 "FRIENDLY FIRE" RUMORS<BR>
<BR>
<P>The following is a rebuttal of the absurd "friendly fire" allegations
concerning the loss of TWA FLIGHT 800 which have circulated on the
Internet for months and which recently gained increased notoriety when
they were again espoused by former TV correspondent Pierre Salinger.   I
was asked about this in mid-September and sent my reply out on September
13. This information was posted to at least one discussion news group
covering aspects of the TWA crash, as well as to other parties.  In some
form or another, it should also be available on the Internet but it
seems that a detailed analysis which tears huge gaps in this "theory" of
a "friendly fire" missile hit is not as interesting and sensational as
the rumors being spread.

<P>I invite all interested parties to distribute and disseminate this post
wherever they wish. My name can be left in or taken out, as the user
wishes. Credit for this material is not important-- distribution of the
facts is. Thank you.</P>

Best regards,<BR>
Ron Lewis<BR><BR>

*******************************************************************<BR>

<I>>>From X:    (TO RON LEWIS)<BR>
<BR>
<P>>> What do you think of this one that was forwarded to me?

<P>>>    As an aviator, the language rings true (for instance, "non-beacon
     target (transponder OFF)" sounds like something an ATP would say).

<P>>>     Also, W-105 is south of Long Island ... but on the charts which I
   have (which are old and long expired), the closest warning area to what
   I think is the crash site is W-106
</I>
<P>LEWIS:  If correct, our correspondent does not even have the correct
operating area defined. Not a good start.</P>
<I>
<P>>>     The chief source of my skepticism is the possibility of preventing
     all those sailors from letting the cat out.  There are the familiar
     two chances of keeping this type of thing suppressed: slim and none.
    I would doubt that the Navy would even try, knowing that worse---and
     wider-spread---egg would be on their faces when it inevitably came out.
</I>
<P>LEWIS  This is very correct.  The post I received last evening talked
about three sailors calling home and claiming they had been involved in
an incident resulting in a plane being shot down. Two problems with that
immediately:  Who monitored the phone calls, tallied the count, and knew
they were calls "home." Sounds too pat.  The other problem is that they
did not say they were specifically responsible or knew who was.  As I
related in my lengthy response, I was in Okinawa in September 1983 when
KAL 007 was shot down.  I worked on the F-15 weapons systems and the
F-15s were used to protect US Navy search vessels looking for the black
boxes.  When Soviet aircraft locked on to our ships, "my" F-15s locked
on them in return and chased them away.  The planes were from my wing
and I worked on the weapons. I had flown the same route corridor as 007.
 Therefore, I was "involved" in a shootdown.   In 1985, Delta L-1011
crashed in a wind shear accident at Dallas-Ft. Worth.  Now an imagery
interpreter, I worked on the photos produced of the accident site as
photographed from a 67th Tactical Recon Wing RF-4C.  I was directly
involved in support of the crash investigation, therefore I was
"involved" in the crash, but had no role in causing it.  As such, I
believe that the supposed three crewmen who talked of "being involved"
in TWA 800 may have witnessed it on radar but had absolutely no role in
causing it.   Why have none of these reports been fed to the tabloid
magazines and news shows, by friends and families of these sailors if
not the servicemembers themselves?  It just does not wash.

<P>LEWIS:  The following is the original material (with my rebuttal
commentary later added), received off of the Internet by, that several
parties asked me to evaluate:

<P>Part 2</P>
<I>
<P>>>     Extracted note follows:

<P>>>     The message came to me from a man who was Safety Chairman for the
     Airline Pilots Association for many years and he is considered an
     expert on safety.  He would not ever spread idle rumor.  In short,
    he is usually quite certain before saying anything!

<P>>>     Subject: Friendly Fire?

<P>>>     The following information about TWA Fight 800 was received this
     afternoon: (08-22-96)

<P>>>     TWA flight 800 was shot down by a U.S. Navy guided missile ship which
     was in area W-105.  W-105 is a Warning Area off the SouthEast coast
     off Long Island, and is used by the military for missile firing and
     other military operations
</I>
<P>LEWIS:  A "guided missile ship"?   If our correspondent has such
in-depth information about this incident, why is it that he cannot even
describe the class of ship, its name of hull number.  How about a
specific geographic position as well?</P>
<I>
<P>>>     Guided missile ships travel all over the world defending the US and
    they were conducting practice firings up over the top of a Navy P-3
     radar plane which was on a Southwest heading about over the top of
     TWA 800. Evidently the missile is supposed to go over the top of the
    P-3 and the accuracy of the missile is being measured by
     instrumentation in the P-3
</I>
<P>LEWIS:  A Navy P-3 "radar" plane? The Navy weapons and test labs do have
specially instrumented aircraft but if you wished to monitor the
progress of a missile from a "radar plane", then why not use the E-2C
Hawkeye and give that aircraft's crew additional training in tracking a
missle as well?

<P>US Customs does fly a "radar" version of the P-3 platform known as the
P-3 Airborne Early Warning (AEW) with a radar housing from the E-2
scabbed on the upper rear fuselage of a P-3. It would not be a player.

<P>Theoretically, it is possible that another version, an EP-3A or EP-3J
from VAQ-33 at NAS Key West could have been involved in providing ECM
jamming to test the fleet defenses of TICONDEROGA or ARLEIGH BURKE
ships.  It is POSSIBLE that such jamming could cause an SM-2MR Standard
missile to lose guidance in a heavy ECM environment and go after another
target, but there are several problems with this particular stretch of
the theoretical.

<P>For one thing, the Standard is a semi-active homing missile.  It follows
the radar reflections from the ship to ride to its intended target.
Unless the jammed radar was now focused on TWA 800, what radar
reflections would it be following in a heavily-jammed enviroment?
Secondly, there are reports of several missiles fired.  Finally, and
this is the BIGGEST nay-sayer against a Navy missile being involved.
The range of the SM-2MR Standard missile is 40nm.  At 40nm, under
lighting conditions as those noted that night, the massive flash of
flame from the launchers and the reflection of the flame off of the
resulting plume and cloud of smoke (which is incredibly substantial)
would have been seen for miles around.  The reports I have seen about
strikes of light indicate that they traveled UP toward the 747.  If
fired 40nm away from the target, or anywhere near a distance substantial
enough to put the ship out of sight of numerous witnesses, the SM-2MR
would have been flying almost horizontally or at a very shallow
depression angle. Reports I've seen indicate near-vertical streaks or at
least those approaching 45 degrees or better.  Also, I have not seen any
mention of columns or plumes of smoke being noticeable.  The SM-2MR is
norticeably smoky, sometimes incredibly so.

<P>Where did this "P-3 radar" aircraft originate from?  Why was this a
night launch?  The combat information center of a modern Aegis-equipped
TICONDEROGA-class cruiser or ARLEIGH BURKE-class destroyer is deep in
the bowels of the ship.  It is not as though they can "see" their target
visually. Night or day would not matter in the exercise but daytime
would give range safety a better chance of avoiding such a conflict with
civilian traffic if such is even likely to have occurred.

<P>When somebody says "evidently" something is "supposed to" do anything,
it immediately red-flags this as an issue the author is NOT an expert
in, or even seems well aware of.  It smacks of second-hand information
or rumor.

<P>I also object to a missile "going over the top of the P-3."  If there is
any danger of a loss of tracking on the missile, the P-3 would be too
close for safety's sake.  Besides, you don't simply let a missile fly
loose and watch what it does.  A surface-to-air missile is supposed to
lock on a target such as a drone.  If an EP-3A/J was involved in
jamming, it would likely have jammed the radars to the point that they
could not lock on to a target and there would have been no point in
firing a missile at all.  There is no mention of drone targets, again
indicating that the author either does not have familiarity with the
subject matter or has not checked all of his facts.</P>
<I>
<P>>>     There was a USAir flight coming from the Southeast descending towards
     Providence, RI that had been cleared to 21,000 feet and the TWA 800
     aircraft was restricted to 13,000 feet.  The air traffic controller
     requested the USAir flight to turn on his landing lights with the
     idea that TWA might see his lights and identify him.  At that point, he
    would clear the TWA flight to continue his climb.
</I>
</P>LEWIS:  Numerous eyewitnesses, including civilian and military pilots
aboard commercial airliners saw what they report as missile activity.
Any shipboard missile launch that could not be seen from land because of
the over-the-horizon curvature of the earth would not have been hidden
from people flying in aircraft.  SOMEBODY would have seen the extremely
bright flash, brightly-lit plume of smoke, and the flame of the missile
exhaust if this had been a ship-launched missile.  They didn't.  It
wasn't.</P>
<I>
<P>>>     The P-3 was a non-beacon target (transponder OFF) flying southwest in
     the controlled airspace almost over TWA 800 and made NO calls to ATC.
     After the explosion, he continued his flight to the west and then
     called ATC and asked if they would like him to turn around and assist
     with the "accident!"
</I>
<P>LEWIS:  A P-3 as a "target."  OK.  Let's assume this is a "dry-fire"
exercise in which the crew is to lock on to a target and simulate
launching a missile.  Otherwise, the P-3 and its crew are going to be
splashed.  So, how is it a live missile gets launched?   And, note the
description of "controlled airspace."  What does that mean?  Controlled
by whom?  Exercise safety officers? FAA air traffic controllers?
"Controlled" airspace indicates to me that somebody should have
controlled the 747 and kept it out of such "controlled" airspace around
an exercise.  Besides, such exercises are not held in secret but are
published in NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen and Mariners, if I am not
mistaken).  So, why hasn't anybody at regional air traffic control
centers or the JFK tower talking about this murderous Navy assault that
supposedly took place?  Because it DIDN'T happen!

<P>Yes, I know that accidents have happened, such as the carrier a few
years back that was supposed to simulate the launch of radar-guided Sea
Sparrow missiles and, through an error and failure to follow procedure,
they fired a live missile--or two--at a Turkish destroyer nearby. The
missile homed in on the ship's radar array and struck the bridge below,
killing the ship's captain and I believe at least one other officer.
Things do happen.

<P>But let me take a moment to interject something here.  Let's suppose,
just for argument's sake, that this was a deadly "friendly fire"
exercise that went awry.  Fine.  You have to really stretch to assume
that over 300 crewmen are going to keep silent forver.  Then you have
the P-3 crew. OK, so they're all Navy and they'll all cover this
incident up because, being Navy personnel, they are all lobotomized
robot types with no conscience and no concern for the 230 victims and
their families.  What about the Air National Guard officers and men in
the two HH-60Gs and lone HC-130P?  What allegiance do they owe to the
allegedly pirate-ridden, corrupt and evil Navy? Nothing.</P>

<P>>> You will remember that the first announcement about this accident=
 came from the Pentagon.  The spokesman mentioned that they were sending=
 the Navy to the crash site.  They immediately sent a Navy Captain who was
 replaced the next day by an Admiral.  That Admiral is still on the scene.

<P>LEWIS:  This is making a mountain range out of a sand pile.  The
military happened to be on the scene because the Air National Guard was
practicing night rescue missions in the area and reported the accident.
The P-3 crew deployed numerous rafts  (by the way, if I'm not mistaken,
specially outfitted jamming EP-3s do not have sufficient space for as
many rafts but we'll have to confirm that).  Of course the Pentagon
would be the first agency to release information because their rescue
aircraft were first on the scene and they had the most information
available.  What is so sinister about that?

<P>Now, the next part is very interesting because the post I received last
night on TWA rumors had this admiral going out to relieve the skipper of
the ship that supposedly shot down TWA 800. What the above correspondent
is telling me is nothing more than the fact that a senior naval officer
wasappointed, possibly to head up rescue and recovery efforts contributed
to by the Navy (it was an accident at sea, you understand) and, the next
day, the Navy was able to re-arrange the schedule of an admiral and send
the flag officer to replace him.  That only makes sense from a military
procedures standpoint.  Note, however, how this story was twisted in the
rumor mill and made to sound as though the skipper of the launching ship
was replaced by an admiral.  Simply amazing how these transformations
occur in the re-telling!</P>
<I>
<P>>>     The FBI has conducted at least 3,000 eyewitness interviews and the
     NTSB has not been able to be a part of these interviews not have any
     access to the contents of them.  Some of those eyewitnesses reported
     seeing lights.  Those were probably the landing lights of the USAir
     plane.
</I>
<P>LEWIS:   Who says, with such authority, that the NTSB has been barred.
Let's see some dates, some names, some more specifics.  This entire
document is riddled with such generalities and no specifics that can be
independently verified.  So the FBI performed 3,000 interviews.  They
were part of a criminal probe.  The NTSB was admittedly so outnumbered
and short-handed that they probably declined to participate in such
interviews on the assumption that the physical evidence would tell them
all they needed.  Why spread out limited assets by running around the
countryside accompanying hundreds of FBI agents.  The NTSB is a very
small agency and not=
well-funded.</P>
<I>
<P>>>     It has been a cover-up from the word go.  The NTSB is there in name
     ONLY.  All announcements made by Mr. Bob Francis say absolutely
     nothing and notice that the FBI is always standing beside or behind
     Mr. Francis and it would appear that his job is to make sure that
     nothing is said that would give away  "THE BIG SECRET!"
</I>
<P>LEWIS:  Oh, it would "appear" that Kallstrom has a certain function, all
right.  Can you spell S-P-E-C-U-L-A-T-I-O-N.   This is highly subjective
opinion based in no concrete fact.  Mr. Francis does seem to have
carefully selected his words when describing his findings but this may
be attributable to nothing more diabolical than his style of speech.
Rather than saying "absolutely nothing", he has often described the
condition of the debris, where charring has been noted, the percentage
of wreckage recovered, locations of the suspected seat of the explosion,
and so on. Investigators like those of the NTSB do not like to make wild
and speculative comments. They are very methodical and plodding in their
procedural manner.  To those who do not understand this approach, their
slow and deliberate delivery may seem to be an attempt to hide or cover
up things.  I am really surprised that a person identified as having
anything to do with expertise in airline safety would not realize this
from direct experience.  That alone makes me wonder if this person
really does have the credentials presented.</P>

<I>
<P>>>     It is time to end this farce and tell the public the real truth as to
     what happened to TWA 800.  My source shall remain my own but the=
     above information is true and I believe it will all become known soon,
     now that all of you know the real truth.
</I>
<P>LEWIS:  This is author is unwilling to provide sources.  There are few,
if any, specifics.  No detailed names, ship types, classes, hull numbers
or designations of the aircraft, ships and missiles involved, other than
P-3, and that aircraft was improperly described as a "radar" platform.
The "true information" alluded to here is suspect and there is little
real "information" provided.  The entire post seems to be an
amalgamation of hearsay, second-hand information and beliefs rather than
hard evidence, solid fact or reasoned conclusions.

<P>As I outlined earlier in relating the Turkish destroyer strike, there is
nothing which indicates that an accident could not have happened.
Nobody seems to know for absolute certain.  I will advise you of one
other thing, though, which I believe is highly relevant: within the
first 24 hours after this incident occurred, an Iranian based in London
and known as an official propagandist for the Tehran government was
announcing that this was the result of a "friendly fire" missile strike.
 No specifics.  No identification of missile type, launch platform,
etc., just that it was the result of a missile strike.  His certainty in
the face of such total uncertainty and confusion by all of the
eyewitnesses, rescue workers, pilots and so on, convinced me, at a very
early stage, that this was no accident and that the missile fired was
not "friendly."  Nothing since has made me waver in that belief.  If any
Navy shot down TWA Flt 800, I would look for a seaman or officer of the
Iranian Navy manning an ocean-capable cabin cruiser or other such small
vessel off the coast of the United States on the night of July 17,
1996.=20

<P>LEWIS SUMMATION: Again, I was not an eyewtiness to this event, a
participant in it, or a member of any of the agencies involved in
witnessing it, investigating it, or allegedly causing it.  I have made
my assessments based on military training as an imagery interpreter and
intelligence analyst with access to open-source reports relating to the
loss of TWA.  My comments are based on in-depth study, some personal
experience with the weapons and platforms described and certified
expertise in recognizing the characteristics of ships, aircraft and
missile.

<P>I invite comments and rebuttal from all interested parties but I ask
that all objections or counter-arguments be presented with specific data
such as specific date and time of day, identification of ship class,
name, type and hull number, descriptions of colors, angles of attack and
characteristics of any aircraft or missiles noted.  The author of the
above post has much more work to do in order to present a credible
argument.  In the absence of that additional effort, I can only rate the
above information as a poorly-researched, uninformed, speculative,
subjective, opinionated and second-hand hypothesis.  I would not even
given it the added weight of describing it as a "theory."

<P>To date most informed opinions on non-state political violence suggest that terrorist of the future will neither seek to develop, nor threaten to use weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  Arguments supporting this position are typically presented through a framework of anachronistic assumptions that have been in use since the days of the late nineteenth century Russian Nihilist movement.  
<P>These assumptions suggest that: (1), terrorist groups are nothing more than a collection of frustrated, political actors bent on correcting a perceived flaw in the socio-political order of the state.  The cause to take up terrorism evolves adjunct to their failure or inability to influence objectional political, economic and/or social conditions that define their environment;1 (2), it is assumed that these frustrated actors adopt terrorism as a means to force their political agenda through the use of directed and modulated violence.  <P>This violence is designed to communicate a complex message that primarily gains the terrorist group public recognition for their cause.  Unmitigated destruction and violence is not the goal as noted by Brian Jenkins who suggests that "terrorists want a lot of people watching, not a lot of people dead.;2 (3) terrorists are "mirror imaging rational actors," e.g., their behavior is normative.  As such they are subsumed to understand that exceeding a certain violence threshold  may result in a globally enjoined effort to eradicate them.3  Finally it is assumed that the technology and associated costs involved in the development and production of  weapons of mass destruction are beyond the reach of the non-state group.4  For these reasons the image of the classical terrorist of the twentieth century has not included WMD.  However, these  traditional arguments have arguably weakened due to the changing nature of the terrorist phenomenon.  Specifically these changes are emerging in areas related to supply and demand variables, variables  that certainly influence a non-state group's decision to develop and use WMD.   
Supply issues suggest that: (1), the availability of materials and technical requirements to produce  elementary WMD are well within the reach of contemporary non-state groups; (2), that many groups have the financial capacity to fund such programs; and (3), that individuals knowledgeable of WMD technologies are involved with groups that might threaten the use of  WMD.  
<P>Demand issues suggest that ownership and use of WMD by a non-state group provides a powerful negotiating tool, status, and power.  Thomas Schelling notes that a terrorist organization which achieves a WMD capability ascends to a higher position of relative power and prestige.5  Additionally, the absence of territorial boundaries in the case of the non-state group serves to make state retaliation difficult as the terrorist become hard to target, a problem that Marrs suggests serves to "vitiate the retaliatory threats of the state."6  

<P>It is noteworthy that Schelling's argument may have strong appeal to non-state groups that embrace a religious ideology affiliated with apocalyptic millennialism, redemptive fanaticism or racist/ethnic hate. Where traditional terrorists typically conduct their actions within certain violence thresholds, those operating under the aforementioned belief systems are arguably not subject to the same constraints as they conduct their acts to satisfy a higher authority, God.  These groups may be attracted to the power ownership of WMD affords precisely because WMD use can result in mass casualties and mass disruption against an "enemy" defined by their religious beliefs.  Non-state groups operating under the "cloak of religion" might very well be the most likely candidates to use the unlimited or disproportionate violence WMD affords.  

<P><B>The "Post-Modern Terrorist" or "The Revolution in Terrorist Affairs"</B>
<P>Much as scientific, technological, and social changes continually influence the art and science of warfare, so to have these things  influenced the behavior and enhanced the capabilities of the terrorist.  Recent studies suggest that terrorists are becoming increasingly more lethal and violent.7  These ultra-violent acts suggest that the days of constrained or modulated violence are over.  Drawing on the work of Mark Juergensmeyer 'ultra-violent' is defined as an act that involves killing or planning to kill others 'en-masse.'  This killing is conducted outside the boundaries of warfare and punishment in such a horrific manner as to elicit total revulsion and anger from those who witness or become aware of the act.8
The divergence from traditional 'means to ends' in recent terrorist acts is evident in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103;  the 1993 World Trade Center complex bombing; the 1995 Oklahoma Federal Building bombing, the Tokyo nerve gas attack; the 1996 Hamas bombings in Israel, IRA bombings in London, the Islamic radical bombings in Saudi Arabia.  New twists on old ideological imperatives, coupled with the availability of more lethal weapons and weapon related technologies, are rapidly enabling the terrorists to cause large scale death and destruction.9  Again, for the terrorist empowered by an underpinning of religion, the ability to please God by killing his enemies 'en-masse' with WMD, becomes an end unto itself.   
<P>Of increasing frequency is the ultra-violent terrorist act followed by silence.  Many times in recent years terrorist acts have been committed without a group stepping forward to claim credit for the event.  Events such as the downing of Pan Am flight 103, the Air India flight that crashed off the Irish coast in 1988, the recent terroristic bombing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, all suggest a 'shift in terms of the message the terrorist act is supposed to send.  Where traditional terrorists use the event to gain access to a 'bully-pulpit' to air their grievances, these 'silent terrorist' desire to send a message that creates a superordinary sense of overwhelming fear, and vulnerability amongst their 'enemies.'  Additionally, non-state, religiously oriented groups arguably have no great need for media assistance to articulate their cause as the intended audience is their own closed cell-constituency and God.   
<P>By not claiming responsibility for the event, non-state groups may actually be able to do more damage to the selected target and, at the same time, escape retaliation.  The fact that no one group has stepped forward to claim responsibility for the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing has, at a minimum, caused difficulties between the U.S. and her economic allies and heightened tensions between the Islamic countries of Libya, Iran, Sudan and Syria vis-a-vis the U.S.10  This might represent part of a non-state strategy to polarize the Islamic community against the West, while causing divisiveness among Western allies.     
<P>The change in the characterization of terrorism may be indicative of a new era, one in which the traditional, 'constrained' terrorist of the twentieth century is supplanted by the ultra-violent 'post-modern terrorist' of the twenty-first century.  Post-modern because of the manner in which they employ advanced technology, and anonymity,  to conduct destructive acts traditionally viewed as disproportionate to their goals.   
<P><B>Genesis of the "Post Modern Terrorist"</B>
<P>Expanding on a general theme discussed recently by Walter Laqueur,11 the emergence of the "post-modern terrorist" appears to have two causes.  One may be religious revivalism.  Religion has played a part in legitimizing extremes of violence throughout history, tendencies that are generally constrained in traditional, secularly oriented, non-state groups.  Ultra-violent terrorist acts rooted in religious imperatives can be seen in Sri Lanka, where Tamil Hindus are waging a bloody terrorist campaign against the Sinhalese Buddhists; in India and Pakistan where Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslim extremist groups engage in violent struggles; in Israel, where both radical Palestinian and Israeli movements have caused  great injury and death in the name of God.12  The success of Khomeini's 1979 Islamic Revolution and his call to propagate Islam through the use of "holy-terror" have also been viewed as enhancing extremes of radical Islamic violence in many location.13 	
<P>The second cause is arguably related to the removal of constraints imposed by the Cold War, and the subsequent disintegration of a bipolar world order.  As a result of this disintegration, a new world disorder seems to have emerged in which the legitimacy of many states is being challenged from within by increasing non-state calls for self-determination.  Huntington affirms this trend in a recent essay in which he suggests that the causes of future conflict will be rooted in a clash of cultures.14   He argues that ethnic and religious underpinnings will supplant traditional political ideologies with cultural ones.  Where these movements cross each other, bloody conflict will erupt.  
<P>Prime examples of this phenomenon can already be seen in Algeria, Somalia, Egypt, Sudan, Rwanda, Chechnya, the Balkans, Indonesia - and even here in the United States.  These movements often prey on the insecurities of the population, offering to fill the psychological, sociological, political or religious security needs of those who would join them.  Examples of such groups have emerged in the form of the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo; the Identity movement in the U.S.; and the radical Islamic revivalist movements that exist in a variety of countries.15
<P>These religiously oriented groups appear to share a common ideological thread that rejects existing societal structures and demand a structural revision of the world in a manner that will ensure their own dominance.   To this end, the threat or actual use of WMD may be the method by which they believe they can attack the state without having to expose themselves.16  Capitalizing on the highly cultivated fear WMD use engenders may convince these groups that they possess a power great enough to compel the state to concede to their demands.  If the state is not prepared to effectively respond to multiple WMD crises, and manage the consequence of such attacks, non-state groups may arguably be able to achieve their desired goals.  Armed with WMD, the non-state group may achieve its objective, circumventing the need to engage in a protracted terrorist campaign.17  

<P><B>Conclusion	</B>
<P>WMD use can cause mass casualties and substantial infrastructure disruption, far more than that caused by any previous terrorist incident.  Since the threat to use WMD affords the non-state group a powerful tool (to compel, deter, or destroy) that  heretofore has not been available to them, non-state proliferation presents a serious security dilemma to the global community.  
<P>Recognizing the WMD threat in general terms, President Clinton signed Executive Order No. 12938 on November 14, 1994.  This order declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat proliferation of weapons of mass destruction pose to the national security, foreign interest, and economy of the United States.  On November 9, 1995, a continuation of this order was declared by Executive notice.  This declared state of a national emergency has continued.  Despite the existence of a robust, widely supported international regime to control the spread of WMD,18  the consensus of various scholars and policy makers, identifies WMD proliferation as a top security threat to our Nation.  Senator Sam Nunn's address concerning proliferation echoes these sentiments:
The number one security challenge in the United States now and probably for years ahead is to prevent these weapons of mass destruction, whether chemical, biological or nuclear, and the scientific knowledge of how to make them, from going all over the world to rogue groups, to terrorist groups, to rogue nations.19

<P>Raising the specter of this concern, in March of 1995, members of the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo released nerve gas in a Tokyo subway, resulting in the death of 12 people and the injury of 5000.20  Following this horrendous act, Congressional hearings on the potential for continued non-state group employment of WMD concluded with the assertion that non-state proliferation poses a difficult challenge to our National security primarily because these groups are exceptionally hard to target, and much harder to deter, more so than an identifiable rogue state.
<P>It is intimately clear that when a non-state group such as Aum is able to develop a WMD capability, an endemic failure within the international community exists that must certainly be remedied.  That failure relates to two significant deficiencies.  First, our collective, intelligence capabilities to identify such groups early on needs to be improved.  As discussed in Congressional hearings held in November of 1995, the threat posed by Aum was never even on our intelligence "radar screens."  If we are going to beat these "bad guys," we must fine tune our intelligence apparatus so we can identify these groups, their capabilities, and intentions.  By doing this we assure ourselves the ability to operate inside the terrorist group's "decision making loop."  Operating inside this "loop" will allow us to preempt the terrorist action before it occurs.  Second, export controls and domestic efforts to restrict the sale of chemical/biological precursors, dual use technology and equipment must be strengthened.  
<P>Aum has proven that a determined non-state group can amass material, know-how, and equipment to develop and threaten the use of WMD. The concern now lies in discerning what the next group will do having learned from Aum's mistakes.  A robust effort to improve our knowledge of terrorist groups through human and open source intelligence gathering, coupled with strengthened efforts to control access to chemical and biological agents, their precursors and duel use equipment, will certainly help to minimize the WMD threat posed by these "post-modern-terrorists."

<P>15.  The case of Aum is by now assumed to be the first time that WMD has been employed in a contemporary terrorist attack.  However, there is information to suggest that the Islamic terrorists that bombed the World Trade Center may have incorporated cyanide as part of the package, see "Doomsday Cults: Only the Beginning," Newsweek, April 3, 1995, 40.  Additionally, in a 1986 Justice Department raid of the Identity oriented group known as the Covenant, The Sword, Arm of the Lord, federal agents seized approximately thirty gallons of cyanide and plans to poison the water supplies of several unidentified U.S. cities.  See Ron Purver, "Chemical and Biological Terrorism: The Threat According to the Open Literature," report, Canadian Security Intelligence Service, (June, 1995), 86; also J.Coats, Armed and Dangerous: The Rise of the Survivalist Right, (New York: Hill and Wang, 1987), 140.
<P>16.  The devastation wrought by the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945; the Nazi use of poison gas to annihilate six million Jews during World War II and the use of chemical weapons by both Iran and Iraq during their war in the 1980's, are all these incidents that have served to create a superordinary sense of fear of such weapons in many people.    
<P>17.  This concept is similar to one referred to by Tarrow as the "the window of opportunity."  See Sidney Tarrow, Power in Movement, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 81-99.
<P>18.  This regime includes codified efforts consisting of, but not limited to those involving the International Atomic Energy Agency, Non Proliferation Treaty, Chemical Weapons Convention, Biological Weapons Convention, export controls through the Zangger Committee and the Nuclear Suppliers Group.  Note that though the United States has yet to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention (problems related to private industrial concerns that inspections will result in industrial espionage) the DoD is actively engaged in destroying existing stockpiles of chemical agents and their delivery systems.

CIA'S FAILURE OF INTELLIGENCE <BR>
RE: TERRORISM<BR>
by Ralph McGehee <BR>
rmcgehee@IGC.APC.ORG<BR>
</H3>
<BR>
</center>



<P>   The failure of intelligence in Saudi Arabia in the bombing
at Khobar Towers in Dhahran in June 1996 and the earlier
bombing in at the National Guard Training Center in Riyadh
in November 1995, forebodes additional intelligence failures.
This is particularly true for all intelligence operations aimed at
radical Islamic fundamentalist terrorists in the Middle East and
around the globe.

<P>   Many of radicals were activated by the CIA's own operation in
Afghanistan during the 1980s that brought fundamentalists from
around the Middle East and trained, armed and energized their
terrorism. There is an irony in all of this -- the CIA creates
the threat that is now the primary reason for its existence. Yet
another irony is that the Agency seems totally incapable of controlling
or penetrating the Frankenstein of its own creation.

<P>   A number of investigations of the Khobar Tower's bombing blames
the lack of adequate intelligence for that disaster. However, an
investigation by Senator Specter's Senate Intelligence Committee
concluded there was adequate intelligence but a failure to by the
commanders to act on that information.  Significantly Senator Specter
credits State and Defense Department intelligence but ignores the CIA's
(lack of) contribution.

 <P>  A Defense Department investigation led by General Downing of the
Khobar Towers bombing states there were numerous indicators but
no specific intelligence that allowed for counter action. In his
report, General Downing lists various defense intelligence publications
for the indicators intelligence but does mention the CIA. His report
also lists a number of corrective actions specifically an increase
in the number of analysts to collate and understand the information
gathered locally and around the world.

 <P>  This to me is where the CIA should have been at the forefront
but is where its bureaucratic, tradition-based and secrecy-locked
operations and intelligence have not, and cannot perform.

<P>   I repeat two arguments from other postings -- one the CIA
in the middle of the Vietnam War with literally tens-of-thousands
of assets could not penetrate the all-pervasive Communist
structures.  Now we are asked to believe that it can penetrate
widely scattered, often non-connected, small, secretive terrorist
groups. But the CIA uses essentially the same structures and
procedures that have repeatedly failed in much more promising
and less challenging milieus. The list of its intelligence
failures is massive.

<P>   Some might argue but that was Vietnam and this is now. We need
look only to the views of the current Director of the CIA, John Deutch,
to see the fallacy in that reasoning. In 1995, Deutch said he was shocked
by the (DO) Director of Operations's "inability to formulate solutions."
The DO did not have the desire or ability to reinvent itself. "Compared to
uniformed officers they certainly are not as competent or as understanding
of what their relative role is and what their responsibilities are."
The deep rot of the DO in Guatemala is a core sample of the deep rot of
the overall Directorate. The curse of old boys is the patrimony of an
elite secret society that degenerated into an elitist bureaucracy, an
inbred tribal culture. Rules and laws are not for them. The curse of
old boys has so damaged the morale and reputation of the CIA that it
is hard to find good people. "The CIA has been imprisoned by its own
lies."

<P>   Below is information from CIABASE files re the
various investigations of the failures of intelligence
in Saudi Arabia.</P>

<B>Ralph McGehee<BR>
CIABASE<BR></B>

<P>  Saudi Arabia,  96  A home-grown Islamic underground has emerged in Saudi
  Arabia with a violent fringe sworn to attack its American protectors. many
  Saudis and Americans predict continued bursts of violence. most were among
  the estimated 15,000 Saudis who fought in Afghanistan, where some had
  received CIA-organized military training and forged links with radical
  leaders from a number of countries who since have helped organize terrorist
  attacks against the west. The bombing at the National Guard Training
  Center on 11/13/95 was (probably) the work of Saudi's own Islamic
  extremists. Many in the radical underground are veterans of the war
  against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. A small circle of
  ultra-radicals, from among the thousands of fundamentalists who
  embrace audeh's criticisms decided to take action. A group, the Movement
  for Islamic Change, issued warnings in April and June 95 calling on
 U.S. forces to leave Saudi Arabia by 6/28/95, or become legitimate targets.
  They claimed to have carried out the November bombing in Riyadh and the June
  bombing in Dhahran. Of the four who confessed to November bombing, three
  were veterans of the Afghan conflict. Washington Post 8/15/96 1,22

<P>  Saudi Arabia, The Pentagon's report on 6/25 truck bombing in Dhahran, Saudi
  Arabia, cited a long list of bureaucratic and intel failings in U.S.
  counter terrorism program. Retired General Wayne A Downing, who led
  the investigation emphasized the intelligence community's inability to
  penetrate terrorist groups. The report said "we still have enormous
  difficulty in gaining firsthand, inside knowledge of terrorist plans
  and activities." To some the main threat comes from a murky net of
  home-grown, privately-financed and largely independent groups a kind
  of international terrorists internet. Net is extremely difficult for
  U.S. Intel agencies to locate and penetrate. Washington Post
  10/17/96 a25

<P>  Saudi Arabia,  95-96  There was no intelligence from any source which
  warned specifically of the nature, timing, and magnitude of the 6/25/96
  attack on Khobar Towers. However, a considerable body of info, including a
  series of ten suspicious incidents in the proceeding 90 days, was available
  that indicated terrorists had both capability and intention to target U.S.
  interests in Saudi Arabia, and that Khobar Towers was a potential target.
  Command was not well served by an ad hoc intel structure. Command did not
  have a dedicated, organic, and focused intel analytic capability re
  intention to target U.S. advisers in Saudi Arabia and that Khobar Towers
  was a potential target. secretary of defense, report to the president,
  9/16/96, force protection: global interests, global responsibilities.
  General Downing's report re the bombing of Khobar Towers, Saudi Arabia,
  45

<P>  Saudi Arabia,  96  Intel failures left the military in Khobar (Dhahran)
  unaware of the magnitude of the threat. Per the chairman of the house
  national security committee. "Available intel was virtually devoid of
  specific knowledge of terrorist and dissident activity in Saudi Arabia."
  Washington Post 8/15/96 a33-4

<P>  Saudi Arabia,  96  Secretary of Defense, report to the President, 9/16/96,
  force protection: global interests, global responsibilities. (General
  Downing's report re the bombing of Khobar Towers, Saudi Arabia). there were
  intel indications, while they lacked specificity, they did warn that new
  attacks were being planned and caused the U.S. to take further steps to
  protect the forces. DOD does not know the perpetrators. report recommends
  tailor anti-terrorism training for deployed personnel; provide more focused
  anti-terrorism intel to field units; improve interchange with host nations
  on intel and security. U.S. intel community was providing 24-hour coverage
  of terrorist and terrorist-related activity. all available intel widely
  distributed in theater. Intel support was very good is some areas,
  sufficient in others, and lacking in at least one key area - that of
  providing tactical warning of impending attack. U.S. forces acted on
  General threat Intel, but forces lacked specificity that would have made
  the crucial difference. what was missing was the hard tactical warning of
  impending attack - info needed to thwart the op before it reached fruition.
  need improved analysis in Washington at the counter terrorist center. to
  improve Intel forces to augment the southern watch fusion cell with
  counter-terrorism analysts. a fusion cell combines on a timely basis,
  national strategic Intel, gathered around the world, with local or tactical
  Intel. DOD elements had the authority, but were not exploiting all
  potential sources of info. the U.S. Intel community must have the requisite
  authorities and invest more time, people and funds into developing humint
  sources. makes this a general recommendation. field units had limited
  access due [highly classified] Intel. report re Intel organization
  classified.  secretary of defense, report to the president,
  9/16/96, force protection: global interests, global responsibilities.
  General Downing's report re the bombing of Khobar Towers, Saudi Arabia.

<P>  Saudi Arabia,  95-96  Ability of theater and national Intel community to
  conduct in-depth, long term analysis of trends, intentions, and
  capabilities of terrorists is deficient. Development monitored in parallel
  with the country team. Beginning in spring of 95, concerns about the
  possibility of terrorism began to increase. Intel community produced a
  series of reports which expanded and was updated as new intel was
  collected. These events were documented in the Defense Intel Terrorism
 summary, the National Military Joint Intel Center executive highlights, the
  chairman, joint chiefs of staff, daily Intel briefing and the military
  Intel digest. However, focus was on current trends and promulgations of
  warnings. Military intel community lacks sufficient in-depth, long-term
  analysis of trends, intentions, and capabilities of terrorists. DIA had 40
  people assigned to the terrorist mission at the time of the Khobar Towers
  bombing, yet only seven analysts were committed to accomplish detailed
  assessments because of other priority commitments. similar conditions exist
  at service component commands and in the military department elements
  charged with analyzing terrorism. this is particularly crucial re terrorism
  analysis which must promote insight and anticipation of future potential,
  not just repetition of historical anecdote. secretary of defense, report to
  the president, 9/16/96, force protection: global interests, global
  responsibilities. General Downing's report re the bombing of Khobar Towers,
  Saudi Arabia, 30

 <P> Saudi Arabia,  94-96  Senate Intel chairman, Specter, finds Khobar Towers
  bombing "not the result of intel failure." A new committee staff report,
  focused on adequacy of intel re terrorist threat in Saudi Arabia. "There
  was a failure to use intel." Staff reviewed raw and finished intel from
  late 94 through 6/96 from CIA, DIA, NSA, State and others. Staff
  interviewed various members from the intel community. Committee held seven
  hearings. Report determined intel in Saudi Arabia gave its highest priority
  to the terrorist target and aggressively collected against a range of
  internal and external threats from Iran, Hizballah and others. From 4/95
  through the bombing the analytic community produced more than a 100
  products on terrorism in the Arabian peninsula. Among most significant were
  the 6/13/96 Department of State report and the 6/17/96 Military Intel
  Digest outlining numerous suspicious incidents... that warrants improved
  security efforts. Senate Select Committee on Intel staff report on Khobar
  Towers terrorist attack 9/12/96

<P>  Saudi Arabia,  96  Intel failures left the military in Khobar (Dhahran)
  unaware of the magnitude of the threat. Per the chairman of the House
  National Security Committee. "Available intel was virtually devoid of
  specific knowledge of terrorist and dissident activity in Saudi Arabia."
  Washington Post 8/15/96 a33-4

  <P>Saudi Arabia,  69  Staff of the Senate Intel Committee said in a report
  that U.S. military overstated the extent of security measures sought prior
  to the bombing in Dhahran on 6/25/96. Military only asked Saudis to move
  fence 10 feet rather than 400 feet later claimed. Sen. specter said bombing
  was made possible by officials failure to act on 100 separate Intel
  warnings about terrorist acts in Saudi Arabia. A pentagon spokesman said
  it was unfair and cited 130 steps they took to tighten Khobar's security.
  most of he report concerns U.S. intel reports that Muslim fundamentalists
  and Iranian agents targeted U.S. personnel. By march 95, intel had
  determined that Iranian ops in Saudi Arabia were no longer simply intel
  gathering acts but contained potential for terrorism. U.S. intel
  investigated "Iranian operatives" in the eastern province of
  [Saudi Arabia] who were attempting to gather intel on Dhahran.

<P>RUSSIAN PROVOCATION I - TWO SWEDISH *SPIES* ARRESTED

<P>In the beginning of September the Russian Security Service FSB
reported on the arrest32-year old Peter Nordstroem for espionage in St.
Petersburg. The arrest was made at the Naval Museum in
Russias second largest city in front of hidden Russian video-
cameras. The pictures were later shown on Russian television. In
the museum building Nordstroem accepted a wooden Russian doll.
In exchange he handed over 2,000 US dollars. A Russian counter-
intelligence officer was interviewed on TV claiming that Swedish
espionage in Russia had increased. It is the first arrest of a
Swedish spy in modern time in Russia or the Soviet Union.

<P>The Russian Security Service leaked the story to the newspaper
Nezavizimaya Gazeta and to the privately owned TV-station NTV.

<P>Nordstroem came to Russia already on 21 February this year. He 
entered on a visa that expired on 1 March. The Russians claim 
that he represented a company that was created by the Swedish 
Defense Staff for the purpose of espionage. Nordstroem was briefed,
according to Russian media, at the Swedish General Consulate
in the city *on the espionage situation*.

<P>The Russians claim Nordstroem planned the meeting carefully.
The arrest was made in front of a videocamera. Three Russians
rushed the Swede and his Russian contact, handcuffed them and
took them away.

<P>On TV the doll was shown to contain a role of unexposed film.
The Russian contact is accused of having had at least ten contacts
with Swedish military intelligence. The spokesman for FSB, Sergey 
Gorlenko, said that Swedish intelligence lately had shown increasing
interest in the Russian Navy, but also in the situation in Caucasus.
But the Swedish agents according to Gorlenko also have an interest in
the Ural and Volga regions.

<P>One can wonder why FSB waited as long as six months before leaking
the news of the incident to media ?

<P>The spy accusation led to a Swedish diplomat having to leave Moscow
earlier than planned. However, Nordstroem had between 1989 and 1995 
worked for the Swedish Defense Research Establishment. He now was
employed by the Celsius Tech Corporation involved in the most
secret defense equipment project in Sweden, the missile protection
of the new Swedish jet fighter JAS Griffin.

<P>Later in September another Swede living in Gothenburg was accused
in Russian media for espionage in the city of Pskov, believed in
Sweden to be the staging point for a possible future Russian invasion.
It is the center for the airborne troops in Northwest Russia.

<P>Four possible theories for the FSB action in September have been 
put forward by intelligence experts:

<P>- It is a war between KSI, the secret Swedish intelligence organization,
  and the Russian FSB. KSI might have carried out several succesful
  operations and FSB now wanted to break the trend.

<P>- It is a revenge action for the deportation of the Russian spy
  Michail Smirnov from Sweden in April 1995.

<P>- FSB is seeking a larger budget and wants to show its muscles for
  the Russian administration and the State Duma.

<P>- It is an attempt to interfere with the cooperation between the
  littoral countries of the Baltic Sea. The Nordstroem affair was 
  revealed the same day US mediator Richard Holbrooke arrived in
  Stockholm to discuss Baltic cooperation.

<P>Your editor believes in the last theory. The Russians are angry over
Sweden leaving its policy of non-alliance and moving towards a
closer cooperation with the United States.</P>

RUSSIAN PROVOCATION II - DID THE RUSSIAN<BR>
CRUISER SHOOT DOWN A SWEDISH FIGHTER ?<BR>

<P>Latvian naval officers on 16 October claimed that the
Swedish jet fighter that crashed in the water near
the new Russian nuclear missile cruiser *Peter the
Great* was shot down. Earlier the Swedish Air Force Staff
believed it was an accident but the new theory will also
be tested in the investigation.

<P>The facts are that the Russians were making a test run
with the cruiser around 30 nautical miles outside the
Latvian coast. Two Latvian patrol vessels were watching the
Russians.

<P>Two Swedish Viggen fighters were flying low near the cruiser
to take photographs. Suddenly a Russian reconnaissance aircraft
appears in front of the Swedish planes and they attempt to
pass under it. During this manuever one of the Swedish pilots
crashed into the water. He never had time to eject himself from
the plane.

<P>Latvian officers aboard the patrol vessels claim that there was
an intense radio traffic between the Russian vessels which was
suddenly broken off and followed by firing and flames were seen
from the Swedish Viggen that went down. The other pilot managed
to get away and return to base.

<P>Later Russian media claimed that the Swedish fighters were training
mock attacks against the cruiser, which has been denied by the
Swedish Air Force. The Latvians underlined the importance of Sweden
salvaging the wreckage of the plane to find evidence of the Russian
shots.

<P>The latest incident could be another attempt by the Russians to tell
Sweden that they are unhappy about Swedish-American cooperation in
what Moscow believes is its backyard.</P>

DISINFORMATION IN THE PALME CASE<BR>

<P>Late in September South African Colonel Eugene de Kock revealed
in the Supreme Court in Pretoria, where he is standing trial, that
he knew that the assassination of Olof Palme, the Swedish Premier,
in February 1986, was planned by the South African intelligence
officer Craig Williamson.

<P>De Kock is standing trial accused of a number of s.c. hit squad
assassinations in South Africa during the 1980s and 1990s.

<P>Another hit squad officer, Dirk Coetzee, later said that the
actual shooting of Palme in Stockholm was carried out by a 
former member of the Rhodesian Selous Scouts, Anthony White,
now living in Mocambique.

<P>Yet another South African intelligence operative claimed
that the assassin was a Swede living on Northern Cyprus.
Other sources indicated it was a Turk hired by the South
Africans to do the shooting.

<P>The reason for the assassination of Palme was claimed to be that
he was an active opponent of apartheid and that ANC was 
supported by Swedish funds.

<P>One of the reasons for this explosion of allegations is of
course that some of the officers are standing trial or are
risking prosecution. One opportunity to be pardoned is
to tell as much as possible for the s.c. Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission.

<P>The main suspect in Sweden is a man that was sentenced for the
crime in lower court, Christer Pettersson. He was picked out in
a police line-up by the only witness, Mrs. Palme. No murder weapon
has been found and with the identification by Mrs. Palme it will
be hard indeed for the police to even get a prosecution of an
alleged South African suspect.

<P>Other possibilities through the years have been PKK, the Kurdish
terrorist organization, Iranian intelligence and the former KGB.

<P>De Kock says he has no first hand information and that he will
tell all before the Commission when his trial is over.

<P>Meanwhile the game of disinformation continues. After ten years it is
not likely the assassin will ever be convicted.</P>

SWEDENS MILITARY INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION<BR>

<P>MUST (Militaera underraettelse- och sakerhetstjaensten), Swedish Military
intelligence, is led by Major General Erik Rossander.

<P>He leads seven sections: the Command Section under Colonel Haakan
Petterson. The Analysis Section is headed by Colonel Mats Engman.
Naval Commander Mats Haglund is head of Operations and Lt. Colonel
Johan Edstroem heads Military Forces Section. Security and Protection
is the responsibility of Naval Captain Erland Soennerstedt and
responsible for diplomatic contacts is the Military Attache Section.
The Office for Special Investigation (KSI) is the top secret section of 
MUST.</P>

SERB FROM SWEDEN CHEATED KARADZIC<BR>

<P>One of the main supporters of suspected war criminal Radovan Karadzic
has been a Serb living in Sweden, Brank Ostojic.

<P>He is now suspected of cheating the Bosnian Serb Republic of around
10 million US dollars. Ostojic became Swedish citizen in 1983 and 
belonged to the inner circle of Bosnias most wanted man. Ostojic 
is believed to have purchased weapons for the Bosnian Serbs in 
Copenhagen, Denmark, for large amounts.

<P>He has been a resident of Moscow during the latest months but his 
official residence is Malmoe, Sweden.

<P>Ostojic was made Vice Premier and also Minister of Finance and
Industry for his help of the Serbs in Bosnia. The Pale *government*
now accuses Ostojic of a multimillion embezzlement in connection
with an oil deal.</P>

COMMUNIST PARTY LEADER IN SWEDEN ALCOHOLIC<BR>

<P>Mrs. Gudrun Schyman, leader of the Left Party in Sweden, with around
12 percent of the electorate in the latest polls, had recently to
be treated for alcoholism. It happened after she used a movie theater
as public bathroom during the showing of a film.

<center><H3>HOW THE CIA COMBATS INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM ..
</H3>
<BR>
</center>

By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<BR>
<BR>

<P>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director John Deutch recently
gave a speech at Georgetown University in Washington that offered
some insight on how the CIA is working against international
terrorism.

<P>According to Deutch, the principal threats are radical Islamic
fundamentalist groups, such as the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
the Egyptian al-Gama'a al-Islamiya, HAMAS and others.  These
groups use terrorism as their only way to battle democratic
institutions.  Deutch warned that these groups are considered
to be a growing threat.

<P>To offset these terrorist organizations, the U.S. intelligence
community established the Counterterrorist Center in 1986.  The
CTC reports directly to the DCI and is designed to bring all
elements of the intelligence community together to collect and
analyze information from all over the world about terrorists and
their organizations.  Information such as how terrorists train
and operate is collected, as well as who supports them and where
they may hide.

<P>Professional officers from ten different agencies are part of the
CTC.  They come from the CIA, the National Security Agency, the
Defense Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the U.S. State Department and others.  These officers work together
to provide a "strategic warning" about terrorists who may be
planning to strike at United States interests inside or outside
of the country.

<P>In Deutch's opinion, the CTC is the best organization, of its type,
in the world.  If another nation has better information about a
specific terrorist threat, the CTC will seek access to that
information through liaison relationships.

<P>The Director said that President Clinton instructed him to increase
intelligence efforts against the terrorist threat.  Recently, the
CIA has implemented a four-point program to comply with the
directive:

<P>-- A national-level foreign Terrorism Warning Group was created
within the CTC.  This group is made up of experts who will focus
their efforts to review intelligence from all sources and will
provide warning of possible terrorist attacks against U.S. interests
and facilities.

<P>-- A significant number of additional CIA Directorate of Operations
case officers have been deployed overseas and are assigned to the
CTC to work against foreign terrorism.

<P>-- Intelligence support for force protection has been expanded
for military facilities.  An example of this would be the use
of National Intelligence Support Teams.  Currently, there are
seven such teams that are assisting the U.S. military in the
Balkans and in Saudi Arabia.

<P>-- The U.S. intelligence community will increase its capability
to act forcefully against terrorists worldwide.  More options
will be given to the President to preempt and disrupt and defeat
any known terrorist plans.

<P>There recently was a worldwide anti-terrorism conference that
was held in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.  Counterterrorism
experts who attended that conference said that reacting to
terrorist attacks is not the way to combat the attacks themselves.
Most experts said that there must be a long-term, continuing
effort to improve and sustain security around U.S. interests.

<P>The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Air Force
General Joseph W. Ralston. said that recent terrorist attacks
have not been isolated incidents.  Ralston said, "We need to
put aside the notion that terrorism is a series of unfortunate,
one-time events to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis."

<P>"We have emerged in the last decade as the first target of
international terrorism for a host of political, economic,
geopolitical reasons," said Winston Wiley, the chief of the
CIA's Counterterrorist Center.

<P>Wiley believes that future attacks will be conducted with more
advanced unconventional weapons.  Terrorists will probably
attempt to use nuclear, chemical or biological materials.
Wiley said, "As the decade evolves, I think we're going to
see some movement in that direction."</P>

<center><H3>HUMINT STILL MOST IMPORTANT WHEN THWARTING TERRORISTS
</H3>
<BR>
</center>

By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<BR>
<BR>

<P>Even though U.S. intelligence agencies have billions upon billions
of dollars worth of sophisticated technical equipment at their
disposal, when it comes to thwarting terrorists -- human operatives
are still the most important asset.

<P>Spending on intelligence in recent years has substantially declined
in the past ten years.  However, more resources have been directed
toward to improve "human intelligence" devoted to combat terrorists.

<P>Senior intelligence officials say that the U.S. has improved its
capability against terrorists and the nations that support them.
One potential terrorist target area of particular concern are
terrorists who target airliners.

<P>Burton L. Hutchings is an aviation security consultant and a
former CIA counterterrorism specialist.  He said, "The role of
the intelligence community is to give the tipoff, to alert the
FAA, who then passes it on to the aviation community."

<P>When Hutchings was employed at the Central Intelligence Agency,
he had a direct telephone line to the FAA on his desk.  Hutchings
said that recalls that aviation officials often became frustrated
when he attempted to relay potential threats in nonspecific terms
in order to protect CIA sources and methods.  He recalled, "After
you've done this three or four times, the airline companies would
say, 'If you're not going to say anything more specific, we're
not going to do anymore countermeasures.'"

<P>The United States has the most sophisticated SIGINT (Signals
Intelligence) assets in the world.  These assets include spy
satellites and planes.  These assets do aid in the detection
of terrorists by intercepting their phone, computer, e-mail,
and radio communications.  However, according to intelligence
experts, these technological assets still cannot replace the
importance of human intelligence assets.  Human operatives
are still needed to infiltrate and uncover the plans of terrorist
groups.

<P>Reportedly, U.S. intelligence has been having some success in
their efforts against terrorists.  The CIA says that they have
substantially increased the number of new sources reporting to
it on terrorism.  ENN will go more in-depth on the CIA's
counterterrorism center in a few days.

<P>CIA Director John Deutch has recently said, "The gain in the past
18 months far exceeds previous achievements."

<P>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is responsible for fighting
terrorism within the borders of the United States.  The Bureau
has recently redeployed 500 agents to counterterrorism duty.

<P>The CIA and the FBI are now working together to combat terrorism.
Earlier this year, for the first time ever, CIA station chiefs
and FBI legal attaches held meetings to discuss terrorism.  This
is a vast improvement over the days of the infamous bureaucratic
rivalries between the two agencies.

<P>More information is also flowing to the FAA and the U.S. Department
of Transportation.  The information is coming from the CIA, the FBI
and the U.S. State Department, which is the lead agency on
international terrorism.

<P>It is said that the hijacking of TWA Flight 847, a flight that
was diverted from Athens to Beirut in 1985, was the incident that
caused the U.S. to really get serious about international terrorism.
After that hijacking, the CIA created its first counterterrorism
center in 1986.

<P>"There have been a lot of potential ... attacks against aircraft
that have been thwarted," said Robert H. Kupperman, who is a
senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies and highly regarded expert on terrorism.  Kupperman
added that there have been many U.S. "silent" success stories.

<P>The job of tracking terrorists and terrorist groups is not
becoming easier.  Smaller, less organized groups appear to
be emerging.  This makes the job of thwarting terrorists
more difficult.

<P>Former CIA director Robert Gates said, "There is the problem
of free-lance terrorists.  But the other side of that is, as
you get groups like that, they also tend to be more amateurish.
They do things like take their rental cars back for rebates,
drive the principal vehicle used in an attack without license
plates.  They make foolish mistakes that traditional, state-
sponsored groups would not make."</P>

<center><H3>Deputy Attorney General speaks on computer terrorism
</H3>
<BR>
</center>

By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<BR>
<BR>

<P>WASHINGTON (ENN) - Deputy U.S. Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick on
Friday spoke at a forum that was sponsored by the Council on Foreign
Relations.  Ms. Gorelick, said that there is a high potential of
crippling strikes aimed at vital U.S. computer and/or energy systems by
terrorists.

<P>"One of our most important challenges in the coming years will be
battling terrorists at home and abroad," said Gorelick.  She added that
the United States could respond to the attacks with various options that
range from "intelligence collection to military options."

<P>Gorelick also said that the U.S. must defend itself against terrorists
who have the potential to "wreck havoc with little investment of time or
money or personal risk."  According to Gorelick, terrorist attacks since
1993 have decreased by about 20 percent, but Americans remain the prime
target of international terrorists.

<P>She added in her speech, that the U.S. government should take  "a very
aggressive response" and should implement the future recommendations of
a presidential commission that call for "hardening vital infrastructure
against computer and physical attacks."

<P>In closing, Gorelick said, "Our national well-being rests on an
increasingly interconnected infrastructure ... our power grids, our
telecommunications, our banking system, gas and oil pipelines and
transportation system are increasingly linked together."</P>

<P>Greek NATO Officer's Car Bombed

<P>An explosion in Athens late on Thursday night destroyed the parked car
of a Greek Air Force officer connected with NATO, prompting speculation
that it may be the beginning of a new wave of terrorist strikes. No one
was injured.

<P>The car was parked on the road at the intersection of Keas and
Kithairionos streets near the house of the officer in the densely
populated district of Kypseli, a police spokesman said. The owner was
identified as Greek Air Force Colonel Antonis Roussos, 49, who, until
recently, was serving at the NATO base in Naples, Italy, home to the
military alliance's Mediterranean air wing. Roussos is one month away
from retirement.

<P>According to police reports, a time-bomb was used in the explosion -
similar to the devices used by the November 17 terrorist group during
the 70's. There was no claim of responsibility but the anti-terrorist
squad did not rule out that November 17 or another terrorist group, such
as the Revolutionary People's Struggle (ELA), were behind the attack.


<P>The explosion, at 11 p.m., destroyed the front of Roussos' Mercedes
which had the licence plate number AFI-N58917 and also displayed
assorted military stickers. The explosion also damaged a car parked
nearby and shattered the windows of several neighboring buildings. "When
we heard the explosion we immediately thought of the car", the officer's
wife Vasso said. Roussos said he had not received threats from anyone at
any time. Small anarchist groups often use homemade explosive devices to
damage vehicles belonging to officials of Western countries or
organizations to stress their opposition to Greece's membership of NATO
and the European Union.

American Forces Press Service<BR>

<P>        Bariloche, Argentina -- Manuals advocating torture and other
inhumane treatment will never again be part of DoD training, said
U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry.
<P>        In September, DoD officials released segments from Spanish-
language training manuals used at the U.S. Army School of the
Americas in the 1980s.

<P> Passages mentioned  interrogation techniques, executions and use of truth
serums.

<P>        Use of the offensive materials was wrong and is totally
unacceptable, Perry said during a press conference Oct. 8.

<P>        Instructors teaching intelligence courses at the school and
at U.S. Southern Command's mobile training teams used the manuals
from 1982 through 1991, DoD officials said. The school, now at
Fort Benning, Ga., was in Panama and has trained 60,000 U.S. and
Latin American officers, cadets, NCOs, police and civilians since
1946.

 <P>            DoD has  added human rights  instruction to the School of the
Americas curriculum. A board of  visitors, which includes human rights
advocates, reviews the  curriculum, course content and teching methods.

<P>
PRESS RELEASE - 10/14/96<BR>
American Forces Press Service<BR>

<P>Reacting after a terrorist attack  is not the way to combat terrorist
attacks, according to officials at DoD's recent worldwide anti-terrorism
conference at Fort Walton Beach, Fla. Combating the threat of attack
requires a long-term, continuing effort to improve and sustain security
for U.S. personnel and facilities, the experts said.

<P>DoD and other federal officials and civilian law enforcers discussed the
need to change people's mindset on anti-terrorism. Officials said they
need to break the cycle of being complacent when there are no attacks
and then developing a "hunker down" response after terrorist attacks
occur.

<P>Recent attacks are not isolated incidents, according to Air Force Gen.
Joseph W. Ralston, vice chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. "We need to put
aside the notion that terrorism is a series of unfortunate, one-time
events to be dealt with on a case by case basis," he said.

<P>Winston Wiley, chief of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center in Washington
said "We have emerged in the last decade as the first target of
international terrorism for a host of political, economic, geopolitical
reasons," Future attacks will take advantage of the world's advanced
weapons technology, he said. Conventional, semi-smart and smart weapons
systems are becoming increasingly available in the world marketplace.
Terrorists may also concoct crazy cocktails of nuclear, biological and
chemical materials. "As the decade evolves I think we're going to see
some movement in that direction," Wiley said.

<P>Terrorists will also take advantage of advances in information
technology, Wiley said. "It is not that terrorists are out in front of
the rest of society," he said. "It's simply that they are going along
taking advantage of the increasing number of communications systems,
transportation systems, public encryption and the like. That fits
naturally into their kit bag."

<P>Conference working groups said more funding, better training and a
clearly defined chain of responsibility are needed to ensure a
consistent, sustainable force protection program, DoD officials said.
The United States also needs better intelligence sharing and to develop
a national policy detailing interagency responsibilities. DoD, the Joint
Staff and the unified combatant commanders are now focused on reducing
the vulnerability of U.S. personnel and facilities.  The fiscal 1998
budget will include money specifically appropriated for force
protection.</P>

                       *****Fire/EMS News*****<BR>

<P>(Prague, Czechlosavakia) Prague fire officials are reporting a major
subway incident today, in which as many as thirty people may have been
injured. Smoke filled the central section of the underground train
system and forced a cessation of operations at approx. 10:00a.m.
(local). As many as thirty people may have suffered smoke inhalation
injuries as they were evacuated from the tunnel. Several were taken to
local hospitals, but no further information on their condition was made
available.  No cause of this incident was immediately determined and it
is said to be under investigation.</P>

<center><H3>GANGBANGERS INVADE CYBERSPACE
</H3>
<H4>By Steve Macko, ENN Editor</H4><BR>
<BR>
</center>



<P>
Chicago, IL (ENN) -- As if law enforcement officers didn't already have
enough to worry about, there is now a new hangout in cyberspace. It's
for street gang members and gangbanger wannabes. Just what was needed --
a place for gang members to exchange ideas on how to improve drug sales,
what's the best gun to use to shoot your business rivals and what's the
best drugs to use in your spare time?

<P>All of that and even more can be found on the Glock3 Web site. This site
is said to link members of street gangs from around the world, from 'Lil
Shorty's Click in London to the Gangster Disciples in Chicago to the
West Side Crips in Phoenix. Experts say that the site provides a virtual
how-to-be a street gang member.

<P>The site was said to be created in early January by gangbangers in
Detroit. In the first three months, it recorded about 9,000 hits --
which is pretty respectable. After its internet service provider saw
what was going on -- Glock3 was deleted from the service. In April, the
enterprising gang members found a new internet provider ... in New
Zealand.

<P>The Auckland internet provider has received complaints about the Web
site, but the company feels its powerless to do anything about it. The
operations manager for the provider said, "We have no legal right to
censor the content. We don't have the authority. The legislation hasn't
caught up with the internet."

<P>An example of the type of individual that visits the Web site is a gang
member who calls herself, "GDLookin'" She talks about her favorite music
groups, partying in Mexico and smoking "out" on the Glock3 "phat linkz"
page. She must be a real charmer. Other members have bragged about
serving time for such offenses as: carjacking, carrying a concealed
weapon, auto theft, assault and arson.

<P>Sergeant Mark Clark of the Scottsdale, Arizona, Police Department says
that he is more concerned about Web sites showing how to make bombs then
how to act and dress like a gangbanger.

<P>The Scottsdale Police Department has established its own Web site that
is dedicated to fighting gangs. The new site offers gang statistics,
phone numbers and tips for parents on keeping their kids out of gangs.
Any questions can be directed to Sergeant Clark at his e-mail address
of: spdganggood@net.com

<P>As a reminder, the Emergency Response and Research Institute's EMERGENCY
BBS has a large library on information about Chicago street gangs. You
can reach the EMERGENCY BBS at the number given at the end of the ENN
DAILY REPORT or if you don't want to pay long distance fees -- you can
reach the BBS through telnet from anywhere in the world.

<P>Clark said that there are not a large number of street gang members in
Scottsdale. "Half the gang population of Arizona lives in Phoenix," he
said. "And we're a part of the Phoenix metropolitan area."

<P>In the United States, there are at least 25,000 street gangs with an
estimated membership of about 650,000 people. Gangbangers in the
Southwest portion of the U.S. are said to be less organized than those
on the East Coast, said Jim Ledy, a criminal-intelligence analyst for
the Arizona Department of Public Safety.

<P>Captain David Gonzales, who heads up the Arizona DPS gang task force,
said about gangs on the internet, "Now it's in your home, your living
room, your den. Street gangs are moving toward more of an organized
crime stature." (Editor's Note: the captain needs to come to Chicago and
see how organized they are here.)

<P>Gonzales, who has been tracking gangbangers for almost ten years, added,
"Unfortunately, these guys can talk about anything they want and there's
nothing law enforcement can do about it. It establishes a worldwide
connection to gangs everywhere."

<P>* Thanks to G.I. Wilson for his help in the preparation of this
article.*</P>

<center><H2>Terrorism in a New World--THE EVOLUTION IN REVOLUTION</H2>
By: Michael Wilson [5514706@mcimail.com] The Nemesis Group<BR>
Copyright 1994.  All rights reserved.<BR>

<P>
In a time when a greater peace appears to be breaking out, smaller
conflicts appear to be on the upswing. There are two major causes for
this--the death of the superpowers and the stability they brought, and a
severe reduction in the  minimum means necessary to engage in conflict.
The preferred method? Terror.

<P>Terrorism has been correctly identified as being media driven. In its
guerrilla warfare form, terrorism is intended to bring attention to a
conflict when the media is perceived to be controlled by the opposition
or when it has no wish to cover the conflict otherwise. Organizations
such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (RA) or the Palestinian
Intifada fall into this category--RA against British rule and control of
the media, the Intifada against Israeli occupation, with a perceptive
media bias in favor of Israel.

<P>Other terrorism is for the purpose of distraction, slight of hand, or
revenge. Syria, Iraq, and Iran, following their belief that the ability
to destroy is the ability to control, have used terror acts to control
the Palestinian peace process terms and timing; the Syrian-backed Al
Saiqa attack in Austria just prior to the October War distracted Israel
from the impending threat; and attacks such as Black September's Munich
Olympic operation, were purely reprisal.

<P>Over time, terrorism has changed its form. The first generation of
'modern' terrorism, post-World War II, was based on a theory of
attrition, a strategy of exhaustion. Target profiles were 'no retreat,'
such as airplane hijackings and Embassy takeovers. Counter-terror
tactics caught up at Entebbe, showing that police methods and commando
strikes worked against this threat. Second generation terrorist attacks
stemmed from a reactive evolution and focused on a strategy of
recognition, almost a coercive propaganda. These methods were  adopted,
in different forms, by the RA and Palestinian groups. 'No contact'
targets were adopted, primarily through the use of explosive devices.
Attack on this strategy was made by criminalizing the action, with
complete removal of the political context in media coverage of the event
or group carrying out the operation.

<P>The next step in terrorism, which is happening now, applies technology
to overcome these problems. While nations' military and intelligence
services re-tool themselves to deal with the fall of the Eastern bloc
and worry about  nuclear proliferation, a different genie has come out
of the bottle, one that  can't be put back in, and for which there is no
infrastructural control possible.

<P>Communications technology has revolutionized the way the average man
lives,  works, thinks, and plays. The popularization of this
technological  infrastructure will provide a ready tool for the future
terrorist--a global  arena and a way to leverage limited resource. Soon
to be gone (in most parts of the world) will be the cut-outs, drops,
forwards and other elements of tradecraft in the Cold War period.

<P>The telephone system, with its anonymous payphones, reprogrammed
cellular phones that allow one to roam, facsimile machines, alphanumeric
pagers, and voicemail are only the beginning. In and of themselves, they
can act as a digital replacement for most items of tradecraft, but they
provide even better services. They also allow computer networks, private
and public, with numerous anonymous  entrypoints, to move information
around without worry; information as simple as a scanned image altered
in a creative fashion to be distributed, laser printed, copied, and
distributed for propaganda purposes; or information as potent as a
continuing evolutionary design of explosive devices. Distribution
through the electronic mail, mailing lists, anonymous remailers,
newsgroups, or whatever, can now act as a 'community memory,' keeping
all parties informed of all evolution in tactic, technique, and
technology.

<P>Digital cryptography for the masses has provided another powerful tool.
Messages can be secured using public-key cryptographic technology, among
other methods, for authenticated distribution--internal to a 'virtual
organization' for things such as operational plans, or external, to
media organizations to provide  propaganda statements to negate
counter-terror efforts to 'close the lid' on  issues. Even this
technology is rapidly evolving and will provide even greater
capabilities--voice encryption using a normal computer, providing
security and authentication for dynamic, real-time communication; the
ability to disguise secure information as signal 'noise' inside of other
data, innocuous or not, such as the large pornographic sub-culture on
the public computer networks.

<P>This technology is being given away free to any who want it, even making
the 'source code' available, to allow the user to be certain it isn't
gimmicked; this allows a more sophisticated user to make alterations, or
use certain techniques for  other purposes (such as the creation of a
cryptographic computer virus, which  infect a system and encrypt data
with a public key technique for blackmail purposes, since capturing the
virus doesn't provide a mechanism for retrieving the data). Rising
interest in such technology have also made available the cryptanalysis
resources for attacking such systems, which secure personal, corporate,
and government computers world-wide.

<P>Technology is making direct alterations in the way every organization
operates;  terrorist groups, or for that matter, any organization with
the wherewithal to, can drop the hierarchical or 'cell' structure that
is out of date. Such  structures, other than being inefficient, have
also become negated through contract tracing, traffic analysis, or
'gateway' style checkpoints on members which make the entire
organization vulnerable. Heterarchies, with localized independent action
are the next wave, with authority being roll- based and functional, and
structures only being one level deep, allowing direct control or
supervision but providing complete isolation from the other elements of
the network.

<P>Recruiting is effected--members who are voluntarists can be thoroughly
investigated before trust is given. Collateral networks can be
established as  never before--vulnerable elements on the computer
networks such as women or  homosexuals can be exploited; tracing back
dependent behavior such as drugs,  sexual, or other deviant behavior can
provide blackmail leverage; mules can be recruited among the population
who are still legal 'minors.' Legends, cover  stories, for members of
the organization can be made quite thorough and backdated.

<P>Funding for the organization can come from industrial espionage, which requires 
essentially the same virtual infrastructure, computer crime, or blackmail. The 
needs of the organization won't be extreme, however, as the technology provides 
leverage, and the infrastructural costs are practically negligible, carried 
mainly by the legitimate use by the populous at large.

<P>Operations gain considerably, and intelligence and research, the backbone of any
organization, profit most; targets can be isolated and an in-depth background 
brief and schedule developed through penetration of computers and communications
(including contact tracing, purchasing habits, travel, etc.), and all in a 
fashion that doesn't alert the target or any security protection they may have. 
Training, planning, and debriefing can benefit from virtual walk-throughs, 
models of anything important to the operation built entirely in advance, which 
can be used together by team members who need never meet to use them, working 
over secured networks. Post operation 'spin control' can benefit from massive 
monitoring of media channels and real-time propaganda or manipulation. 
Operations may even become fully digital--information warfare attacks are highly
leveraged, low cost, can be done at any distance, take whatever time needed yet 
be synchronized, have complete surprise, and move faster than the opposition can
respond to.

<P>There is very little in the world of intelligence that is not now available to 
most anyone with technology and the will. More so than any 'dual use' 
technology, computers and communications are an equalizer, in a world where 
whomever makes the first move, wins.<BR>

<H2>by John Dermaut</H2>


</center>
<P>"Terrorism is the security challenge of the 21st century."  British
Prime Minister John Major.<BR>

<P>1. Tough talk alone does not work.  Besides, it is all "Deja entendu"
(heart that before...).</P>
<A NAME="arabia"></A>
<P>On August 2, 1996, Defense Secretary William Perry warned any nation
linked to the <A HREF="#Point1">bombing of U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia</A> of "<B>strong action</B>."  Secretary Perry also said that
there are several different groups in the Gulf region that the U.S. was
watching closely and that even included some domestic groups in the
desert Kingdom.  Some 20,000 American troops are stationed in the
Persian Gulf to defend American "vital interests" and to maintain the
flow of the liquid gold.  Four thousand of those troops will be moved to
"safer places" because the terrorist threat continues to exist.  That
move will cost more than $200 million, of which Saudi Arabia will pay
half.  It is no secret that certain groups want the U.S. out of the Gulf
region altogether.  Secretary Perry said: "<B>We cannot let them
succeed</B>."  Perry ordered 700 dependents to leave Saudi
Arabia....</P>

<P>It is very interesting to note that the speaker of the House, Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., in an interview mentioned two countries: Syria and Iran
but not Libya.  He stated: "We are the most powerful nation in the world
and the message we should send to Syria, Iran and similar countries is,
"<B>you mess with us and you will be severely damaged</B>."  He also
said that if necessary "<B>decisive action</B>" will be taken.</P>

<P>Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, stated that if Iran was involved in the
bombing, "<B>we're going to have to get tough</B>."  Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., went even further and said that if the bombing was supported by
a state, it would be "<B>an act of war</B>."</P>

<P>As far as the investigation into the bombing, FBI Director Louis
Freeh found the Cooperation with the local officials "<B>good</B>." But,
he said, it needs improvement...</P> 
<A NAME="panam"></A>
<P>On August 5, 1996, President Clinton called Libya and Iran "two of
the most dangerous supporters of terrorism in the world."  He also
stated that  "<B>the United States will bring to justice any terrorists
who attack the United Sates or U.S. citizens</B>."  President Clinton
will sign a bill that would punish foreign companies investing in Iran's
or Libya's energy sector.  That bill is already being criticized by
Canada, Mexico, China, Russia and most of the European countries, all of
whom indicate they will not go along with it.  The measure would impose
sanctions on foreign firms that invest $40 million or more in a year in
the energy sector of either Iran or  Libya.  Clinton was joined by
relatives of victims of the in 1988 downed <A HREF="#Point2">Pan Am
103</A>.</P>

<P>Terrorists get concerned during an election year because each
political parties wants to look tougher than the other.  The most
difficult part is when one of the parties gets elected and has to
deliver results.  That is when terrorists can resume their
activities.</P>

<P>Both Iran and Libya are on the State Department's list of countries
that sponsor terrorism.  Iran accuses the U.S. of pointing a finger at a
soft and convenient target and stated that the U.S. should either "shut
up" or produce evidence to back the allegations.  Iranian officials also
claim that by constantly accusing Iran, the terrorist groups around the
globe will have a free ride because no matter who plants bombs, Iran
will always be blamed and the real perpetrators will escape justice.</P>

<P>Germany and some other countries ask why both Syria and Saudi Arabia
are not on the proposed sanctions list. </P> 

<P>During questioning by Israeli authorities, an Islamic militant named
Hassan Salameh, admitted that he was trained in Iran and Sudan.  Salameh
is accused of illegal possession of explosives and of assisting suicide
bombers. </P> 

<P>Osama Bin Laden has been linked to terrorist activities, according to
the U.S. Department of State.  Laden allegedly is one of the most
significant sponsors worldwide of Islamic fundamentalist activities,
which range from funding recruitment centers in Egypt to sponsoring some
specific terrorist acts.</P>  

<P>Reportedly Iran considered a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, the
choke point for half of the world's oil.  Europe, Asia and the United
States are its biggest customers.  The largest oil-producers use the
Strait to export the liquid gold.  The equivalent of Europe's daily
consumption, which is about 15 million barrels, passes through there.
</P> 

<P>Then there is Turkey where Necmettin Erbakan became Prime Minister
after the elections in December 1995.  During the campaign, Erbakan
proposed to pull out of NATO, cut ties with Israel, and pushed for an
Islamic Union.  Erbakan has signed a $20 billion agreement with Iran to
buy natural gas for the next 20 years.</P>

<P>Although no country can defeat the US militarily, several
organizations could bring U.S. cities and/or states to their knees
through a sustained campaign of terrorism.  It has been done in overseas
countries.  Let's hope it never happens here.  </P><BR>



<P><B>2. International co-operation...</B>

<P>The G-7 nations and Russia came up with a 25 points plan.  The U.S.
also comes up with plan and this is the nth plan after the nth bombing. 
It is starting to look like a pattern:  once there is a bombing; there
is a plan.  Then some kind of committee is formed.  There is a large
variety to choose from: simple committees, sub-committees, oversight
committees, investigating committees and advisory committees.  The
formed committee can either report to the House, Senate or government
agency.  Or they can choose to all form their own.  A lot of times the
wheel is reinvented over and over again. A recurring thread is the cry
for more cooperation between departments and/or countries, and for the
exchange of more intelligence between departments and/or countries. 
Sanctions of some type are popular, too.  How much cooperation and
exchange of information is really there if after every major bombing
countries keep needing to increase cooperation and exchange of
information ?</P>

<P>In June of 1984 (twelve years ago) a G-7 summit was held in London. 
Already then the participating nations agreed that there was a need for
"closer cooperation between police and security organizations and other
relevant authorities, especially in the exchange of information,
intelligence and technical knowledge."</P>  

<P>Two years later, in May of 1986, another summit was held in Tokyo
where the seven nations urged for "the closest possible bilateral and
multilateral cooperation between police and security organizations and
other relevant authorities in the fight against terrorism."</P>  

<P>In June 1987 they all came together in Venice where the heads of
state were "profoundly aware of our peoples' concern at the threat posed
by terrorism" and they reaffirmed their "determination to combat
terrorism both through national measures and through international
cooperation among ourselves and with others, when appropriate, and
therefore renew our appeal to all like-minded countries to consolidate
and extend international cooperation in all appropriate fora." </P> 

<P>Last year the G-7 and Russia all met in Canada where they concluded
that they were "determined to work together in the international
community, with international organizations, institutions and other fora
to fight terrorism."  With an aim to preventing terrorist acts they
proposed to: "share our technical knowledge, intelligence, forecasts of
threats and activities and information on different tactics and methods,
means of terrorists through closer bilateral and other forms of
co-operation among police and security agencies and other relevant
authorities."</P>  

<P>During the last summit in July 1996, in Paris, the eight countries
came to the conclusion that "in order to harness our own capacities more
tightly we decided to establish among our countries a directory of
counter-terrorism competences, skills and expertise to facilitate
practical cooperation.  The very first subheading under "Adopting
Internal Measures To Prevent Terrorism" is "Improving counter-terrorism
cooperation and capabilities."</P>

<P>The G-7 and now G-8 does not even agree on the spelling of the word
"cooperation" (or is it co-operation) and they are going to stop
terrorism !  It looks like the only ones who benefit from these summits
are the travel agencies, airlines, and caterers.  The other thought was
that it probably would be a better idea to have a summit on learning how
to ski.  It would save more lives than the summits on terrorism do.</P>

<P><B>3. Deja vu.</B>

<P>Apparently the CIA has gathered intelligence about the possible
involvement of Iranian authorities in the bombing of the TWA 800 plane. 
The gathered material is "vague, nothing solid."  There are also reports
that a terrorist was able to enter Israel via an international airline,
went to his hotel, and assembled a bomb that went off prematurely,
blowing his legs and an arm off.  His intention was to assemble the bomb
and then somehow get it on an airplane that would be leaving from
Israel's Ben Gurion airport.</P>

<P>A draft report by the staff of the House National Security Committee
states that "U.S. intelligence operations were unprepared to deal with
the threat posed to Americans in Saudi Arabia."  Kenneth Bacon gave
details about efforts to improve security before and after the bombing
of the U.S. military housing complex.  Why details about improvements
before the bombing ?  Whatever happened to all the reports, findings,
recommendations, suggestions, changes in policy and procedures that were
or were going to be implemented after the Marine barracks bombing in
Beirut ?</P>  

<P>A journalist pretending to be disabled, hid a toy gun and a fake bomb
in the wheelchair he was using and smuggled them through French and
Israeli airports.</P>  

<P>The one really disturbing fact is that it seems like every single
country just accepted the fact that terrorism is here and here to stay. 
It is even more disturbing to see that all we are able or willing to do
is to build thicker walls, higher walls or wider walls.  Why is it that
democracies adopt such a defeatists attitude ?  We reduced ourselves to
defenders,  to countries who wait to be bombed and terrorized and once
when a building is leveled, we count the bodies, then rebuild it all but
only higher than the previous structure.  Then we wait again and so on. 
We do not dare to punish the ones who are responsible for the mayhem. 
We do not dare to insult or even  worse, accuse any individual culprit,
let alone country or countries.  The prime example is the Pan AM 103
bombing.  Everyone knows who did it, authorities even have their
pictures but what is DONE about it ?  Sure we have filled whole
bookcases with books and reports on it.  Action or Justice ?  None.</P>

<P>Punishment may not be the ideal solution to a problem person but at
least it does two good things.  First it prevents that person from
harming other people again and secondly it sends a message to other
citizens telling them to behave or otherwise they will end up in
prison.  At least that is what it is supposed to do.  I am no longer
sure if today that message is still being sent.  People today do not go
to college because they either do not have the time or because they
cannot afford it.  Great was my surprise when I learned that convicts
could leave prison with a degree !  Why is it that we allow those things
to happen ?  Why is it that the "wrong-doers" are better taken care off
than the "right-doers ?"</P>  

<P>Russian revolutionaries always said that terror had to be done. 
Talking about it was not going to change anything.  Maybe it is time
that governments around the world take that free advise, turn it around,
use it to their advantage and for once do something about this growing
problem terrorism is.</P>
<A NAME="dict"></A>
<P><B>4. Words, words, words.</B>

<P>Another big point of discussion are definitions.  If one looks up the
word <A HREF="#Point3">"terrorize"</A> it says <BR>"1. To fill or
overpower with terror; terrify. <BR>2. To coerce by intimidation or
fear." <BR> If that is the case, then drug dealers, gang members and
mobsters should also be considered terrorists and should be dealt with
accordingly.  It is incomprehensible why so much is written about the
"people" who blow up planes and kill innocent civilians indiscriminately
for political or religious reasons.  Gang members and drug dealers
destroy the future of society: they slowly but surely poison and kill
the children and terrorize the ones who "say no" or stand up against
them.  The teachers, parents, law enforcement officials, reporters and
anyone who is against their "business" can expect harm.  This is
terrorism in its purest form and should at least get as much attention
as the above mentioned form of terrorism.  That is what also should get
national attention, that is what also should become a national priority,
that is what people also should be really concerned about. </P> 

<P>The final word goes to U.S. Senator John Glenn who stated: "I believe
we're into a different type of warfare internationally than we've ever
known before.  I don't think we've learned yet how to deal with this." 
The author is not sure if terrorism is warfare but he agrees 100 % with
the second part of the statement.</P>

<P>On several occasions, people have asked for results in the fight
against terrorism.  The usual answer is: "There are results, but for
security reasons we cannot talk about it."  Or another popular one is:
"It would reveal intelligence methods of operations and sources,
therefore we cannot elaborate but there really are results."  Or "The
case is still under investigation." or just plain "I am not allowed to
talk about it."</P> <BR> 


<A NAME="Point1"></A><BR>
<B>Bombing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia</B><BR>
<P>On June 25, 1996 the bombing of the Khobar Tower outside Dhahran in
Saudi Arabia resulted in the loss of nineteen servicemen and injured
about 300.  The device left a crater 30 feet deep and 80 feet  wide. 
All the victims were members of the Air Force.  On 13 November 1995,
another car bomb 
exploded at the U.S.-run military headquarters in the capital of Saudi
Arabia.  That attack killed five Americans and two Indians.  
The attack was claimed by two unknown groups.  The first one is the 
"Legion of the Martyr Abdullah al-Hufaizi" and the second unknown group
calling itself "Hezbollah-Gulf."  

<P>The death toll in Dhahran made it the worst terrorist attack involving
Americans in the Middle East since the bombing in Beirut, Lebanon.  That
bomb killed 241 Americans. </P>

<center><H2>Denial Of Service - Hacksers Hit NY Internet Service Provider</H2>

</center>
<P>Most of you have heard of this by now.  A  computer crimes unit from the FBI
has been called to investigate.</P>

<P>I was interviewed by tons of press when this hit...while  traveling. (Wife
and kids will see me in 97.)   <P>

<P>Computer saboteurs paralyzed a New York Internet access company over the
weekend with the first major use of an electronic attack method that
experts say could shut down virtually any Internet service in the world.</P>

<P>Beginning last Friday, the still unidentified hackers flooded Public
Access Networks Corp., which services about 6,000 individuals and 1,000
companies, with streams of messages that overwhelmed its computers,
forcing the service to shut down for hours at a time.</P>

<P>Security specialists said yesterday the attack underlined the
vulnerability of the global network, which many Americans increasingly
use for electronic mail, entertainment, research and shopping, and
predicted that it would be used again.</P>

<P>The original national computer network that became the Internet "was a
sandbox . . . designed for experimental purposes," said Peter Neumann,
an expert in computer security with research firm SRI International of
Menlo Park, Calif. "It never paid attention to problems like this." </P>

<P>As a result, Neumann said, "there's no security on the Internet. . . .
If we're going to digital commerce on the Internet, a lot of things are
going to have to change. The bottom line is that the Internet isn't
ready for prime time." </P>

<P>William Cheswick, a scientist at Lucent Technologies Inc.'s Bell Labs,
said when he and a coauthor were finishing an often-cited book on
Internet security, they purposefully deleted a description of the kind
of attack used on the Panix service in New York. "It has horrendous
results and we didn't have a way of fixing it," Cheswick said.</P>

<P>Here's how the attack worked: Beginning Friday evening, Panix's
computers began receiving special streams of packets or snippets of
information with fake, randomly generated return addresses. The messages
are very difficult to trace, making it hard to identify the culprits.</P>

<P>These types of packets essentially send a wake-up call to the receiving
computer, checking that it is ready to receive  information from the
network, and so are the basis for much of what happens on electronic
networks. If the packets are legitimate, the computer handles them in a
fraction of a second. If they have a confusing address, the computer
will hold them for 75 seconds before discarding them.</P>

<P>Normally, Panix's computers -- like many others on the Internet -- can
hold fewer than a dozen such packets. But on Friday, several of Panix's
computers began receiving as many as 50 of such packets per second. Like
Lucy and Ethel working in a candy factory on an "I Love Lucy" episode,
the Panix computers soon were overwhelmed by a flood of bogus messages.</P>

<P>To try to shield their system from the attack, Panix managers were
forced to block all incoming messages for hours at a stretch. </P>

<P>Although Alexis Rosen, president and founder of Panix, spent the weekend
working frantically to stem the problem, it ultimately stopped only when
the stream of counterfeit messages subsided.</P>

<P>"We don't know why they either started or stopped," Rosen said.</P>

<P> A nonprofit site dedicated to electronic rights, Voters
Telecommunications Watch, was subjected to a similar -- but briefer --
attack late Tuesday, he said.</P>

<P>Although Panix is a relatively small Internet access provider, no
company is immune to these kinds of attacks, Cheswick said. </P>

<P>"This is probably the most effective of these attacks that I know of,"
he said. "We're going to see more of it." </P>

<P>Most Internet systems "are vulnerable to this kind of attack," agreed
Fred Avolio, a vice president at Trusted Information Systems in
Glenwood, Md. "It's a difficult if not in some cases impossible to fight
against" attacks that use forged information. </P>

<P>Rosen said he hopes that Internet access providers will work together to
try to rebuff packets with fake return addresses. "This publicity isn't
going to help my business," Rosen said. But he hopes that discussing the
attacks on Panix will "wake up" major networking services providers to
the severity of the problems.</P>

<center><H2>FAA INVESTIGATES SECURITY LAPSES AT NEWARK INTERNATIONAL</H2>

</center>
By Jim Fay  ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent<BR>
<BR>
<P>NEWARK, NEW JERSEY (ENN) - Following a scathing report by
The Record of Hackensack (NJ) newspaper in which a reporter
easily accessed supposedly secured areas at Newark International
Airport, the FAA has begun an investigation of that airport's security.</P>

<P>The Wednesday, September 11th, issue of The Record reported that
correspondent Michael Moore easily entered baggage areas, observed
contract security guards sleeping on post, and, at one point,
accessed the ramp, or tarmac, area of the airport leaning his foot
on one wheel of a parked plane.  At no time was he stopped or challenged.
It was also found that checked luggage for international flights
were not being hand-searched or even X-rayed by airline personnel,
and that the machines for those tasks sat unused in the baggage rooms
that the reporter easily accessed.</P>

<P>Due to the importance of Newark in the NYC hub, and the fact that
it is the 13th busiest airport, the Federal Aviation Administration
reported that they found the lapses in security at Newark "disturbing,"
and that a Federal investigation is mandated immediately.</P>

<P>Throughout the newspaper article, there are reports that airline
personnel as well as private security guards-ostensibly hired to
prevent just such activity-took no action or questioned the reporter
to find why he had no mandatory identification displayed. The
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who manages the three
New York metropolitan airports, including Newark, had no comment
on the findings, basically stating that they do not comment on
security matters in general.  The article, however, does not
specifically fault the Port Authority Police for any of the security
breeches.</P>

<P>In a follow-up report on Thursday, The Record reported that travel
agents have been fielding many phone inquiries from fearful passengers
who are ticketed to depart from Newark as a result of the Wednesday
article.</P>

<P>It has been well reported that many in the security field have
faulted the hiring practices of the airlines, as well as the
lack of ability of those hired, as it relates to airport security.
Many have called for the government take over this operation from
the airlines, in order to prevent ongoing breeches and to maintain
a stable work force in this security field.</P>

<H2><Center>Tales From the UK: Part I</h2>
Class III Information Warfare: Has It Begun?<br>
June 1, 1996, Florida, USA by Winn Schwartau</Center><BR>

The June 2, 1996 Sunday Times from London front page headline reads:<P>
<I>"City Surrenders to L400 million Gangs"</I><P>

And HERF Guns, Electromagnetic Pulses and sophisticated logic bombs may be responsible.<P>

At InfoWarCon II, Montreal Canada, I made reference to investigations I was conducting regarding concerted and organized attacks on up to 43 financial institutions in Europe and the US; an example of Class III Information Warfare. This issue of London Sunday Times brings a glimpse of the story that will eventually be told.<P>

The first attack in my files dates to January 6, 1993. A trading house in London was blackmailed into paying L10million to unknown extortionists who demonstrated they could crash the company's computers at will. The next incident in the Times article is also in my files: January 14, 1993 where similar demonstrations and demands were made for this time L12.5Million. And so is the next, January 29, 1993 and another L10Million siphoned off by the bad guys. According to my figures and those in the Times article, hundreds of millions of pounds have been paid ransom in what is clearly an example of Class III Information Warfare.<P>

According to officials in Washington, Whitehall, London, City of London Police, the National Security Agency, Kroll Associates, Bank of  England and others (in the article) the threats are credible. The attackers have the clear ability to bring trading and financial operations to a halt - exactly when they say they will. "Banks, brokerage firms and investment houses in America have also secretly paid ransom to prevent costly computer meltdowns and a collapse in the confidence  among their customers," sources said in the article.<P>

The article discussed the advanced information warfare techniques used by the perpetrators. "According to the American National Security Agency (NSA), they have penetrated computer systems using 'logic bombs' (coded devices that can be remotely detonated), electromagnetic pulses and 'high emission radio frequency guns' which blow a devastating electronic 'wind' through the computer systems." [For a complete description of HERF Guns (coined by Schwartau in 1990), see "Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway," Thunders Mouth Press, 1994] <P>

The perpetrators have also left encrypted messages, apparently bypassing the highest security levels of the systems, leaving messages such as "Now do you believe we can destroy your computers?" The NSA and other officials believe that four gangs are involved; probably one from the US and probably one from Russia. But, because the crimes are international, national borders still prevail, making investigation more difficult. Investigations and official inquiries have been in progress for some time according to the article.<P>

Now, for a few things you will not see in the articlem, but will hopefully [if I am lucky] come out in the near future. The number of attacks is way above 40. They have been known about for almost three years, but only recently have people been willing to come out of the closet and discuss this highly sensitive issue with the media. Long briefs and analyses of these events have been submitted to high level officials and select business persons for at least a year, but to no avail. [Security by obscurity reigns all too often.] Banking is not the only industry that has been attacked and the attacks have been spread around Europe as well as Australia.<P>

As an industry many of us have said that the only way something will really be done is if we experience a Computer Chernobyl [Peter Neumann Phrase as I recall] or as I first said in Congressional Testimony, An Electronic Pearl Harbor. Are these events the harbinger of strong reaction by the community at large? As events unfold and more information is permitted to be disseminated over the next few days and weeks, we will see.<P>

We have essentially solved the issues of confidentiality and integrity. But, I have maintained that the real problem is going to be Denial of Service. These events are unfortunate, but clear examples of that reality. <P>

A Bank of England official also said of the incidents, "it is not the biggest issue in the banking market."  Hmmm. I have to think about that.<P>

Tales From the UK: Part II
</H2>
June 9, 1996, Venice, Italy, by Winn Schwartau</Center><BR>
I am ostensibly on vacation with my  wife and two children (ages 11 and 5); here we are in Venice, Italy but I can't ignore what seems to be going on in England. American media don't seem to be following it so here's what happening.<P>

The headline of the June 9, 1996 Sunday edition of the Sunday Times in London reads:<P>

"Secret Inquiry into Cyber-Terror." <P>

This is a follow up of last Sunday's story about alleged extortion attacks against British financial institutions using Trojan Horses and/or HERF Guns.<P>

According to today's article, the British government has been holding secret investigations into the 'attacks' for more than two years, involving the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ the Brits' NSA), the Defence Research Agency (DRA) and the Bank of England. <P>

On June 8, the DTI issued a public statement which included: "We are very interested in the allegations of extortion directed at City of London institutions which were brough to our attention in 1994. We responded then by involving many government organizations . . . so far we have not been presented with any hard evidence from victims. We would urge those threatened to come forward."<P>

DTI Director of Technical affairs David Hendon wrote a letter in May 1995 saying they took the extortion issue "extremely seriously."  The Times' reporters say they have seen some of the evidence that was submitted to DTI and GCHQ which includes a chart on 46 of the attacks.<P>

According to the article, DRA senior Director Professor David Parks, his agency is "especially interested in the 'weaponry' deployed by the cyber terrorists." <P>

The Times continued: "The agency [DRA] believes high intensity radio frequency (HIRF) guns may have been used to black out trading positions in City finance houses. The weapon disables a computer by firing electromagnetic radiation at it and is a 'black programme' at the defence ministry, one of the highest security classification levels."<P>

In December of 1995, the DRA and parks approached a company who specialises in information warfare and asked them to "arrange a demonstration of a portable HIRF weapon in Germany."<P>

The article further states that details on the HIRF systems and their use in the City of sLondon  have been compiled by a British computer magazine and are being passed onto government officials.<P>

* * * * * <P>

I have spoken to more than 50 media in the last week about this story; the comments range from "suspicious" of the British reports, "sounds sci-fi," "alarming," "scary" and the like. Even though I am on vacation (ha!) I called a few of expert friend for a sanity check and the comments are as follows:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The alleged software attacks mentioned in last week's article are more likely than HERF/HIRF attacks that today's article focuses on.<BR>
<LI>"Given the kind of systems they use and their connectivity, I can figure a hundred ways to do what the article says," one of my consultants said.<BR>
<LI>As for the HERF/HIRF: We have worked out a number of models for the attack scenarios mentioned, but we have a targeting problem. An free-space (air) based attack would create a wide dispersion pattern and would likely have affected other organizations, not just those under attack.<BR>
<LI>A ground plane attack might cause the alleged results, but requires more physical access to the facility.<P></UL>

A few thoughts about the potential motivations:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Were the alleged attacks meant as a malicious Denial of Service attack or as a profit motive?<BR>
<LI> Were trading volumes and the stock prices of the alleged victims affected during the times in question?<BR>
<LI>Was internal profit taking an alterior motive?<BR></UL>

I have to keep in mind, if we give these stories credence, that over 50% of computer crimes involve insiders. <P>

According to my British friends, the Sunday Times is preparing even more on this story and they will appear next Sunday - when I will be in London to get it right back to you within minutes. <P>

So, the kids are fine (thanks for asking), my wife just double dosed on her Prozac (thank you FDA), is almost relaxed, and we are now headed into the Alps for a leisurely eight hour drive and will spend the night at the Jungfrau.<P>

In the meantime, contact Betty@infowar.com for comments and contact.<P>

Back at you later.<P>

Tales From the UK: Part III
</H2>June 20, 1996, Florida, USA by Winn Schwartau
</Center><BR>


I've spent the last two weeks in Europe, five countries, an avarage of 2.6 countries per day. Two kids and a wife along for a 'family vacation' which I have concluded is a modern day oxymoron. I'm thankfully back on the road to DC and Atlanta, sans kids, in a few days for a well earned rest.  :-) (Love you honey, really do, but I do need a break . . . .)<P>

But what you care about is the attacks that the Sunday Times has been talking about for the last couple of weeks. I've received incredible volumes of email on this story asking for more details - mostly very supportive - so here goes<P>

I met with the Times in London's Trocadero (while the kids played Virtual Games upstairs in an incredible arcade). I also spoke with them at length while at the top of Le Tour Eiffel, at Euro-Disney (Space Mountain violently pivots you end over end in complete darkness: a definite PG-13 ride), on the Chunnel Train and at Legoland. <P>

First, the errors:<P>
<UL>
<LI>	1. As a co-sponsor of InfoWarCon, I can assure you that the Brussels event had *nothing* to do with the alleged attacks as the June 2 article implies.<P>

<LI>	2. There were absolutely *no* secret meetings at InfoWarCon about the alleged attacks,<P>

<LI>	3. Laithe Gambit is not a secret study group about the distresses of the financial community. It is a NATO SHAPE security group and most of it is quite open.<P>

Despite the protestations of the Net community, masses of media folks and my own criticisms of their writings, the Sunday Times is sticking by their stories with dedicated vehemence. In some ways they seem confused and chagrined that their reporting is suspect. They really do believe what they are saying. I argued that they gave no names of their sources and they responded that it wasn't  necessary since they used the word 'spokesman' in several places. We have to remain disagreed on that point. If it's a rumor, then say it's a rumor. If it's a well placed source who wants anonymity, say so. If it's a spokesman, name him in writing. <P>

As a result, the U.S. media has been calling Kroll Associates and the NSA and the British DTI and so on and getting rebuffed at every turn with firm denials of having ever had conversations of the nature claimed in the Times' articles. According to the media with whom I've spoken, this is a giant red flag. Curiously, though, according to the Times, when they call back the very sources used for the articles in the first place, they too are being met with cold shoulders and 180 degree attitude shifts. Curiouser and curiouser.<P>

The Times swears by the validity of the story, and is putting on additional pressure to those people who they claim are in-the-know and will come out with the real details which could be further corroberated. I will be receiving, hopefully this weekend, (not here yet) an updated article that is being published in the UK on this story. From what I've heard about it so far, it will include some comments from Russian Admiral Pirumov (ret) and others on the record.<P>

In the next couple days: Someone in Basel corroberates the tale.<P>

Tales From The UK: Part IV
</H2>June 23, 1996 Basel, Switzerland by Winn Schwartau
</Center><BR>



<P>
The International Banking Information Technology Forum seemed like an ideal location to get a reading on whether the Times' articles held any water or not. I sent the family to Germany for two days while I spoke and schmoozed and asked some of Europe's and America's top bankers about the articles. (See my last three reports [June 1 - 23, 1996] on the alleged attacks as reported in the (London) Sunday Times<P>

I browsed and wove in and out of this esteemed financial community and asked anyone and everyone in the banking field: "Do you know anything?" "Is any of it true?" "Do you know any victims?" "Was your bank attacked?" "Please, tell me!"<P>

Of course I didn't scream this out to all four hundred of the world's top bankers in the public forum of my keynote speech; rather I asked quietly and discreetly, hoping for a discreet and honest answer. I got lucky and received two.<P>

Both people who did agree to speak about the events in question do *not* want to be identified. They are both in the very senior ranks of European banking and only asked that I do not divulge their companies, their positions, backgrounds or names. They both feel that the *real* story should get out - at least as much as they know - and that the leaks are inherently good for the banking industry. [They do not agree with security by obscurity.] Further, they both told me, at separate times during the two day conference, stories that were nigh on identical  (and I never told either one that I spoke to the other).<P>

The bottom line is they both know about _four_ 'attacks' against financial institutions, although it was unclear as to whether they were all in the UK or not. I am left with the distinct impression at least three of them were. [Not the 40 or more that the Times suggested or that I have heard about since April of 1994.] However, unlike the Times article, there was no question as to the method of attack, and both sources were very clear in the use and the meaning of the word attack. Here is what they said as to how the technical extortion was accomplished. <P>

The perpetrator(s) would first place a call to the upper management of the intended victim announcing his/her intention. "We will take down your bank (or financial organization) unless you pay us a lot of money not to." <P>

The intended victims each sluffed off the threats. Shortly thereafter (within a day or two) their financial systems would seemingly collapse for no reason at the prescribed time and as promised by the caller. Banking services and/or trading would come to a halt, for about an hour or so, and then the affected systems would come back on line. Backups were ineffective; typical disaster recovery methods, I was told, just didn't work.<P>

Thereafter, a second call would be made to senior executives of the victim firms, and the extortion demands for payment made again. In these cases, electronic payments to Switzerland were made, and the monies were then secreted from their temporary Swiss home within seconds - destined for places unknown or unannounced. No repeat attacks to paying institutions has occurred according to my sources.<P>

I was told unequivocally that all of the four attacks used the same methodology: malicious software was somehow injected into the systems but neither was either forthcoming or knowledgeable about the specifics. They specifically denied that HERF techniques were used. But many questions remained, and I was unsuccessful at getting what I would call good answers to these and more queries:<P>

	- Which systems were affected exactly?<P>
	- How were the backup/redundancies disconnected?<P>
	- Exactly what do you mean by remote control?<P>
	- Did you ever find the offending software?<P>
	- Was it an insider job?<P>
	- Was it pure hacking?<P>
	- Was is mission critical application software gone awry?<P>
	- And so on . . . .<P>

My questions flowed but both people either didn't know the answers or wouldn't talk. With both of them, there was a clear discomfort as I pushed and prodded for more details. Despite having so many questions still unanswered, I do feel fortunate to have found at least two people who were willing to support at least aspects of the Times' story.<P>

One of the two banking people in Basel went even  further with detail. He/she says the actual dollar figure extorted in these four cases using the software techniques, was L63 Million (UK), which is just about US$100 Million. According to him/her, a lot of meetings have been taking place amongst the banks and financial institutions to deal with the situation but they have agreed and thus made a conscious effort to avoid government and law enforcement.<P>

So, no, none of this fully supports the Times' story, but it does support aspects of it, and aspects of the rumors and stories I've been hearing since April of 1994. No HERF Guns, although another of my contacts who will not let me use much of his/her information yet, swears that the software attack stories are merely obfuscating the higher technology methods.<P>

I certainly don't know all of the facts, but as more people come forward with bits and pieces we may be able to siphon through the maelstrom of noise and rumor and find out what's really been going on.<P>

Back at you as soon as I have something more.<P>

<P>The Future of CyberTerrorism:</P>

</P>Where the Physical and Virtual Worlds Converge</P>

<P>Remarks by Barry C. Collin</P>

<P>Institute for Security and Intelligence</P>


<P>Terrorism to CyberTerrorism</P>

<P>The definition of "terrorism" has been well studied, defined, and
documented. There is also a degree of understanding of the meanings of
CyberTerrorism, either from the popular media, other secondary sources,
or personal experience. This paper examines the future of CyberTerrorism
- a term the author coined a decade ago, as the indicia of technological
dependence and frailty were forming in our New World disorder. Indeed,
that future has come to fruition, today.</P>

<P>The face of terrorism is changing. While the motivations remain the
same, we are now facing new and unfamiliar weapons. The intelligence
systems, tactics, security procedures and equipment that were once
expected to protect people, systems, and nations, are powerless against
this new, and very devastating weapon. Moreover, the methods of
counter-terrorism that our world's specialists have honed over the years
are ineffectual against this enemy. Because, this enemy does not attack
us with truckloads of explosives, nor with briefcases of Sarin gas, nor
with dynamite strapped to the bodies of fanatics. This enemy attacks us
with one's and zero's, at a place we are most vulnerable: the point at
which the physical and virtual worlds converge. Let us first define
theses two domains.</P>

<P>The Physical World</P>

<P>The physical world is matter and energy - light, dark, hot and cold, all
physical matter - that place in which we live and function.</P>

<P>The Virtual World</P>

<P>The virtual world is symbolic - true, false, binary, metaphoric
representations of information - that place in which computer programs
function and data moves.</P>

<P>The physical and virtual worlds are inherently disparate worlds. It is
now the intersection, the convergence, of these two worlds that forms
the vehicle of CyberTerrorism, the new weapon that we face.</P>

<P>Reliance and Dependence</P>

<P>This convergence of the physical and virtual worlds, this lattice, is
growing larger and more complex as we venture further into technological
dependence. Each day, we move ahead with blinding speed into the
computerization of every task and process that we face. We are becoming
ever more inextricably reliant and dependent on the convergence of these
two worlds.</P>

<P>Points of Convergence</P>

<P>What are some of the more obvious points of convergence?</P>

  <UL> * A garage door opener.</UL>
   <UL>* A heart pacemaker.</UL>
   <UL>* The computer chip in a late model car.</UL>
   <UL>* A microwave oven.</UL>

<P>These are all things taken for granted. Yet, as we progress into a far
more technological world, what other points of convergence are taken for
granted?</P>

<UL>* Food processing plants</UL>
<UL>* Pharmaceutical processing plants</UL>
<UL>* Electric and natural gas utilities</UL>
<UL>* Train crossings and traffic control systems</UL>
<UL>* Next generation air traffic control systems</UL>
<UL>* Virtually all modern military equipment</UL>
<UL>* Military and public safety communications</UL>
<UL>* Civilian communications</UL>

<P>Convergence Drivers</P>

<P>What is driving the convergence of these two worlds? There are three
goals:</P>

<UL>1.Access: the goal of universal, ubiquitous interface;</UL>

<UL>2.Control: the goal of remote administration; and</UL>

<UL>3.Mining: the goal of knowledge acquisition.</UL>

<P>Convergence Vehicles</P>

<P>To achieve these goals, there are four vehicles:</P>

   <UL>* Transmission: longer lines across land and through space;</UL>
   <UL>* Connections: more links to more points;</UL>
   <UL>* Aggregation: more information centralized, and disconnected
information linked; and</UL>
   <UL>* Retrieval: more ways of retrieving information, and more
importantly, knowledge.</UL>

<P>Achieving CyberTerrorist Goals</P>

<P>So how does a CyberTerrorist achieve his mission? Like any terrorist, a
CyberTerrorist actively exploits the goals of the target population in
areas in which they take for granted.</P>

<P>There are three potential acts in CyberTerrorism at the point of
convergence:</P>

   <UL>* 1.Destruction;</UL>
   <UL>* 2.Alteration; and</UL>
   <UL>* 3.Acquisition and retransmission (these are a unit).</UL>

<P>As we will see, these three types of acts are most heinous at the point
where the physical and virtual worlds converge.</P>

<P>To achieve a true terrorist goal, as we know, we must have scale and
publicity. So how does the CyberTerrorist approach a new age - an age of
convergence of the physical and virtual worlds? An age where, thanks to
our goals, he can perform his CyberTerrorist acts from his living room,
undetected, from 8,000 kilometers away?</P>

<P>Cracker or CyberTerrorist?</P>

<P>A great deal of "cracks" are committed for the purposes of anarchy,
humor, or as often stated by the perpetrators, "to be annoying."
However, is this the mindset of a CyberTerrorist? Does the
CyberTerrorist make a garage door go up and down? Does he change an
Internet web site to say a country's government is evil? Does he hack
into a major corporation's voice mail system to make long distance
calls? No - that is not the domain of the CyberTerrorist - that is the
domain of the amateur cracker community that exists worldwide.</P>

<P>A CyberTerrorist's mindset is quite different. A CyberTerrorist would
not alter a voice mail, or even abuse credit cards.</P>

<P>Potential CyberTerrorist Acts</P>

<P>Let us examine some example CyberTerrorist acts. Based on the
definitions of terrorism, a determination can be made if they in fact
constitute terrorism:</P>

   <UL>* A CyberTerrorist will remotely access the processing control
systems of a cereal manufacturer, change the levels of iron supplement,
and sicken and kill the children of a nation enjoying their food. That
CyberTerrorist will then perform similar remote alterations at a
processor of infant formula. The key: the CyberTerrorist does not have
to be at the factory to execute these acts.</UL>

   <UL>* A CyberTerrorist will place a number of computerized bombs around a
     city, all simultaneously transmitting unique numeric patterns, each
     bomb receiving each other's pattern. If bomb one stops
transmitting, all the bombs detonate simultaneously.</UL>

<P>The keys:</P>

<UL>1) the CyberTerrorist does not have to be strapped to any of these
bombs;</UL>
<UL>2) no large truck is required;</UL>
<UL>3) the number of bombs and urban dispersion are extensive;</UL>
<UL>4) the encrypted patterns cannot be predicted and matched through
alternate transmission; and</UL>
<UL>5) the number of bombs prevents disarming them all simultaneously. The
bombs will detonate.</UL>

   <UL>* A CyberTerrorist will disrupt the banks, the international
financial transactions, the stock exchanges. The key: the people of a
country will lose all confidence in the economic system. Would a
CyberTerrorist attempt to gain entry to the Federal Reserve building or
equivalent?</UL>

<P>Unlikely, since arrest would be immediate. Furthermore, a large truck
pulling along side the building would be noticed. However, in the case
of the CyberTerrorist, the perpetrator is sitting on another continent
while a nation's economic systems grind to a halt. Destabilization will
be achieved.</P>

   <UL>* A CyberTerrorist will attack the next generation of air traffic
control systems, and collide two large civilian aircraft. This is a
realistic scenario, since the CyberTerrorist will also crack the
aircraft's in-cockpit sensors. Much of the same can be done to the rail
lines.</UL>

   <UL>* A CyberTerrorist will remotely alter the formulas of medication at
     pharmaceutical manufacturers. The potential loss of life is
     unfathomable.</UL>

  <UL> * The CyberTerrorist may then decide to remotely change the pressure
in the gas lines, causing a valve failure, and a block of a sleepy
suburb detonates and burns. Likewise, the electrical grid is becoming
steadily more vulnerable.</UL>

<P>In effect, the CyberTerrorist will make certain that the population of a
nation will not be able to eat, to drink, to move, or to live. In
addition, the people charged with the protection of their nation will
not have warning, and will not be able to shut down the terrorist, since
that CyberTerrorist is most likely on the other side of the world.</P>

<P>Sadly, these examples are not science fiction. All of these scenarios
can be executed today. As you may know, some of these incidents already
haveoccurred in various nations. More of such acts will take place
tomorrow. Are you prepared?</P>

<P>CyberTerrorists: Who, Where, and Why?</P>

<P>The purpose of this paper is to help you understand the threats that
exist, and hopefully, to help you prevent these types of atrocities. But
know this - there are people out there with very different goals, who are our real
threats, and who are, or will be, attacking us. Make no mistake, the
threats are real, today.</P>

<P>Who are the CyberTerrorists? There a great many poor movies and too many
works of fiction about the hacker and cracker communities. In the
popular media, there recently was the Kevin Mitnick incident, where one
cracker broke into another cracker's systems. This spawned endless press
and atleast two best selling books. While this incident received much
attention, the events amounted to meaningless children's games.</P>

<P>By and large, the cracker community, based primarily in the United
States, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and in the nations of the former
SovietUnion, is composed of individuals who see the cracking process
merely as a challenge, a brain teaser, a puzzle. They view themselves as
not only being innocent of any crime, but perhaps even doing something
righteous, something to counter the dark monoliths of the corporate and
government worlds. Theybelieve they are being persecuted. These
individuals believe that what they are doing is not doing any true
damage. At its least harmful, these crackers just look at information.
However, privacy issues and military secrecy can
render such infiltrations acts of terror.</P>

<P>Sometimes crackers make minor changes, just for fun, to be annoying, or
to make a statement. The potential for damage here is enormous.</P>

<P>Crackers as Facilitators</P>

<P>Individuals with a background in intelligence are aware that a frequent
element of case execution is enlisting the indigenous, sometimes called
"facilitators," to assist in a campaign. At the convergence of the
physical and virtual worlds, the indigenous are the crackers.</P>

There is the incorrect assumption in the cracking community that they,
the crackers, are so sophisticated or so knowledgeable as to know when
they are being approached for a truly illicit reason (e.g., to be
enlisted as a facilitator to commit an act of terrorism). However,
despite cracker arrogance, these individuals are easy targets for
enlistment.

<P>What about those crackers who actively wish to cross the line, or more
basically, need money? To a teenager, a $1,000 U.S. can purchase a good
many compact disks, a new modem, and a great deal of libation. Beyond
youths, there are professionals in this arena as well.</P>

<P>Historically, individuals engaged in the practice of terror tended not
to be people working upon a computer 20 hours per day. Terrorists have
not been in the business of tracking the latest holes found in UNIX or
an obscure government telnet opportunity. There are people, however, who
are in that business - for illicit as well as good cause. As stated,
just as indigenous people may be turned into soldiers, so can crackers
be turned into CyberTerrorists. Sometimes such a transition may be
motivated by money or prestige. Usually, this transition will occur
without the cracker's cognizance. The potential threat from such
transitions is mind boggling, considering the damage even one
mis-directed cracker can cause.</P>

<P>Further, as young, educated people are brought into the folds of
terrorist groups, this new generation will have the talent to execute
the acts of CyberTerrorism of which we have spoken.</P>

<P>We are going to see increasing levels of in-house expertise, and
concomitant exponential increases CyberTerrorism. Unlike other methods
of terrorism, CyberTerrorism is safe and profitable, and difficult to
counter without the right expertise and understanding of the
CyberTerrorist's mind. Combine our increasing vulnerability, with the
explosive increases in the level of violence, and increasing expertise
available inside terrorist organizations through new blood and outside
through facilitators, and we can see that at the point where the
physical and virtual worlds converge, the old models of managing
terrorism are obsolete.</P>

<P>Methods of Protection: No Easy Answers</P>

<P>We must consider the following elements when building a
counter-CyberTerrorist program:</P>

<UL>   * We must accept that while the theories of terrorism stand true,
  the way in which we approach counter-terrorism, in this case,
     counter-CyberTerrorism, must change.</UL>

 <UL>  * We must cooperate and share intelligence in ways we have never have
     before.</UL>

<UL>   * We must enlist the assistance of those individuals who understand
    the weapons we are facing and have experienced fighting these wars.</UL>

<UL>   * We must learn the new rules, the new technologies, and the new
 players.</UL>

<P>Unfortunately, one cannot learn how to fight this very unconventional
warfare from someone who hasn't been there, nor from someone whose
experience is in the old ways and old technologies. The old data
processing, auditing, and computer security models in use today are
obsolete. On this battlefield, against this weapon, the terrorist is
already far ahead. The building of a counter-CyberTerrorist team must be
real-time and dynamic, as the weapons will continually change, to morph,
in an attempt to beat you, your systems, and your people. There is no
re-machining, and unlike other terrorists, if the CyberTerrorist loses
today, he does not die - he learns what did not work, and will use that
information against you tomorrow.</P>

<P>Conclusion</P>

<P>If a computer security advisor states that you, your organization, and
your country are safe behind firewalls, behind a system put into place
by people who have never fought cyberbattles, behind audit trails,
passwords, and encryption, then a great and dangerous fallacy (or
fantasy) is being perpetrated upon you. The only solution is the quick
deployment of a counter-CyberTerrorist - someone who knows what you are
up against today, someone who lives in the world of the people who are,
and will be, attacking - someone who can train the people who must fight
the battles.</P>

<P>Ex Post Facto</P>

<P>An effective auditing system will only inform the target manager that
they have taken a hit; perhaps a fatal hit. By that point, it is too
late. Now is the time to take action. Unfortunately, due to this open
nature of this document, specific counter-CyberTerrorism measures cannot
be discussed.<P>

<P>Those discussions must be reserved for secured facilities.</P>

<P>Counter-terrorists of all backgrounds are duty-bound to save property,
and more importantly, save lives. However, we are not isolated. We are
all increasingly connected, dependent, and vulnerable. The very basic
things we take for granted (e.g., food, medicine, energy, air, freedom
of movement, communications, freedom from violence) are being threatened
by the new weapon of CyberTerrorism.</P>

<P>If we do not work together, we will be responsible for the outcome. If
we fail to be ready when and where the virtual and physical worlds
converge,  then all that will be left is terror - in one's and zero's.</P>

<H2><Center>Cyber-Civil Disobedience:</H2>
<H4>	Political Dissent in the 90's</H4>
	by Winn Schwartau</Center><BR>

While speaking to 800 raving New York hackers I made what I considered at the time to be an innocuous off-hand comment:<P>

"If my generation had had the technical toys you guys have, the '80's never would have happened."   Then I got to thinking about what I had said.<P>

Twenty five years ago, millions of Americans shouted their anti- government convictions and anti-war sentiments by marching in the streets and engaging in variously creative forms of civil disobedience.  Anti-nuclear activists and environmentalists have maintained the tradition over the years while repeat offender anti- abortionists seemingly wear the badge of both misdemeanors and murder arrests with pride.  But the visceral images of huge traffic-jamming Vietnam era protests broadcast live on the evening news will be the ones indelibly etched in our minds and history books. <P>

Twenty-five years later, due to ever unpopular government stances as it promotes the National Information Infrastructure, the Clinton Administration similarly invites demonstrable outcries, but with the modern twist of technology driven protest.  <P>

In April of 1993 the White House announced the Clipper Chip: perhaps the most loathed invention the US Government has ever sprung upon the American public.  Ostensibly designed to protect telephone conversations from interception with government quality encryption, the NSA designed Clipper is outfitted with a 'back- door' to allow law enforcement to listen in on the encoded signals when approved by the courts.  Outside of a small handful of vocal adherents, Clipper is viewed by its critics (darn close to 100% of the population) as anything from silly and stupid, to technically flawed, to evidence of the totalitarian tendencies of government.  <P>

Despite the continuing outpouring of hatred for the ill-conceived and unworkable Clipper Initiative, the White House continually reaffirmed its support for the 'voluntary' initiative. The IRS has reportedly considered that electronically filed tax returns should be Clipper'd, and that sounds like anything but voluntary.  <P>

The hotly debated Digital Telephony Bill which was passed in late 1994 further exacerbates an already disgruntled cyber-public.  Law enforcement wants to continue its court authorized surveillance activities despite, critics say, no proven need for expensive and possibly invasive anti-privacy technology and legislation.   <P>

Arrogant export control laws turn software programmers into seditious felons if their creations find resting places on overseas hard disks.  A book about cryptography containing source code is freely sold globally, yet an electronic diskette version of the same material is banned from export - even to friendly countries.  Where's the sense?  DES - the Data Encryption Standard - is public domain in the US, and about 50% of the world's DES cryptographic products are not American made. This travesty underscores the inanity of the current policies which cost American business several hundreds of millions of dollars (and jobs) in lost export sales. <P>

The Administration's man-handling of  Cyberspace is deeply questioned and often criticized from the board room to the university to millions of on-line Compuserve and Prodigy and Internet users.  "Don't they get it?"  There is no shortage of critics who feel that the government's attempts at regulating the anarchistic freedoms of the Electronic Superhighway through legislative mandates and policy directives is a poorly disguised shroud.  The fancified term 'National Information Infrastructure' does not settle the stomach of those who swear three ways from Sunday that all the Feds want is to take over Cyberspace on their terms - the people be damned.  Right or wrong, perceptions are the driving force in political dissent.<P>

We also saw a California couple prosecuted in Tennessee for violation of Tennessee pornography laws which bodes fear and loathing when on-line citizens do not truly know with whom they are chatting or where they reside.  Cyber-entrapment comes to mind.  When President Clinton's conceptually endorsed an electronic National ID Card, that too, aroused additional discontent. <P>
 <P>
Twenty five years ago it can't be said that any single event formed the critical mass of dissatisfaction with government policies, nor can it be said today that any single act will trigger similar unrest.  What can be said though, is that the form of protest will not likely resemble any protests of the past.<P>

Cyber-civil Disobedience is timely, poignant and potentially highly effective.<P>

Twenty five years ago, youthful and academic demographics flavored the anti-War movement: predictable looking people predictably demonstrating against government polices while always aware the TV cameras were rolling.  Today, Administration policies are held suspect by a wide cross section of America that crosses most social, economic and age barriers.  <P>
 <P>
Twenty five years ago a demonstration or protest required massive organization and the physical congregation of huge numbers of people, all within the limits of the necessary police permit. Signs and slogans and chants prefaced the occasional Mayor Daly- like headline grabbing over-reactions.  Today, the nether world of Cyberspace offers an unrestricted, unregulated and certainly unorganized refuse as a '90's alternative to conventional assembly. Cyberspace provides the ideal mechanism for Cyber-civil Disobedience, the protest means of choice for the Information Age.  Cyber-civil Disobedience  is waged by remote control, over vast distances, yet can be effectively aimed at selected targets located anywhere.<P>

And, best yet for the Cyber-civil disobedient, there isn't a policeman guarding each and every portal to the information superhighway waiting to haul him off to the slammer.<P>

But Phil Zimmerman,  would probably disagree.  Facing the potential of years in prison, he has been under investigation for violating US export control laws which govern encryption schemes.  Someone, in an apparent act of Cyber-civil disobedience, placed an electronic copy of Phil's PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software encryption program on the Internet, resulting now in near universal availability of  a very strong encoding method.  Governments, notably ours, aren't happy and want to put a stop to copy cat 'crimes'. <P>

One widely discussed act of mass Cyber-civil Disobedience would be the intentional violation of encryption export laws by tens or hundreds of thousands of people, rendering attempted export policy enforcement virtually impotent.  All that is necessary is to make a copy of a favorite encryption scheme and place it on the 'Net, electronically mail it to their buddies overseas or even just post it on a domestic BBS.  All of these act are, depending upon your interpretation, against the law.  Precedent setting Cyber-civil Disobedience on this scale gives the government the unenviable and unpopular choice of either selective enforcement or policy revision.  <P>

Cyber-civil Disobedience is easily disguised.  If, for example,  the electronic mail boxes of selected, and presumably offensive government services are overloaded with lengthy unnecessary garbage laden messages,  they literally collapse under the weight of popular opinion.  Endless 'pinging' of Internet sites shuts down not only the target but also the benign service provider.  <P>
Such wide spread shrapnelling of targeted systems by millions of Cyber-civil disobedients could effectively shut down non-critical electronic government services whose demise would serve as highly visible media-magnets.  Cyber-events are news and news spreads the word: the protesters need the publicity for enlistment of more sympathizers. <P>

Rotary dial telephones that once used to ring in one's opinion are today replaced with millions of  home PC's connected to millions of modems.  Using a piece of software known as an auto- dialer,  it would only take a few thousand distant and invisible confederates to shut down a company's or agency's PBX, or even PRESIDENT@WHITEHOUSE.GOV and thus their ability to communicate.  With a larger 'demonstration' of Cyber-civil Disobedience, entire telephone exchanges would only be capable of responding to would be callers with, "All Circuits Are Busy."<P>

With an electronic US population of an estimated 20 million, a high percentage of which are Cyber-aware, the capability for Cyber-civil disobedience is within the realm of short term possibility, if not probability.  Network systems have limited bandwidth; an obvious weak point that a Cyber-civil disobedient can easily exploit to the detriment of the service provider and its customers. <P>

But Cyber-civil Disobedience does not necessarily have to be aimed at government. Politically incorrect organizations or companies who say or do the 'wrong' thing, can just as easily be victimized by the same methods.  The Internet Liberation Front launched what it called the first of many attacks against those companies who are commercializing the 'Net.   <P>

Whether it's Right to Lifers shutting down an abortion clinic's ability to communicate or extreme environmentalists striking at a paper mill's piece of Cyberspace instead of the woods, or an angry public venting electronic frustration at an oil-spilling oil company, the capability for Cyber-civil Disobedience is real, and within the power of millions of people. <P>

The 1990 movie, <I>Flashback</I>, concludes with captured '60's radical-activist-hippy Dennis Hopper forewarning FBI agent Keifer Sutherland: <I>"Kid. The 90's are going to make the 60's look like the 50's."</I>  <P>

Washington should keep in mind that for an Information Age population to voice its discontent, America doesn't have to take to the streets.<P>

[This article was first written in October of 1994 and it took 6 months to find a publisher willing to print it; Information Week, March 1995. The first Cyber-civil revolts began in November of that year in France. For more information, see <a href="/winn/ssiw2.html-ssi">Information Warfare: 2nd. Edition</a>]<P>

<p><B>ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) </B>-- Foreign terrorists are learning how to make and assemble bombs and carry out assassinations at 11 Iranian training camps, U.S. intelligence records show.</p>
<p>Up to 5,000 men and women are currently training at Iran's state-sponsored terrorism camps, according to classified documents described today in USA Today. Another 500 trainees are learning specialized skills such as suicide bomb-making.</p>
<p>Iran denies running terrorist training camps or exporting terrorism, said Mahmud Mohammadi, spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry. Asked about the report, President Clinton said today that terrorist training camps exist in "more than one country in the world" and that the United States will bring to justice any terrorists who attack the United States or U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies believe the trainees come from Libya, Algeria, Sudan, Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Gaza and Saudi Arabia, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>All 11 camps are designed to look like small villages, complete with houses, shops and mosques, but are closed to the public, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Two Saudi dissident groups, the Organization of Islamic Revolution and the Hezballah of Hejaz, are believed to train at Tehran's Imam Ali camp, the largest of the training camps, the newspaper said. U.S. intelligence officials say most of Iran's overseas terrorist activities are planned at the Imam Ali camp.</p>
<p>Other large training camps are in Qazvim, northeast of Tehran; Qom, south of Tehran; and Hamadan, southwest of Tehran, the newspaper said. The camps were set up by Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani two years ago and are led by members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and intelligence service, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The camps were discovered through satellite observation, radio and phone taps, and visual confirmation, the documents said.

<p>PARIS (AP) -- As a summer of bombings added urgency to their work, Western ministers adopted a 25-point cooperative plan Tuesday for tracking, stopping and convicting terrorists. </p>
<p>Foreign ministers from Russia and the Group of Seven industrialized nations, joined by their interior ministers and security directors, agreed to share information and resources to increase surveillance of bank accounts, front organizations and the Internet. </p>
<p>Measures adopted at the one-day summit -- attended by ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States -- include easing extradition and cracking down on forged travel documents and access to firearms and explosives. </p>
<p>"Terrorism is changing. In addition to the conventional forms of terrorism, we see an increasing number of small groups with a rather confused ideology,"French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said. "This new kind of terrorism requires new approaches," he said. The June 25 truck bombing that killed 19 U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia prompted the conference. The meeting convened two weeks after 230 people died in the crash of TWA Flight 800 and just four days after a pipe bomb at the Atlanta Olympics killed one. </p>
<p>"The events of these last days make this meeting clearly important to the whole world," said Attorney General Janet Reno, representing the United States at the conference. Summit participants said they noted the year's bombings "with deep concern." The ministers called on all countries to "investigate the abuse of organizations, groups or associations, including those with charitable, social, or cultural goals, by terrorists using them as a cover for their own activities." They placed as much importance in cutting off terrorists' funds as stemming their arms supply, pledging heightened vigilance over bank accounts and money transfers and a crackdown on drug and arms trafficking. Experts from the participating nations will discuss the points further in the coming months, and a meeting in November will review progress on carrying them out, de Charette said. </p>
<p>The foreign and security ministers side-stepped their differences over state-sponsored terrorism, never even raising U.S. calls for sanctions against Iran, Libya and other countries, said Peter Tarnoff, undersecretary of state for political affairs. </p>
<p>Still, "I have no doubt that the spirit and the measures that were taken here among us will be extended to other countries around the world ... that support and harbor terrorists," Tarnoff said.  The Japanese indicated Washington would not find unanimous support for the d'Amato-Kennedy bill, which would enforce an embargo against Iran and Libya as sponsors of state terrorism -- legislation France also opposes. </p>
<p>"Such a measure may constitute an extraterritorial application of domestic law, which is unacceptable under relevant international law," Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Takahisa Tsugawa said. </p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda also announced Japan will hold an Asia-Pacific terrorism conference sometime between this fall and the next G-7 summit in July 1997. </p>
<p>A numbing series of terrorist attacks around the world in the past 16 months -- starting with the massive poison gas attack on the Tokyo subway last year --increased pressure on Western governments to combat terrorism. "Open democratic societies will always remain vulnerable to terrorist attacks," British Home Secretary Michael Howard said at Tuesday's conference. "We know that we cannot offer our citizens total protection, but that reinforces the imperative to do everything we can."

</center>



<P> It could be the end of the car chase as we know it. With the
automotive equivalent of a stun gun, science fiction is coming to the aid of
law enforcement.  A high-powered electrical device under development at the
Pentagon's Army Research Laboratory in Adelphi, Maryland, is to be tested by
police and border patrol agents and could be in use by next year.

  <P>     The car stopper works by focusing an intense electromagnetic charge
on the electronic systems that manage most modern engines, disabling them
and paralysing the car. In the jargon of its inventors, the 150 kilovolt
charge is a nemp, or non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse.  Contractors are
bidding to produce a police version.

<P>       Very precisely directed beams are required, but even then there
will be problems. A pulse powerful enough to disable an engine at any
reasonable range would also be likely to disrupt communications, damage
television and radio sets, disable computers and even stop heart
pacemakers. There is also the danger of loss of control when a car is
being driven at high speed.

<P>       Counter-measures would include using old-fashioned engines with no
electronics, or perhaps surrounding the most delicate components with
shielding. The best might be to get hold of one of the stun guns and use
it to disable pursuing police vehicles.</P>

<center><H2>It is Time to Come Clean on Gulf War Syndrome</H2>
<H3>By Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director</H3>


</center>



<P>Amidst continuing reports of more than 15,000 soldiers potentially
exposed to the the so-called "Gulf War Syndrome," I believe it is my
duty as a U.S. Army veteran and informed citizen to speak out about the
handling of this situation.

<P>The most valuable asset that any military service has is its personnel.
Their health and safety must be encouraged and preserved at almost any
price.  To do otherwise will undoubtedly result in declining morale and
decreasing productivity.  The information management aspects of this
situation have also helped to create a "crisis of credibility" for the
Dept. of Defense and diminished the reputations of those associated with
it.

In light of continuing facts and disclosures regarding the exposure of
Desert Storm veterans to Iraqi nerve agents and other petroleum/chemical
agents, it becomes incumbent upon the Department of Defense and its
inherent agencies to provide free medical care and counseling for any
soldier who was present there and complains of associated
symptoms....period.  Duty disability cases should be determined on a
case-by-case basis, based on the severity of symptoms and a liberal
interpretation of such policy.

<P>Further "sandbagging" regarding this issue should be discontinued and a
Secretary of Defense announcement of the "new" aforementioned policy,
along with all of the pertinent facts that are available about possible
contamination/exposure of our troops should be issued to the largest
media audience, at the earliest opportunity.

<P>Only by "coming completely clean" on this issue, and accepting full
responsibility, can the Department of Defense hope to salvage it's
reputation and begin the transition to a reinstatement of its overall
credibility.  We would strongly urge anyone that may have any
input into the decision making process on this issue, to take
these or similar steps, immediately.  While we realize that there are
certainly costs involved in what we propose, they are minimal compared
to the overall effect of letting this issue continue on its present
track.

<P>To do less for those that have faithfully and voluntarily served our
country would be a travesty and would only contribute to an overall
weakening of our military services at a time when we may need them most.
The last thing the United States needs is another another situation
similar to the "Agent Orange" controversy of the Viet Nam era. Please,
President Clinton and Secretary Perry, support our troops and solve this
problem now.</P>

<H3>   By GEORGE TIBBITS<BR>
 AP Business Writer</H3>


</center>
<P>  SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft, which spent nine months adapting its Windows 95
program for use in China, is now scrambling to remove phrases that pop up in it
describing the country's leaders as "Communist bandits."
  <P> The phrases were in editing software licensed by Microsoft from Taiwanese
companies for its personal computer operating system. The Los Angeles Times
reported the phrases included descriptions of China's leaders as "Communist
bandits," and urged Taiwan's government to "take back the mainland."
   Bryan Nelson, Microsoft's managing director for China, said Saturday the
phrases were removed from unsold software. The company is also sending new
software to registered users and posting an update of Simplified Chinese Windows
95 on the Internet so customers can remove the phrases.
  <P> Microsoft began selling Windows 95 in China in March, but Nelson said he
learned of the problem only a week ago. He noted the Chinese government, which
worked with Microsoft to develop the software, made no formal protest and there
were only "isolated" incidents of police trying to stop sales.
 <P>  Nelson said the phrases, described by the company as "culturally
inappropriate," appeared in utility programs called "input method editors" used
to create characters in Traditional Chinese.
<P>   Although the Windows 95 version in question is written in Simplified Chinese,
the language used on the mainland, it contains input method editors to create
Traditional Chinese, the language used most in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
 <P>  In some input method editors, the program tries to anticipate and complete
the phrase the user is trying to create. That's how the rogue phrases popped up.
  <P> Microsoft's Nelson said there were just a handful of troublesome phrases
among the 70,000 phrases in the software. He added the company is trying to
determine how the phrases got into the software and is checking to see if
problems exist in other versions of Windows 95 sold in Asia.
 <P>  This is not the first time Microsoft has been embarrassed while introducing
software into other countries.
 <P>  In August, Microsoft apologized to South Korea for suggesting in its Encarta
96 Encyclopedia that part of ancient Korea was ruled by Japan.
 <P>  In July, it apologized to users in Spain and Mexico for a Spanish-language
thesaurus that offered "savage" and "man-eater" as synonyms for the word
"Indian."

By Matthew Devost,<BR>
SAIC Corp.<BR>
 <P>  BEIJING (AP) -- The Chinese government has made good on a promise to
cut off access to Internet sites it considers obscene or politically
dangerous. Industry observers say more than 100 World Wide Web sites
have been blocked since last week.</P>
<P>Some of the censored sites are obvious targets -- ones linked to
exiled dissident groups and the rival government in Taiwan -- but
others, such as those run by U.S. news media, are less expected.</P>
  <P> Americans using local Chinese Internet services have called the U.S.
Embassy in the past two weeks after they found that they could no longer
read U.S. newspapers online.</P>
 <P>  One Chinese web surfer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
government decided to block more sites after it discovered that Chinese
employees in international firms were using company computers to get
information on the Internet.</P>
  <P> No electronic warning appears when surfers try to connect to the
banned sites. Requests for access merely go unanswered.</P>
  <P> The new blocking is part of China's attempt to control information
entering the country and to keep out criticism of the government.</P>
  <P> Although Singapore and Germany have ordered pornographic and
politically objectionable material screened out of the Internet, China's
restrictions appear to be broader.</P>
   <P>Beijing paved the way for firm control of the Internet in February
when it warned that a sweeping and ambiguous law to protect state
security applied to Internet use.</P>
 <P>  It also ordered all Internet servers in China go through the Ministry
of Posts and Telecommunications.</P>
   <P>The spokesman's office for the State Council refused to respond to
requests for comment.</P>
   Sites that have been blocked include:<BR>
  <P> --U.S. news media such as the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street
Journal, the Washington Post, Voice of America, and Cable News Network.</P>
  <P> --Politically sensitive sites, including the Taiwan Government
Information Office. China views the island of Taiwan as a renegade
province that eventually must be reunified with the mainland, by force
if necessary.</P>
  <P> --Home pages of groups that monitor human rights abuses in China,
such as Amnesty International.</P>
  <P> --The U.S.-based China News Digest, a site that provides information
about China and a forum for debates.</P>
  <P> --Playboy.</P>
  <P> Although only about 100,000 Chinese are believed to have access to
the international computer network, that number is expected to multiply
10 times by 2000.</P>
   <P>With Internet use in China still relatively sparse -- and therefore
more easily monitored by authorities -- overseas political groups have
been cautious about trying to link up with Chinese residents.</P>
   <P>too easy for them (the authorities) to manage," said Robbie
Barnett of the Tibet Information Network, a London-based group that
monitors Chinese political and religious repression in the Himalayan
region. "For us, even faxes are incredibly conspicuous, much less
e-mail."</P>
<P>   China's government has long restricted the information Chinese
receive. All newspapers and television stations in China are run by the
state. Private satellite dishes are outlawed.</P>

<P>
1.0 Introduction and Background
<P>
It has rapidly become possible for a small group of knowledgeable
and skilled individuals to create chaos, wreak havoc, destabilize,
and potentially destroy what is currently referred to as 'Western
Civilization.'
<P>
Once it was possible to accomplish such goals through the removal,
by various means, of the ruler of the dominant country of the
'Empire.' Rendering unto Caesar what is due him becomes moot if
Caesar has been eliminated. However, the swift rise of democratized
countries as the dominant powers of the world has
<P>
added a certain amount of cultural resiliency, making such a manoeuvre
obsolete. In its stead has arisen a new, more virulent, form of
attack--such empires are now built upon economic strength, and
Gross National Product [GNP] is the most critical factor to be
taken into account, even regarding military strength; witness
the resolution of the Cold War in favor of the U.S. and NATO forces
over the Soviets and Warsaw pact forces strictly via extended
economic, as opposed to military or pure ideological conflict,
and such strength can be swiftly negated, as it relies upon technology.
Caesar could always be quickly replaced, an economy cannot be.
<P>
Negation of an economy, and hence a country dependent upon it,
is accomplished through the skilled manipulation and usage of
technology in conjunction with the exploitation of the flaws--inherent,
accidental, or deliberate--of a technology-based society.
<P>
An economic maxim of obvious truth is that control of the means
of production implies control of a society. While the maxim has
remained the same, the factors comprising it have evolved--the
means of production have changed from the factory worker to the
'knowledge' worker and electricity has transformed from a unit
of work to a unit of information, but then again, so has everything
else (money, etc.).
<P>
Termed the Information Age of Western Civilization, it has given
new possibilities and benefits to the citizens of the West, although
it has left them in a completely exposed position as far as long
term viability is concerned. It has created new avenues for dominance
and manipulation [which is why the Japanese are trying to dominate
through technology], and ultimately, the power to destroy is the
power to control; technology is a sword which cuts both ways,
an Achilles' Heel of the West.
<P>
'Western Civilization,' as it has evolved and currently stands,
is defined by its advanced technology. Such technology is a recent
development, historically speaking, and thus the window of opportunity
for such an economic attack has only just opened. The combination
of such 'newness' with the almost immediate dependence upon the
usage of technology has created the most significantly vulnerable
area of attack in the history of the culture.
<P>
The maxim 'those who do not study history are doomed to repeat
it' once again plays truly in this case. For example, essentially
every culture has built bridges; in fact, bridge building, masonry,
goes back into the depths of time. Yet every culture, when learning
to build bridges has made numerous mistakes, usually costing numerous
human lives. This is the price associated with learning; tracking
these developments eventually leads to the science of engineering.
<P>
The history of engineering, which builds bridges, ships, or airplanes
is that of one disaster after another, but always something that
can be learned from. What develops is an engineering 'rigor':
performing testing and extensive analysis, and not trusting that
something can be reliably done until you have actually done it.
<P>
Yet when it comes to technology, it seems that reason flew out
the window. Even though you can't test code the way you can test
metal or concrete's material strength, even though there are one-of-a-kind
systems that were never intended to be doing the job they are
forced to do, the West has passed over complete control of the
critical functions holding their society together to the unreliable
machines. Why? Because it was convenient, and some things (such
as the large volume of phone traffic or banking transactions)
just weren't possible otherwise.
<P>
The individuals 'in the know' on these problems are perfectly
well aware that they can't verify the function of their technology,
can't be certain that it does what they say it does reliably,
and have no way of being positive that it doesn't do more than
it says it does; they can't even guarantee 'bugless' code, let
alone 'hardened' systems. But if nobody says that the Emperor
has no clothes, maybe no one will notice. Perhaps a good example
is that of the 'rules of the road': everyone knows that driving
can be dangerous, yet sane drivers in sane situations will obey
the common courtesies of driving (staying in the proper lane,
stopping at lights and signs) even in the absence of an enforcing
officer. Why? Because the potential for danger to life and limb
is greater once you 'break' the rules. Here we have a similar
situation--if everybody behaves and treats the systems very nicely,
then they will continue to function as intended; stray outside
the decorum of good behavior, and you have a disaster on your
hands.
<P>
But that still leaves a vulnerable situation, an accident waiting
to happen, or an opportunity looking for someone to take advantage
of it if they know what they are doing.
<P>
A further note--it is only getting worse (or easier, depending
on your viewpoint). Every day, more is automated, more network
connections are established, more people, places, and things become
dependent upon technology. Because of this, a society that is
already standing on a Precipice becomes even more unsteady, stands
on less firm ground, waiting to slip. Or be pushed. Remember,
this isn't a case of 'going downhill'--it's a case of dropping
off a steep cliff.
<P>
The advancing policies of both industry and government are actually
increasing the risk the West is in; for example:
<P>
- The creation of various standards (whether de facto through
market clout or through imposition) does incredible damage; the
major limiting factor to disease in humans, crops, and livestock
has been the heterogeneous nature of the population; reduction
of the technology arena to a homogeneous environment (for instance,
with a major dominant hardware platform and operating system such
as is occurring) only paves the way for the wreckers;
<P>
- Almost every group in the West with some interest in computers,
communications, consumer products, or technology in general is
pushing for the creation of a 'super datahighway' or greater connectivity;
if the dreamers have their way, everybody will be connected by
a tangled web of twisted pair, coaxial cable, optical fiber, microwave,
radio, and even local infrared.
<P>
This bestows great access upon John Doe, but it also builds an
irrevocable dependence in the economy, the way people do business,
and the way the culture works; even though technology has become
wide scale in the financial community only within the last decade,
groups such as banks, credit suppliers, or stock brokers would
be helpless without it. Now extend that to John Doe, and see how
little cash money he carries, how dependent upon 'plastic' he
is, and how much chaos his life will be if everything crashes.
<P>
In addition to the economic functions that advocates wish to be
turned over to the new systems, there are numerous social ones--from
medical care to electoral voting; the potential damage that will
eventually be able to be done is beyond calculation.
<P>
No large scale organization (from 'Empire' to the human body)
can exist without a fundamental bedrock of communication and infrastructure,
yet we see that the expansion of the existing 'Empire' has foundations
built upon sand, and worse still, we're busily at work pulling
up the old granite foundation and replacing it with sandstone,
all in the interest of renovation. Madness, indeed.
<P>
2.0 Operational Overview
<P>
Critical potential targets of the problem are the infrastructure
of the economy. Much like a circulatory system in a human body,
which provides oxygen and nourishment to the various parts, the
infrastructure of an economy acts similarly. Destruction or damage
to it on a massive scale causes irrecoverable harm to the basic
structure and integrity of the economy. Operational techniques
to carry out the 'hostile' outlined program are briefly discussed
in the 'Informational' subsection of the 'NCBI' section later
in this document.
<P>
Let's assume an adversary and see what they could do:
<P>
2.1 Telephone Communications
<P>
Conventional communications, including voice conversations, fax,
data, etc. are providing absolutely critical support for the West--without
them, little could occur owing to the dependence upon the frantic
'societal pace' and sizable and diverse territory covered. This
dependence includes all transactions--domestic,
<P>
international, government-- yet even the most sophisticated of
communication set-ups is an AT&amp;T 3B2 UNIX minicomputer with
a telephone backplane hypernetworked together as an electronic
switching system. Such systems are trivially simply to disable,
commonly causing cascading malfunctions on their
<P>
own.
<P>
Other component parts of the communications grid are also easy
targets, such as the microwave transceivers, or satellites themselves,
which can be brought back down to the ground through reprogramming
of their on-board but ground-controlled attitude jets (simple
to do if one can grab the legitimate equipment and software used
to do such). The emergency 911 and 911E systems could also be
<P>
specifically targeted in advance to contribute to the impact of
the impending chaos.
<P>
Disabling the telephone system also, as collateral damage, disables
all ancillary services which depend on communications via the
system: police, fire, emergency medical care, alarms of all kind
but primarily of security systems, power control, water, sewage
regulation, etc.
<P>
Take as a case study the mishap which occurred in New York on
Martin Luther King Jr. Day only a few years ago. Cascading failures
of the switching systems caused communications havoc for the 'long
lines' of the Eastern Seaboard. It is still inconclusive whether
outside interference contributed to the failure, but the cost
was enormous, even on a Federal holiday.
<P>
2.2 Power
<P>
Power generation plants are manually controlled, thus making them
fairly resistant to tampering and manipulation from informational
warfare attacks. This is primarily due to their having been designed
and constructed during a period in which fail-safes were taken
more seriously, as well as the potential for civil unrest, coupled
with the fact that most are pre-'information age'. However, the
power distribution and regulation systems are electronically controlled,
making them potential targets.
<P>
If a hostile party wished to indulge in physical operations to
augment the informational warfare, American power generation targets
are 'easy pickings' from that stand-point. Security designs are
remedial, coupled with poor implementation. For example, one nuclear
power plant TNG principals analyzed had no 'forcing factors' requiring
a confrontation with security systems or forces to destroy the
plant; security is geared to fit regulation requirements and keep
protesters away, rather than prevent an actual attack. The security
precautions also seemed, absurdly enough, to take for granted
that an attack would be aimed at taking control of the plant,
rather than simply destroying it (which could be accomplished
from outside the security perimeter with three people and costing
less than $10,000 [U.S., 1993 dollars]).
<P>
2.3 Financial
<P>
Making direct attacks on the financial community that the West
depends upon is quite easy--the emphasis in this community, even
when security was considered worthwhile (security does not contribute
to the 'bottom line' of quarterly profit and loss statements,
and is thusly considered a waste of capital), it has been focused
on prevention of theft, not against malicious attack. Even then,
theft is covered by insurance, and the amount stolen comes nowhere
near the amount necessary to retrofit more security into the systems;
it is considered acceptable loss.
<P>
Obvious initial targets are the large funds transfer networks,
such as SWIFT; domestic banking, and the now common method of
access, the Automatic Teller Machine (ATM), is easy to cripple.
Also targeted could be the credit system, including credit cards
and credit bureaus (TRW, CBI). The average individual in
<P>
Western Civilization has grown dependent upon plastic and 'vapor'
money of the Electronic Age; commonly they have less than $100
(U.S., 1993 dollars) in negotiable tender on their person, trusting
in their ability to quickly and conveniently get what they need.
<P>
This is all, however, just icing upon the cake. It may be possible,
with a little help from the systems already in place, to destroy
the world's currency, capital, and equity markets in a matter
of minutes. As the speed of technology came into play in the financial
world, the brokerages and financial organizations quickly took
advantage of it; it is now a competitive requirement for massive
computing power to be constantly watching all the markets of the
world, performing analyses, making decisions, and executing orders
entirely without the approval or intervention of a human being.
Such systems, called 'program trading,' have trillions of dollars
at work directly, not counting the leverage gained from their
positions; insertion of the right type of orders into the right
machines could be devastating and trigger worldwide panic and
financial collapse (for instance, the Japanese brokerages selling
all their U.S. dollar positions, bonds, and stocks, coupled with
reactionary orders in the American trading systems). It is odd
that with all the speculation of disaster regarding the removal
of humans from the decision loop for military technology, no one
recognized the worse impending danger on the economic side.
<P>
2.4 Transportation/Logistics
<P>
Western Civilization has become so specialized that it is no longer
has self-sustaining population centers; once basic logistics are
disturbed, such centers of population are at great risk. Aviation
is simple to paralyze; air traffic control systems are essential
for any civilian flight. For sheer nuisance value, collateral
systems such as the SABRE scheduling system could also be targeted.
Shipping, trucking, and rail transport can all be crippled through
their scheduling and coordination systems.
<P>
[The topic of transportation brings a small digression: an analysis
of airport anti-terrorism security measures leads to interesting
conclusions. It would be educational for the reader to consider
the focus and results of terror attacks involving air travel pre-
and post- introduction of airport metal detectors. Security measures
seem to only have worsened the situation; how does such a discovery
extrapolate to the introduction of thermal neutron analysis devices?
TNG principals have analyzed the TNA device and conclude that
the next generation of such terrorism will involve unary or binary
chemical weapons, or non-nitrogen 'firestorm' type weapons, such
as thermite (ignited by magnesium triggered by sodium metal set
off by a water ressurization fuse). The more things change, the
more they remain the same.]
<P>
2.5 SSA
<P>
The Social Security Administration is 'the hand that feeds'; it
is also an easy target. This system, which provides payments for
welfare, social security, and veterans, has no protection, no
auditing, and no hope of restoration once removed.
<P>
2.6 IRS
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service quite recently made it possible to
tamper with them. Introduction of 'electronic filing' of income
tax has created the opportunity to flood their system with bad
information (taking names at random from the telephone rolls,
accessing the credit reporting system to gather essential information
such as their taxpayer identification number and financial status,
and then creating a 'bogus' tax return which would be filed).
<P>
The IRS system is one of the few 'hard' systems (meaning it has
some of the better electronic protection), but it is targetable
in two ways: an EMP generator, generating a damaging static charge
of 50K volts to any conducting object, can be used to eliminate
the system, or the system can be attacked in the same subtle fashion
as the most 'secure' electronic systems in Western Civilization
(see the section on 'isolated' systems in the Government section).
<P>
2.7 Communications
<P>
It could add considerably more terror and panic to incapacitate
the conventional means of mass communication, cable and commercial
or 'network' television. These system are completely dependent
upon electronic switching, microwave, and satellite pathways for
their deliveries, and security of such is poor, most attention
having been focused at prevention of theft-of-signal.
<P>
2.8 Government &amp; DoD/Intel
<P>
Oddly enough (for one would assume that this sector would be secure),
a crippling amount of damage can be done to the government sector.
The group responsible for protecting the West against just this
sort of an attack, the National Security Agency, has been sorely
remiss in their duty (just one small example: The brain trust
in charge of technology security for the U.S. let their classified
procurement records through most of the 80s be released in a database
(Maryland Procurement Office); worse yet, they didn't know it
until they were told by an outsider. Knowing what they were buying
provided a good degree of intelligence to the opposition; it also
opens a future hole by exposing the type of technology to target
to do them damage.).
<P>
Granted, making any technology secure is difficult; just as with
a locked room, there are plenty of ways to pick a lock, force
a door, steal a key, make the owner let you in, or just go through
a window. Add to this that most of the people who are supposed
to be protecting things are completely incapable of doing so--like
virgins talking about sex, they are beyond their competence. There
is, however, a sincere amount of deliberate negligence. Their
rationale has been that protecting U.S. technology would be dangerous,
as it would be exported or stolen, and then the U.S. would be
in a position of being unable to break into their own systems,
then in the hands of enemies. The implication, of course, is that
NSA takes its job of being able to penetrate target systems as
more important than protecting the West from a similar danger.
Sheer folly.
<P>
NSA systems, such as the old PLATFORM network and their in-house
system Dockmaster are difficult, but not unassailable targets.
The scientists at NSA are counting on their 'isolated' systems
to be impervious to this sort of tampering; it is unfortunate
(for them) that there is no such thing as an isolated system.
Even if the system is behind a giant 'blast door,' with supposedly
no contact to the outside world, with the software written in
DoD approved ADA, the system is still 'touchable.' The system
has an operating system, other applications, the ADA programming
tools and compilers, and a host of other mechanisms exist for
getting something 'in' to the system, and that's all it takes.
Even if the Defense Department were to institute prophylactic
measures to attempt to keep such things from happening, Precipice
style attacks can target through contractors and other suppliers,
making all systems available for informational warfare attacks.
<P>
Precipice poses as serious a threat to the military strength of
the NATO forces. It was the acknowledged technical superiority
which enabled a quick and painless (for the West) end to the Gulf
Conflict. Such an 'edge' can be removed quite simply, evening
up things considerably (actually, more than evening up--today's
typical NATO soldier is mostly helpless without his technology
to back him up). Even the tactical nuclear devices will become
unusable, as the 'PAL' codes that activate them are not kept on-site
in a 'hard' (printed, for example) format that is readily usable;
without such a code, which are individually unique per device,
things like atomic mortar rounds equate with throwing rocks.
<P>
NATO tools of policy, such as Japan, the U.S. mechanism of choice
for Asia, are also at risk. Japan is currently updating and relocating
its antiquated equivalent of the 'Pentagon.' Analysis of the proposed
new installation leaves Japan in a more vulnerable position that
it is currently (which is pitiful; CIA has volubly and accurately
complained that Japan 'leaks like a sieve' and has rightly refused
to share crucial intelligence for just that reason).
<P>
Groups in the intelligence community will be hit even harder.
As intel moved from HumInt to SigInt, it became more and more
susceptible to 'spoofing' (tampering with the signal) or outright
destruction of the means of gathering and analyzing the endless
amounts of data generated by such systems. For instance, the CIA
uses NeXT workstations, notoriously easy targets, for image analysis;
the billions of dollars of satellite surveillance gear circling
the globe becomes worthless if the systems aren't there to make
sense of it (not to mention the risk to systems such as the ARGUS
ring). Precipice style informational warfare attacks make an easy
target of all C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
Intelligence).
<P>
Law enforcement organizations are a mixed bag of security problems.
Police, the Secret Service, and the Justice Department could all
suffer greatly from major attacks; introduction of systems such
as the Federal Crime Information Center, with fingerprint tracking,
etc., if they pass the test of the ACLU, won't pass any security
test. These groups have already been subject to a considerable
amount of scrutiny by the 'underground' and are already thoroughly
penetrated; for example, the Drug Enforcement Administration has
been penetrated through their primary contractor, leaking names
of informants (now deceased) and details of their system. The
only group that has a mixed blessing is the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, which still relies on pre-microchip technology
and techniques for most of their work, lending them some immunity.
<P>
2.9 Business
<P>
Attacking the business community of the West is trivial compared
with other targets. A simple tactic of hitting with maximum stealth
and aiming for maximum damage with 'military grade' worm, virus,
and penetration attacks will overwhelm any resistance they can
offer. Some small protection against electronic attack has been
implemented in the business community, yet it has a set of fatal
flaws; such protection systems look for 'known' signatures of
attack mechanisms, but the new and novel pass right through. Primary
targets will be the mainframes, microcomputers, and networks that
businesses in the West rely upon for everything from simple word
processing, to decision support or factory automation.
<P>
2.10 Exploitable holes
<P>
Precipice style attacks can take advantage of the fallout from
Western power politics and backstabbing. Imagine NATO paranoia
prior, during, and subsequent to the Gulf Conflict has made Western
leaders nervous about providing advanced weapons systems that
may be turned against NATO forces by their current users, or,
as was the worry with Saddam Hussein approaching Saudi Arabia,
by someone acquiring them.
<P>
Because of this, the U.S. may have wanted the ability to deactivate
or destroy, via a coded signal, any weapons system that is of
American manufacture via 'software.' Such systems are also deliberately
vulnerable to electronic penetration attacks (as per NSA doctrine).
In an odd twist of irony, Japan may have also likely implemented
into their technology of military use the ability to destroy or
deactivate the system at the hardware level; this is part of a
veiled but very real and operational &quot;Japan That Can Say
'No'&quot; strategy that has shown up on occasion throughout our
analyses. Knowledge of this weakness (and many other valid reasons)
has caused the NSA to initiate its own chip manufacturing efforts
for critical systems; this effort was out-of-date and outclassed
from its inception.
<P>
3.0 Non-conventional warfare
<P>
We are witness to a new 'theatre' of operations opening up, where
the antagonists can be anywhere, at any time, with immense leverage
of their resources all out of proportion to the damage they can
cause. The training grounds, a 'virtual' place, are not something
that can be tracked by satellites, but more live within them;
the entry cost to get in the game is so small as to be negligible,
something that can be paid for as a by-product of 'riding the
grid.' The profile of those capable of informational attacks is
a combination of 'Carlos' and 'Robin Hood.' Today is the tomorrow
you worried about yesterday.
<P>
3.1 NCBI
<P>
The crowning glory of non-conventional warfare are attacks carried
out using nuclear devices, chemicals, biological weapons, and,
as proposed herein, informational attacks. All of these mechanisms
are known for their large, rather indiscriminate capabilities
of destruction; informational attacks are additionally 'tactical'
and can be quite surgical.
<P>
3.2 Informationals
<P>
As has been outlined previously, this is the primary method for
a small group to leverage themselves into a considerable force;
what one doesn't have the numbers to make short work of, one needs
to stretch out over time. Technology provides the necessary ability
to introduce systems over time and in such numbers as to create
quite a stir at the previously appointed time, yet this can be
done by a few or lone antagonist, and from anywhere they can hook
into the 'grid'.
<P>
All that is required is the use of sophisticated electronic penetration
techniques, computer worms and viruses, and the exploitation of
existing 'targets of opportunity.' Such knowledge does not, as
yet, grow on trees; there are perhaps a few handfuls of individuals
with the necessary skills and desire to carry out a large-scale
program such as Precipice.
<P>
The viruses and worms needed to execute the project are not terribly
complex; indeed, this is a benefit, as such 'weapons' have only
been discovered in the past through malfunction or when they had
activated, post damage, usually in isolated circumstances--yet
a full scale attack such as Precipice would target widely, and
leave no room for response. Each specific target could be covered
by redundant attacks, with one attack being a stealthy, bare-bones
style intrusion (ideally a custom built attack aimed at each specific
system, rather than a 'shotgun' approach), with the other being
new, previously unheard of technology such as:
<P>
- Morphing viruses, which constantly change their programming
code and configuration to avoid a stable pattern that can be looked
for;
<P>
- Binary attacks/data viruses, which reside, Trojan Horse fashion
in legitimate systems as only a few necessary bytes, only activating
upon linkage with the remainder of the system which was disguised
as unexecutable (and hence, a blind spot for 'hunter-killer' prophylactic
systems) data files, or a section 'hidden' in 'unusable' sections
of the system; such systems also pass through 'firewall' style
protection;
<P>
- Polymorphic worms, which are slightly cumbersome, but can reconfigure
themselves to cross machine type boundaries, thus avoiding a 'yeast
growth law' limitation to the spread;
<P>
- 'Factory' worms, that take advantage of networks hanging off
of networks, by breaking into the 'parent' system, taking advantage
of the newly available trusting resources and accesses, then propagating
and seeding throughout the 'child' network(s), mutating, and then
launching back through the gateway into the larger network;
<P>
- Cryptographic worms, which infiltrate into the storage mechanism
of the system, and encipher with a public-key system all the stored
data, and decipher the retrieved data for a period of time, until
one day the retrieval half of the pair 'commits suicide' and performs
a low level format on itself, thus making all data in the system
non-retrievable; note that this attack is deliberately reversible
by the reintroduction of the ecryption half of the worm;
<P>
- Envoys, or expert penetration systems, that use knowledge-based
system technology to learn from the penetration team and carry
out further penetrations on its own.
<P>
The main group intended to 'combat' such infiltration, the National
Security Agency, has been covering their inability to correct
the problem for many years now. NSA relies upon 'secure' system
metaphors such as the MULTICS model, yet these were invalidated
years ago by the advance of such penetration technology (which
can, in fact, use the protection mechanisms to their own advantage).
Quite simply, there is little hope to prevent such intrusions.
<P>
4.0 Rationale--Who and Why
<P>
How would one benefit by such actions as the Precipice style attacks?
Who would it profit? As with most things, there are varying colors
and shades. Taking the two extremes and examining them is highly
educational:
<P>
4.1 Full Scale Attack
<P>
Once the triggering event has occurred, John Doe and Jane Roe
are in sorry shape. For instance, immediately there is no phone,
police access, fire control access, medical care for emergencies,
alarms, power, sanitation, money, credit cards, financial markets,
economy, social programs, television, government or intelligence
community. There will be limited transportation (none on a large
scale, no logistics, personal transport is mostly temporary as
fuel runs out, leaving muscle power), and supplies (food, water,
fuel). Likely there will be military with conventional weaponry,
their stockpiles, and radio communications available to them.
<P>
What happens next is pure supposition, but some things are clear--there
will be immediate chaos. Control will be established after a certain
period of time; society has a certain inertia holding it together.
In the interim, the amount of damage that will be done will total
into the trillions; this does not take into account the long term
economic effects which will be uncorrectable.
<P>
The West will be suffering near-fatal internal strife, and will
be quite unable to cope with anyone else's problems at the time.
Even afterwards, if control is successfully reestablished, the
countries of the West will be, at best, Second World parties,
and unable to exert any real influence beyond their own borders
for a time.
<P>
In what context is it desirable to destroy Western Civilization,
primarily those countries that comprise what is known as NATO
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization)? When the executing parties
have something to gain--possibly their independence from NATO
dominance, influence, and manipulation.
<P>
Historically, a 'breaking away' of this sort has only been possible
when the dominating country was heavily involved elsewhere, financially
strapped, or incapacitated. Even the American Revolution (1776
A.D.) was only possible in the context of Great Britain being
quite occupied elsewhere. It is also humorous to note the symbolic
'first act' of that rebellion was economic, the dumping of commodities
at the 'Boston Tea Party.'
<P>
The rules of rebellion are different than they were for the American
conflict; the best model for running a modern effort towards self
determination was the World War I effort of T.E. Lawrence and
his compatriots. Such lessons come mostly in the form of &quot;don't&quot;s:
<P>
- Don't attack militarily (it only forces the game to be played
by the opponents rules, rather than your own [Iraq's miscalculation
in the Gulf Conflict]);
<P>
- Don't attack your opponent's strength directly but hit around
the target (destroying logistics, for instance; increasing terror,
or helplessness; not falling into a predictable pattern; obvious
targets are commonly the best guarded, pitting your forces against
your opponent's strength, a serious mistake);
<P>
- Don't lose or give up your mobility, your foe isn't going anywhere
(and if they do, it means you've won, incurring a whole new set
of problems);
<P>
- Don't let your opponent fight a single- or double-fronted war,
always force them to maintain a hyperextended (thus overextended)
front;
<P>
- Don't fight a pitched battle, even by mistake, always maintain
'hit and run' tactics that give your forces the advantage;
<P>
- Don't strike indiscriminately, or strike just to strike, be
surgical in the precision with which operations are carried out;
<P>
- Don't pick simple targets; seek leverage, go for 'more bang
for your buck' style targets that cause extreme damage for little
effort.
<P>
Western Civilization is wide open to attacks governed by these
rules--it certainly isn't going anywhere (no one is packing up
New York or Tokyo and moving them), mobility and time are on the
side of the attacker. In fact, the best method of making such
an attack by such 'rules' is by hitting the infrastructure and
economy of the NATO countries and their dependents.
<P>
A few parties have the greatest desire to see this done; for instance,
the Middle East has been the battle field since WWI, and post-WWII,
because of the importance of oil and the West's need to control
it. The Cold War raged through the region, with the U.S. using
Israel (and later Egypt) as a tool of policy and control, ignoring
even the most blatant human rights violations perpetrated by the
Israelis and other allies against the Palestinians and other targets.
But, similar to the way the Spanish Empire ran afoul of the harmless
people they drove into the seas, known as the Buccans (for the
fires over which they roasted
<P>
the pigs the Spanish had seeded the islands with) and later as
pirates, the Arabs refused to take the situation lightly and have
been fighting, rightly so, ever since. Another interested and
injured party would be in Ireland; long the target of British
oppression, up to and including the earliest programs of organized,
State-sanctioned genocide, certain among the Irish have desired
self determination for centuries. A 'bytes, not bombs' strategy
could be quite appealing to guerrilla and terrorist organizations
world-wide; this comes from an increased awareness of the 'feedback'
loop that terrorism makes possible. While it has been desirable
(from their point of view) for such groups to attempt to force
a government response to restrict civil and (in some cases) human
rights to foster a feeling of oppression in the general populous,
it usually only increases the militarization of anti-terror forces
while not appreciably inconveniencing 'the masses' and can cost
popular support. A shift in focus to terror activities that are
not overtly violent would take away much of the justification
of government forces for heavy militarization, would cause more
damage to the system than their current methods, are safer for
the terrorist, and the only option of response by government forces
would be 'regulation' of technology and the jeopardized industries
(which is a non-viable option).
<P>
The wish to have 'Uncle Sam' and his allies out of their lives
have driven many a people to wage an up-until-now fruitless war.
Something like Precipice would give them a new option that would
break them free. Luckily for the West, the emphasis on the part
of such parties has remained 'conventional' militarily, with some
focus for their intelligence (including the education of their
people in the West) on nuclear power.
<P>
The Western intelligence community has been in a difficult position
regarding the Middle East (Arabic and Islamic) terrorists. One
of the 'rules of the game' is that mutual deterrence works, or
at least it used to. The U.S. has long had the ability to track
the perpetrators of terrorists acts, knows the training base locations,
etc. What has held back reprisals? Other than the obvious &quot;don't
blow your source&quot; issue, there has also been a sort of &quot;gentleman's
agreement&quot;--the U.S. wouldn't hit them, and the U.S. itself
was immune from attacks on 'home territory.' The new players aren't
following the rules. What makes something like Precipice attractive
to players in the Middle East is two-fold:
<P>
- It strikes at the very heart of the 'Great Satan';
<P>
- They don't pay nearly as high a price as the West; other than
the very top of the society, there is little intrusion of the
benefits of the West, and even then, the pro-West aristocracy
is hit, not the ruling elite of Islam, for example. A return to
the simplicity of the 14th Century is attractive to the people.
<P>
4.2 Limited Conflict
<P>
Rather than all out 'nuclear war,' a small 'tactical' war is more
likely, and more insidious. The two initial segments motivated
to play this sort of game are dissident factions in the West and
economically motivated concerns.
<P>
There are numerous internal elements of dissension in the West
who would see this sort of an option as useful for its real or
'threat' value; the power to destroy something is the power to
control it, and there are 'oh so many' ways to cause trouble.
Informational warfare attacks could be racially motivated (the
neo-Nazi movement is quite motivated in the technical arena),
terrorist launched, started by eco-terrorists, part of a blackmail
attempt, or just a casual action by hostile parties.
<P>
Money is also a great motivator; a new degree of low-level conflict
could mean an economic war of sabotage by 'allies' against each
other (witness the programs initiated in Israel and Germany to
build a competence in Precipice style attacks), or American usage
against hostile 'economic' targets (not outside the realm of possibility;
view it as the next step after sanctions--&quot;If you won't stop
selling X to Y, then we'll make certain you can't make X.&quot;).
The Japanese are also gaining an understanding of the techniques
and strategies as a side effect of their broad-based competitive
intelligence programs. Additionally, industrial spying is breeding
a subculture geared for this sort of work; the electronic criminals
(hackers, crackers, and cyberpunks) discovered that 'stealing'
money led to their being caught (the old game of 'follow the money'--you
have to pick it somehow, somewhere, some day), while stealing
information was much more lucrative and virtually untraceable.
<P>
The 'Information Age' is more like the 'Wild West' than anything
else--there are no 'rules' to break, so it is a 'land' of opportunity.
Targets in the West are too susceptible, not just to destruction,
but to disruption, spoofing, and passive spying; all systems that
technology touches in the West can be considered compromised.
<P>
5.0 Conclusions
<P>
How to conclude? The problems are there and aren't abating; I
can draw a few broadly stated conclusions:
<P>
- The buzz about information warfare will begin to occur as more
and more people become technology savvy; just as with the initial
reports of computer viruses and worms, I expect people to slap
their forehead and say &quot;I can do that!&quot; By any account,
I'm certain they can, and will.
<P>
- The tactics of information warfare will only become more powerful
as time progresses.
<P>
- Whomever makes the advance into this theatre of operations first
has an enormous strategic and tactical advantage.
<P>
- An information warfare program is not detectable by the international
regulatory agencies, law enforcement, or intelligence community;
while not yet 'regulated,' such monitoring is a practical mpossibility.
<P>
- A Precipice style attack requires little enough effort to prepare
and wage that organizations interested can do so easily.
<P>
- The time is now.

<h2><Center>NET STRIKE ECHO</H2>
Jan. 1996</Center>

<I>This item was posted on the Net in response to the Net Strikes launched in Europe in late 1995. </I>
<P>

The first international Internet's strike has been developed in a good result! It is not possible to know how many Internet's users were on-line but as 
there were many WWW French government servers listed in our strike's msg  
we think several thousands of Internet users have participated to the  
strike!<P>

Strike effects were the above reported:<P>

<UL>
<LI>5.45 p.m. Quick access to from servers;<BR>
<LI>6.00 p.m. first difficulties to access to from servers;<BR
<LI>6.15 p.m. it is not possible to access to the Health and to the Educational Ministers' WWW servers;<BR>
<LI>6.30 p.m. Also the servers of the Nuclear Agency, of the French Government and of the Indusrial Ministry decline the access;<BR>
<LI>6.45 p.m. The access to the servers of the National Education and of  the Health Ministers is denied while the link with other from servers meets several difficulties;<BR>
<LI>7.00 p.m. Only the link with the servers of the Educational and Health servers is denied while the functioning of the other servers is on standard level.<BR>
</UL>

Apart from the "on-line" participation we have recorded the arrive of several msg of approval to the demonstration from all over the world. The comrades of the French ECN have translated our msg and spread all over France while several well known fellows such as Bruce Sterling has joined the strike.<P>

The Italian press has shown attention to this kind of strike by  publishing several articles (La Nazione, Unita', Repubblica while the left-wing newspaper Manifesto has not published any note on this demonstration!).<P>

The strike has been "transmitted" by several Italian "radio" such as Controradio and Radio Popolare and other kinds of local and national information networks has spread news about the strike.<P>

Our protest msg developed on 14.12.95 has been spread all over the world after few days showing:<P>

- the interest of many people to counteract the French current policy on nuclear and social items;<BR>
- the willing to be involved in a NET'STRIKE;<BR>
- the existence of a world-wide movement able to counteract world-wide injustice;<BR>
- the capacity to develop a such kind of movement in a short time.<P>

Finally we outline that:<P>

- several users have not set browser preferences in such a way to really link with the server each time (cache memory at 0) and not with its own  PC;<BR>
- it could be possible (for the next time) to build up software oriented  to the specific goal to make an "electronic demonstration" at the internal of a WWW server.<P>

As a result of this first net'strike's test we are sure that a strike organized at the internal of internet (with more days to organize the strike, specific software, specific instructions) can be a powerful media to counteract international injustice.<P>

We are happy to see how the inter-activity offered by Internet has offered the opportunity to many people to stand-up on the electronic frontier not for business or for show goals but for social global demonstration!<P>

<br><h4>NONLETHALITY, INFORMATION WARFARE,
AND AIRPOWER IN THE AGE OF CHAOS</h4>
<P>
<i>by Chris Morris, Janet Morris, Thomas Baines</i></Center>
<P>
<hr size=4> 
<font size=+2>A</font>irpower has become the first choice of policymakers and politicians
around the world who must suggest how the international community
should react to stop some infringement of the established order
or crimes against humanity.  Whether the threat be Serbian warplanes
pounding Bosnian religious sites or a resurgence of Saddam Hussein's
Iraqi adventurism, Somalian warlords firing on United Nations
(UN) peacekeepers, or Rwandan refugees streaming across uncontrollable
borders, the politically correct response when the United States
or the international community must resort to force is always
&quot;air strikes.&quot;  Why?  Because airpower seems to offer
the potential of force projection without politically unacceptable
risks, without risk of entering upon the &quot;slippery slope&quot;
of long-term involvement characterized by the commitment of ground
troops, without risk of US or coalition casualties in a casualty-averse
world, and without massive logistical expenses and subsequent
reconstruction costs.
<P>
 Since airpower as currently deployable and constituted was designed
for battle in a bipolar world, it cannot always successfully undertake
the new roles and missions seen for it by politicians, policymakers,
and diplomats.  Service chiefs and mission planners alike must
find new ways to fulfill decision makers' expectations and the
evolving requirements of a world no longer divided into two neat
power blocs.  Airpower has the potential to provide a credible
deterrent and effective first response in today's conflict-rich
environment.  For airpower to afford such early, cost-effective,
casualty-limiting, minimally destructive, logistically feasible
ways to project power, it must be able to attain sharply constrained
and multiplex objectives in multiple theaters simultaneously.
 
<P>
<I> Nonlethality</I> is the use of weapons of mass protection
such as nonlethal and antilethal weapons and information warfare
to project high-precision power in a timely fashion, delivering
results that are life conserving, environmentally friendly, and
fiscally responsible.  Such weapons can provide airpower with
capabilities that will yield new supports to diplomacy, a credible
deterrent below the level of massive conventional force projection,
and an expanded ability to meet evolving mission needs when used
in conjunction with conventional force.
<P>
 The ability to nonlethally overwhelm an enemy who is using lethal
force has become a clear requirement for peacekeeping, peace enforcement,
operations other than war, and military operations in built-up
areas where minimum destruction of life and property are prerequisites
for action.  Airpower's capability to execute these new roles
and missions where policy makers require decisive action to be
undertaken in a timely fashion but always from the moral high
ground and under media scrutiny is increasingly critical, has
increasingly come into question, and must be reaffirmed.  In order
to maintain airpower's position as a strategic capability of unparalleled
effectiveness, planners must now reevaluate the very nature of
the world in which power will be projected and must begin to develop
new doctrine and capabilities to fill those needs.
<P>
 Acquiring weapons of mass protection--nonlethal, antilethal,
and information warfare weapons--and integrating them into
current force capabilities may be one way that airpower can secure
for years to come its primacy in strategic utility for the post-cold-war
conflict environment.  In order to evaluate this thesis, we must
reexamine the nature of warfare as it has evolved and its relation
to policy in a world that has drastically changed over the last
half century and especially in the last decade.  We must also
examine the potential difficulties of fielding nonlethal, antilethal,
and information weapons in the new threat environment.
<P>
<h4>An Age of Chaos</h4>
<P>
 An unforeseeable consequence of the breakdown of the bipolar
world has been to remove war from the purview of the dueling superpowers
and to return it to the people.  Transnational and subnational
groups, rogue states and breakaway republics, civil warmongers
and tinhorn dictators, ethnic purists, and religious fundamentalists
all see the inchoate environment of the post-cold-war world as
an opportunity to seize or increase power.  The result is an environment
of spreading destabilization that can be characterized as an age
of chaos.
<P>
<b><i>A New Class of Threat</i></b>
<P>
 The current chaotic environment of multiplex threats to the international
rule of law is uniquely unresponsive to conventional diplomacy
or war-fighting methodologies tooled for the cold war over nearly
half a century.  Taken one by one, the many disparate conflicts
erupting among the former client states of the Soviet Union may
seem unmanageable.  Taken together as a new class of threat, these
flash points can be viewed as the inevitable attempts of states
built on the Soviet Union's &quot;military-bureaucratic country&quot;
model to expand militarily in order to survive. Unanswered questions
about the relevance of chaotic destabilization of the former communist
world to the national interests of the United States and other
major powers in the developed world impede decision making.  Ad
hoc decisions to act made by policymakers are often disastrously
unenforceable by the diplomatic or military components of nations
or groups of allies.
<P>
<b><i>Quantifying the Threat</i></b>
<P>
 The greatest threat to the international rule of law in modern
memory may be the spread of chaotic destabilization throughout
the developing world.  Unable to see these disparate threats as
part of a single class of threat with effects greater than the
sum of its parts, the United States and the international community
fail to act decisively.  As in the mathematical model of chaos
theory, the number of discrete destabilizing events, nondestructive
to the status quo when taken singly, may mount until their frequency
causes a catastrophic shift in the nature of things--in this
case, the balance of power in the world.
<P>
<b><i>Redefining Roles and Missions</i></b>
<P>
 Redefined roles and missions of not only militaries but diplomatic
corps and international entities such as the United Nations and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as the
role of the United States as world leader and the single remaining
superpower, are critical lest chaotic destabilization erode the
credibility of the international community to maintain order and
the rule of law.  If faith in the ability of the world community
to maintain order fails, the utility of all existing international
and national entities comes into question.  People will sustain
their governments only as long as those governments maintain order
and provide security and benefits to citizens at home and abroad.
<P>
<b><i>Recognizing the Problem</i></b>
<P>
 International consensus for action against destabilizing forces
is difficult to achieve, and this very difficulty emboldens would-be
aggressors who carefully calculate rationales for their violence,
some hiring international public relations firms to make their
cases for the world's media.  Once these forces draw the attention
of the world media, the attention of the international community,
its governments, and their militaries invariably follows.  Thus,
the focus of world leaders on areas of crisis is primarily determined
not by internal evaluation of the importance of any chaotic situation
to the national security of the United States or other nations
but by the amount of media attention given to a crisis.  Since
this media coverage is often sought, courted, or even bought by
aggressors, combatants, or defenders, the initiative in such situations
is on the side of those who can command world attention.  More
and more international response to crises seems effectively media-driven.
 The ability of the developed world's conflict management bodies
to set the agenda--to preempt crises with early and decisive
diplomatic and unconventional action or to mitigate such crises
with conventional methods--is demonstrably inadequate for
a number of reasons:

<ul>
    <li>A given crisis may bear no apparent or direct relation or
pose no imminent threat to one's own national security.

    <li>Internal and international consensus for timely action is
difficult to achieve because of varying evaluations of the seriousness
of the threat.

    <li>The roles, prerogatives, and utility of international instruments
such as NATO or the UN in such crises are increasingly unclear.

    <li>Internal pressures on nations to act in any such crisis vary
in accordance with treaty obligations, commercial interests, and
domestic constituencies developed for or against specific action.

    <li>The developed world's intolerance of casualties when weighed
against the casualty tolerance of the developing world, militates
against the insertion of ground forces should a consensus for
action be developed.

    <li>Roles and missions of military and peacekeeping forces are
inadequately defined both in unilateral and multilateral terms.

    <li>Training, doctrine, and capabilities for such new roles and
missions are consequently inadequate. 
</ul>

<P>
The result of these unsolved problems is that US and other policymakers
wait too long to announce actions and then announce actions that
may not be operationally or logistically feasible with the forces
and weapons at hand.
<P>
<i><b>Air Power and the Reality Gap</b></i>
<P>
 When the United States or its coalition partners wait too long
to act and an international situation such as Bosnia has degenerated
to a point where leaders must announce some action they think
will restore their international respect and credibility, air
power is the inevitable inheritor of the problem.  In the United
States, especially, elected officials continually call on airpower
to project a US or US-led coalition force decisively from above
in any situation where action is demanded but where the commitment
of ground troops could lead to casualties or longer-term involvement,
both of which are anathema to contemporary policymakers. 
<P>
 This situation has effectively eroded much of the credibility
of the United States as a world leader, which was gained at such
great cost during the cold war and the Persian Gulf War.  The
importance of that credibility is not simply a matter of US pride.
 US credibility is the primary security factor protecting US citizens
and businesses around the world.  Each time limited air strikes
are undertaken by NATO or coalition forces with indeterminate
results, the damage to US and international security establishments'
credibility is greater than it is to that of the declared enemy.
 Each time US leaders promise swift action by air in circumstances
that are operationally impractical, US resolve and international
prestige are eroded, leading to increasing danger for all US citizens
abroad.
<P>
 A particular problem for airpower inherent in the larger geopolitical
situation is that the utility of airpower itself comes into question
each time the US Air Force must mitigate policy makers' zeal for
impractical action.
<P>
<b><i>Recognizing the New Imperatives of the Age of Chaos</i></b>

 <p>The shared imperatives of the world community in the age of chaos
are several and conflicting:
<ul>
    <li>To enforce the international rule of law,

    <li>To maintain the credibility of international institutions,


    <li>To assure human rights,

    <li>To defend the viability of international trade'

    <li>To protect the ecology and environment, and

    <li>To ensure national sovereignties. 

 <li>The imperatives of the United States in the age of chaos are
divergent:

    <li>To ensure the national security of the United States,

    <li>To maintain US world leadership,

    <li>To sustain the rule of law,

    <li>To project power to enforce policy while limiting casualties
and damage,

    <li>To satisfy US ethnic constituencies and international treaty
signatories, and

    <li>To create a climate of safety for globalized US trading interests.
</ul>


<P>
 To the extent that these interests converge, coalition action
is possible.  To the extent that US interests, which are internally
consistent, diverge from the interests of our allies, which are
sometimes inconsistent, the United States must decide in each
case whether to lead or to defer.
<P>
 Such decisions are in no small part based on the <I>capability
to act</I>.  Acting in the current international milieu described
above means acting in a highly constrained environment very different
from that of the cold-war era, an environment that requires the
ability to do the following:

<ul>
   <li> Act in a timely fashion.

    <li>Act decisively while limiting casualties and damage to the
environment.

    <li>Act below the threshold of war and without risking long-term
involvement in a politically unsustainable ground war. 

    <li>Act effectively in an urban or complex environment where enemies
and noncombatants are mixed.

    <li>Act while claiming the moral high ground under constant media
scrutiny. 

    <li>Act in pursuit of clear mission goals with high precision.

    <li>Act effectively without risking US casualties.

    <li>Use the threat of US military action as a credible deterrent.
</ul>


<P>
<h4A Short History of War as an Instrument of Societal Change</h4>
<P>
 Historically, war has been redefined by societies struggling
with their leadership roles.  More than 2,400 years ago, Sun Tzu
counseled in <I>The Art of War</I> that armed force was to be
applied so that victory would be gained (a) in the shortest possible
time, (b) at the least possible cost in lives and effort, and
(c) with the infliction on the enemy of the fewest possible casualties.
 He also stated that &quot;to fight and conquer in all your battles
is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking
the enemy's resistance without fighting.&quot; and that &quot;the
skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting;
he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows
their kingdoms without lengthy operations in the field.&quot;<a href="#6">6</a>
<P>
 Sun Tzu was committed to the economic principles underlying the
conduct of war in his time.  People, even enemy people, had great
value as potential workers and taxable citizens; human and natural
resources were the primary prize in warfare; and goods and services
were coveted booty, as were physical property and societal infrastructure.

<P>
In A.D. 1513, Niccolo Machiavelli observed in <I>The Prince</I>
that
<P>
<blockquote><i>there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous
to conduct, or more uncertain of success than to take the lead
in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator
has for enemies all those who have done well under the old condition,
and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.</i><a href="#7">7</a></blockquote>
<P>
Later, in <I>The Discourses</I> he wrote that 
<P>
<blockquote><i>the object of those who make war, either from choice or ambition,
is to conquer and to maintain their conquests, and to do this
in such a manner as to enrich themselves and not to impoverish
the conquered country.  To do this, then, the conqueror should
take care not to spend too much, and in all things look mainly
to the public benefit; and therefore he should imitate the manner
and conduct of the Romans, which was first of all to 'make war
short and sharp.' . . . Whoever desires constant success must
change his conduct with the times</i>.<a href="#8">8</a></blockquote>
<P>
 Like Sun Tzu, Machiavelli and his beloved Roman forebears saw
war as a way to extend the boundaries of physical empire, to enrich
and strengthen his society with the people, natural resources,
and physical attributes of the lands to be conquered and absorbed.
 Even in a time of great change and turmoil, the basis for war
was still economic.  In A.D. 1690, John Locke wrote in <I>The
Second Treatise of Government</I> that
<P>
<blockquote><i>the state of war is a state of enmity and destruction, . . . it
being reasonable and just that I should have the right to destroy
that which threatens me with destruction; for, by the fundamental
law of nature, man being to be preserved as much as possible when
all cannot be preserved, the safety of the innocent is to be preserved
. . . .  Want of a common judge with authority puts all men in
a state of nature; force without right upon a man's person makes
a state of war both where there is and is not a common judge</i>.<a href="#9">9</a></blockquote>
<P>
 John Locke lived in a time of wars of attrition, when early war-fighting
technology had matured until total destruction of all assets and
persons of a society was not simply possible but probable.  War
by Locke's time was something that had to be limited by laws--either
God's law or man's law--and a process that put at risk both
innocents and desirable assets of warring societies.  Populations
are dense and people have less inherent value.  The economic basis
of war is beginning to be replaced by wars of ideology.  
<P>
 On 10 July 1827, Carl von Clausewitz said in <I>On War</I> that
war is nothing but a continuation of policy by other means.<a href="#10">10</a>
 Clausewitz marks the maturation of &quot;modern&quot; wars of
conquest in which war has become an instrument of statecraft among
nations whose goals may be imperialistic, nationalistic, economic,
ideological, or some combination of all four.  The laws of the
state have replaced the laws of God and man as adjudicator.  The
benefit of war is dependent on the wisdom of policy.  The goals
of war are not self-evident but are determined by the goals of
the state.
<P>
 If Clausewitz were alive today he might add that the main and
self-justifying mission of the military is to make policy enforceable.
 Failing that, the military or any branch of it may risk its own
continued survival since it exists at the sufferance of the state
and ultimately of the people who fund the state so long as the
state serves its people.  
<P>
<b><i>Defining War in the Age of Chaos</i></b>
<P>
 In modern American military thought, war is usually defined qualitatively.
 War is limited, such as in the Persian Gulf War, or war is unlimited,
as in World War II.  &quot;Unlimited war implies that the objective
is the complete destruction of the enemy's war-making ability
or unconditional surrender. . . .  Limited war implies objectives
short of the complete destruction of the enemy.&quot;<a href="#11">11 </a>
<P>
 At the end of the twentieth century, war can and should also
be defined chronologically as an evolutionary procession shaped
by the geopolitical climate in each of three eras.
<P>
 <b>The Era of Wars of Conquest, 2800 B.C.- A.D. 1945</b>.  From
the conquests of Sargon of Akkad in Mesopotamia to Adolf Hitler's
dreams of an Aryan hegemony, wars of conquest were predicated
on the conquering state gaining economic and strategic benefit
by acquiring the land, physical assets, and populace of others
in order to increase its size and wealth, assert its dominance,
and ensure its security.  Destruction of an enemy replaced absorption
of the enemy.  Genocide became more commonplace as societies became
more populated and the value of human life went down.  Occupation
of enemy territory became progressively less synonymous with conservation
of his cultural assets since one goal of wars of conquest was
to impose a cultural hegemony and another was to replace the dominance
of one race over an area with the dominance of another race. 
By the time of World War I, scorched-earth warfare became an accepted
tool of statecraft. Because of the relative slowness of societal
and technological change and the inherent conservation of assets
involved in wars of conquest, this era was a prolonged one.
<P>
 <b>The Era of Wars of Deterrence, 1946-1989</b>.  The cold-war epoch,
which ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall at the close of 1989,
demarcates a time of wars of deterrence in which countries built
weapons of great and of mass destruction whose use was primarily
as a deterrent to aggression.  Ensuring the survival of the state
was the military's greatest goal.  The most important task of
the military was to contain the spread of rival ideologies.  The
era of wars of deterrence was predicated on a doctrine of mutually
assured destruction and marked by nuclear proliferation.  This
is an era in which war itself was of no economic benefit, but
client states and wartime economies fueled international growth,
and it was a time in which the value of war was the strength it
gave to wartime economies.  This era was shaped by the industrial
age and the capabilities that produced it.  The original economic
fundamentals underlying wars of conquest were completely eradicated
and replaced with a doctrine of state survival that saw acquisition
of enemy assets as immaterial and that required its military to
be able to completely destroy not only the people but the physical
assets of its enemies.  This era was brief because of its lack
of a sustainable economic goal and the speed of technological
change.
<P>
 <b>The Era of Wars of Divestiture, 1990-</b>.  Wars of divestiture,
the first of which was the Persian Gulf War, are wars of sharply
limited scope whose economic rationale is the restoration of the
rule of law and the status quo of free trade.  The international
community rallies to restore order, and the goal of the war is
not the eradication of a regime or state but the divestiture of
an aggressor's war-making capability and his ability to threaten
the world order through wars of conquest.  The goal of the state
in this era is the maintenance of order and, through its military,
the protection of the status quo or the restoration of the status
quo ante.  The goal of the military thus becomes the preservation
of sovereign rights and the protection of innocents and preservation
of the environment from destruction caused by wars of conquest
or wars of deterrence.  This era is marked by rapid, interdependent
technological and geopolitical change in which geopolitical stability
is measured by the stability of the rule of law.  The length of
this era will be dependent on the military's ability to ensure
a stable rule of law through unilateral, coalition, and international
action.    
<P>
 Because wars of divestiture take place in an environment in which
there are many constraints, particularly due to the presence of
the media, and because this environment is one of chaotic destabilization,
both the political and military communities are struggling to
come to grips with the implications of precedents  being set on
an ad hoc basis, without the benefit of an articulated framework.
<P>
 Yet, analysis quickly yields numerous cases in point of more
or less successful wars of divestiture.  The Persian Gulf, Somalia,
Haiti, and Bosnia all are examples of wars of divestiture despite
the fact that all but the Persian Gulf War have occurred below
the threshold of war as it is currently perceived.
<P>
<b><i>A Lowering Threshold of War</i></b>
<P>
 A paradigm shift in international behavior has created a new
area of military action between the point where conventional diplomacy
fails and a declared war begins.  Concomitant with this shift
has come a lowering of the threshold of war itself.  Reasons for
military action are different than they were during the era of
conquest or the era of deterrence.  We may call these military
actions peacekeeping, operations other than war, military operations
in built-up areas, or any other politically popular term.  The
reality is that our military--and especially our airpower--is
increasingly called upon to act.  In this new area of military
action, US casualties are unacceptable, enemy casualties and collateral
damage must be minimized, and the goal of missions is political
(such as restoring order or democracy, limiting humanitarian abuse,
or reducing but not eradicating a threat) rather than military
action in the classical sense--destruction of an enemy or
conquest of his territory as a prelude to absorbing his assets.
<P>
 Since acts of war must be ratified by Congress, US policymakers
are hesitant to come to grips with this new reality.  When it
is admitted that the threshold of war is lowering, Congress may
act to preserve its prerogative to &quot;advise and consent&quot;
below the current threshold at which its consent is required.
 Until that time, ad hoc policies and unclear mission definitions
will prevail for political reasons, despite the difficulties this
poses for our military, particularly for airpower, which is consistently
called upon by political leaders to act--often impractically&--to
project military power in pursuit of political objectives that
may or may not bear directly on national security.
<P>
 And yet, all classical definitions of war imply that a military
that cannot enforce policy has failed in its purpose.  Therefore,
a unique set of problems is developing for airpower and for all
other military forces in this new conflict environment.  The impractical
must be made practical.  The military, and especially airpower,
must learn how to project power that is hyperaccurate yet minimally
destructive, limited while being overwhelming, and effective against
lethal force, yet nonlethal.  Out of these seeming contradictions
will come a new set of doctrinal tenets and operational requirements
that serve the overriding requirement of policymakers in today's
world.
<P>
 This requirement of policymakers--to have at their disposal
a new, highly effective, cost-efficient force equipped with weapons
tailored to today's limited conflicts--does not end with force
projection.  The ability of our military to project limited force
must be such that the very limitation of this force must be seen
as a credible deterrent because the qualitative nature of the
force available to the military allows the military to act earlier,
and decisively, against aggression while limiting casualties and
damage to the environment.
<P>
<h4>Airpower and the New Missions</h4>
<P>
 If war is now most critically an extension of policy, then the
military's main mission must be to make policy enforceable across
the operational continuum.  To fail repeatedly in this is to call
the value of a standing military into question.  Therefore, military
planners must look squarely at the geopolitical demands shaping
policymakers' needs and be ready to meet those needs.
<P>
 Of all branches of the military, the Air Force is the service
most challenged by these new mission areas and the new requirements
of policymakers.  To a policymaker, airpower seems to offer easy
answers to hard questions of how to project US power without risking
US lives or involvement in protracted ground wars.  To architects
of air wars, this propensity of US officials to call for air strikes
in any and all situations is more than problematical; it is dangerous
to US Air Force cohesion and perhaps to the future of the service
itself.  A military service that cannot serve the needs of policymakers
risks its raison d'&ecirc;tre.
<P>
 As has been shown since 1990, first with the success of the air
war in the Persian Gulf and later with unsuccessful attempts to
use airpower decisively in Bosnia and against the Serbs, these
new missions are paramount to US national security interests whenever
US credibility--US resolve and ability to act--come into
question.  This conclusion cannot be avoided indefinitely.  Although
war planners of all services would prefer not to engage in missions
of such demanding constraint as seem to be required by wars of
divestiture, there is a growing need to counter chaotic destabilization
by projecting power to enforce policy.
<P>
 Therefore, the Air Force must look seriously at the way policymakers
have clearly indicated that they wish to use airpower now and
in the future and must find ways to meet the requirements of new
roles and missions.  Currently, many would argue that combined
ground and air operations are limited to the operational and tactical
levels.  In the politically constrained environments of the future,
airpower and ground power must be strategically applied to achieve
our political objectives.  Consequently, development of weapons
of mass protection for the Air Force should be approached as part
of a joint effort that also considers capabilities for ground
forces and issues of interoperability.<a href="#12">12</a>
<P>
<h4>Nonlethal, Antilethal, and Information Weapons in the Age of Chaos </h4>
<P>
 The ancient weapons of chariot and cavalry warfare, the seige
engines of Greek and Roman technology, the naphtha fireballs of
the fifteenth century A.D., the horse-drawn cannon, the machine
gun, the mechanized tank, and the early fighters and bombers of
World War II-- these have given way first to weapons of mass
destruction and then to electronically guided weapons of high
precision.
<P>
 As early as the Persian Gulf War, weapons of mass <I>protection
</I> were coming into use as a means of destroying enemy command
and control.  The first 48 hours of the Gulf War showed beyond
a doubt that electronic warfare technologies could keep US servicemen
safe from enemy fire by denying the enemy the use of his command,
control, communications and intelligence (C3I) capability.
<P>
 Nonlethality, the theory that overwhelming nonlethal force could
be used to defeat lethal force, and nonlethal weapons first received
serious notice after their use in the Persian Gulf War.  Carbon
circlets were dropped on Iraqi power stations to deny electricity
to the enemy, obscurants were used to deny the enemy targeting
information about US troop movements, and electromagnetic weapons--reportedly
including nonnuclear electromagnetic pulse--were used successfully
to limit casualties, as President George Bush and Prime Minister
John Major of the United Kingdom had publicly directed.
<P>
 Nonlethal weapons (defined as weapons whose intent is to nonlethally
overwhelm an enemy's lethal force by destroying the aggressive
capability of his weapons and temporarily neutralizing his soldiers)
will give the United States new options in peacekeeping and conventional
force projection, as well as new supports to diplomacy and a credible
deterrent below the level of massive conventional force projection.<a href="#13">13</a>
 Nonlethality posits that the world community has become averse
to casualties and that the West, and the United States as leader
of the world community, must develop and be ready, willing, and
able to deploy decisive nonlethal weapons in situations where
casualty-tolerant rogue states and subnational or pannational
groups must be stopped by casualty-intolerant coalition forces.
 Nonlethality requires no massive investment in new technology,
but a reevaluation and redirection of mature research programs
into the weaponization and the fielding of usable systems that
conserve life and are environmentally friendly and fiscally responsible.
 Nonlethality further posits that the technologies that yield
nonlethal systems will comprise a real peace dividend.<a href="#14">14</a>
<P>
 Nonlethality categorizes nonlethal weapons as (1) antipersonnel
or antimateriel; (2) electromagnetic, kinetic, or chemical; and
(3) nonlethal and antilethal.  Among technologies identified as nonlethal are acoustic, laser,
high-power microwave; non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse; HP jamming;
obscurants;  foams; glues and slicks; supercaustics; magnetohydrodynamics;
information warfare; and soldier protection.  Among technologies
identified as antilethal are countersniper, countermortar, antimissile,
and high-precision weapons, including low collateral damage kinetic
munitions with reduced lethality. 
<P>
 Nonlethal technologies require the simultaneous development of
countermeasures and antifratricide because of the vulnerability
of humans and, the weapons of the high-technology battlefield
to nonlethal weapons. The value of nonlethality is presumed to be greatest to two critical
users:  the political decision maker, who must decide how and
when to act, and the field commander, who must carry out the orders
of the decision maker. 
<P>
 A key value and important policy issue central to nonlethality
is the ability of nonlethal weapons to allow a nation equipped
with them to act earlier against a threat.  This same capability
brings into question the level of international and, in the United
States, congressional control over a state's ability to venture
below the threshold of war.<a href="#15">15</a>
<P>
<h4>Nonlethal Weapons, Information Warfare, and the Problem of Provocation without Decisiveness</h4>
<P>
 Information warfare, a subset of nonlethality, traces its independent
existence directly to the success of electronic warfare during
the Gulf War.  In <I>Nonlethality:  A Global Strategy</I>, the
authors listed information warfare as a subset of nonlethality.
 Today, information warfare has its own bureaucratic institutionalization
and its own user base, funding, and constituency.  It has these
because electronic warfare proved overwhelmingly successful during
the Gulf War.  However, information warfare does not have a generally
accepted conceptual structure outlining its utilities and attributes,
as does nonlethality.  Therefore, the authors will treat information
warfare as sharing the same general attributes and strategic values
as other nonlethal and antilethal weapons.
<P>
 Information warfare technologies do differ from some other nonlethal
and antilethal technologies in that information warfare technologies
can seldom if ever be used alone.  Because of this, we have chosen
information warfare as our example in examining critical issues
of geopolitical usability.
<P>
 To be of consequence, any new defense technology must be useful,
usable, and used.<a href="#16">16</a>  It must have political utility.  It must
be legal.  It must be moral in a milieu in which all military
actions are subject to scrutiny by the media and the international
community.  It must be effective.  It must be a superior choice
to meet a policy objective.  It must be dependable.  It must produce
the desired result.  It must be short, sharp, successful, and
economical.  Most of all, it must be decisive or contribute to
a decisive victory or a desired outcome, even if that outcome
is deterrence or show of force.  
<P>
 Information warfare technologies are those that deny, deform,
destroy, or disable the enemy's communications and targeting capabilities.
 They may also be designed to act upon infrastructure points and
therefore upon noncombatants.  Some information warfare technologies
are mature but classified.  Others are conceptually obvious but
are still in the design stage.  Still others have been available
since the height of the cold war but have never been used for
fear that their use might be too provocative in an arena where
consequences and repercussions are still murky.
<P>
 International policymakers and weaponeers alike must consider
four issues--legality, decisiveness, effectiveness against
new forms of aggression, and proliferation--when considering
the use of information and other nonlethal and antilethal weapons,
especially in actions below the threshold of war.    
<P>
<b><i>Legality</i></b>
<P>
 What actions made possible by new capabilities will be legal
under international law?  Some existing treaties predate but prohibit
the use of information warfare technologies that belong to the
electromagnetic spectrum of weapons.  Chemical nonlethal weapons
(riot control agents) risk a similar fate because of the draft
Chemical Warfare Convention which may soon be ratified by the
US Senate. 
<P>
<b><i>Decisiveness</i></b>
<P>
 Which new operational capabilities offer decisive advantages,
either when used alone or in concert with conventional force,
and which are too provocative to provide real utility?  Information
warfare brings to the policymaker and diplomat the most serious
problems of decisiveness that exist among the nonlethal arsenal.
 It may be tempting to intercept and deform another nation's communications
and send those messages on their way with new information inserted,
but circumstances in which such tactics alone will provide a deterrent
or a decisive victory will be rare.  It may be attractive to use
information warfare to deny a rogue state access to internationally
banked funds, but such actions may be unacceptably provocative
in the eyes of the international community.  Communications or
banking embargoes are now possible, but the results of imposing
them may be unclear.<a href="#17">17</a>
<P>
<b><i>Defense against New Forms of Aggression</i></b>
<P>
 What new capabilities must we develop in order to have defenses
against their use by rogue states or international criminals?
 Although both issues noted directly above may limit or slow US
or Western development or use of new kinds of weaponry, neither
legality nor decisiveness will deter rogue states, terrorists,
and subnational and pannational groups of religious fundamentalists,
cultural separatists, or ideologues of any sort from building
and using information weapons as well as some types of nonlethal
and antilethal weapons that can be configured from off-the-shelf
components and that require no technological expertise or hardware
that is effectively restrictable.  Only the creation of a nonlethal,
antilethal, and information arsenal can convey to the West the
expertise needed to develop and deploy effective countermeasures
against nonlethal, antilethal, or information warfare attack,
especially attacks on our woefully vulnerable banking and communications
systems.
<P>
<b><i>Proliferation</i></b>
<P>
 What technologies will inevitably proliferate because of their
mature nature, and how should the international community acknowledge
and deal with the proliferation of new and evolving nonlethal
and antilethal capabilities that impact international security?
 Information weapons have already proliferated beyond hope of
containment.  The personal computer, the telephone, the modem,
the Internet--all are at the heart of modern man's daily life.
 Attempts to put mediating electronics in new defensive systems
cannot address this vast vulnerability.  Information warfare is
already the domain of computer hackers.  Its weapons are available
worldwide.  Its systems can be cobbled together from electronics
stores on the streets of any city in the world or can be ordered
by mail.  Banking and communications security can only be ensured
by new and stringent efforts to develop proprietary safeguards,
countermeasures, and antifratricide and share them not only with
our allies but with our interdependent commercial enterprises
worldwide.   Other nonlethal technologies with even more aggressive
capabilities, such as high-power microwave weapons, can be constructed
from easily obtainable commercial components.  As the information
highway makes technology more accessible, this trend can only
continue to grow.
<P>
<h4>In the Age of Chaos, What Constitutes an Act of War?</h4>
<P>
 These examples are but a few of many cases that illustrate that
nonlethal weapons, and especially information warfare technologies,
bring into question as never before the issue of what constitutes
an act of war.  Unless and until we wish to use nonlethal and
information warfare technologies alone against an enemy, this
question may seem immaterial since all nonlethal technologies,
including information warfare, used in conventional operations
have the potential to provide new and needed options to military
planners.  However, as deterrence and allied shows of force become
more commonplace, this question of what defines an act of war
takes on increasing immediacy.  If we accept that the threshold
of war is being lowered and that new technologies will provide
new options to war planners, we must accept the necessity of redefining
the act of war itself.   
<P>
 When we are using nonlethal, antilethal, and information weapons
in concert with conventional weapons for peacekeeping or in pursuit
of clear national objectives, such new technologies and new operational
strategies and tactics yield no such difficulties.  In such cases,
nonlethality can provide commanders with new ways to meet mission
objectives and allow diplomats and policymakers to act in an area
of warfare heretofore inaccessible--that area between the
moment that diplomacy fails and a shooting war begins.<a href="#18">18</a>
<P>
<h4>Nonlethality and a New Strategic Doctrine</h4>
<P>
 The way we insert nonlethal and information warfare technologies
into our force mix will be critical issues linked to the adoption
of a new strategic doctrine suited to the evolving geopolitical
climate.  That doctrine may well be the containment of barbarism
or the containment of conflict itself, a possibility only if the
world community acknowledges the true nature of the current geopolitical
climate and chooses to act aggressively not only for self-preservation
but for the protection of human rights.  The articulation of any
such new strategic doctrine that can be shared by the world community
will be based partly on the realization that nonlethal, antilethal,
and information weapons comprise a new category of weaponry--weapons
of mass protection.         
<P>
<b><i>Weapons of Mass Protection</i></b>
<P>
 Nonlethal, antilethal, and information weapons form a new arsenal
for a new era of warfare, an arsenal that can generally be termed
<I>weapons of mass protection</I>.  Weapons of mass protection
are weapons that can be used earlier to deter by denial<a href="#19">19 </a>in order
to support diplomacy, to limit aggression, to nonlethally disarm
or dissuade, and to destroy lethal capability with a minimum of
damage to noncombatants, combatants, and the environment.  Weapons
of mass protection may include nonlethal weapons, antilethal weapons,
and conventional weapons.  They may be electromagnetic, kinetic,
or nonlethal chemical.
<P>
 Weapons of mass protection have broad utility in that they meet
the following constraints imposed by the new geopolitical climate
on policymakers and military planners:

    <ul>
<li>Limit casualties and environmental and collateral damage.
<li>    Act earlier and decisively in defense of human life.
<li>    Minimize reconstruction costs.
<li>    Deter by denial.
<li>    Restore a credible threat of effective action.
<li>    Enforce the rule of law.
<li>    Maintain the moral high ground.
<li>    Protect lives of US and allied personnel. 
</ul>

<b><i>Useful, Useable, and Used</i></b>
<P>
 We have noted that weapons, to be viable, must be useful, useable,
and used.  To be relevant, armed services must be able to deliver
the required intensity and type of force to the target in such
a way as to deliver the desired result to the policymaker.  When
this result is a cessation of hostilities or a divestiture of
the ability to threaten aggression rather than complete surrender
or unequivocal victory, new methods must be made available to
the military planner so that the goals of the policymaker can
be met.
<P>
<b><i>Airpower and Nonlethality</i></b>
<P>
 Airpower is clearly the first choice of policymakers when contemplating
timely action abroad.  The US Air Force can utilize existing technology
and weapons platforms to develop new capabilities that will provide
policymakers with the tools necessary for timely action in the
new area between conventional diplomacy and warfare.  These tools
can and must be a mixture of precision kinetic, nonlethal chemical,
and electromagnetic weapons that are legal, ethical, humane, and
effective.  Since potential enemies will be using lethal force
when US or allied forces act to overwhelm that lethal force with
weapons of mass protection, it is important that the capabilities
of nonlethal, antilethal, and information warfare technologies
be known and understood not only by policymakers but by aggressors,
both for the potential deterrent effect and to demonstrate that
fear of casualties will not stop the US or allies from acting.
  
<P>
 Most of the flash points of chaotic destabilization are client
states of the former USSR.   Airpower can reach these venues in
a timely fashion and with a less-troubling level of troop commitment
as far as Congress is concerned.  Whether air planners will take
up the challenge and adapt their technologies and platforms to
these new missions may be the question that determines the future
of airpower in the coming century. 
<P>
<h4>SUMMARY</h4>
<P>
 The age of chaos has created new demands on policymakers and
war planners alike.  Wars of divestiture, which may occur far
below the previous threshold of war, provide a new challenge to
the United States.   Weapons of mass protection can be developed
that will allow the United States to assert its leadership while
holding a moral high ground internationally.  Airpower holds the
key to timely delivery of weapons of mass protection in ways that
will create new supports to diplomacy, a new deterrent below the
level of massive conventional force projection, and enhanced,
politically useable conventional force with which to meet the
challenges of the chaotically destabilized, media-scrutinized
environment.  The basic values inherent in airpower--deep
penetration, broad reach, precision delivery, early entry--must
be augmented with the ability to carry payloads whose results
enforce policy throughout the operational continuum in ways suitable
to the needs of decision makers in this age of chaos.  Wars of
divestiture have at their core the aim of restoring order with
minimum destruction.  Weapons of mass protection have a political
utility that encompasses the changed environment for warfare and
allows the United States to enforce its policies when necessary,
thereby exercising its role as world leader.  Airpower, demonstrably
the first choice for early action by US decision makers, can project
nonlethal, antilethal, and information warfare while conserving
lives, limiting destruction, and deterring by denial, thus helping
to chart the course of US military power in this new and evolving
action area.

<P><B>HOAX: "the Deeyenda virus"</B>

<P>   A new hoax apparently surfaced in November 1996, warning users not to
   read email if it contains the word "Deeyenda" in the subject line.
   This new hoax uses many tactics found in other hoaxes, myths, and
   urban lengends. For example:</P>
<UL>
   * like the Good Times urban legend, the Deeyenda hoax warns you to
       delete messages if they contain a key phrase in the subject line;<BR>
    * similar to the Java virus myth, the Deeyenda hoax claims
    Java-enabled web browsers stand at great risk of getting infected;<BR>
    * like the MSN/Prodigy urban legends, the Deeyenda hoax claims it
       will scan your hard disk for personal information;<BR>
     * like the Good Times urban legend, the Deeyenda hoax claims the FCC
       issued an alert to watch out for it;<BR>
    * like the Mutation Engine myth, the Deeyenda hoax claims it is
       "virtually undetectable."<BR>
   </UL>
<P><B>  WHY CALL IT A HOAX? WHY NOT "URBAN LEGEND"?</B>
  
<P>   Deeyenda warnings quote a message from a Steven K. Johnson at Carnegie
   Mellon University, complete with his phone number & email address.
   
<P>   The phone number doesn't exist; the email address doesn't exist. And
   Steven K. Johnson probably doesn't exist either. Providing a
   [ficticious] name, phone number, and email address at the bottom of
   the hoax merely gives it a feeling of legitimacy.
   
<P>    Two known versions of the hoax already
    
<P>   At least two versions of the Deeyenda hoax already exist. One version
   (possibly the original) includes a "forwarding header" similar to the
   Good Times urban legend, warning users not to read email if the word
   "Deeyenda" appears in the subject line. A second version (possibly the
   variant) makes no mention of the Good Times-like warning.
   
<P>==========================================================
   
<P>  CIAC INFORMATION BULLETIN
  
 <P>      H-05 INTERNET HOAXES: PKZ300, IRINA, GOOD TIMES, DEEYENDA, GHOST
                                       
<P>   November 20, 1996 16:00 GMT
       

<P>PROBLEM:       This bulletin addresses the following hoaxes and erroneous
               warnings: PKZ300 Warning, Irina, Good Times, Deeyenda, and
               Ghost.exe
<P>PLATFORM:      All, via e-mail
<P>DAMAGE:        Time lost reading and responding to the messages
<P>SOLUTION:      Pass unvalidated warnings only to your computer security
               department or incident response team. See below on how to
               recognize validated and unvalidated warnings and hoaxes.

  
<P>VULNERABILITY   New hoaxes and warnings have appeared on the Internet and
<P>ASSESSMENT:     old hoaxes are still being cirulated.

  <P>
<P><B>Introduction</B>


<P>The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer
viruses and Trojans. However, interspersed among real virus notices are
computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are
still time consuming and costly to handle. At CIAC, we find that we are
spending much more time de-bunking hoaxes than handling real virus
incidents.
<P>This advisory addresses the most recent warnings that have appeared on the
Internet and are being circulated throughout world today. We will also
address the history behind virus hoaxes, how to identify a hoax, and what to
do if you think a message is or is not a hoax. Users are requested to please
not spreadunconfirmed warnings about viruses and Trojans. If you receive an
unvalidated warning, don't pass it to all your friends, pass it to your
computer security manager to validate first. Validated warnings from the
incident response teams and antivirus vendors have valid return addresses
and are usually PGP signed with the organization's key.

<P><B>PKZ300 Warning</B>


<P>The PKZ300 Trojan is a real Trojan program, but the initial warning about it
was released over a year ago. For information pertaining to PKZ300 Trojan
reference CIAC Notes issue 95-10, that was released in June of 1995.

<P><a href="http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes10.shtml">http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes10.shtml</a>

<P>The warning itself, on the other hand, is gaining urban legend status. There
has been an extremely limited number of sightings of this Trojan and those
appeared over a year ago. Even though the Trojan warning is real, the
repeated circulation of the warning is a nuisance. Individuals who need the
current release of  PKZIP should visit the PKWARE web page at
http://www.pkware.com. CIAC recommends that you DO NOT recirculate the
warning about this particular Trojan.

<P><B>Irina Virus Hoax</B>


<P>The "Irina" virus warnings are a hoax. The former head of an electronic
publishing company circulated the warning to create publicity for a new
interactive book by the same name. The publishing company has apologized for
the publicity stunt that backfired and panicked Internet users worldwide.
The original warning claimed to be from a Professor Edward Pridedaux of the
College of Slavic Studies in London; there is no such person or college.
However, London's School of  Slavonic and East European Studies has been
inundated with calls. This poorly thought-out publicity stunt was highly
irresponsible. For more information pertaining to this hoax, reference the
UK Daily Telegraph at <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk">http://www.telegraph.co.uk</a>.

<P><B>Good Times Virus Hoax</B>


<P>The "Good Times" virus warnings are a hoax. There is no virus by that name
in existence today. These warnings have been circulating the Internet for
years. The user community must become aware that it is unlikely that a virus
can be constructed to behave in the manner ascribed in the "Good Times"
virus warning. For more information related to this urban legend, reference
CIAC Notes 95-09.

<P><a href="http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes09.shtml">http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/notes/Notes09.shtml</a>

<P><B>Deeyenda Virus Hoax</B>


<P>The "Deeyenda" virus warnings are a hoax. CIAC has received inqueries
regarding the validity of the Deeyenda virus. The warnings are very similar
to those for Good Times, stating that the FCC issued a warning about it,
and that it is self activating and can destroy the contents of a machine
just by being downloaded. Users should note that the FCC does not and will
not issue virus or Trojan warnings. It is not their job to do so. As of this
date, there are no known viruses with the name Deeyenda in existence. For a
virus to spread, it  must be executed. Reading a mail message does not
execute the mail message. Trojans and viruses have been found as executable
attachments to mail messages, but they must be extracted and executed to do
any harm. CIAC still affirms that reading E-mail, using typical mail agents,
can not activate malicious code delivered in or with the message.

<P><B>Ghost.exe Warning</B>


<P>The Ghost.exe program was originally distributed as a free screen saver
containing some advertising information for the author's company (Access
Softek). The program opens a window that shows a Halloween background with
ghosts flying around the screen. On any Friday the 13th, the program window
title changes and the ghosts fly off the window and around the screen.
Someone apparently got worried and sent a message indicating that this might
be a Trojan. The warning grew until the it said that Ghost.exe was a Trojan
that would destroy your hard drive and the developers got a lot of nasty
phone calls (their names and phone numbers were in the About box of the
program.) A simple phone call to the number listed in the program would have
stopped this warning from being sent out. The original ghost.exe program is
just cute; it does not do anything damaging. Note that this does not mean
that ghost could not be infected with a virus that does do damage, so the
normal antivirus procedure of scanning it before running it should be
followed.

<P><B>History of Virus Hoaxes</B>


<P>Since 1988, computer virus hoaxes have been circulating the Internet. In
October of that year, according to Ferbrache ("A pathology of Computer
Viruses" Springer, London, 1992) one of the first virus hoaxes was the
2400 baud modem virus:</P>
<UL>
        SUBJ: Really Nasty Virus<BR>
       AREA: GENERAL (1)<BR>
        <BR>
        I've just discovered probably the world's worst computer virus
        yet. I had just finished a late night session of BBS'ing and file
        treading when I exited Telix 3 and attempted to run pkxarc to
        unarc the software I had downloaded. Next thing I knew my hard
        disk was seeking all over and it was apparently writing random
        sectors. Thank god for strong coffee and a recent backup.
        Everything was back to normal, so I called the BBS again and
        downloaded a file. When I went to use ddir to list the directory,
        my hard disk was getting trashed again. I tried Procomm Plus TD
        and also PC Talk 3. Same results every time. Something was up so I
        hooked up to my test equipment and different modems (I do research
        and development for a local computer telecommunications company
        and have an in-house lab at my disposal). After another hour of
        corrupted hard drives I found what I think is the world's worst
        computer virus yet. The virus distributes itself on the modem sub-
        carrier present in all 2400 baud and up modems. The sub-carrier is
        used for ROM and register debugging purposes only, and otherwise
        serves no othr (sp) purpose. The virus sets a bit pattern in one
        of the internal modem registers, but it seemed to screw up the
        other registers on my USR. A modem that has been "infected" with
        this virus will then transmit the virus to other modems that use a
        subcarrier (I suppose those who use 300 and 1200 baud modems
        should be immune). The virus then attaches itself to all binary
        incoming data and infects the host computer's hard disk. The only
        way to get rid of this virus is to completely reset all the modem
        registers by hand, but I haven't found a way to vaccinate a modem
        against the virus, but there is the possibility of building a
        subcarrier filter. I am calling on a 1200 baud modem to enter this
        message, and have advised the sysops of the two other boards
        (names withheld). I don't know how this virus originated, but I'm
        sure it is the work of someone in the computer telecommunications
        field such as myself. Probably the best thing to do now is to
        stick to 1200 baud until we figure this thing out.<BR>

<P>This bogus virus description spawned a humorous alert by Robert Morris III :</P>
<UL>
       Date: 11-31-88 (24:60)  Number: 32769<BR>
        To: ALL Refer#: NONE<BR>
        From: ROBERT MORRIS III Read: (N/A)<BR>
       Subj: VIRUS ALERT       Status: PUBLIC MESSAGE<BR>
<BR>
        Warning: There's a new virus on the loose that's worse than
        anything I've seen before! It gets in through the power line,
        riding on the powerline 60 Hz subcarrier. It works by changing the
        serial port pinouts, and by reversing the direction one's disks
        spin. Over 300,000 systems have been hit by it here in Murphy,
        West Dakota alone! And that's just in the last 12 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
        It attacks DOS, Unix, TOPS-20, Apple-II, VMS, MVS, Multics, Mac,
        RSX-11, ITS, TRS-80, and VHS systems.<BR>
<BR>
        To prevent the spresd of the worm:<BR>

        1) Don't use the powerline.<BR>
        2) Don't use batteries either, since there are rumors that this
          virus has invaded most major battery plants and is infecting the
          positive poles of the batteries. (You might try hooking up just
          the negative pole.)<BR>
        3) Don't upload or download files.<BR>
       4) Don't store files on floppy disks or hard disks.<BR>
        5) Don't read messages. Not even this one!<BR>
        6) Don't use serial ports, modems, or phone lines.<BR>
       7) Don't use keyboards, screens, or printers.<BR>
       8) Don't use switches, CPUs, memories, microprocessors, or
          mainframes.<BR>
       9) Don't use electric lights, electric or gas heat or
          airconditioning, running water, writing, fire, clothing or the
          wheel.<BR>
<BR>
        I'm sure if we are all careful to follow these 9 easy steps, this
        virus can be eradicated, and the precious electronic fluids of
        our computers can be kept pure.<BR>
<BR>
        ---RTM III<BR>
</UL>
<BR>
<P>Since that time virus hoaxes have flooded the Internet.With thousands of
viruses worldwide, virus paranoia in the community has risen to an extremely
high level. It is this paranoia that fuels virus hoaxes. A good example of
this behavior is the "Good Times" virus hoax which started in 1994 and is
still circulating the Internet today. Instead of spreading from one computer
to another by itself, Good Times relies on people to pass it along.

<P><B>How to Identify a Hoax</B>


<P>There are several methods to identify virus hoaxes, but first consider what
makes a successful hoax on the Internet. There are two known factors that
make a successful virus hoax, they are: (1) technical sounding language, and
(2) credibility by association. If the warning uses the proper technical
jargon, most individuals, including technologically savy individuals, tend
to believe the warning is real. For example, the Good Times hoax says that
"...if the program is not stopped, the computer's processor will be placed
in an nth-complexity infinite binary loop which can severely damage the
processor...". The first time you read this, it sounds like it might be
something real. With a little research, you find that there is no such thing
as an nth-complexity infinite binary loop and that processors are designed
to run loops for weeks at a time without damage.

<P>When we say credibility by association we are referring to whom sent the
warning. If the janitor at a large technological organization sends a
warning to someone outside of that organization, people on the outside tend
to believe the warning because the company should know about those things.
Even though the person sending the warning may not have a clue what he is
talking about, the prestigue of the company backs the warning, making it
appear real. If a manager at the company sends the warning, the message is
doubly backed by the company's and the manager's reputations.

<P>Individuals should also be especially alert if the warning urges you to pass
it on to your friends. This should raise a red flag that the warning may be
a hoax. Another flag to watch for is when the warning indicates that it is a
Federal Communication Commission (FCC) warning. According to the FCC, they
have not and never will disseminate warnings on viruses. It is not part of
their job.

<P>CIAC recommends that you DO NOT circulate virus warnings without first
checking with an authoritative source. Authoritative sources are your
computer system security administrator or a computer incident advisory team.
Real warnings about viruses and other network problems are issued by
different response teams (CIAC, CERT, ASSIST, NASIRC, etc.) and are
digitally signed by the sending team using PGP. If you download a warning
from a teams web site or validate the PGP signature, you can usually be
assured that the warning is real. Warnings without the name of the person
sending the original notice, or warnings with names, addresses and phone
numbers that do not actually exist are probably hoaxes.

<P><B>What to Do When You Receive a Warning</B>


<P>Upon receiving a warning, you should examine its PGP signature to see that
it is from a real response team or antivirus organization. To do so, you
will need a copy of the PGP software and the public signature of the team
that sent the message. The CIAC signature is available from the CIAC web
server at:

<P><a href="http://ciac.llnl.gov/">http://ciac.llnl.gov/</a>

<P>If there is no PGP signature, see if the warning includes the name of the
person submitting the original warning. Contact that person to see if he/she
really wrote the warning and if he/she really touched the virus. If he/she
is passing on a rumor or if the address of the person does not exist or if
there is any questions about theauthenticity or the warning, do not
circulate it to others. Instead, send the warning to your computer security
manager or incident response team and let them validate it. When in doubt,
do not send it out to the world. Your computer security managers and the
incident response teams teams have experts who try to stay current on
viruses and their warnings. In addition, most anti-virus companies have a
web page containing information about most known viruses and hoaxes. You can
also call or check the web site of the company that produces the product
that is supposed to contain the virus. Checking the PKWARE site for the
current releases of PKZip would stop the circulation of the warning about
PKZ300 since there is no released version 3 of PKZip. Another useful web
site is the "Computer Virus Myths home page" (<a href="http://www.kumite.com/myths/">http://www.kumite.com/myths/</a>)
which contains descriptions of several known hoaxes. In most cases, common
sense would eliminate Internet hoaxes.</P>

From: "Trevor Warwick INF-SP" <a href="twarwick@madge.com">twarwick@madge.com</a><BR>
Subject: Mobile Phone Mayhem!<BR>

<P>Another twist on the well known "Cleaner buffs computer room floor and takes
down entire site" stories:

<P>We recently had some engineers from AT&T in our computer room for three
days, working on a PABX which also lives in there. During this period, two
of our main Netware servers have been extremely unreliable, crashing several
times a day. The AT&T engineers were working near these servers, and we
initially thought that they might have been causing the crashes by
disturbing some cables.

<P>After a few of these unexplained crashes, one of our MIS group noticed that
every time he went in to the server room to reboot the dead servers, one of
the AT&T engineers was using his mobile phone. So, they were asked to turn
their phones off while working in the server room, and the problem has not
reoccurred.

<P>To test the theory a bit further, the MIS group then took an otherwise
unused server, and experimented with using a mobile phone near it. With the
working phone being used less than a foot away from the machine, they
provoked a crash which corrupted the system disk (and its mirror volume)
beyond repair.

<CENTER>		       A serious weakness of DES<BR>
		       Draft - 2nd November 1996</CENTER>

<P><B>Abstract</B>

<P>Eli Biham and Adi Shamir recently pointed out that if an attacker can
induce unidirectional faults in key memory of cryptographic devices,
then keys could be extracted quickly. Although their attack is very
elegant, it is not practical against many fielded systems. For
example, inducing a single bit change in a DES key will cause a proper
implementation to return a key parity error.

<P>However, when combined with Peter Gutman's recent work on memory
remanence, there are two very practical attacks. One of them allows
smartcard electronic wallet keys to be extracted with much less
expensive equipment than that currently used by pay-TV pirates; the
other yields an effective attack against fielded banking security
modules. These attacks show that a feature of DES that had long been
thought innocuous is actually a serious design error.

<P><B>Introduction</B>

<P>In a research announcement of 30th October, Biham and Shamir point
out that if a cryptographic hardware module employes EEPROM for key
memory only, an opponent who can turn EEPROM values from `1' to `0'
with a small controlled probability (e.g., by applying UV light) might
cause a test input to be encrypted with a series of keys, each of
Hamming distance one from the next in the series, and ending with the
all zero key [1].

<P>There are a number of reasons why their attack is not likely to work
against real systems. For example, the typical smartcard system has
several kilobytes of program code in EEPROM as well as typically two
to five DES keys. An undirected stress applied to such a card is more
likely to cause a program crash or an uninformative error than to
yield a ciphertext encrypted under a key at Hamming distance one from
a genuine key. Even if we only had to cause a hundred cards to fail
to get a single input for the Biham-Shamir attack, if we needed on
average 28 inputs to recover a DES key, then the number of cards
required could be O(100^28).

<P>The situation is made still worse by the fact that DES keys have odd
parity, and a proper implementation will reject a key if any of its
bytes has even parity. So one would be reduced to looking for keys at
a Hamming distance of two rather than one. It is this objection that
inspired the following work.

<P><B>A Modified Attack</B>

<P>My idea is to turn the DES key parity problem on its head and enable
parity to help rather than hinder the attack. Let us first consider
an opponent who can perform directed attacks on the chip. Reading the
contents of an EEPROM cell directly is difficult, and people who do
it for a living use focused ion beam workstations to modify the chip
[2]. However, it is trivial to set an EEPROM cell to the value of
your choice if you do not have to read it first; you only need two
microprobes. A 10mS 18V pulse from the cell's source to its control
gate will do the trick [3].

<P>My modified attack therefore proceeds as follows. Set the first bit
of the EEPROM containing the target DES key to 1 (or 0, the choice
doesn't matter) and operate the device. If it still works, the keybit
was a 1. If you get a `key parity error' message, then the bit was
zero. Move on to the next bit; set it to 1 and see if this changes
the device's response (from encryption to error or vice versa).

<P>This is a practical attack even on chips whose software we do not
know in detail, as many smartcard software writers seem to have
adopted a convention that the keys are located at the bottom end of
the EEPROM memory. It will also work with protocols that use
redundancy which we do not understand: we just change each key bit
back to its original value.

<P>The use of predictable memory addresses for keys is not restricted to
smartcards; many banking security modules also keep keys at low
memory. I will now describe a related attack that extracts master
keys from these modules.

<P><B>An Attack on Fielded Systems</B>

<P>In a brilliant Usenix paper [4], Peter Gutman described the
mechanisms that cause both static and dynamic RAM to `remember'
values that they have stored for a long period of time. A prudent
security engineer will ask what the effect of this is in the real
world.

<P>I looked at an instance of a security module used in banking. This
security module has 12 pairs of DES master keys stored in low memory.
The device is tamper resistant in that power to the key memory is cut
when the box is opened for servicing (this is needed every few years
to change the battery). Keys are loaded into the device afterwards in
multiple components by trusted bank staff.

<P>In this device, which dated from the late 1980's, the key values were
substantially intact on power-up. The number of bits in error was of
the order of 5-10%. I cannot give more accurate figures as I was not
permitted to copy down either the correct master key values, nor the
almost-correct values that had been `burned in' to the static RAM
chips. I am also not permitted to name the bank at which these modules
are installed, and it may not be prudent to name their manufacturer.

<P>Nonetheless the crypto community should consider the consequences.

<P>If each DES key is wrong by five bits, then the effort involved in
seaching for the 10 wrong bits in a double DES key might be thought
to be 112-choose-10 operations. Each operation would involve (a)
doing a 2-key 3DES decryption of a 64 bit PIN key whose enciphered
value is widely known to the bank's programmers (b) in the 2^{-8} of
cases where this result has odd parity, enciphering an account number
with this as a DES key to see if the (decimalised) result is the
corresponding PIN. The effort is 4 times 112-choose-10 DES operations
 - about 2^50. But it would probably be cheaper to do a hardware
keysearch on the PIN key directly than to try to implement this more
complex 2^50 search in either hardware or software.

<P>However, the bytewise nature of the DES key redundancy reduces the
effort by orders of magnitude. If no key byte has a double error,
then the effort is seven tries for each even parity byte observed, or
7^10 - about 2^28, which is easy. If there is one key byte with a
double error, the effort is 2^38, giving a search of 2^40 DES
operations - which is still feasible for an individual.

<P><B>Conclusions</B>

<P>I have shown that the key parity in DES enables us to slash the cost
of real attacks on both old systems (banking security modules) and
new ones (electronic wallet smartcards).

<P>I had already mentioned in [5] that a common fault in the driver
software for banking security modules was that `key parity error'
messages were often ignored rather than copied to the bank's security
manager to give warning of an attempted attack. This note shows that
key parity is even more serious than that.

<P>The nature of DES key redundancy now appears to be a design error; it
would have been much better to calculate the redundancy on the whole
key. The 16 bit MAC used in the Clipper and Capstone chips is
preferable (although as shown in [6], 16 bits may not be enough to
prevent some protocol attacks).

<P>The lesson for bankers is that existing security modules (and other
cryptographic devices) should be destroyed carefully at the end of
their working life.

<P>The lesson for security engineers is that we should add key
redundancy, and the question of whether we can rely on a device's
eventual destruction, to the growing list of system parameters that
must be (a) explicitly considered during design and (b) examined
carefully when the product is being evaluated.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
======================================================= Chapter 0


   PURPOSE
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 0:1

Unknown and unauthorized individuals are increasingly attacking and
gaining access to highly sensitive unclassified information on the
Department of Defense's computer systems.  Given the threats the
attacks pose to military operations and national security, GAO was
asked to report on the extent to which Defense systems are being
attacked, the potential for further damage to information and
systems, and the challenges Defense faces in securing sensitive
information. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 0:2

Attacks on Defense computer systems are a serious and growing threat. 
The exact number of attacks cannot be readily determined because only
a small portion are actually detected and reported.  However, Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA) data implies that Defense may have
experienced as many as 250,000 attacks last year.  DISA information
also shows that attacks are successful 65 percent of the time, and
that the number of attacks is doubling each year, as Internet use
increases along with the sophistication of "hackers"\1 and their
tools. 

At a minimum, these attacks are a multimillion dollar nuisance to
Defense.  At worst, they are a serious threat to national security. 
Attackers have seized control of entire Defense systems, many of
which support critical functions, such as weapons systems research
and development, logistics, and finance.  Attackers have also stolen,
modified, and destroyed data and software.  In a well-publicized
attack on Rome Laboratory, the Air Force's premier command and
control research facility, two hackers took control of laboratory
support systems, established links to foreign Internet sites, and
stole tactical and artificial intelligence research data. 

The potential for catastrophic damage is great.  Organized foreign
nationals or terrorists could use "information warfare" techniques to
disrupt military operations by harming command and control systems,
the public switch network, and other systems or networks Defense
relies on. 

Defense is taking action to address this growing problem, but faces
significant challenges in controlling unauthorized access to its
computer systems.  Currently, Defense is attempting to react to
successful attacks as it learns of them, but it has no uniform policy
for assessing risks, protecting its systems, responding to incidents,
or assessing damage.  Training of users and system and network
administrators is inconsistent and constrained by limited resources. 
Technical solutions being developed, including firewalls,\2 smart
cards,\3 and network monitoring systems, will improve protection of
Defense information.  However, the success of these measures depends
on whether Defense implements them in tandem with better policy and
personnel solutions.

\1 The term hackers has a relatively long history.  Hackers were at
one time persons who explored the inner workings of computer systems
to expand their capabilities, as opposed to those who simply used
computer systems.  Today the term generally refers to unauthorized
individuals who attempt to penetrate information systems; browse,
steal, or modify data; deny access or service to others; or cause
damage or harm in some other way. 

\2 Firewalls are hardware and software components that protect one
set of system resources (e.g., host systems, local area networks)
from attack by outside network users (e.g., Internet users) by
blocking and checking all incoming network traffic.  See chapter 3
for a discussion of firewalls. 

\3 Smart cards are access cards containing encoded information and
sometimes a microprocessor and a user interface.  The encoded
information and/or the information generated by the processor are
used to gain access to a computer system or facility. 


   PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 0:3


      COMPUTER ATTACKS ARE AN
      INCREASING THREAT
-------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 0:3.1

In preventing computer attacks, Defense has to protect a vast and
complex information infrastructure:  currently, it has over 2.1
million computers, 10,000 local networks, and 100 long-distance
networks.  Defense also critically depends on information
technology--it uses computers to help design weapons, identify and
track enemy targets, pay soldiers, mobilize reservists, and manage
supplies.  Indeed, its very warfighting capability is dependent on
computer-based telecommunications networks and information systems. 

Defense's computer systems are particularly susceptible to attack
through connections on the Internet, which Defense uses to enhance
communication and information sharing.  In turning to the Internet,
Defense has increased its own exposure to attacks.  More and more
computer users--currently over 40 million worldwide--are connecting
to the Internet.  This increases the risks of unauthorized access to
information and disruption of service by outsiders.  Defense systems
connected to outside networks contain information that, while
unclassified, is nevertheless sensitive and warrants protection
because of the role it plays in Defense missions. 


      ATTACKS ARE COSTLY AND
      DAMAGING
-------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 0:3.2

DISA estimates indicate that Defense may have been attacked as many
as 250,000 times last year.  However, the exact number is not known
because, according to DISA, only about 1 in 150 attacks is actually
detected and reported.  In addition, in testing its systems, DISA
attacks and successfully penetrates Defense systems 65 percent of the
time.  According to Defense officials, attackers have obtained and
corrupted sensitive information--they have stolen, modified, and
destroyed both data and software.  They have installed unwanted files
and "back doors" which circumvent normal system protection and allow
attackers unauthorized access in the future.  They have shut down and
crashed entire systems and networks, denying service to users who
depend on automated systems to help meet critical missions.  Numerous
Defense functions have been adversely affected, including weapons and
supercomputer research, logistics, finance, procurement, personnel
management, military health, and payroll. 

In addition to the security breaches and service disruptions they
cause, these attacks are expensive.  The 1994 Rome Laboratory
incident alone cost Defense over $500,000 to assess the damage to its
systems, ensure the reliability of the information in the systems,
patch the vulnerabilities in its networks and systems, and attempt to
identify the attackers and their locations.  Although Defense has not
estimated the total cost of repairing damage caused by the thousands
of attacks experienced each year, it believes they are costing tens
or possibly even hundreds of millions of dollars. 


      POTENTIAL THREAT TO NATIONAL
      SECURITY
-------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 0:3.3

There is mounting evidence that attacks on Defense computer systems
pose a serious threat to national security.  Internet connections
make it possible for enemies armed with less equipment and weapons to
gain a competitive edge at a small price.  As a result, this will
become an increasingly attractive way for terrorist or adversaries to
wage attacks against Defense.  For example, major disruptions to
military operations and readiness could threaten national security if
attackers successfully corrupted sensitive information and systems or
denied service from vital communications backbones or power systems. 

The National Security Agency has acknowledged that potential
adversaries are developing a body of knowledge about Defense's and
other U.S.  systems and about methods to attack these systems. 
According to Defense officials, these methods, which include
sophisticated computer viruses and automated attack routines, allow
adversaries to launch untraceable attacks from anywhere in the world. 
In some extreme scenarios, studies show that terrorists or other
adversaries could seize control of Defense information systems and
seriously degrade the nation's ability to deploy and sustain military
forces.  Official estimates show that more than 120 countries already
have or are developing such computer attack capabilities. 


      CHALLENGES IN COUNTERING
      ATTACKS
-------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 0:3.4

In guarding its information, Defense faces the same risks and
challenges as other government and private sector organizations that
rely heavily on information technology.  The task of preventing
unauthorized users from compromising the confidentiality, integrity,
or availability\4 of sensitive information, is increasingly difficult
in the face of the growth in Internet use, the increasing skill
levels of attackers themselves, and technological advances in their
tools and methods of attack. 

Defense is taking actions to strengthen information systems security
and counter computer attacks, but increased resources, and management
commitment are needed.  Currently, many of Defense's policies
relating to computer attacks are outdated and inconsistent.  They do
not set standards or mandate specific actions for important security
activities such as vulnerability assessments, internal reporting of
attacks, correction of vulnerabilities, and damage assessments.  Many
of Defense's policies were developed when computers were physically
and electronically isolated and do not reflect today's "networked"
environment.  Computer users are often unaware of system
vulnerabilities and weak security practices.  The majority of system
and network administrators are not adequately trained in security and
do not have sufficient time to perform their duties.  Technical
solutions to security show promise, but these alone do not ensure
security.  While Defense is attempting to react to attacks as it
becomes aware of them, it will not be in a strong position to deter
them until it develops and implements more aggressive, proactive
detection and reaction programs. 


--------------------
\4 Confidentiality refers to keeping information from being disclosed
to unauthorized parties, i.e., protecting its secrecy.  Integrity
refers to keeping information accurate, i.e., keeping it from being
modified or corrupted.  Availability refers to ensuring the ability
of a system to keep working efficiently and keep information
accessible. 


   RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 0:4

Chapter 4 of this report contains recommendations to the Secretary of
Defense for ensuring that sufficient priority, resources, and
top-management attention are committed to establishing a more
effective information systems security program--one that includes (1)
improving security policies and procedures, (2) increasing user
awareness and accountability, (3) setting minimum standards for
ensuring that system and network security personnel have sufficient
time and training to properly do their jobs, (4) implementing more
proactive technical protection and monitoring systems, and (5)
evaluating Defense's incident response capability.  It also includes
a recommendation to the Secretary for assigning clear responsibility
and accountability throughout the Department for the successful
implementation of the security program. 


   AGENCY COMMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 0:5

GAO provided Department of Defense officials a draft of this report
and discussed it with them on May 15, 1996.  These officials
generally agreed with the findings, conclusions, and recommendations
in this report.  The Department's comments and our evaluation are
discussed in chapter 4 and have been incorporated where appropriate. 


INTRODUCTION
======================================================= Chapter 1

As a result of the rapid growth in computer technology, the
Department of Defense, like the rest of government and the private
sector, has become extremely dependent on automated information
systems.  These systems have also become increasingly interconnected
worldwide to form virtual communities in cyberspace.  The Department
calls its portion of this global community the Defense information
infrastructure.\1 To communicate and exchange unclassified
information, Defense relies extensively on a host of commercial
carriers and common user networks.  This network environment offers
Defense tremendous opportunities for streamlining operations and
improving efficiency, but also greatly increases the risks of
unauthorized access to information. 


--------------------
\1 The Defense information infrastructure consists of communications
networks, computers, software, databases, applications, and other
capabilities that meets the information processing, storage, and
communications needs of Defense users in peace and wartime. 


   DEFENSE'S COMPUTER ENVIRONMENT
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 1:1

As depicted in figure 1.1, the Department of Defense has a vast
information infrastructure of computers and networks to protect
including over 2.1 million computers, 10,000 local networks, 100
long-distance networks, 200 command centers, and 16 central computer
processing facilities or MegaCenters.  There are over 2 million
Defense computer users and an additional two million non-Defense
users that do business with the Department. 

As discussed in chapter 2, Defense systems contain very valuable and
sensitive information including commercial transactions, payrolls,
sensitive research data, intelligence, operational plans, procurement
sensitive source selection data, health records, personnel records,
and weapons systems maintenance records.  This unclassified but
sensitive information constitutes a majority of the information on
Defense computers.  The systems are attractive targets for
individuals and organizations seeking monetary gain, or dedicated to
damaging Defense and its operations.  Generally, classified
information such as war planning data or top secret research is safer
from attack since it is (1) protected on computers isolated from
outside networks, (2) encrypted, or (3) only transmitted on
dedicated, secure circuits.

   Information Infrastructure

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)


   THE INTERNET
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 1:2

The Internet is a global network interconnecting thousands of
dissimilar computer networks and millions of computers worldwide. 
Over the past 20 years, it has evolved from its relatively obscure
use by scientists and researchers to its significant role today as a
popular, user-friendly, and cost-effective means of communication and
information exchange.  Millions of people conduct business over the
Internet, and millions more use it for entertainment. 

Internet use has been more than doubling annually for the last
several years to an estimated 40 million users in nearly every
country today.  Connections are growing at an ever increasing rate;
the Internet is adding a new network about every 30 minutes.  Because
the Internet strives to be a seamless web of networks, it is
virtually impossible today to distinguish where one network ends and
another begins.  Local, state, and federal government networks, for
example, are interconnected with commercial networks, which in turn
are interconnected with military networks, financial networks,
networks controlling the distribution of electrical power, and so on. 

Defense itself uses the Internet to exchange electronic-mail, log on
to remote computer sites worldwide, and to download and upload files
from remote locations.  During the conflict in the Persian Gulf,
Defense used the Internet to communicate with U.S.  allies and gather
and disseminate intelligence and counter-intelligence information. 
Many Defense and information technology experts predict that Defense
will increase its reliance on Internet in the future.  They believe
that public messages originating within regions of conflict will
provide early warnings of significant developments earlier than the
more traditional indications and warnings obtained through normal
intelligence gathering.  They also envision the Internet as a back-up
communications medium if other conventional channels are disrupted
during conflicts. 

Though clearly beneficial, the Internet also poses serious computer
security concerns for Defense and other government and commercial
organizations.  Increasingly, attempted break-ins and intrusions into
their systems are being detected.  Federal law enforcement agencies
are likewise initiating more investigations of computer systems
intrusions, based on the rising level of Internet-related security
breaches and crimes.  Similarly, security technologies and products
are being developed and used to enhance Internet security.  However,
as new security tools are developed, hackers quickly learn how to
defeat them or exploit other vulnerabilities. 


   HOW COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE
   ATTACKED
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 1:3

A variety of weaknesses can leave computer systems vulnerable to
attack.  For example, they are vulnerable when (1) inexperienced or
untrained users accidentally violate good security practices by
inadvertently publicizing their passwords, (2) weak passwords are
chosen which can be easily guessed, or (3) identified security
weaknesses go uncorrected.  Malicious threats can be intentionally
designed to unleash computer viruses,\2 trigger future attacks, or
install software programs that compromise or damage information and
systems. 

Attackers use a variety of methods to exploit numerous computer
system vulnerabilities.  According to Defense, the three primary
methods described below account for most of the successful attacks. 

Sendmail is a common type of electronic mail used over the Internet. 
An attacker can install malicious code in an electronic mail message
and mail it to a networked machine.  Sendmail will scan the message
and look for its address, but also execute the attacker's code. 
Since sendmail is executing at the system's root level, it has all
systems privileges and can, for example, enter a new password into
the system's password file which gives the attacker total system
privileges. 

Password cracking and theft is a technique in which attackers try to
guess or steal passwords to obtain access to computer systems.  This
technique has been automated by attackers; rather than attackers
trying to guess legitimate users' passwords, computers can very
efficiently and systematically do the guessing.  For example, if the
password is a dictionary word, a computer can quickly look up all
possibilities to find a match.  Complex passwords comprised of
alphanumeric characters are more difficult to crack.  However, even
with complex passwords, powerful computers can use brute force to
compare all possible combinations of characters until a match is
found.  Of course, if attackers can create their own passwords in a
system, as in the sendmail example above, they do not need to guess a
legitimate one. 

Packet sniffing is a technique in which attackers surreptitiously
insert a software program at remote network switches or host
computers.  The program monitors information packets as they are sent
through networks and sends a copy of the information retrieved to the
hacker.  By picking up the first 125 keystrokes of a connection,
attackers can learn passwords and user identifications, which, in
turn, they can use to break into systems. 

Once they have gained access, attackers use the computer systems as
though they were legitimate users.  They steal information, both from
the systems compromised as well as systems connected to them. 
Attackers also deny service to authorized users, often by flooding
the computer system with messages or processes generated to absorb
system resources, leaving little available for authorized use. 

Attackers have varied motives in penetrating systems.  Some are
merely looking for amusement; they break in to obtain interesting
data, for the challenge of using someone else's computers, or to
compete with other attackers.  They are curious, but not actively
malicious, though at times they inadvertently cause damage. 
Others--known as computer vandals--are out to cause harm to
particular organizations, and in doing so, attempt to ensure that
their adversary knows about the attack.  Finally, some attackers are
professional thieves and spies who aim to break in, copy data, and
leave without damage.  Often, their attacks, because of the
sophistication of the tools they use, go undetected.  Defense is an
especially attractive target to this type of attacker, because, for
example, it develops and works with advanced research data and other
information interesting to foreign adversaries or commercial
competitors. 

Attackers use a variety of tools and techniques to identify and
exploit system vulnerabilities and to collect information passing
through networks, including valid passwords and user names for both
local systems as well as remote systems that local users can access. 
As technology has advanced over the past two decades, so have the
tools and techniques of those who attempt to break into systems. 
Figure 1.2 shows how the technical knowledge required by an attacker
decreases as the sophistication of the tools and techniques
increases.  Some of the computer attack tools, such as SATAN,\3 are
now so user-friendly that very little computer experience or
knowledge is required to launch automated attacks on systems.

   Less Knowledge as Tool
   Sophistication Increases

   edition.)

Also, informal hacker groups, such as the 2600 club, the Legions of
Doom, and Phrackers Inc., openly share information on the Internet
about how to break into computer systems.  This open sharing of
information combined with the availability of user-friendly and
powerful attack tools makes it relatively easy for anyone to learn
how to attack systems or to refine their attack techniques. 


--------------------
\2 A virus is a code fragment that reproduces by attaching to another
program.  It may damage data directly, or it may degrade system
performance by taking over system resources which are then not
available to authorized users. 

\3 SATAN is an acronym that stands for Security Administrator Tool
for Analyzing Networks.  It was designed to help network
administrators scan their computers for security weaknesses, but has
been used effectively by hackers to break into systems. 


   OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND
   METHODOLOGY
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 1:4

The Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Governmental
Affairs; the Ranking Minority Member, Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs; and the
Chairman, Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs
and Criminal Justice, House Committee on Government Reform and
Oversight requested information on the extent to which Defense
computer systems are being attacked, the damage attackers have
caused, and the potential for more damage.  We were also asked to
assess Defense efforts to minimize intrusions into its computer
systems. 

To achieve these objectives, we obtained documentation showing the
number of recent attacks and results of tests conducted by Defense
personnel to penetrate its own computer systems.  We obtained data on
actual attacks to show which systems were attacked, and how and when
the attack occurred.  We also obtained information available on the
extent of damage caused by the attack and determined if Defense
performed damage assessments.  We obtained documentation that
discusses the harm that outsiders have caused and can potentially
cause to computer systems. 

We also assessed initiatives at Defense designed to defend against
computer systems attacks.  We reviewed the Department's information
systems security policies to evaluate their effectiveness in helping
to prevent and respond to attacks.  We discussed with Defense
officials their efforts to provide information security awareness and
training programs to Defense personnel.  We obtained information on
technical products and services currently available and planned to
protect workstations, systems, and networks.  We also obtained and
evaluated information on obstacles Defense and others face in
attempting to identify, apprehend, and prosecute those who attack
computer systems. 

We interviewed officials and obtained documentation from the

  -- Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command,
     Control, Communications, and Intelligence, Washington, D.C.;

  -- Defense Information Systems Agency, Center for Information
     Systems Security, Washington, D.C.;

  -- Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters Offices, Washington,
     D.C.;

  -- National Security Agency, Ft.  Meade, Maryland;

  -- Air Force Information Warfare Center, Kelly Air Force Base, San
     Antonio, Texas;

  -- Navy Fleet Information Warfare Center, Norfolk, Virginia;

  -- Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Bolling Air Force
     Base, Washington, D.C.;

  -- Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Navy Yard, Washington,

  -- Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 

We also interviewed officials and obtained data from the Computer
Emergency Response Team Coordination Center, Software Engineering
Institute, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  In
response to computer security threats, Defense established the
Coordination Center in 1988, to support users of the Internet.  The
Center works with the Internet community to detect and resolve
computer security incidents and to prevent future incidents. 

Our review was conducted from September 1995 to April 1996 in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  We
provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense for
comment.  On May 15, 1996, we discussed the facts, conclusions, and
recommendations with cognizant Defense officials.  Their comments are
presented and evaluated in chapter 4 and have been incorporated where
appropriate. 


COMPUTER ATTACKS POSE CRITICAL
RISKS TO DEFENSE
======================================================= Chapter 2

To operate more effectively in a technologically sophisticated world,
Defense is moving from a computing environment of stand-alone
information systems that perform specific functions to a globally
integrated information structure.  In doing so, it has linked
thousands of computers to the Internet as well as other networks and
increased its dependence on computer and network technology to carry
out important military functions worldwide.  As a result, some
operations would now be crippled if (1) the supporting technology
failed or (2) information was stolen or destroyed.  For example: 

  -- Defense cannot locate or deliver supplies promptly without
     properly functioning inventory and logistics systems;

  -- Defense relies heavily on computer technology--especially a
     network of simulators that emulate complex battle situations--to
     train staff;

  -- it is impossible to pay, assign, move, or track people without
     globally networked information systems;

  -- Defense cannot control costs, pay vendors, let or track
     contracts, allocate or release funds, or report on activities
     without automation; and

  -- Defense systems handle billions of dollars in financial
     transactions for pay, contract reimbursement, and economic
     commerce. 

Defense systems are enticing targets for attackers for several
reasons.  Attackers seeking financial gain may want to access
financial systems to direct fraudulent payments, transfer money
between accounts, submit fictitious claims, direct orders for
unneeded products, or wipe out an entire organization's budget. 
Companies doing business with Defense may want to strengthen their
competitive position by accessing systems that contain valuable
information about billions of dollars worth of sophisticated research
and development data and information on contracts and evaluation
criteria.  Enemies may want to better position themselves against our
military by stealing information on force locations and plans for
military campaigns and use this data to locate, target, or misdirect
forces. 


   NUMBER OF ATTACKS IS INCREASING
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:1

Although no one knows the exact number, DISA estimates show that
Defense may have experienced about 250,000 attacks last year, and
that the number of attacks is increasing.  Establishing an exact
count of attacks is difficult since some attackers take measures to
avoid detection.  In addition, the Department does not detect or
react to most attacks, according to DISA, and does not report the
majority of attacks it does detect. 

Estimates of the number of computer attacks are based on DISA's
Vulnerability Analysis and Assessment Program.  Under this program,
DISA personnel attempt to penetrate computer systems at various
military service and Defense agency sites via the Internet.  Since
the program's inception in 1992, DISA has conducted 38,000 attacks on
Defense computer systems to test how well they were protected.  DISA
successfully gained access 65 percent of the time (see figure 2.1). 
Of these successful attacks, only 988 or about 4 percent were
detected by the target organizations.  Of those detected, only 267
attacks or roughly 27 percent were reported to DISA.  Therefore, only
about 1 in 150 successful attacks drew an active defensive response
from the organizations being tested.  Reasons for Defense's poor
detection rates are discussed in chapter 3. 

   Figure 2.1:  Results of DISA
   Vulnerability Assessments

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

   Source:  Defense Information
   Systems Agency.

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

The Air Force conducts similar vulnerability assessments.  Its data
shows better success in detecting and reacting to attacks than DISA's
data.  However, Defense officials generally acknowledge that, because
the Air Force's computer emergency response team resources are larger
and more experienced, they have had better success in detecting and
reacting to attacks than either the Navy or Army. 

DISA also maintains data on officially reported attacks.  Defense
installations reported 53 attacks in 1992, 115 in 1993, 255 in 1994,
and 559 in 1995.  Figure 2.2 shows this historical data on the number
of officially reported attacks and projections for future attack
activity.

   Attacks

   ATTACKS HAVE CAUSED
   CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:2

According to Defense officials, attacks on Department computer
systems have been costly and considerably damaging.  Attackers have
stolen, modified, and destroyed both data and software.  They have
installed unwanted files and "back doors" which circumvent normal
system protection and allow attackers unauthorized access in the
future.  They have shut down entire systems and networks, thereby
denying service to users who depend on automated systems to help meet
critical missions.  Numerous Defense functions have been adversely
affected, including weapons and supercomputer research, logistics,
finance, procurement, personnel management, military health, and
payroll. 

Following are examples of attacks to date.  The first attack we
highlight, on Rome Laboratory, New York, was well-documented by
Defense and of particular concern to committees requesting this
report because the attack shows how a small group of hackers can
easily and quickly take control of Defense networks. 


      ROME LABORATORY
-------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:2.1

Rome Laboratory, New York, is Air Force's premier command and control
research facility.  The facility's research projects include
artificial intelligence systems, radar guidance systems, and target
detection and tracking systems.  The laboratory works cooperatively
with academic institutions, commercial research facilities, and
Defense contractors in conducting its research and relies heavily on
the Internet in doing so. 

During March and April 1994, more than 150 Internet intrusions were
made on the Laboratory by a British hacker and an unidentified
hacker.  The attackers used trojan horses\1 and sniffers to access
and control Rome's operational network.  As depicted in figure 2.3,
they also took measures to prevent a complete trace of their attack. 
Instead of accessing Rome Laboratory computers directly, they weaved
their way through various phone switches in South America, through
commercial sites on the east and west coast, and then to the Rome
Laboratory. 

The attackers were able to seize control of Rome's support systems
for several days and establish links to foreign Internet sites. 
During this time, they copied and downloaded critical information
such as air tasking order\2 systems data.  By masquerading as a
trusted user at Rome Laboratory, they were also able to successfully
attack systems at other government facilities, including the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Goddard Space Flight
Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, some Defense contractors,
and other private sector organizations.  Figure 2.3 illustrates the
route the hackers took to get to the Rome Laboratory computers and
the computer sites they successfully attacked from Rome. 

   Figure 2.3:  Computer Sites
   Attacked During Rome Laboratory
   Incident

   (See figure in printed
   edition.)

Because the Air Force did not know it was attacked for at least 3
days, vast damage to Rome Laboratory systems and the information in
those systems could potentially have occurred.  As stated in the Air
Force report on the incident,\3 "We have only the intruders to thank
for the fact that no lasting damage occurred.  Had they decided, as a
skilled attacker most certainly will, to bring down the network
immediately after the initial intrusion, we would have been powerless
to stop them." However, the Air Force really does not know whether or
not any lasting damage occurred.  Furthermore, because one of the
attackers was never caught, investigators do not know what was done
with the copied data. 

The Air Force Information Warfare Center (AFIWC) estimated that the
attacks cost the government over $500,000 at the Rome Laboratory
alone.  Their estimate included the time spent taking systems off the
networks, verifying systems integrity, installing security patches,
and restoring service, and costs incurred by the Air Force's Office
of Special Investigations and Information Warfare Center.  It also
included estimates for time and money lost due to the Laboratory's
research staff not being able to use their computer systems. 

However, the Air Force did not include the cost of the damage at
other facilities attacked from the Rome Laboratory or the value of
the research data that was compromised, copied, and downloaded by the
attacker.  For example, Rome Laboratory officials said that over 3
years of research and $4 million were invested in the air tasking
order research project compromised by the attackers, and that it
would have cost that much to replace it if they had been unable to
recover from damage caused by the attackers.  Similarly, Rome
laboratory officials told us that all of their research data is
valuable but that they do not know how to estimate this value. 

There also may have been some national security risks associated with
the Rome incident.  Air Force officials told us that at least one of
the hackers may have been working for a foreign country interested in
obtaining military research data or information on areas in which the
Air Force was conducting advanced research.  In addition, Air Force
Information Warfare Center officials told us that the hackers may
have intended to install malicious code in software which could be
activated years later, possibly jeopardizing a weapons system's
ability to perform safely and as intended, and even threatening the
lives of the soldiers or pilots operating the system.

      OTHER ATTACKS
-------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:2.2

  -- The U.S.  Naval Academy's computer systems were penetrated by
     unknown attackers in December 1994.  The intrusions originated
     from Great Britain, Finland, Canada, the University of Kansas,
     and the University of Alabama.  During the attack, 24 servers\4
     were accessed and sniffer programs were installed on 8 of these. 
     A main router\5 was compromised, and a system's name and address
     were changed, making the system inaccessible to authorized
     users.  In addition, one system back-up file and files from four
     other systems were deleted.  Six other systems were corrupted,
     two encrypted password files were compromised, and over 12,000
     passwords were changed.  The Navy did not determine how much the
     attack cost and Navy investigators were unable to identify the
     attacker(s).  At a minimum, however, the attack caused
     considerable disruptions to the Academy's ability to process and
     store sensitive information. 

  -- Between April 1990 and May 1991, hackers from the Netherlands
     penetrated computer systems at 34 Defense sites.  The hackers
     browsed directories and modified systems to obtain full
     privileges allowing them future access.  They read e-mail, in
     some cases searching the messages for key words such as nuclear,
     weapons, missile, Desert Shield, and Desert Storm.  In several
     instances, the hackers copied and stored military data on
     systems at major U.S.  universities.  After the attacks, the
     hackers modified systems logs to avoid detection and to remove
     traces of their activities.  We testified on these attacks
     before the Subcommittee on Government Information and
     Regulation, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, on
     November 20, 1991.\6

  -- In 1995 and 1996, an attacker from Argentina used the Internet
     to access a U.S.  university system, and from there broke into
     computer networks at the Naval Research Laboratory, other
     Defense installations, NASA, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
     The systems at these sites contained sensitive research
     information, such as aircraft design, radar technology, and
     satellite engineering, that is ultimately used in weapons and
     command and control systems.  The Navy could not determine what
     information was compromised and did not attempt to determine the
     cost of the incident. 

  -- Unknown person(s) accessed two unclassified computer systems at
     the Army Missile Research Laboratory, White Sands Missile Range
     and installed a sniffer program.  The intruder was detected
     entering the systems a second and third time, but the sniffer
     program was removed before the intruder could be identified. 
     The missile range's computer systems contain sensitive data,
     including test results on the accuracy and reliability of
     sophisticated weaponry.  As with the case above, the Army could
     not determine what data was compromised.  However, such data
     could prove very valuable to foreign adversaries. 

While these are specific examples, Defense officials say they reflect
the thousands of attacks experienced every year.  Although no one has
attempted to determine the total cost of responding to these attacks,
Defense officials agreed the cost of these incidents is significant
and probably totals tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars per
year.  Such costs should include (1) detecting and reacting to
attacks, repairing systems, and checking to ensure the integrity of
information, (2) lost productivity due to computer shutdowns, (3)
tracking, catching, and prosecuting attackers, and (4) the cost and
value of information compromised.

   FUTURE ATTACKS COULD THREATEN
   NATIONAL SECURITY
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 2:3

Because so few incidents are actually detected and reported, no one
knows the full extent of damage caused by computer attacks.  However,
according to many Defense and private sector experts, the potential
for catastrophic damage is great given (1) the known vulnerabilities
of the Department's command and control, military research,
logistics, and other systems, (2) weaknesses in national information
infrastructure systems, such as public networks which Defense depends
upon, and (3) the threat of terrorists or foreign nationals using
sophisticated offensive information warfare techniques.  They believe
that attackers could disrupt military operations and threaten
national security by successfully compromising Defense information
and systems or denying service from vital commercial communications
backbones or power systems. 

The National Security Agency (NSA) has acknowledged that potential
adversaries are developing a body of knowledge about the Defense's
and other U.S.  systems, and about methods to attack these systems. 
According to NSA, these methods, which include sophisticated computer
viruses and automated attack routines, allow adversaries to launch
untraceable attacks from anywhere in the world.  In some extreme
scenarios, experts state that terrorists or other adversaries could
seize control of Defense information systems and seriously degrade
the nation's ability to deploy and sustain military forces.  The
Department of Energy and NSA estimate that more than 120 countries
have established computer attack capabilities.  In addition, most
countries are believed to be planning some degree of information
warfare as part of their overall security strategy. 

At the request of the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Command,
Control, Communications and Intelligence, the Rand Corporation\7
conducted exercises known as "The Day After .  .  ." between January
and June 1995 to simulate an information warfare attack.  Senior
members of the national security community and representatives from
national security-related telecommunications and information systems
industries participated in evaluating and responding to a
hypothetical conflict between an adversary and the United States and
its allies in the year 2000. 

In the scenario, an adversary attacks computer systems throughout the
United States and allied countries, causing accidents, crashing
systems, blocking communications, and inciting panic.  For example,
in the scenario, automatic tellers at two of Georgia's largest banks
are attacked.  The attacks create confusion and panic when the
automatic tellers wrongfully add and debit thousands of dollars from
customers' accounts.  A freight train is misrouted when a logic
bomb\8 is inserted into a railroad computer system, causing a major
accident involving a high speed passenger train in Maryland. 
Meanwhile, telephone service is sabotaged in Washington, a major
airplane crash is caused in Great Britain; and Cairo, Egypt loses all
power service.  An all-out attack is launched on computers at most
military installations, slowing down, disconnecting, or crashing the
systems.  Weapons systems designed to pinpoint enemy tanks and troop
formations begin to malfunction due to electronic infections. 

The exercises were designed to assess the plausibility of information
warfare scenarios and help define key issues to be addressed in this
area.  The exercises highlighted some defining features of
information warfare, including the fact that attack mechanisms and
techniques can be acquired with relatively modest investment.  The
exercises also revealed that no adequate tactical warning system
exists for distinguishing between information warfare attacks and
accidents.  Perhaps most importantly, the study demonstrated that
because the U.S.  economy, society, and military rely increasingly on
a high performance networked information infrastructure, this
infrastructure presents a set of attractive strategic targets for
opponents who possess information warfare capabilities. 

The Defense Science Board, a Federal Advisory Committee established
to provide independent advice to the Secretary of Defense,
acknowledged the threat of an information warfare attack and the
damage that could be done in its October 1994 report, "Information
Architecture for the Battlefield".\9 The report states

     "there is mounting evidence that there is a threat that goes
     beyond hackers and criminal elements.  This threat arises from
     terrorist groups or nation states, and is far more subtle and
     difficult to counter than the more unstructured but growing
     problem caused by hackers.  The threat causes concern over the
     specter of military readiness problems caused by attacks on
     Defense computer systems, but it goes well beyond the
     Department.  Every aspect of modern life is tied to a computer
     system at some point, and most of these systems are relatively
     unprotected.  This is especially so for those tied to the NII
     (National Information Infrastructure)."

The report added that a large structured attack with strategic intent
against the United States could be prepared and exercised under the
guise of unstructured activities and that such an attack could
"cripple U.S.  operational readiness and military effectiveness."

These studies demonstrate the growing potential threat to national
security posed by computer attacks.  Information warfare will
increasingly become an inexpensive but highly effective tactic for
disrupting military operations.  As discussed in chapter 3,
successfully protecting information and detecting and reacting to
computer attacks presents Defense and our nation with significant
challenges.

DEFENSE FACES SIGNIFICANT
CHALLENGES IN COUNTERING ATTACKS
======================================================= Chapter 3

The task of precluding unauthorized users from compromising the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information is
increasingly difficult given the complexity of Defense's information
infrastructure, growth of and reliance on outside networks including
the Internet, and the increasing sophistication of the attackers and
their tools.  Absolute protection of Defense information is neither
practical nor affordable.  Instead, Defense must turn to risk
management to ensure computer security.  In doing so, however, it
must make tradeoffs that consider the magnitude of the threat, the
value and sensitivity of the information to be protected, and the
cost of protecting it. 


   ELEMENTS OF A GOOD INFORMATION
   SYSTEMS SECURITY PROGRAM
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 3:1

In our review of key studies and security documents and discussions
with Defense security experts, certain core elements emerged as
critical to effective information system security.  A good computer
security program begins with top management's understanding of the
risks associated with networked computers, and a commitment that
computer security will be given a high priority.  At Defense,
management attention to computer security has been uneven.  The
Defense information infrastructure has evolved into a set of
individual computer systems and interconnected networks, many of
which were developed without sufficient attention to the entire
infrastructure.  While some local area networks and Defense
installations have excellent security programs, others do not. 
However, the overall infrastructure is only as secure as the weakest
link.  Therefore, all components of the Defense infrastructure must
be considered when making investment decisions. 

In addition, policies and procedures must also reflect this
philosophy and guide implementation of the Department's overall
security program as well as the security plans for individual Defense
installations.  The policies should set minimum standards and
requirements for key security activities and clearly assign
responsibility and accountability for ensuring that they are carried
out.  Further, sufficient personnel, training, and resources must be
provided to implement these policies. 

While not intended to be a comprehensive list, following are security
activities that all of the security studies and experts agreed were
important: 

(1) clear and consistent information security policies and
procedures,

(2) vulnerability assessments to identify security weaknesses at
individual Defense installations,

(3) mandatory correction of identified network/system security
weaknesses,

(4) mandatory reporting of attacks to help better identify and
communicate vulnerabilities and needed corrective actions,

(5) damage assessments to reestablish the integrity of the
information compromised by an attacker,

(6) awareness training to ensure that computer users understand the
security risks associated with networked computers and practice good
security,

(7) assurance that network managers and system administrators have
sufficient time and training to do their jobs,

(8) prudent use of firewalls, smart cards, and other technical
solutions, and

(9) an incident response capability to aggressively detect and react
to attacks and track and prosecute attackers. 

Defense has recognized the importance of good computer security.  The
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications
and Intelligence has stated,

     "The vulnerability to .  .  .  systems and networks is
     increasing .  .  .  The ability of individuals to penetrate
     computer networks and deny, damage, or destroy data has been
     demonstrated on many occasions.  .  .  As our warfighters become
     more and more dependent on our information systems, the
     potential for disaster is obvious."

In addition, as part of its Federal Managers' Financial Integrity
Act\1 requirements, the Department identified information systems
security as a system weakness in its Fiscal Year 1995 Annual
Statement of Assurance, a report documenting high-risk areas
requiring management attention.  In its statement, Defense
acknowledged a significant increase in attacks on its information
systems and its dependence on these systems. 

Also, Defense has implemented a formal defensive information warfare
program.  This program was started in December 1992 through Defense
Directive 3600.1.  The directive broadly states that measures will be
taken as part of this program to "protect friendly information
systems by preserving the availability, integrity, and
confidentiality of the systems and the information contained within
those systems." DISA, in cooperation with the military services and
defense agencies, is responsible for implementing the program.  The
Department's December 1995 Defensive Information Warfare Management
Plan defines a three-pronged approach to protect against, detect, and
react to threats to the Defense information infrastructure.  The plan
states that Defense must monitor and detect intrusions or hostile
actions as they occur, react quickly to isolate the systems under
attack, correct the security breaches, restore service to authorized
users, and improve security. 

DISA has also taken a number of actions to implement its plan, the
most significant being the establishment of its Global Control Center
at DISA headquarters.  The center provides the facilities, equipment,
and personnel for directing the defensive information warfare
program, including detecting and responding to computer attacks. 
DISA has also established its Automated Systems Security Incident
Support Team (ASSIST) to provide a centrally coordinated
around-the-clock Defense response to attacks.  DISA also performs
other services to help secure Defense's information infrastructure,
including conducting assessments of Defense organizations'
vulnerability to computer attacks.  AFIWC has developed a computer
emergency response capability and performs functions similar to DISA. 
The Navy and Army have just established similar capabilities through
the Fleet Information Warfare Center (FIWC) and Land Information
Warfare Activity (LIWA), respectively. 

Defense is incorporating some of the elements we describe above as
necessary for strengthening information systems security and
countering computer attacks, but there are still areas where
improvement is needed.  Even though the technology environment has
changed dramatically in recent years, and the risk of attacks has
increased, top management at many organizations do not consider
computer security to be a priority.  As a result, when resources are
allocated, funding for important protective measures, such as
training or the purchase of protection technology, take a back seat. 

As discussed in the remainder of this chapter, Defense needs to
establish a more comprehensive information systems security program. 
A program which ensures that sufficient resources are directed at
protecting information systems.  Specifically, (1) Defense's policies
for protecting, detecting, and reacting to computer attacks are
outdated and incomplete, (2) computer users are often unaware of
system vulnerabilities and weak security practices, (3) system and
network administrators are not adequately trained and do not have
sufficient time to perform their duties, (4) technical solutions to
security problems show promise, but these alone cannot guarantee
protection, and (5) while Defense's incident response capability is
improving, it is not sufficient to handle the increasing threat. 


--------------------
\1 Public Law 97-255, September 8, 1982. 


   DEFENSE'S POLICIES ON
   INFORMATION SECURITY ARE
   OUTDATED AND INCOMPLETE
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 3:2

The military services and Defense agencies have issued a number of
information security policies, but they are dated, inconsistent, and
incomplete.  At least 45 separate Defense policy documents address
various computer and information security issues.  The most
significant Defense policy documents include Defense Directive
3600.1, discussed above, and Defense Directive 5200.28, entitled
Security Requirements for Automated Information Systems, dated March
21, 1988, which provides mandatory minimum information systems
security requirements.  In addition, Defense Directive 8000.1,
entitled Defense Information Management Program, dated October 27,
1992, requires DISA and the military services to provide technology
and services to ensure the availability, reliability,
maintainability, integrity, and security of Defense information. 
However, these and other policies relating to computer attacks are
outdated and inconsistent.  They do not set standards, mandate
specific actions, or clearly assign accountability for important
security activities such as vulnerability assessments, internal
reporting of attacks, correction of vulnerabilities, or damage
assessments. 

Shortcomings in Defense's computer security policy have been reported
previously.  The Joint Security Commission found similar problems in
1994, and noted that Defense's policies in this area were developed
when computers were physically and electronically isolated. 
Consequently, the Commission reported that Defense information
security policies were not suitable for today's highly networked
environment.  The Commission also found that Defense policy was based
on a philosophy of complete risk avoidance, rather than a more
realistic and balanced approach of risk reduction.  In addition, the
Commission found a profusion of policy formulation authorities within
Defense.  This has led to policies being developed which create
inefficiencies and implementation problems when organizations attempt
to coordinate and interconnect their computer systems. 

Defense policies do not specifically require the following important
security activities. 

Vulnerability Assessments:  DISA established a Vulnerability Analysis
and Assessment Program in 1992 to identify vulnerabilities in Defense
information systems.  The Air Force and Navy have similar programs,
and the Army plans to begin assessing its systems next year.  Under
its program, DISA attempts to penetrate selected Defense information
systems using various techniques, all of which are widely available
on the Internet.  DISA personnel attack vulnerabilities which have
been widely publicized in their alerts to the military services and
defense agencies.  Assessment is performed at the request of the
targeted Defense installation, and, upon completion, systems and
security personnel are given a detailed briefing.  Typically, DISA
and the installation develop a plan to strengthen the site's
defenses, more effectively detect intrusions, and determine whether
systems administrators and security personnel are adequately
experienced and trained.  Air Force and Navy on-line assessments are
similar to DISA vulnerability assessments. 

However, there is no specific Defensewide policy requiring
vulnerability assessments or criteria for prioritizing who should be
targeted first.  This has led to uneven application of this valuable
risk assessment mechanism.  Some installations have been tested
multiple times while others have never been tested.  As of March
1996, vulnerability assessments had been performed on less than 1
percent of the thousands of defense systems around the world.  DISA
and the military services recognize this shortcoming, but state that
they do not have sufficient resources to do more.  This is a concern
because vulnerabilities in one part of Defense's information
infrastructure make the entire infrastructure vulnerable. 

Correction of Vulnerabilities:  Defense does not have any policy
requirement for correcting identified deficiencies and
vulnerabilities.  Defense's computer emergency response
teams--ASSIST, AFIWC, FIWC, and LIWA--as well as the national
computer emergency response team at the Software Engineering
Institute routinely identify and broadcast to Defense network
administrators system vulnerabilities and suggested fixes.  However,
the lack of specific requirements for correcting known
vulnerabilities has led to no action or inconsistent action on the
part of some Defense organizations and installations. 

Reporting Attacks:  The Department also has no policy requiring
internal reporting of attacks or guidance on how to respond to
attacks.  System and network administrators need to know when and to
whom attacks should be reported and what response is appropriate for
reacting to attacks and ensuring systems availability,
confidentiality, and integrity.  Reporting attacks is important for
Defense to identify and understand the threat, i.e., size, scale, and
type of attack, as well as to measure the magnitude of the problem
for appropriate corrective action and resource allocation.  Further,
since a computer attack on federal facility is a crime, it should be
reported. 

Damage Assessments:  There is no policy for Defense organizations to
assess damage to their systems once an attack has been detected.  As
a result, these assessments are not usually done.  For example, Air
Force officials told us that the Rome Laboratory incident was the
exception rather than the rule.  They said that system and network
administrators, due to lack of time and money, often simply "patch"
their systems, restore service, and hope for the best.  However,
these assessments are essential to ensure the integrity of the data
in those systems and to make sure that no malicious code was inserted
that could cause severe problems later. 


   DEFENSE PERSONNEL LACK
   SUFFICIENT AWARENESS AND
   TECHNICAL TRAINING
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 3:3

The Software Engineering Institute's Computer Emergency Response Team
estimates that at least 80 percent of the security problems it
addresses involve poorly chosen or poorly protected passwords by
computer users.  According to the Institute, many computer users do
not understand the technology they are using, the vulnerabilities in
the network environment they are working in, and the responsibilities
they have for protecting critical information.  They also often do
not understand the importance of knowing and implementing good
security policies, procedures, and techniques.  Defense officials
generally agreed that user awareness training was needed, but stated
that installation commanders do not always understand computer
security risk and, thus, do not always devote sufficient resources to
the problem.  The officials told us they are trying to overcome the
lack of resources by low cost alternatives such as banners that warn
individuals of their security responsibilities when they turn on
their computers. 

In addition, network and system administrators often do not know what
their responsibilities are for protecting their systems, and for
detecting and reacting to intrusions.  Critical computer security
responsibilities are often assigned to personnel as additional or
ancillary duties.  We interviewed 24 individuals responsible for
managing and securing systems at four military installations. 
Sixteen stated that they did not have enough time, experience, or
training to do their jobs properly.  In addition, eight stated that
system administration was not their full-time job, but rather an
ancillary duty.  Our findings were confirmed by an Air Force survey
of system administrators.  It found that 325 of 709 respondents were
unaware of procedures for reporting vulnerabilities and incidents,
249 of 515 respondents had not received any network security
training, and 377 of 706 respondents reported that their security
responsibilities were ancillary duties. 

In addition, Defense officials stated that it is not uncommon for
installations to lack a full-time, trained, experienced information
systems security officer.  Security officers generally develop and
update the site's security plan, enforce security statutes and
policy, aggregate and report all security incidents and changes in
the site's security status, and evaluate security threats and
vulnerabilities.  They also coordinate computer security with
physical and personnel security, develop back-up and contingency
plans, manage access to all information systems with sound password
and user identification procedures, ensure that audit trails of
log-ins to systems are maintained and analyzed, and perform a host of
other duties necessary to secure the location's computer systems. 
Without a full-time security official, these important security
activities are usually done in an ad hoc manner or not done at all. 
Defense officials again cited the low priority installation
commanders give security duties as the reason for the lack of
full-time, trained, experienced security officers. 

Defense has developed training courses and curricula which focus on
the secure operation of computer systems and the need to protect
information.  For example, DISA's Center for Information Systems
Security offers courses on the vulnerability of networks and computer
systems security.  Each of the military services also provides
training in this area.  While we did not assess the quality of the
training, it is clear that not enough training is done.  Defense
officials cite resource constraints as the reason for this
limitation.  To illustrate, in its August 1995 Command and Control
Protect Program Management Plan, the Army noted that it had
approximately 4000 systems administrators, but few of these had
received formal security training.  The plan stated that the systems
administrators have not been taught security basics such as how to
detect and monitor an active intrusion, establish countermeasures, or
respond to an intrusion.  The plan added that a single course is
being developed to train systems administrators, but that no funds
are available to conduct the training.  This again demonstrates the
low priority top Defense management officials often give security. 

In its February 1994 report, Redefining Security, the Joint Security
Commission had similar concerns, stating: 

     "Because of a lack of qualified personnel and a failure to
     provide adequate resources, many information systems security
     tasks are not performed adequately.  Too often critical security
     responsibilities are assigned as additional or ancillary
     duties."

The report added that the Department lacks comprehensive, consistent
training for information systems security officers, and that
Defense's current information systems security training efforts
produce inconsistent training quality and, in some cases, a
duplication of effort.  The report concluded that, despite the
importance of security awareness, training, and education programs,
these programs tend to be frequent and ready targets for budget cuts. 

According to Defense officials, installation commanders may not
understand the risks associated with networked computers, and thus
may not have devoted sufficient priority or resources to address
these problems.  These officials also cite the lack of a professional
job series for information security officials as a contributing
factor to poor security practices at Defense installations.  Until
systems security is supported by the personnel system--including
potential for advancement, financial reward, and professional
training--it will not be a full-time duty.  As a result, security
will continue to be the purview of part-time, inadequately trained
personnel. 


   TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS SHOW
   PROMISE, BUT CANNOT ALONE
   PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 3:4

As described below, Defense and the private sector are developing a
variety of technical solutions which should assist the Department in
preventing, detecting, and reacting to attacks on its computer
systems.  However, knowledgeable attackers with the right tools can
defeat these technologies.  Therefore, these should not be an
entity's sole means of defense.  Rather, they should be prudently
used in conjunction with other security measures discussed in this
chapter.  Investment in these technologies should also be based on a
comprehensive assessment of the value and sensitivity of the
information to be protected. 

One important technology is a smart card called Fortezza.  The card
and its supporting equipment, including card readers and software,
were developed by the NSA.  The card is based on the Personal
Computer Memory Card International Association industry standard and
is a credit card size electronic module which stores digital
information that can be recognized by a network or system.  The card
will be used by Defense and other government agencies to provide data
encryption\2 and authentication\3 services.  Defense plans to use the
card in its Defense Message System\4 and other systems around the
world. 

Another technology that Defense is implementing is firewalls. 
Firewalls are hardware and software components that protect one set
of system resources from attack by outside network users by blocking
and checking all incoming network traffic.  Firewalls permit
authorized users to access and transmit privileged information and
deny access to unauthorized users.  Several large commercial vendors
have developed firewall applications which Defense is using and
tailoring for specific organizations' computing and communications
needs and environments.  Like any technology, firewalls are not
perfect; hackers have successfully circumvented them in the past. 
They should not be an installation's sole means of defense, but
should be used in conjunction with the other technical, physical, and
administrative solutions discussed in this chapter. 

Many other technologies exist and are being developed today which
DISA, NSA, and the military services are using and considering for
future use.  These include automated biometrics systems which examine
an individual's physiological or behavioral traits and use that
information to identify an individual.  Biometrics systems are
available today, and are being refined for future applications, that
examine fingerprints, retina patterns, voice patterns, signatures,
and keystroke patterns.  In addition, a technology in development
called location-based authentication may help thwart attackers by
pinpointing their location.  This technology determines the actual
geographic location of a user attempting to access a system.  For
example, if developed and implemented as planned, it could prevent a
hacker in a foreign country, pretending to come from a military
installation in the United States, from logging into a Defense
system. 

These technical products show promise in protecting Defense systems
and information from unauthorized users.  However, they are
expensive--firewalls can cost from $5,000 to $40,000 for each
Internet access point,\5 and Fortezza cards and related support could
cost about $300 for each computer.\6 They also require consistent and
departmentwide implementation to be successful; continued development
to enhance their utility; and usage by personnel who have the
requisite skills and training to appropriately use them.  Once again,
no single technical solution is foolproof and, thus, combinations of
protective mechanisms should be used.  Decisions on which mechanisms
to use should be based on an assessment of threat, the sensitivity of
the information to be protected, and the cost of protection.

\2 Data encryption is the transformation of original text (also known
as plaintext or cleartext) into unintelligible text (also called
ciphertext) to help maintain the secrecy and integrity of the data. 

\3 Authentication is the process of proving that a user or system is
really who or what it claims to be.  It protects against the
fraudulent use of a system or the fraudulent transmission of
information. 

\4 The Defense Message System will replace Defense's current e-mail
and record message systems with a single, common electronic messaging
system.  It will add important features to Defense's current system
such as multiple levels of security, message traceability, electronic
signatures, and firewalls. 

\5 Although there are no comprehensive estimates of the number of
Internet access points, it is probably in the thousands.

workstations. 


   DEFENSE'S INCIDENT RESPONSE
   CAPABILITY IS LIMITED
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 3:5

Because absolute security is not possible and some attacks will
succeed, an aggressive incident response capability is a key element
of a good security program.  Defense has several organizations whose
primary mission is incident response, i.e.  the ability to quickly
detecting and reacting to computer attacks.  These
organizations--DISA's Center for Information Systems Security,
ASSIST, and the military service teams--as discussed previously in
this chapter provide network monitoring and incident response
services to military installations.  The AFIWC, with its Computer
Emergency Response Team and Countermeasures Engineering Team, was
established in 1993 and has considerably greater experience and
capability than the other military services.  Recognizing the need
for more incident response capability, the Navy established the FIWC
in 1995, and the Army established its LIWA this year.  However, these
organizations are not all fully staffed and do not have the
capability to respond to all reported incidents, much less the
incidents not reported.  For example, when the FIWC was established
last year, 30 personnel slots were requested, but only 3 were
granted.  Similarly, the LIWA is just beginning to build its
capability. 

Rapid detection and reaction capabilities are essential to effective
incident response.  Defense is installing devices at numerous
military sites to automatically monitor attacks on its computer
systems.  For example, the Air Force has a project underway called
Automated Security Incident Measurement (ASIM) which is designed to
measure the level of unauthorized activity against its systems. 
Under this project, several automated tools are used to examine
network activity and detect and identify unusual network events, for
example, Internet addresses not normally expected to access Defense
computers.  These tools have been installed at only 36 of the 108 Air
Force installations around the world.  Selection of these
installations was based on the sensitivity of the information, known
system vulnerabilities, and past hacker activity.  Data from the ASIM
is analyzed by personnel responsible for securing the installation's
network.  Data is also centrally analyzed at the AFIWC in San
Antonio, Texas. 

Air Force officials at AFIWC and at Rome Laboratory told us that ASIM
has been extremely useful in detecting attacks on Air Force systems. 
They added, however, that as currently configured, ASIM information
is only accumulated and automatically analyzed nightly.  As a result,
a delay occurs between the time an incident occurs and the time when
ASIM provides information on the incident.  They also stated that
ASIM is currently configured for selected operating systems and,
therefore, cannot detect activity on all Air Force computer systems. 
They added that they plan to continue refining the ASIM to broaden
its use for other Air Force operating systems and enhance its ability
to provide data on unauthorized activity more quickly.  AFIWC
officials believe that a well-publicized detection and reaction
capability can be a successful deterrent to would-be attackers. 

The Army and Navy are also developing similar devices, but they have
been implemented in only a few locations.  The Army's system, known
as Automated Intrusion Monitoring System (AIMS), has been in
development since June 1995, and is intended to provide both a local
and theater-level monitoring of computer attacks.  Currently, AIMS is
installed at the Army's 5th Signal Command in Worms, Germany and will
be used to monitor Army computers scattered throughout Europe. 

DISA officials told us that although the services' automated
detection devices are good tools, they need to be refined to allow
Defense to detect unauthorized activity as it is occurring.  DISA's
Defensive Information Warfare Management Plan provides information on
new or improved technology and programs planned for the next 1 to 5
years.  These efforts included a more powerful intrusion detection
and monitoring program, a malicious code detection and eradication
program, and a program for protecting Defense's vast information
infrastructure.  These programs, if developed and implemented as
planned, should enhance Defense's ability to protect and react to
attacks on its computer systems. 


CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND
AGENCY COMMENTS AND OUR EVALUATION
======================================================= Chapter 4


   CONCLUSIONS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 4:1

Networked computer systems offer tremendous potential for
streamlining and improving the efficiency of Defense operations. 
However, they also greatly increase the risks that information
systems supporting critical Defense functions will be attacked.  The
hundreds of thousands of attacks that Defense has already experienced
demonstrate that (1) significant damage can be incurred by attackers
and (2) attacks pose serious risks to national security.  They also
show that top management attention at all levels and clearly assigned
accountability are needed to ensure that computer systems are better
protected.  The need for such attention and accountability is
supported by the Joint Security Commission which considers the
security of information systems and networks to be the major security
challenge of this decade and possibly the next century.  The
Commission itself believes there is insufficient awareness of the
grave risks Defense faces in this arena. 

We recognize that no organization can anticipate all potential
vulnerabilities, and even if one could, it may not be cost-effective
to implement every measure available to ensure protection.  However,
Defense can take some basic steps to vastly improve its position
against attackers.  These steps include strengthening (1) computer
security policies and procedures, (2) security training and staffing,
and (3) detection and reaction programs.  Since the level of
protection varies from installation-to-installation, the need for
corrective measures should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by
comparing the value and sensitivity of information with the cost of
protecting it and by considering the entire infrastructure. 


   RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 4:2

To better focus management attention on the Department's increasing
computer security threat and to ensure that a higher priority and
sufficient resources are devoted to addressing this problem, we
recommend that at a minimum the Secretary of Defense strengthen the
Department's information systems security program by

  -- developing departmentwide policies for preventing, detecting,
     and responding to attacks on Defense information systems,
     including mandating that (1) all security incidents be reported
     within the Department, (2) risk assessments be performed
     routinely to determine vulnerability to attacks and intrusions,
     (3) vulnerabilities and deficiencies be expeditiously corrected
     as they are identified, and (4) damage from intrusions be
     expeditiously assessed to ensure the integrity of data and
     systems compromised;

  -- requiring the military services and Defense agencies to use
     training and other mechanisms to increase awareness and
     accountability among installation commanders and all personnel
     as to the security risks of computer systems connected to the
     Internet and their responsibility for securing their systems;

  -- requiring information system security officers at all
     installations and setting specific standards for ensuring that
     these as well as system and network managers are given
     sufficient time and training to perform their duties
     appropriately;

  -- continually developing and cost-effectively using departmentwide
     network monitoring and protection technologies; and

  -- evaluating the incident response capabilities within DISA, the
     military services, and the Defense agencies to ensure that they
     are sufficient to handle the projected threat. 

The Secretary should also assign clear responsibility and
accountability within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the
military services, and Defense agencies for ensuring the successful
implementation of this computer security program. 


   AGENCY COMMENTS AND OUR
   EVALUATION
---------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 4:3

On May 15, 1996, we discussed a draft of this report with officials
from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, DISA, Army, Navy, and
Air Force who are responsible for information systems security.  In
general, these officials agreed with the report's findings,
conclusions, and recommendations.  They stated that the report fairly
represents the increasing threat of Internet attacks on the
Department's computers and networks and acknowledges the actions
Defense is taking to address that threat.  In concurring with our
conclusions and recommendations, Defense officials acknowledged that
with increased emphasis and additional resources, more could be done
to better protect their systems from attack and to effectively detect
and aggressively respond to attacks.  They stressed that
accountability throughout the Department for implementing policy was
as important as the policy itself and that cost-effective technology
solutions should be encouraged, particularly in light of the
increasing sophistication of the future threat. 

Defense officials believe that a large part of the Department's
security problems result from poorly designed systems or the use of
commercial off-the-shelf computer hardware and software products that
have little or no inherent security.  We agree that this is a serious
problem.  They also cited some of the more recent actions being taken
to improve security, such as DISA's information systems security
implementation plan and the Joint Chiefs of Staff instruction on
defensive information warfare.  These are positive steps that will
help focus attention on the importance of information security.  In
this context, it is important that our recommendations be effectively
implemented to ensure that sufficient management commitment,
accountability, priority, and resources are devoted to addressing
Defense's serious information security problems. 

We have incorporated the Department's comments and other points of
clarification throughout the report where appropriate.

08 November 1996<BR>
<BR>
(From RISKS Forum)<BR>
Date: Wed, 6 Nov 1996 16:45:52 -0500<BR>
From: Bruce Schneier <schneier@counterpane.com><BR>


<P>From e-mail to cellular communications, from secure Web access to digital
cash, cryptography is an essential part of today's information systems.
Cryptography helps provide accountability, fairness, accuracy, and
confidentiality.  It can prevent fraud in electronic commerce and assure the
validity of financial transactions.  Used properly, it protects your
anonymity and prove your identity.  It can keep vandals from altering your
Web page and prevent industrial competitors from reading your confidential
documents.  And in the future, as commerce and communications continue to
move to computer networks, cryptography will become more and more vital.

<P>But the cryptography now on the market doesn't provide the level of security
it advertises.  Most systems are designed and implemented not by
cryptographers, but by engineers who think cryptography is like any other
computer technology.  It's not.  You can't make systems secure by tacking on
cryptography as an afterthought.  You have to know what you are doing every
step of the way, from conception through installation.

<P>Billions of dollars are spent on computer security, and most of it wasted on
insecure products.  After all, weak cryptography looks the same on the shelf
as strong cryptography.  Two e-mail encryption products may have almost the
same user interface, yet one is secure while the other permits
eavesdropping.  A feature comparison chart may suggest that two programs
have similar features, although one has gaping security holes that the other
doesn't.  An experienced cryptographer can tell the difference.  So can a
thief.

<P>Present-day computer security is a house of cards; it may stand for now,
but it can't last.  Many insecure products have not yet been broken because
they are still in their infancy.  But as these products become more and
more widely used, they will become tempting targets for criminals.  The
press will publicize the attacks, undermining public confidence in these
systems.  Ultimately, products will win or lose in the marketplace
depending on the strength of their security.

<P><B>Threats to computer systems</B>

<P>Every form of commerce ever invented has been subject to fraud, from rigged
scales in a farmers' market to counterfeit currency to phony invoices.
Electronic commerce schemes will also face fraud, through forgery,
misrepresentation, denial of service, and cheating.  You can't walk the
streets wearing a mask of someone else's face, but in the digital world it
is easy to impersonate others.  In fact, computerization makes the risks
even greater, by allowing automated and systematic attacks that are
impossible against non-automated systems.  A thief can make a living
skimming a penny from every Visa cardholder.  Only strong cryptography can
protect against these attacks.

<P>Privacy violations are another threat.  Some attacks on privacy are
targeted: a member of the press tries to read a public figure's e-mail, or a
company tries to intercept a competitor's communications.  Others are broad
data-harvesting attacks, searching a sea of data for interesting
information: a list of rich widows, AZT users, or people who view a
particular Web page.

<P>Electronic vandalism is an increasingly serious problem. Already computer
vandals have graffitied the CIA's web page, mail-bombed Internet providers,
and canceled thousands of newsgroup messages.  And of course, vandals and
thieves routinely break into networked computer systems.  When security
safeguards aren't adequate, trespassers run little risk of getting caught.
Attackers don't follow rules.  They can attack a system using techniques not
anticipated by the original designers they cheat.  In California, art
thieves burgle homes by cutting through the walls with a chain saw.
Sophisticated, expensive home security systems don't stand a chance against
this sort of attack.

<P>Computer thieves come through the walls too.  They steal technical data,
bribe insiders, modify software, and collude.  They take advantage of
technologies newer than the system, and even invent new mathematics to
attack the system with.

<P>Attackers also have more time; it's unusual for a good guy to disassemble
and examine a public system.  SecurID stayed around for years before anyone
looked at their key management, and they didn't even strip their binaries.
And the odds favor the attacker: defenders have to protect against every
possible vulnerability, but an attacker only has to find one security flaw
to compromise the whole system.

<P><B>What cryptography can and can't do</B>

<P>No one can guarantee 100% security.  But we can work toward 100% risk
acceptance.  Fraud exists in current commerce systems: cash can be
counterfeited, checks altered, credit card numbers stolen.  Yet these
systems are still successful because the benefits and conveniences outweigh
the losses.  Privacy systems-wall safes, door locks, curtains-are not
perfect, but they're often good enough.  A good cryptographic system strikes
a balance between what is possible and what is acceptable.

<P>Strong cryptography can successfully withstand targeted attacks up to a
point-the point at which it becomes easier to get the information some other
way.  A computer encryption program, no matter how good, will not prevent an
attacker from going through someone's garbage.  But it can absolutely
prevent data-harvesting attacks; no attacker can go through enough trash to
find every AZT user in the country.

<P>The good news about cryptography is that we already have the algorithms and
protocols we need to secure our systems.  The bad news is that that was the
easy part; successful implementation requires considerable expertise. The
areas of security that interact with people-key management, human/computer
interface security, access control-often defy analysis.  And the disciplines
of public-key infrastructure, software security, computer security, network
security, and tamper-resistant hardware design are very poorly understood.

<P>Companies often get the easy part wrong and implement insecure algorithms
and protocols.  But even so, practical cryptography is rarely broken through
the mathematics; other parts of systems are much easier to break.  The best
protocol ever invented can fall to an easy attack if no one pays attention
to the more complex and subtle implementation issues.  Netscape's security
fell to a bug in the random-number generator.  Flaws can be anywhere: the
threat model, the system design, the software or hardware implementation,
the system management.  Security is a chain, and a single weak link can
break the entire system.  Fatal bugs may be far removed from the security
portion of the software; a design decision that has nothing to do with
security can nonetheless create a security flaw.

<P>Once you find a security flaw, you can fix it.  But finding the flaws to
begin with can be incredibly difficult.  Security is different from any
other design requirement, because functionality does not equal quality.  If
a word processor prints successfully, you know that the print function
works.  Security is different; just because a safe recognizes the correct
combination does not mean that its contents are secure from a safecracker.
No amount of general beta testing will reveal a security flaw, and there's
no test possible that can prove the absence of flaws.

<P><B>Threat models</B>

<P>A good design starts with a threat model: what the system is designed to
protect, from whom, and for how long?  The threat model must take the entire
system into account: not just the data to be protected, but the people who
will use the system and how they will use it What motivates the attackers?
What kinds of abuses can be tolerated?  Must attacks be prevented, or can
they just be detected?  If the worst happens and one of the fundamental
security assumptions of a system is broken, what kind of disaster recovery
is possible?  The answers to these questions can't be standardized; they're
different for every system.  Too often, designers don't take the time to
build accurate threat models or analyze the real risks.

<P>Threat models allow both product designers and consumers to determine what
security measures they need.  Does it makes sense to encrypt your hard drive
if you don't put your files in a safe?  How can someone inside the company
defraud the commerce system?  What exactly is the cost of defeating the
tamper-resistance on the smart card?  You can't design a secure system
unless you understand what it has to be secure against.

<P><B>System design</B>

<P>System design should only begin after you understand the threat model.  This
design work is the mainstay of the science of cryptography, and it is very
specialized.  Cryptography blends several areas of mathematics: number
theory, complexity theory, information theory, probability theory, abstract
algebra, and formal analysis, among others.  Few can do the science
properly, and a little knowledge is a dangerous thing: inexperienced
cryptographers almost always design flawed systems.  Good cryptographers
know that nothing substitutes for extensive peer review and years of
analysis.  Quality systems use published and well-understood algorithms and
protocols; to use unpublished or unproven elements in a design is risky at
best.

<P>Cryptographic system design is also an art.  A designer must strike a
balance between security and accessibility, anonymity and accountability,
privacy and availability.  Science alone cannot prove security; only
experience, and the intuition born of experience, can help the cryptographer
design secure systems and find flaws in existing designs.

<P>Good security systems are made up of small, verifiable (and verified!)
chunks, each of which provides some service that clearly reduces to a
primitive, such as the difficulty of forging a certain hash function.  There
are a lot of big systems out there (DCE, for example) which are just too big
to verify in a reasonable amount of time.

<P><B>Implementation</B>

<P>There is an enormous difference between a mathematical algorithm and its
concrete implementation in hardware or software.  Cryptographic system
designs are fragile.  Just because a protocol is logically secure doesn't
mean it will stay secure when a designer starts defining message structures
and passing bits around.  Close isn't close enough; these systems must be
implemented exactly, perfectly, or they will fail.  A poorly-designed user
interface can make a hard-drive encryption program completely insecure.  A
bad clock interface can leave a gaping hole in a communications security
program.  A false reliance on tamper-resistant hardware can render an
electronic commerce system all but useless.  Since these mistakes aren't
apparent in testing, they end up in finished products.

<P>Implementers are under pressure from budgets and deadlines.  They make the
same mistakes over and over again, in many different products.  They use bad
random-number generators, don't check properly for error conditions, and
leave secret information in swap files.  Many of these flaws cannot be
studied in the scientific literature because they are not technically
interesting. The only way to learn how to prevent these flaws is to make and
break systems, again and again.

<P><B>Procedures and management</B>

<P>In the end, many security systems are broken by the people who use them;
most fraud against commerce systems is perpetrated by insiders.  Honest
users cause problems too, because they usually don't care about security.
They want simplicity, convenience, and compatibility with existing
(insecure) systems.  They choose bad passwords, write them down, give
friends and relatives their private keys, leave computers logged in, and so
on.  It's hard to sell door locks to people who don't want to be bothered
with keys.  A well-designed system must take people into account, and people
are often the hardest factor to design around.

<P>This is where you find the real cost of security.  It's not in the
algorithms; strong cryptography is no more expensive than weak cryptography.
It's not even in the design or the implementation; a good system, while
expensive to build and verify, is far cheaper than the losses from an
insecure system.  The cost is in getting people to use it.  It's hard to
convince consumers that their financial privacy is important when they are
willing to leave a detailed purchase record in exchange for one thousandth
of a free trip to Hawaii.  It's hard to build a system that provides strong
authentication on top of systems that can be penetrated by knowing someone's
mother's maiden name.  Security is routinely bypassed by store clerks,
seniortop executives, and anyone else who just needs to get the job done.

<P>Even when users do understand the need for strong security, they have no way
of comparing systems.  Computer magazines compare security products by
listing their features, not by evaluating their security.  Marketing
literature makes claims that are just not true; a competing product that is
more secure and more expensive will only fare worse in the market.  People
rely on the government to look out for their safety and security in areas
where they lack the knowledge to make evaluations-food packaging, aviation,
medicine.  For cryptography, the U.S. government is doing just the opposite.

<P><B>Tomorrow's problems</B>

<P>When an airplane crashes, there are inquiries, analyses, and reports.
Information is widely disseminated, and everyone learns from the failure.
You can read a complete record of airline accidents from the beginning of
commercial aviation.  When a bank's electronic commerce system is breached
and defrauded, it's usually covered up.  If it does make the newspapers,
details are omitted.  No one analyzes the attack; no one learns from the
mistake.  The bank tries to patch things in secret, hoping that the public
won't lose confidence in a system that deserves no confidence.

<P>It's no longer good enough to install security patches in response to
attacks.  Computer systems move too quickly; a security flaw described on
the Internet can be exploited by thousands in a day. Today's systems must
anticipate future attacks.  Any comprehensive system-whether for
authenticated communications, secure data storage, or electronic commerce-is
likely to remain in use for five years or more.  To remain secure, it must
be able to withstand the future: smarter attackers, more computational
power, and greater incentives to subvert a widespread system.  There won't
be time to upgrade them in the field.

<P>History has taught us: never underestimate the amount of money, time, and
effort someone will expend to thwart a security system.  Use orthogonal
defense systems: different ways of doing the same thing.  Secure
authentication might mean digital signatures on the desktop, SSL protecting
the incoming transmission, and IPsec from the firewall to the back end,
along with multiple audit points along the way for recovery and evidence.
Breaking parts of it gives an attacker a wedge, but doesn't cause the whole
system to collapse.

<P>It's always better to assume the worst.  Assume your adversaries are better
than they are.  Assume science and technology will soon be able to do things
they cannot yet. Give yourself a margin for error.  Give yourself more
security than you need today.  When the unexpected happens, you'll be glad
you did.

Report Reference: http://www.security.mci.net<BR>
     White Paper: Potential Denial<BR>
     of Service Attacks at Internet<BR>
     Service 	Providers (ISPs)<BR>

      <B>ABSTRAC</B>T<BR>

<P>There are two types of potential denial of service attacks at internet
service providers (ISPs) that are targeted at end hosts and routers.

<P> 	TCP SYN attack: A sender transmits a volume of connections that cannot
be completed. This causes the connection queues to fill up,therby denying
service to legitimate TCP users.

<P>  	UDP diagnostic port attack: A sender transmits a volume of requests=
for UDP diagnostic services on the router which causes all CPU resources to be
consumed servicing the phony requests.

<P>This paper contains a technical description of the potential attacks and
methods for using the Cisco IOS to defend against them.

<P><B>PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS</B>
<P>The TCP SYN attack:

<P>When a normal TCP connection starts, a destination host receives a SYN
(synchronize/start) packet from a source host and sends back a SYN ACK
(synchronize acknowledge). The destination host must hear an ACK of the SYN
ACK, and then the connection is established. This is referred to as the "TCP
three-way handshake."

<P>While waiting for the ACK to the SYN ACK, a connection queue of finite size
on the destination host keeps track of connections waiting to be completed.
This queue typically empties quickly since the ACK usually arrives a few
milliseconds after the SYN ACK.

<P>The TCP SYN attack exploits this design by having an attacking source host
generate TCP SYN packets with random source addresses at a victim host. The
victim destination host sends a SYN ACK back to the random source address
and adds an entry to the connection queue. Since the SYN ACK is destined for
an incorrect or non-existent host, the last part of the "three-way
handshake" is never completed and the entry remains in the connection queue
until a timer expires, typically for about one minute. By generating phony
TCP SYN packets from random IP addresses at a rapid rate, it is possible to
fill up the connection queue and deny TCP services to legitimate users.

<P>There is no easy way to trace the originator of the attack because the IP
address of the source is phony.

<P>The external manifestations of the problem include inability to get mail,
inability to attach to WWW services, or a large number of TCP connections on
your host in the state SYN_RCVD.

<P>The UDP diagnostic port attack:

<P>By default, the Cisco router has a series of diagnostic ports enabled for
certain UDP and TCP services including echo, chargen, and discard. When a
host attaches to those ports, a small amount of CPU is consumed to service
these requests.

<P>If a single attacking device sends a large barrage of requests with
different, random phony source IP addresses, it is possible that the Cisco
router can become overwhelmed and slow down or fail.  

<P>The external manifestation of the problem includes a process table full
error message (%SYS-3-NOPROC) or a very high CPU utilization. The exec
command show process will show a lot of processes with the same name, for
example, "UDP Echo."

<P><B>DEFENDING AGAINST ATTACKS DIRECTLY TO THE ROUTER</B>

<P>Disabling UDP Diagnostic Ports
<P>Any router not already protected behind a firewall or not using the small
servers (diagnostic services) should disable UCP and TCP diagnostic
services. This can be accomplished by using the global configuration=
 commands:</P>

no service udp-small-servers<BR>
no service tcp-small-servers<BR>

<P>See the appendix for further information on these commands.
Discarding Packets from Unfriendly Source Addresses

<P>Both the TCP SYN attack and UDP diagnostic port attack are characterized by
an influx of packets from random source addresses. One defense for both
types of attacks against the router is to program the router to only allow
packets from "friendly" source addresses on interfaces that are exposed to
the Internet or other unsecured locations. This provides a defense against
random attacks, but still leaves a vulnerability to targeted attacks by
hackers who know "trusted" addresses. Another variation of this defense is
to deny all packets destined to the routers address on exposed interfaces.
The latter defense is possible only if no dynamic routing protocols are
employed.

<P>Example: If interface Serial 0/1 were facing the Internet with an address
of 172.16.10.13, and had BGP peers with addresses 172.16.10.23 and
172.16.10.66, the following configuration would deny all packets from any
other address:</P>
<BR>
	interface serial 0/1<BR>
	ip address 172.16.10.13<BR>
	ip access-group 103 in<BR>
<BR>
	access-list 103 permit ip 172.16.10.23 0.0.0.0 172.16.10.13 0.0.0.0<BR>
	access-list 103 permit ip 172.16.10.66 0.0.0.0 172.16.10.13 0.0.0.0<BR>
	access-list 103 deny ip any 172.16.10.13 0.0.0.0 log *<BR>
        access-list 103 permit ip any any<BR>

<P>*Note: the log option is only needed if tracking of source addresses
attempting to access the router is desired.

<P><B>DEFENDING AGAINST ATTACKS TO HOSTS</B>

<P>Defending against attacks to hosts is a more difficult undertaking.
Filtering on routers is simple since only a few select hosts should be
accessing the router. However, in the case of a web server or mail server
facing the Internet, there is no way to determine which addresses are
legitimate. Therefore, there is no clear cut defense against such an attack.
Several options are available to hosts. You can:</P>

  	Increase the size of the connection queue (SYN ACK queue).<BR>
  	Decrease the time-out waiting for the three-way handshake.<BR>
  	Employ vendor software patches to detect and circumvent the problem (if
        available).<BR>

<P>You should contact your host vendor to see if they have created specific
patches to address the TCP SYN ACK attack.

<P>Filtering is ineffective since the IP addresses vary, and may or may not be
addresses of legitimate hosts.

<P><B>PREVENTING THE NETWORK FROM UNWITTINGLY HOSTING AN ATTACK</B>

<P>Since a primary mechanism of denial of service attacks is the generation of
traffic sourced from random IP addresses, we recommend filtering traffic
destined for the Internet. The basic concept is to throw away packets with
invalid source IP addresses as they enter the Internet. This does not
prevent the denial of service attack on your network, but will help attacked
parties rule out your location as the source of the attacker. In addition,
it prevents the use of your network for this class of attacks.

<P>Preventing Transmission of Invalid IP Addresses

<P>By filtering packets on your routers that connect your network to the
Internet, you can permit only packets with valid source IP addresses to
leave your network and get into the Internet.

<P>For example, if your network consists of network 172.16.0.0, and your
router connects to your ISP using a FDDI0/1 interface, you can apply the
access-list as follows:</P>
<PRE>
  access-list 111 permit ip 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 any
  access-list 111 deny ip any any log *

  interface Fddi 0/1
  ip access-group 111 out
</PRE>
<P>* Note: The last line of the access-list determines if there is any traffic
with an invalid source address entering the Internet. It is not crucial to
have this line, but it will help locating the source of the possible attacks.

<P>Preventing Reception of Invalid IP Addresses

<P>For ISPs who provide service to end networks, we highly recommend that you
validate incoming packets from your clients. This means that you will have
to use inbound packet filters on your border routers. This can be done by
using an incoming access-list.

<P>For example, if your clients have the following network numbers connected
to your router via a FDDI interface named "FDDI 1/0", you can create the
following access-list:

<P>The network numbers are 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.15.0, and 172.18.0.0</P>
<PRE>
   access-list 111 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.15.255 any
   access-list 111 permit ip 172.18.0.0 0.0.255.255 any
   access-list 111 deny ip any any log

   interface Fddi 1/0
   ip access-group 111 in
</PRE>
<P>Note: The last line of the access-list determines if there is any traffic
with invalid source address entering the Internet. It is not crucial to have
this line, but it will help locate the source of the possible attack.=20

<P><B>APPENDIX: DESCRIPTION OF SMALL SERVERS</B>

<P>The small servers are servers (daemons, in Unix parlance) running in the
router which are useful for diagnostics. Therefore, they are on by default.

<P>The commands for the TCP and UDP small servers are:</P>

service tcp-small-servers<BR>
service udp-small-servers<BR>

<P>If you do not want your router to provide any non-routing services, you can
turn them off (using the no form of the above commands).

<P>The TCP small servers are:

  	<P>Echo: Echoes back whatever you type. Type the command telnet x.x.x.x
        echo to see.
  	<P>Chargen: Generates a stream of ASCII data. Type the command telnet
        x.x.x.x chargen to see.
  	<P>Discard: Throws away whatever you type. Type the command telnet x.x.x.x
        discard to see.
  	<P>Daytime: Returns system date and time, if correct. It is correct if you
        are running NTP or have set the date and time manually from the exec
level.


<P>Type the command telnet x.x.x.x daytime to see.

<P>The UDP small servers are:</P>

  	Echo: Echoes the payload of the datagram you send.<BR>
  	Discard: Silently pitches the datagram you send.<BR>
  	Chargen: Pitches the datagram you send and responds with a 72 character
        string of ASCII characters terminated with a CR+LF.<BR>

<P>Notes:

       <P>Almost all UNIX boxes support the small servers listed above.
       The router also offers finger service and async line bootp service,
       which can be independently turned off with the configuration global 
       commands "no service finger" and "no ip bootp server", respectively.



     <P>  Other protective measures would include using ACLs to restrict
       SNMP access to the router itself, and disabling SNMP WRITE access -
       as its UDP based and can be spoofed easily.  ACLs should also be
       deployed to protect TELNET access to the routers VTYs, and it is
       recommended to use an enhanced authentication protocal, like XTACACS
       or TACACS+, to authenticate individual users, rather than just a
password.

  <P>     In addition, it is also advisable to make use of the "service config-
       encryption" to protect passwords stored in the router configuration.</P>

Re:	[NSA] SYN Flooding [info]<BR>
<BR>
<P>[Below we have a software tool that will recognize SYN floods and correct
the problem.]

<P><B>Possible solution to SYN Flooding attacks</B>


<P>The attack is on!  Both 2600 and Phrack, 2 of the biggest well-known
underground hacking magazines, have posted exploit code to do one of the
nastiest denial of service attacks that the Internet has seen so far. 
Hundreds of people have access to these programs to bring down services on
the Internet.  Many of these people are targeting their attacks at various
organizations such as ISP.  Panix, an ISP, has been under attack for quite
a few days now and they have not been able to receive email. Many other
ISPs are suffering from the SYN flood attack.  This attack is being
discussed on many mailing lists, newsgroups, and Thursday's Wall Street
Journal (9/12/96).  Fortunately a solution already exists as we discuss
below.

<P>Everyone connected to the Internet relies on TCP/IP.  When you establish a
connection with TCP, you do a 3-way handshake.  The connecting host sends
a SYN packet to the receiving host.  The receiving host sends a SYN|ACK
packet back and to fully establish a connection, the connecting host
finally responds with an ACK packet. 

<P>In a SYN flood attack, an attacker host sends many SYN packets and does
not respond with an ACK to the SYN|ACK's.  As the receiving host is
waiting for more and more ACK's, the buffer queue will fill up and the
receiving machine can no longer accepts legitimate connections. This means
that attackers can block your email, web, or any other service you are
providing on the Internet. 

<P>To even make this attack worse, the code exploiting the problem randomizes
the source address of the attacking host.  Thus, the receiving machine
gets packets that appear to be from all over the Internet, hiding the
location of the attacker. 

<P><B>Solution</B>

<P>There are several things we can do to stop these attacks from being
effective. 

<P>With the routers for most ISP, they should be blocking any non-internal
addresses from leaving their network and going to the Internet. This will
stop an attacker if their ISP implements this.  Unfortunately, this does
not stop an attack from areas on the Internet that do not block that. But
at least the ISP can feel comfortable to know that an attacker can not
launch his attack from that ISP. 

<P>Here are two methods of helping eliminate the problem.  Some of the
exploit code I have seen does not pick a random source port.  It would be
easy to block the attack with a router denying any packets coming from a
specific source port. This may not be too effective because of the trivial
nature of adding code to randomize the source port, sequence number,
source address, and TTL.  But it might help you temporarily if you notice
the attacks have any pattern that can be blocked by router rules. 

<P>Another way to fix this is to set the kernel maximum number of half open
connections allowed (SO_MAXCONN) to a higher number than the default value.
We have a tool that will look for SYN packets that do not get followed with
ACK and clean the half open connections by sending a RST packet.  This 
unclogs the port and allows legitimate connections to happen.  This tool
is called RealSecure (tm).  To obtain a copy of the RealSecure tool,
send email to majordomo@Iss.net and within the body of the message, type: 

<P>	subscribe realsecure

<P>RealSecure (tm) is a comprehensive attack recognition and real time response
tool that ISS is alpha testing and will expire in 60 days.</P>

<CENTER>		 Savvy Hacker Tangles         Web For Net Host</CENTER>
<BR>
Dow Jones  9/12/96  6:01 AM<BR>
<BR>
   By Bart Ziegler<BR>
   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal<BR>
<P> A pioneering Internet-access provider that hosts almost a thousand corporate
Web sites has been virtually shut down since late last week by a computer hacker
bombarding the service's computers with requests to send information.
<P>  The attacks, which have lasted more than a day at a time, have rendered almost
defenseless the small New York company, Public Access Networks Corp., or Panix.
They also underscore a key vulnerability of the Internet. "This is the first
major attack of a kind that I believe to be the final Internet security
problem," says William Cheswick, an Internet security expert at the Bell
Laboratories unit of Lucent Technologies Inc. "We're going to see a lot more of
this," he predicts.
<P>  The hacker invasion began late Friday afternoon and went on almost constantly
through Sunday afternoon. Then it mysteriously subsided -- only to resume in the
predawn hours of Monday morning. The attacks, which were still continuing
yesterday, forced shutdowns that let up only intermittently, and even then only
because the hacker temporarily halted his efforts.
<P>  "We could be out of business a week from now if this keeps up -- there's no
way to fight it," says Alexis Rosen, co-founder and majority owner of the
closely held company.
<P>  Among the Web sites Panix hosts are those of the Wilhelmina modeling agency,
the Miss America pageant and a Mercedes dealer network. The unknown intruder has
alternately invaded Panix computers that control pages on the World Wide Web,
others that store electronic-mail, and still other machines that link Internet
addresses to Panix subscribers, blocking them from receiving any communications.
<P>  In effect, the hacker's method is similar to campaigns used by some activist
groups to flood a politician's switchboard with phone calls. So much time is
spent sorting out the bogus calls -- in this case, the hacker's false requests
for an electronic "handshake" with Panix machines -- that the legitimate ones
can't get through.
<P>  The hacker has been sending up to 150 requests a second to Panix's computers,
seeking to establish a connection to send or receive information. The requests,
presumably generated by a malicious computer program, contain fake Internet
addresses, which Panix's computers must sort out before they can discard them.
The computers have choked under the deluge, preventing them from handling
legitimate requests from Internet users for access to the World Wide Web sites
that Panix hosts or to send electronic mail to Panix's more than 6,000
individual users.
<P>  Panix is trying to find the source of the attack by working backward through
the labyrinthine network of phone lines and specialized "router" computers that
form the Internet. But Mr. Rosen and Mr. Cheswick say there is no easy way to
trace such hackers.
<P>  "This is new enough, and the technical expertise is scarce enough, that it is
going to be hard to muster [the resources to do tracing] for a while," says Mr.
Cheswick, who is on-site at Panix's Manhattan offices trying to help fix the
trouble.
 <P> As to who might be targeting Panix, the firm's Mr. Rosen speculated it could
be someone upset by the fact that the company hosts, free, the Web site of
Voters Telecommunications Watch, a group that advocates free speech on the
Internet. "We've always tried to lead the way to being a good citizen on the Net
and there are people who don't like that," Mr. Rosen says. On the other hand,
says Bell Labs' Mr. Cheswick, "It could have been a seventh-grader who feels
slighted" by Panix for some reason.</P>

<P>   Three years ago Panix was the victim of another attack when an intruder
obtained high-level electronic access to its computers, forcing the service to
shut down for three days. The invader stole passwords of Panix subscribers that
could be used to gain access to other computer networks.
<P>  Mr. Cheswick says he "has been waiting" for an attack like the current one so
he could study it, since it exploits one of the big remaining holes in Internet
security. In fact, when Mr. Cheswick co-authored a book on Internet security a
few years ago, at the last minute, he says, he removed a section on this type of
assault for fear of tipping off hackers. While there have been a few previous
reports of such incidents, the Panix episode is the most severe, he says.
 <P> Internet computers have no quick way of distinguishing a bogus request for
information from a real one, Mr. Cheswick says. While upgrades to the software
controlling these computers could ease the problem, hackers could respond with
even more intensive attacks.
<P>  "There's going to be the usual arms race" between better security measures and
hackers, Mr. Cheswick predicts.

<P>  NEW YORK -- Where did that computer hacker who virtually shut down an Internet
provider this week get his skills? He might have simply turned to the latest
issue of 2600 magazine, the Hacker Quarterly.
<P>  There, he'd find line-by-line instructions for creating a computer program to
inflict just such damage to an Internet service as experienced by Public Access
Networks Corp., or Panix. "It's very, very, very bad," says the article's
disclaimer -- before giving the directions.
<P>  New York-based Panix was attacked on and off for five days starting last
Friday. The unknown assailant flooded Panix's computers with requests to start
transmissions to them, a strategy that overloaded the machines and prevented
legitimate requests from getting through.
<P>  Emmanuel Goldstein, 2600's editor, defends the article as a way to point out
holes in computer security that need to be fixed. He says similar attacks have
occurred before, and that he's not even sure the hacker who attacked Panix used
2600 as a guide, since an on-line publication recently published similar
directions.
 <P> "We need to educate the community that it's very, very simple to cause massive
mayhem," says Mr. Goldstein, who publishes the magazine in Setauket, N.Y. "A lot
of companies subscribe to us so they can learn before they're victimized."
<P>  The magazine, sold in major bookstore chains, contains articles on how to use
pay phones without paying, how to get a phone line under a fake name and how to
capture computer passwords to break into systems, among others. (The magazine's
name refers to the frequency, in hertz, of a whistle that phone "phreaks" once
blew to break into phone systems.) But Mr. Goldstein denies that the intent is
to tell people how to break the law or cause damage.
<P>  Alexis Rosen, Panix's co-owner, says he supports what 2600 does even though it
may have led to the attacks that threaten his on-line business. "As a matter of
principle I don't think they [2600] should have been stopped," Mr. Rosen says.
But he adds that unlike almost every other instruction for hacking that 2600 has
published, there is no known technical defense that can be used by the victim.
<P> 2600's tactics, while bold, parallel a "central debate" in the computer
industry over how to respond to security problems, says Doug Tygar, an associate
professor at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. "On one
hand there is a point of view that you should disclose the information as widely
as possible because that's the fastest way of getting it fixed," he says. "The
other point of view is you should put a lid on it" to limit copycats.</P>

 AP Business Writer<BR>
<P>   NEW YORK (AP) -- An unscrupulous computer hacker, taking
advantage of a weakness in the construction of the Internet, has
essentially shut down an online company by bombarding it with
scores of bogus queries every second.
<P>  For nearly a week, thousands of individual and corporate
customers have been unable to log on to the worldwide computer
network using Public Access Networks Corp., New York City's first
Internet access provider.
 <P>  The small, privately owned company, known as Panix, says it may
not survive if the attack persists.
 <P>  "It means 25 people could shortly be looking for work," said
Alexis Rosen, the company's president and co-owner.
 <P>  The hacker is sending scores of requests for information each
second to computers at Panix. But the requests have fake return
addresses, which confuse the Panix computers. At the rate the fake
requests are coming, Panix is unable to handle legitimate
interactions with other computers.
 <P>  Security experts say it is one of the longest such attacks ever
seen, and highlights a problem with the Internet that many network
design engineers are familiar with but rarely discuss publicly.
<P>  Computers that provide information distributed through the
Internet operate under the general assumption that they will be
sending the information to a legitimate destination.
<P>   If the request has a fake destination, the computer becomes tied
up trying to find it. If one is not found the computer moves on to
the next task. Computers are set up to handle only a few bogus
requests simultaneously, not dozens or hundreds per second.
  <P> Experts from Lucent Technologies Inc.'s Bell Labs and the CERT
Coordination Center, a Pittsburgh-based group that responds to
Internet security troubles, are helping Panix.
<P>  But Rosen said, "There's no help to be had. This a problem
fundamental to the structure of the Internet."
<P>   The easiest solution would be for all other Internet access
companies to filter their outgoing traffic to make sure the data
has legitimate return addresses. But it could take months for
companies to agree to that and take the necessary technical steps.
<P>  "Until all people start filtering their traffic to assure there
are no forgeries in the packets, this attack can continue
unabated," Rosen said.
 <P>  "We've been batting around possible defenses," said William
Cheswick, a Bell Labs scientist. But he said any kind of computer
system can be overloaded.
  <P> "It's an arms race," he said. "A lot of the easy solutions
for dealing with the attack are looking for idiosyncrasies in it
and separating the attack (data) packets from the other ones. That
game only goes on for so long before we can't tell them apart
again."
<P>   Typically, hacker attacks on corporate computers are brief. The
length of time Panix has been under siege is especially severe. It
began last Friday, was interrupted Sunday evening but restarted
Monday.
  <P> Panix, started in 1989, has 6,000 individual subscribers and
connects over 1,000 companies to the Internet. It also hosts World
Wide Web sites for dozens of companies.
 <P>  Rosen, the technical wizard behind the service, has had little
sleep since the attacks began. "What else would I be but tired and
angry?"

<P><B>HTML report</B>
<P> Be afraid. Be very afraid. There is
 a new kind of vandalism that exploits
 the very foundation of the Internet.
 Not only is it virtually impossible to
 deflect, it could effectively shut down
 any Internet Service Provider. The
 attack, known as a SYN attack,
 hobbled New York's oldest Internet
 gateway, Public Access Networks
 (Panix.com), for the better part of the
 past week, cutting off access to its
 7,000 subscribers. 

<P>    "This is the easiest and the
 deadliest of all the spoofing attacks
 out there," says Alexis Rosen,
 Panix's cofounder. "Ultimately this
 attack cannot realistically be
 defended against unilaterally." 

<P>     The code for the SYN attack
 became public earlier this summer
 when it was posted on 2600 and
 Phrack sites. This isn't your usual
 Spammy-the-Unamailer-
 I'm-a-kewl-twelve-year-old-dude-and
 know how to send E-mail.But security
 experts such as Bill Cheswick of
 Lucent Technologies have known
 about this Achilles heel and feared
 such an attack for years. Indeed,
 when they were writing their most
 recent book on information security,
 Cheswick and his co-author omitted a
 description of the SYN attack for fear
 of tipping anyone off to it. 

<P>    "We have regretted that act," he
 told The Netly News. "The
 denial-of-service attack is one that is
 possible even after we've fixed every
 security hole you can find on the Net.
 I'd rather the good guys had known
 about this." 

 <P>   SYN takes its name from the initial
 packet that allows two machines to
 negotiate network communication.
 When you fire up a connection, your
 computer sends a SYN
 (synchronization) containing your IP
 address to the server you are trying
 to contact. The remote server then
 returns a SYNACK, or
 synchronization acknowledgement.
 Finally your machine sends back a
 final ACK, or acknowledgement, and
 the connection is established. Rosen
 compares it to a walk in the park
 where someone shouts "Hey you!"
 Not knowing where the shout
 originated, you shout back "Who
 me?" If the person replies, "Yeah,
 you," then you've established
 communication. 

 <P>    The SYN attack is Internet
 schizophrenia. By flooding the pipe
 with shouts, the spoofer creates a
 perpetual state of "Who me?" on the
 victim's server. The code sends out
 random and forged source IP
 addresses at the rate of around 50
 per second. But since the source IP is
 bogus, the victim's server, when it
 sends back a SYNACK, is left
 waiting for a response, creating a
 half-open connection to nowhere that
 lasts on average 75 seconds. Even on
 the best SUN Sparc servers the
 number of simultaneous SYNACKs
 that can be held waiting is fewer than
 10. Once those spots are filled, any
 real user who tries to connect will get
 no response. Nothing but a long wait
 until the computer gives up. 

<P>    "Any ankle biter with a Linux box
 and a modem can just run this code
 and screw things up," says Rosen.
 "When I say anybody, I mean
 anybody." 

<P>     Working around the clock since for
 five straight days, Rosen did develop
 methods to deflect the attack -- with
 plenty of help from friends like
 Cheswick and the dudes who run
 Netaxs in Philadelphia. At first the
 attacker was careless and left
 earmarks on his packets, so Rosen
 created a "kernel hack" that filtered
 out those packets. That didn't last
 long. There are other hacks that
 Rosen plans to make public, but he's
 leery of giving away any information
 that will ultimately help the attacker.
 Especially since every fix that Rosen
 developed, the attacker was
 eventually able to subvert. 

<P>    "There are lots of things you can
 do to mitigate this," says Cheswick.
 However, "Pretty much any move
 you make can be countered once the
 attacker figures out what you've
 done." 

<P>The only real solution that Rosen
     and Cheswick found involves the
     cooperation of every Internet
     Service Provider in the nation. It
     would require each ISP to create a
     database with all its users IP
     addresses. A filter could then be
     created that would allow the
     provider to screen any packets that
     originated from unregistered IP
     sources. But this is a costly fix, and
     it's hard to believe that everyone
     would be willing to comply. Large
     providers could take months to
     implement such filtering, and
     smaller providers risk toasting their
     routers by using such devices. 

<P>         Even then, how would we defend
     from a SYN attack originating in
     China or Finland? The only answer
     would be to "shun" any site that
     didn't comply with the filtering
     process. And then what happens
     when Sprint hooks up a tiny
     mom-and-pop ISP and they forget to
     filter. Suddenly the whole network
     is exposed. 

<P>         Attempts to trace the attacker
     through various routers on the
     network have been unsuccessful.
     Rosen told us that he suspects the
     attacker is using a very slow
     modem that connects to a 56kbs
     line, which is where the packets are
     bottlenecking. Had the attacker
     used a T1 or, God forbid, a T3
     "we'd all be fucked," says Rosen.
     "I would like to think that we are
     sufficiently clever that we will catch
     the guy. And if we do, I can promise
     you that he will pay for it for the
     rest of his life." 

 <P>        This is not the first vicious attack
     that Panix has suffered. The
     service's radical stances on free
     speech and spamming have earned
     them lots of enemies. "Maybe it's
     someone who could care less about
     Net politics," says Shabbir Safdar
     of Voter's Telecommunications
     Watch, whose web site was shut
     down by the attack on the eve of
     important news from Senator John
     Kerry. "I've poked through our
     kook mail from the last few months
     -- we get a lot of it -- and no one
     stands out." 

<P>         Luckily the attacks subsided
     yesterday. Had they continued,
     Rosen says his business might not
     have survived. Cheswick says that
     lawyers and law enforcement
     authorities are likely to become
     very involved in this case, since
     thousands of dollars are now at
     stake. In Cheswick's mind this is
     yet another gloomy beacon of the
     age of information warfare. 

<P>        "In the long run people will get
     more ready," says Cheswick.
     "There are bad things that will
     happen one day. We can only
     postpone them." </P>

Usenet bulletin boards wiped clean by vandals<BR>
<BR>
'Cancelbot' attacks sabotage sites used by Jews, Muslims, feminists, gays<BR>
<BR>
Published: Sept. 25, 1996<BR>
<BR>
BY RORY J. O'CONNOR<BR>
Mercury News Washington Bureau<BR>

<P>WASHINGTON -- One of the more popular mass communication forms on the
Internet was sabotaged last weekend, wiping clean dozens of public bulletin
boards with tens of thousands of messages frequented by Jews, Muslims,
feminists and gays, among others.

<P>In one of the most widespread malicious attacks on the international
computer network, a wave of so-called ''cancelbot'' programs automatically
erased copies of more than 27,000 messages from thousands of computers,
before operators stopped the damage. The identity of those responsible for
launching the apparent hate attacks -- some of the cancelbot programs were
titled ''fagcancel'' and ''kikecancel'' -- is unknown.

<P>The incident further illustrates the shaky security foundation of the
Internet, which has mushroomed from academic research tool to international
communications medium in just three years. It has raised the ire of many
Internet users over the ease with which a malicious user can erase someone
else's words from worldwide discussion groups, known as Usenet newsgroups,
in a matter of hours.

<P>''There's nothing you can do as an individual user to prevent someone from
canceling your message,'' said John Gilmore, a computer security expert in
Palo Alto. ''We need something added to Usenet's software that would only
allow a cancellation from the originator.''

<P>The incident follows closely three other well-publicized Internet attacks.
In two cases, hackers altered the World Wide Web home pages of the Justice
Department and the CIA, in apparent attempts at political protest. In the
third, a hacker overloaded the computers of an Internet service provider
called Panix with hordes of phony requests for a connection, thus denying
use of the service to legitimate users.

<P>The cancelbot attacks were launched sometime over the weekend from a variety
of Internet service providers, including UUNet Technologies in Fairfax, Va.,
and Netcom Inc. in San Jose, Calif. One attack was launched from a tiny
provider in Tulsa, Okla. called Cottage Software, according to its owner,
William Brunton.

<P>''The offending user has been terminated and the information has been turned
over to the proper (federal) authorities,'' Brunton said in a telephone
interview Wednesday. ''It's now in their hands.''

<P>Legal experts said it's unclear if the attacks constitute a crime under
federal laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

<P>''It's really a difficult issue,'' said David Sobel, legal counsel of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. ''Can you assign value
to a newsgroup posting? Because most of the computer crime statutes assume
you're ripping off something of value.''

<P>A spokesman for the FBI in Washington said he was unaware of any federal
investigation of the incident, although it is the agency's policy not to
comment on investigations.

<P>What's needed to cope with such attacks, some experts say, is a fundamental
change in the Internet that forces individual users to ''sign'' their
postings in a way that everyone has a unique identity that can't be forged.

<P>''The fatal flaw is that newsgroups were set up at a time when everybody
knew everybody using the system, and you could weed out anybody who did
this,'' Brunton said. ''This points out that flaw in the system, and that
there are unreasonable people out there who will exploit it.''

<P>While some of the deleted messages have been restored in cases where there
were backup copies, most are lost forever. The lost messages have prompted a
whole new series of messages in various newsgroups, bemoaning and discussing
the deletions.

<P><B>Newsgroups bemoan 'sad day'</B>

<P>''A sad, sad day indeed,'' one person wrote to a newsgroup on Internet
abuse. ''While some of those may not have been worth reading, each was,
nevertheless, the words and thoughts of a human being who had a right to be
heard.

<P>''Oh, there probably was not a cure for cancer in there (but there could
have been), or a cry for help (but there might have been).''

<P>The fact that a malicious user can stamp out the words of someone else is an
artifact of the original design of the Internet, begun as a Department of
Defense project in 1969.

<P>The Internet consists of tens of thousands of computers, called servers,
that act as repositories for public messages, private e-mail and World Wide
Web home pages. Servers throughout the world are interconnected through
telephone lines so they can exchange information and route messages to the
individual users, or clients, of a given server.

<P>Each server stores a copy of the constantly changing contents of newsgroups,
which function as giant electronic bulletin boards dedicated to particular
subjects. There are thousands of them, covering everything from particle
physics to soap operas. Any Internet user is free to post a contribution to
nearly any newsgroup, and the posting is rapidly copied from one server to
another, so the contents of a newsgroup are identical on every server.

<P><B>'Netiquette' is only control</B>

<P>Almost the only form of control over postings, including their content, is
voluntary adherence to informal behavior rules known as ''netiquette.''

<P>The idea of cancelbots originated when the Internet and its newsgroups were
almost exclusively the domain of university and government scientists and
researchers. Their purpose was to allow individuals to rescind messages they
later discovered to contain an error. The action took the form of an
automatic program, itself in the form of a message, because it would be
impossible for an individual to find and delete every copy of the posting on
every Internet server.

<P>But the Usenet software running on servers doesn't verify that the cancel
message actually comes from the person who created the original posting. All
a malicious user need do is replace their actual e-mail address with that of
someone else to fool the Usenet into deleting a message. That counterfeiting
is as simple as changing an option in the browser software most people use
to connect to the Internet.

<P>''It's pretty easy,'' Gilmore said. ''There's no authentication in the
Usenet. So anybody can pretend to be anybody else.''

<P>It takes only slightly more sophistication to create a program that searches
newsgroups for certain keywords, and then issues a cancelbot for any message
that contains them. That is how the weekend attack took place.

<P>The use of counterfeit cancelbots is not new. The Church of Scientology,
embroiled in a legal dispute with former members, last year launched
cancelbots against the newsgroup postings of the members. Attorneys for the
church claimed the postings violated copyright laws, because they contained
the text of Scientology teachings normally available only to long-time
members who have paid thousands of dollars.

<P>Net users have also turned false cancelbots against those who violate a
basic rule of netiquette by sending out messages to hundreds or even
thousands of newsgroups that are typically commercial in nature. Known as
''spamming'' in Net circles, it is universally reviled by those who work and
play on the Internet.

<P>''This technology has been used for both good and evil,'' Gilmore said.

<P>But an individual launching a wholesale cancelbot attack on postings because
of content is considered a serious violation of netiquette -- although one
about which there is little recourse at the moment.

<P>''For everybody who takes the trouble and time to participate on the
Internet in some way, I think it is not acceptable for somebody else to undo
those efforts,'' Sobel said. ''But what are the alternatives? Not to pursue
this means of communications? Unintended uses and malicious uses seem to be
inevitable.''

<P>sysctl net.inet.tcp.conntimeo 25
<P>sysctl net.socket.maxconn 1024

<P>In the header files you can adjust this:

<P>/usr/src/sys/sys/socket.h:

<P>#define SOMAXCONN 64

<P>/usr/src/sys/netinet/tcp_timer.h

<P>#define TCPTV_KEEP_INIT (75 * PR_SLOWHZ)</P>

<B>------<BR>
Linux<BR>
------<BR></B>


<P>As of version 2.0.5 the Linux kernel is unusually vulnerable to this kind
of attack because the TCP timer is badly broken.  Half open sockets will
stay open as long as 20 minutes.  A fix for this is "in the works".  The
maximum number of half open connections is 128 by default.  It can be
changed in the file:

<P>/usr/src/linux/include/linux/socket.h

<P>#define SOMAXCONN       128</P>

NEW YORK-(BUSINESS WIRE)-Oct. 21, 1996<BR>
<P>Lack of confidence in information security, widespread Internet access and increased malicious attacks by insiders have caused significant information security losses at major U.S. companies,
according to the fourth annual Ernst & Young LLP/InformationWeek Information
Security Survey. More than half (54 percent) of the survey's 1,320 participants
experienced losses due to information security and disaster recovery within the
last two years. Adding computer viruses to the mix, the number rose to a
startling 78 percent. Significant losses were caused by malicious acts by
company insiders (32 percent), malicious acts by outsiders (18 percent),
natural
disasters (25 percent) and industrial espionage (six percent). Nearly
three-quarters (71 percent) of the executives surveyed expressed a lack of
confidence in the security of their computer networks, from both internal and
external attack. "The threats can come from an unsecured Internet connection, a
malicious attack by a disgruntled employee, the loss of a laptop with critical
information, industrial espionage or just plain carelessness," said Scott D.
Ramsey, national director of information security, Ernst & Young. "While
companies spend more money on sophisticated computer hardware, they often fail
to devote attention to safeguarding information systems, equipment and the
people who use it." "Information security is undoubtedly one of the biggest
concerns our readers have. The results of this survey not only confirm this but
also serve as a wakeup call that something must be done to make the enterprise
feel more secure," said Charles Pelton, managing editor/industry, CMP Media's
InformationWeek.</P>
Nosing Around on the 'Net<BR>
<P>The survey also uncovered that while most companies are using the Internet or
Intranet for vital business functions, many feel that the information security
measures for both are ineffective. While nearly 40 percent expressed
dissatisfaction with the overall security level of their companies' Internet
connection, less than one-third (31 percent) of the respondents said they could
detect vulnerability to hackers who can dial-in through external Internet
connections. In fact, 25 percent said someone had used the Internet to attempt
to break into their system during the last year. To make matters worse, nearly
three quarters (74 percent) lack a formal incident response team. "As increased
use of outside vendors and contract employees heightens exposure, organizations
must start monitoring the connections between themselves and their service
providers," added Ramsey. "Companies don't realize that the moment they give
computer access to a contractor, they are handing the keys to the kingdom to a
short-term employee." In addition, only a third (34 percent) of the companies
with Internet access are using the connection to perform electronic commerce
transactions, such as financial transactions, and the taking and placing of
product orders, suggesting that companies are proceeding with caution.
Malicious Attacks from Inside Service providers are not the only people who need monitoring, according to the survey findings. Losses due to internal malicious attacks have nearly doubled
since 1995, with corporate downsizing a possible key motivator for these acts.
"Ironically, `compassionate' relocation packages that allow terminated
employees to remain on-site - with access to corporate computer systems - can backfire on
employers," added Ramsey. "Companies must consider the damage that just one
embittered former employee can do to the operations of a company." Six percent
of those surveyed have suspected industrial espionage attacks on their systems.
Ramsey speculates that since the really good spies never get caught, it's hard
to quantify a company's exposure in this area. "Industrial espionage is illegal
in the United States, but not in foreign countries, and we have noted an
increased level of intelligence gathering from overseas," added Ramsey. To
illustrate the severity of security risks, Ernst & Young revealed how it has
embarked on "staged penetrations" and infiltrated corporate offices at the
request of clients. Past penetrations have allowed Ernst & Young
representatives to gain access to their client's e-mail systems, read sensitive data, such as
merger and acquisition material, and walk out the door with $35,000 worth of
laptops and other equipment. "It's a real eye-opener when a CEO receives an
e-mail from a hacker, describing all the confidential information that's been
read," said Ramsey.

                 18 October 1996<BR>
                     (DRAFT)<BR>

<P>In September 96, Boneh Demillo and Lipton from Bellcore announced an
ingenious new type of cryptanalytic attack which received widespread
attention (see, e.g., John Markoff's 9/26/96 article in the New York Times).
Their full paper had not been published so far, but Bellcore's press release
and the authors' FAQ (available at
<a href="http://www.bellcore.com/PRESS/ADVSRY96/medadv.html">http://www.bellcore.com/PRESS/ADVSRY96/medadv.html</a>) specifically state that
the attack is applicable only to public key cryptosystems such as RSA, and
not to secret key algorithms such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES).
According to Boneh, "The algorithm that we apply to the device's faulty
computations works against the algebraic structure used in public key
cryptography, and another algorithm will have to be devised to work against
the nonalgebraic operations that are used in secret key techniques." In
particular, the original Bellcore attack is based on specific algebraic
properties of modular arithmetic, and cannot handle the complex bit
manipulations which underly most secret key algorithms.

<P>In this research announcement, we describe a related attack (which we call
Differential Fault Analysis, or DFA), and show that it is applicable to
almost any secret key cryptosystem proposed so far in the open literature.
In particular, we have actually implemented DFA in the case of DES, and
demonstrated that under the same hardware fault model used by the Bellcore
researchers, we can extract the full DES key from a sealed tamperproof DES
encryptor by analysing fewer than 200 ciphertexts generated from unknown
cleartexts.  The power of Differential Fault Analysis is demonstrated by the
fact that even if DES is replaced by triple DES (whose 168 bits of key were
assumed to make it practically invulnerable), essentially the same attack
can break it with essentially the same number of given ciphertexts.

<P>We would like to greatfully acknowledge the pioneering contribution of Boneh
Demillo and Lipton, whose ideas were the starting point of our new attack.

<P>In the rest of this research announcement, we provide a short technical
summary of our practical implementation of Differential Fault Analysis of 
DES. Similar attacks against a large number of other secret key cryptosystems
will be described in the full version of our paper.</P>

TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE ATTACK<BR>
<BR>
<P>The attack follows the Bellcore fundamental assumption that by exposing a
sealed tamperproof device such as a smart card to certain physical effects
(e.g., ionizing or microwave radiation), one can induce with reasonable
probability a fault at a random bit location in one of the registers at some
random intermediate stage in the cryptographic computation. Both the bit
location and the round number are unknown to the attacker.

<P>We further assume that the attacker is in physical possession of the
tamperproof device, so that he can repeat the experiment with the same
cleartext and key but without applying the external physical effects. As a
result, he obtains two ciphertexts derived from the same (unknown) cleartext
and key, where one of the ciphertexts is correct and the other is the result
of a computation corrupted by a single bit error during the computation. For
the sake of simplicity, we assume that one bit of the right half of the data
in one of the 16 rounds of DES is flipped from 0 to 1 or vice versa, and
that both the bit position and the round number are uniformly distributed.

<P>In the first step of the attack we identify the round in which the fault
occurred.  This identification is very simple and effective: If the fault
occurred in the right half of round 16, then only one bit in the right half
of the ciphertext (before the final permutation) differs between the two
ciphertexts. The left half of the ciphertext can differ only in output bits
of the S box (or two S boxes) to which this single bit enters, and the
difference must be related to non-zero entries in the difference
distribution tables of these S boxes.  In such a case, we can guess the six
key bit of each such S box in the last round, and discard any value which
disagree with the expected differences of these S boxes (e.g., differential
cryptanalysis). On average, about four possible 6-bit values of the key
remain for each active S box.

<P>If the faults occur in round 15, we can gain information on the key bits
entering more than two S boxes in the last round: the difference of the
right half of the ciphertext equals the output difference of the F function
of round 15.  We guess the single bit fault in round 15, and verify whether
it can cause the expected output difference, and also verify whether the
difference of the right half of the ciphertext can cause the expected
difference in the output of the F function in the last round (e.g., the
difference of the left half of the ciphertext XOR the fault).  If
successful, we can discard possible key values in the last round, according
to the expected differences.  We can also analyse the faults in the 14'th
round in a similar way.  We use counting methods in order to find the key.
In this case, we count for each S box separately, and increase the counter
by one for any pair which suggest the six-bit key value by at least one of
its possible faults in either the 14'th, 15'th, or 16'th round.

<P>We have implemented this attack on a personal computer.  Our analysis
program found the whole last subkey given less than 200 ciphertexts,
with random single-faults in all the rounds.

<P>This attack finds the last subkey.  Once this subkey is known, we can
proceed in two ways: We can use the fact that this subkey contains 48 out of
the 56 key bits in order to guess the missing 8 bits in all the possible
2^8=256 ways. Alternatively, we can use our knowledge of the last subkey to
peel up the last round (and remove faults that we already identified), and
analyse the preceding rounds with the same data using the same attack. This
latter approach makes it possible to attack triple DES (with 168 bit keys),
or DES with independent subkeys (with 768 bit keys).

<P>This attack still works even with more general assumptions on the fault
locations, such as faults inside the function F, or even faults in the key
scheduling algorithm.  We also expect that faults in round 13 (or even prior
to round 13) might be useful for the analysis, thus reducing the number of
required ciphertext for the full analysis.</P>

OTHER VULNERABLE CIPHERS<BR>
<BR>
<P>Differential Fault Analysis can break many additional secret key
cryptosystems, including IDEA, RC5 and Feal.  Some ciphers, such as Khufu,
Khafre and Blowfish compute their S boxes from the key material.  In such
ciphers, it may be even possible to extract the S boxes themselves, and the
keys, using the techniques of Differential Fault Analysis.  Differential
Fault Analysis can also be applied against stream ciphers, but the
implementation might differ by some technical details from the
implementation described above.

<BR>
                             INTERNET II PROJECT<BR>
<BR>
SUMMARY<BR>

<P>Building on the tremendous success of the last ten years in generalizing 
and adapting research Internet technology to academic needs, a number of 
universities (see list at end of this document) are now joining together 
with government and industry partners to accelerate the next stage of 
Internet development in academia. The Internet II project, as it is known, 
will bring focus, energy and resources to the development of a new family 
of advanced applications to meet emerging academic requirements in 
research, teaching and learning. 

<P>The project will address major challenges of the next generation of 
university networks.  First and most importantly, a leading edge network 
capability for the national research community will be created and
sustained. For a number of years beginning in 1987, the network services
of NSFnet were unequaled anywhere else.  But the privatization of that
network and the frequent congestion of its commercial replacement have
deprived many faculty of the network capability needed to support world
class research.  This unintended result has had a significant negative
impact on the university research community.

<P>Second, network development efforts will be directed to enabling a new 
generation of applications that fully exploit the capabilities of broadband 
networks - media integration, interactivity, real time collaboration - to 
name a few.  This work is essential if new priorities within higher 
education for support of national research objectives, distance education, 
lifelong learning, and related efforts are to be fulfilled.

<P>Third, the work of the Internet II project will be integrated with ongoing 
efforts to improve production Internet services for all members of the 
academic community. A major goal of the project is to rapidly transfer new 
network services and applications to all levels of educational use and to 
the broader Internet community, both nationally and internationally.</P>

SCOPE OF INTERNET II PROJECT<BR>
<BR>
<P>The project will be conducted in phases over the next three to five years, 
with initial participation expected from fifty to one hundred universities,
a number of federal agencies, and many of the leading computer and 
telecommunications firms, including IBM, Cisco Systems, AT&T, MCI, and Sun.
The overall project technical plan and architecture is contained in a 
companion document to this statement entitled "Internet II Architecture."

<P>In the initial project phase, end to end broadband network services will be 
established among the participating universities.  On a parallel basis, 
applications design will commence using teams of university faculty, 
researchers, and industry experts.  It is expected that within 
approximately eighteen months, "beta" versions of a number of applications 
will be in operation among the Internet II participating universities.</P>

INTERNET II PARTNERSHIP & FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS<BR>

<P>In most respects, the partnership and funding arrangements for the Internet 
II project will parallel those of previous joint networking efforts, of 
which the NSFnet project is a very successful example.  Industry partners 
will work with campus-based and regional university teams to create the 
advanced network services that are necessary to meet the requirements of 
broadband, networked applications.  Federal R&D agencies will provide grant 
support in their areas of program interest, such as the NSF vBNS 
meritorious high performance networking initiative.  

<P>Funding for the Internet II project will include both financial and in kind 
services and products of various types that will be necessary for the 
project.  Since most of the project effort will occur on or near 
university campuses, it is anticipated that the majority of funding from 
government research agencies and industry partners will be in the form of 
grants to the participating universities.</P>

</PRE>
INTRODUCTION<BR>
<BR>
<P>This technical overview of the proposed architecture for the Internet II 
project was created by a working group composed of Scott Bradner (Harvard 
University), Scott Brim (Cornell University), Steve Corbato (Univ of 
Washington), Russ Hobby (Univ of Calif - Davis), and David Wasley (Univ of 
California System), with contributions from many other individuals, 
including in particular a presentation by Professor Larry Landweber of the 
University of Wisconsin at a workshop in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in July 1996.  
It is intended to be a working document and will be updated as the Internet 
II project evolves.</P>

INTERNET II PROJECT<BR>
<BR>
<P>The Internet II project is a collaborative effort among a number of 
universities, federal R&D agencies, and private sector firms to develop a 
next generation Internet for research and education, including both 
enhanced network services as well as the multimedia applications which will 
be enabled by those services.  The work is developmental and pre-
competitive in nature.  It is is more fully described in a companion 
document to this technical overview.</P>

OBJECTIVES<BR>
<BR>
The technical objectives of Internet II include:<BR>

<P>- Maintain a common bearer service to support new and existing applications

<P>- Move from best effort packet delivery to a differentiated communications
   service

<P>- Provide the capability of tailoring network service characteristics to
   meet specific applications requirements

<P>- Achieve an advanced communications infrastructure for the Research and
   Education community</P>

APPLICATIONS REQUIREMENTS<BR>
<BR>
<P>In a number of technical meetings and workshops over the past several 
years, faculty members and other university representatives have identified 
a set of advanced applications that will greatly enrich teaching, learning, 
collaboration and research activities.  A major impediment to the 
realization of these applications is lack of advanced communications 
services.  The broad use of distance learning will require selectable 
quality of service and efficient "one-to-many" data transport in support of 
multimedia and shared information processing.  To support world class 
research on a continuing basis, the academic community requires high 
capacity and selectable quality of service to make effective use of 
national laboratories, computational facilities and large data 
repositories. </P>

NETWORK SERVICES<BR>
<BR>
<P>Internet II is designed to provide a variety of services "on demand"  in
support of advanced applications.  These dynamically selectable services
will include guaranteed bounded delay, low data loss, and high capacity.
For example, in order to support delivery of advanced multimedia teaching
materials from a digital library repository to a dispersed audience of
learners, it will be necessary for the service delivery infrastructure to
support "multicast" data delivery with guaranteed upper bounds within the
transport components on delay and data loss.

<P>New protocols to enable this functionality have already been defined and
will be deployed early in the Internet-II project. These protocols include
the IETF defined quality of service protocols such as RSVP and RTP along
with IPv6, the IETF-developed replacement for the version of IP that is in
current use on the Internet.  In addition, Internet-II will provide access
to the underlying network infrastructure for those environments that can
support that access and for those applications that can make use of
specific capabilities offered by the infrastructure.</P>

IMPLEMENTATION<BR>
<BR>
<P>At the heart of the Internet-II design is a new technology for providing
advanced communications services.  The technology, referred to as a
GigaPOP, is a complex of technologies developed over the first decade of
the Internet integrated with new technologies developed by vendors and the
Internet Engineering community.  The Internet-II project will demonstrate
proof of concept of this new set of technologies and services so that they
can become the basis for the next generation of commercial Internet service
offerings.

<P>The GigaPOP is the point of interconnection and service delivery between
one or more institutional members of the Internet-II development project
and one or more service providers.  Typical institutional connections will
be made via ATM or SONET services at very high bandwidth. The fundamental
advance represented by the GigaPOP architecture is dynamically acquired 
"quality of service" in support of a broad range of new applications while 
maintaining a common interoperable "bearer service". Service 
characteristics will include end-user definable capacity as well as
latency.  An essential part of the Internet-II project will be to determine
the incremental costs associated with support of differentiated classes of
service and to develop the mechanisms to collect data about the use of
these resources by individual users.

<P>The architecture of the GigaPOP also will support service delivery to
regional or state-based not-for-profit consortia such as the Virginia
Educational Network, the Washington State K-20 network, or the combined
University of California and California State University system.  It is
envisioned that 20-30 GigaPOPs nationwide will comprise the Phase 1 
deployment.  These will be designed and managed collectively on behalf of 
the Internet-II project community.</P>

Equipment at a GigaPOP site will include:<BR>
<BR>
<P>*  One or more very high capacity advanced function packet data
switch/routers capable of supporting at least OC-12 (622 megabit/second)
link speeds and switched data streams as well as packet data routing;

<P>*  Switch/routers supporting Internet Protocols (both version 4 and the new
version 6), advanced routing protocols such as MOSPF, and "quality of
service" protocols such as RSVP;

<P>*  SONET or ATM multiplexers to enable allocation of link capacity to
different services such as highly reliable IP packet delivery, experimental
testbeds for emerging protocols, or special requirements determined by new
initiatives among the Internet-II member institutions;

<P>*  Traffic measurement and related data gathering to enable project staff
to define flow characteristics as part of the operational and performance
monitoring of the GigaPOPs.

<P>One or more wide area communications service providers will connect to the
GigaPOPs in order to provide communications paths between the nationwide
set of GigaPOPs and between GigaPOPs and the established commercial
Internet.  Thus, participating institutions will be able to acquire a wide
variety of commercial as well as pre-competitive communications services
over a single high capacity communications link to the nearest GigaPOP
facility.  In particular, to support high performance distance learning and
remote collaboration initiatives, the GigaPOP architecture will facilitate
local interconnectivity between the higher education community and those
commercial providers offering emerging high-bandwidth home access
technologies.

<P>The most advanced applications will require a set of communications paths
among the GigaPOPs that are engineered especially for the Internet-II
project.  It is essential that these interconnect pathways fully support
the protocols and functions noted above.  Recently, NSF has proposed an
expanded role for its vBNS infrastructure that potentially could attach as
many as 100 sites nationally to the current OC-3 backbone and could provide
a deployment platform for emerging applications in support of research and
collaboration.  It is envisioned that the vBNS, with its proposed new
capabilities, will be the initial interconnect network among the GigaPOPs.
If the vBNS should prove insufficient for the full range of Internet-II
requirements, other alternatives will be employed.

<P>Although direct SONET pathways might be most effective in providing the
inter-GigaPOP pathways, it seems most likely that ATM-over-SONET will be
the most commonly available commercial service.  Because Internet-II will
use virtual connections within and between the GigaPOPs, a test network can
be implemented along side of the production network without having to
duplicate facilities.  This test network will be used to experiment with
new capabilities of the network itself where the production network can be
used to provide reliable service for applications.</P>

OPERATIONS<BR>
<BR>
<P>Clearly the design of the GigaPOPs must meet the requirements of very high
reliability and availability.  Each GigaPOP site will be physically secure
and environmentally conditioned, including backup power and resistance to
damage from acts of nature.  Physically diverse fiber optic and wireless
communications paths will maximize service robustness against the unlikely
event of physical damage external to the site.  In addition, the
Internet-II infrastructure will be designed to be secure from the threats
of those who would seek to disrupt its operations.

<P>Not all GigaPOP sites will be staffed 24 hours per day.  Instead, redundant
Network Operations Centers will monitor the operation of all equipment
remotely via both in-band and out-of-band circuits and will dispatch
problem resolution staff as needed to effect restoration of normal
services.</P>

CONCLUSION<BR>
<BR>
<P>The Internet-II architecture has been chosen to demonstrate the
effectiveness of new technologies in providing the next generation
communications infrastructure. The success of Internet-II will allow 
higher education and research institutions to remain world leaders in the
development of advanced applications of information technology.

         HOW MICROCHIPS CREATE MEGABANKS,  OR <BR>
      HOW COMMUNITY BANKS ARE BECOMING ROADKILL <BR>
           ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY<BR>
	<BR>
      -- Nathan Newman, Progressive Communications, <BR>
                        newman@garnet.berkeley.edu<BR>


<P>     IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE pictured the local banker as a fixture 
of the community--whether as evil oppressor like Mr.Potter or 
local savior like Jimmy Stewart's  George Bailey.  Either way, it 
was hard to think of the community without seeing it as a 
reflection of the local banks.  

  <P>   Those local banks are increasingly a thing of the past, done 
in by regulatory changes but more importantly by technology that 
has encouraged bigger, more national and even international 
banks.  Electronic banking is a key part of the strategy of banks 
trying to go global.  Part of this change is shear survival:  
banks have less and less  a percentage of people's savings, so 
banks are fighting each other for every dime. The Federal Reserve 
has found that in the last twenty years, household financial 
assets deposited in interest-bearing accounts has dropped from 
27.5 percent of family assets down to 16 percent.  The median 
value of those assets has fallen substantially just in the last 
few years as more and more of those assets are moved into mutual 
funds and other investments.  With mutual funds exploding from 
just $57 billion in 1979 to $2 trillion by 1996, banks are 
rushing to use new technology to hold onto their place in the 
financial lives of people.

   <P>  Bigger banks have used technology to both slash their costs 
and expand their operations, usually at the expense of 
traditional community banks.  The disappearance of the local bank 
branch is just the most obvious sign of the deep cost-cutting 
involved.   Automatic teller machines were the first wave of 
electronic banking to begin to replace the local branch, while 
Internet banking is coming up fast.  With alternatives costing as 
little as 15 percent of comparable branch transactions (and with 
the costs dropping quickly), banks are seeking every opportunity 
to push into electronic banking.

 <P>   All banks are looking to cash in on to an estimated 15% of 
customers who, according to at least one major survey, would 
prefer to conduct routine banking over a computer.  In 1995, 
754,000 households banked by computer, according to a study 
performed by Jupiter Communications, a New York consulting firm.  
They project that as many as 13 million households will be 
banking from home by the year 2000.

 <P>    If any entrant into Internet banking shows the promise (or 
the threat) of banking without geography, its the appearance in 
1995 of Security First Network Bank (SFNB), the first independent 
bank with no physical branches doing all business electronically.  
The creation of an otherwise obscure Savings & Loan from Kentucky 
in October 1995, SFNB built on a collaboration with Hewlett-
Packard to launch the bank and a software subsidiary, Five Paces, 
to sell Internet-banking software to other banks.  Within months, 
SFNB had a few hundred customers which grew to 4000 customers in 
all fifty states  who had opened checking accounts by August 
1996.  An initial $100 deposit gets a customer an ATM card or a 
VISA debit card and the ability to check balances any time on 
Security First's home page on the World Wide Web.  By the end of 
1996, SFNB will be offering customers on-line discount stock 
brokerage and insurance services and even a few physical branches 
around the country.  With $44.6 million in assets, SFNB is 
obviously not a big player yet but its success is a threat to 
more established banks.

<P>     And nowhere is that threat felt more than in northern 
California where a majority of Security First's initial customers 
have come, showing clearly that while the Internet is global, the 
Bay Area is where everything seems to break ground first.   Wells 
Fargo and Bank of America, the largest banks in the region,  have 
suddenly realized that their traditional regional territory is 
under threat from banks that can reach their traditional 
customers from anywhere over the Internet.  Mack Hicks, a Vice 
President at Bank of America, sees the Internet ending the 
relevancy of economic regions, especially for banks:  "In an 
industrial society, cities were appropriate because of the 
regional nature of business and the delivery of services, in the 
information age there is no boundary for the delivery of services 
so there is no reason for regions.  You want to compete in the 
international region."</P>

<P>    Bank of America has established an Internet home banking 
service allowing balance queries, account info, bill payment and 
funds transfer.  Their rival Wells Fargo has been much more 
aggressive.  Hicks notes that Wells Fargo has been using the 
Internet to transform itself from being a large regional bank 
into a major international player: "They can put up a good Web 
site and give new strategies and services that give them an 
international presence with no cost for brick and mortar.  You 
don't have to open a branch in London and New York with the new 
technology."

 <P>    As electronic commerce expands, paper is sucked out of the 
banking system, taking away most traditional fees earned by banks 
for dealing with those paper checks.  The migration to debit and 
smart cards, electronic cash wallets and electronic bill 
presentment bypasses most of the points where local banks collect 
any fee, leaving them scrambling for a role.  Argues Ira Morrow, 
research director of Stamford, CT-based Gartner Group, "Many 
[banks] make a nice tidy fee-based business operating lock boxes. 
If there's no check and no bill and no reconciliation, there's no 
lock box."  Larger banks with corporate customers see the key to 
adaptation as changing their focus to new services that integrate 
customer's overall cash management.  Wells Fargo highlights its 
combining of electronic bill payment with managing companies 
receivables process.  Vince Hruska, Wells Fargo Vice President 
and manager of electronic commerce products, argues that larger 
banks can deliver this broad range of corporate financial 
services, "I'm the person that can deliver that to the company," 
says Hruska. 

    <P> Even in core areas of loans, smaller banks are losing out to 
bigger national banks as new technology cuts out the need for 
local intermediaries.  Home mortgages are increasingly based on 
national lending criterion determined and managed by central 
banking institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Using an 
infrastructure of fast computers, data base software and high 
speed communication networks,  new "data mining" techniques allow 
lenders to manage data to identify key patterns and relationships 
in customer data to determine whether loans should be granted.  
All of these technologies require technical and statistical 
sophistication that small banks cannot afford.  And as on-line 
networks strengthen, any intermediary between customers and the 
ultimate loan approver could be subject to elimination.

  <P>  Home mortgages have been moving towards centralization for 
the last decade and a half but even more significant for regional 
economies is the recent emergence of a national loan market for 
small business loans--once the quintessential part of local 
economic development decision-making.  Until just a few years 
ago, large institutions had little advantage in loaning to small 
business; each loan was evaluated based on business plans, 
balance sheets, cash flow and profits.  There were few economies 
of scale.  Because of the uncertainty of small business survival, 
the assumption was that only local banks had any chance of 
betting on the right loans, so local bankers with knowledge of an 
area had pretty much free reign in the area of small business 
lending.

 <P>   Computer technology has changed all that as small business 
loans have begun to be evaluated using the same statistical 
methods as individual consumer loans.  Using a system known as 
credit scoring, lenders no longer perform detailed financial 
reviews of each borrower.  Instead, they use a few key pieces of 
information to predict the probability that a borrower will 
repay, then offer the loan to those deemed worth taking a risk 
on.  The cost of processing each small business loan thereby 
drops from thousands of dollars to merely a few hundred, opening 
the way to apply mass market techniques to these loans.  

<P>     Big banks are displacing community banks in this game for 
two reasons.  First, the costs of the computers, software and 
databases involved in this new system are far beyond the 
resources of most small banks.  "The capital cost is significant, 
and if you are not doing volume, you can't recover it," notes 
BankAmerica small business lending chief Janet Garufis. In that 
sense, the balance of power is tilting toward large regional or 
national lenders. 

  <P>  Wells Fargo is one bank pioneering the development of an in-
house  system to give it a dominant edge over rivals.  Using data 
collected on its own customers as a guide to its evaluation of 
data to predict losses, it began expanding the database as it 
expanded small business loans in California beginning in 1991.  
This was combined with increasing technology in back-office 
operations to reduce paper and drive costs down.  "We engineered 
out the number of times a human hand touches a loan," says 
executive vice president Lucy Reid, who heads the bank's national 
small business direct marketing program. Within California, the 
results were spectacular.  In 1989, Wells had only 1% of all 
small business loans held by California banks.  By 1995, Wells 
had more than 16% of all small business loans.

<P>     By 1994, Wells Fargo was ready to go national using direct 
marketing techniques to attract customers outside California.  By 
1995, five million small business loan solicitations were mailed 
nationally.  Outside of California, Wells concentrated solely on 
loans under $100,000 using credit scoring to sort potential 
customers into eight risk categories with different loan rates 
offered to each group.  By June 1995, total commercial loans 
under $1 million at Wells had jumped to 117,392; that year, Wells 
earned a stellar 32% return on equity in its small business 
credit portfolio.

  <P>   Smaller banks are being squeezed not only because they can't 
afford to invest in the computer technology and in-house 
databases, but also because they just aren't big enough to treat 
loans as large as $100,000 as statistics that can repay or 
default based on probability tables.  David Payne, chief 
executive of $2.4-billion-asset Westamerica Bancorp. in San 
Rafael, CA, argues "I have to look at each deal to repay as 
agreed."  Local knowledge of the economy is no longer the 
competitive advantage it once was for local banks as low cost, 
mass market loans become possible due to the new computer 
technology.  Big banks end up with the advantage as they can 
average out good and bad returns over a much broader capital 
base.

   <P>  Direct mail, telemarketing and now Internet marketing such 
loans nationwide to small business is replacing the local 
community bank as the source of small capital.  And as the 
confidence of the mega banks grow using these computerized 
techniques, they are moving towards targetting larger business 
loans, further threatening community banks.  All of these changes 
are undermining traditions that linked local businesses and local 
capital in a shared fate in the growth of their region.  As 
capital nationalizes, local businesses will be able to find loans 
irregardless of the health of local banks, while local banks will 
no longer have to depend on growth in their local region to find 
places to invest their capital. 

   <P>  For the rest of us, this opens up new services if we are 
deemed to be good customers by the credit-rating computers but 
for the rest of society, the danger is a new form of electronic 
redlining as they become invisible to the marketing thrust of 
these international banks.  With banks having a national and even 
international focus for business, no banks will see a particular 
region as their domain or responsibility.  Local communities once 
had some political hold on local banks (through tools like the 
Community Reinvestment Act), but in the age of the megabank, they 
are finding that those tools are increasingly impotent.  With the 
disappearance of specifically local capital, the threads that 
bind the economic life of rich and poor within regions are 
loosening even more.  </P>

TUESDAY, October 1, 1996<BR>
<BR>

STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT<BR>

<P>President Clinton and I are committed to promoting the growth of
electronic commerce and robust, secure communications worldwide while
protecting the public safety and national security.  To that end, this Administration is
consulting with Congress, the information technology industry, state and
local law enforcement officials, and foreign governments on a major
initiative to liberalize export controls for commercial encryption products.

<P>The Administration's initiative will make it easier for Americans to use
stronger encryption products -- whether at home or abroad -- to protect
their privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information.  It
will support the growth of electronic commerce, increase the security of
the global information, and sustain the economic competitiveness of U.S.
encryption product manufacturers during the transition to a key management
infrastructure.

<P>Under this initiative, the export of 56-bit key length encryption products
will be permitted under a general license after one-time  review, and
contingent upon industry commitments to build and market future
products that support key recovery.  This policy will apply to hardware and
software products.  The relaxation of controls will last up to two years.

<P>The Administration's initiative recognizes that an industry-led technology
strategy will expedite market acceptance of key recovery, and that the
ultimate solution must be market-driven.

<P>Exporters of 56-bit DES or equivalent encryption products would make
commitments to develop and sell products that support the key recovery
system that I announced in July. That vision presumes that a trusted
party (in some cases internal to the user's organization) would recover the
user's confidentiality key for the user or for law enforcement officials acting
under proper authority.  Access to keys would be provided in
accordance with
destination country policies and bilateral understandings.  No key length
limits or algorithm restrictions will apply to exported key recovery
products.

<P>Domestic use of key recovery will be voluntary, and any American will
remain free to use any encryption system domestically.

<P>The temporary relaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryption
policy initiative designed to promote electronic information security and
public safety.  For export control purposes, commercial encryption
products will no longer be treated as munitions.  After consultation with Congress,
jurisdiction for commercial encryption controls will be transferred from
the State Department to the Commerce Department.  The Administration also
will seek legislation to facilitate commercial key recovery, including providing
penalties for improper release of keys, and protecting key recovery
agents against liability when they properly release a key.

<P>As I announced in July, the Administration will continue to expand the
purchase of key recovery products for U.S. government use, promote
key recovery arrangements in bilateral and multilateral discussions, develop
federal cryptographic and key recovery standards, and stimulate the
development of innovative key recovery products and services.

<P>Under the relaxation, six-month general export licenses will be issued
after one-time review, contingent on commitments from exporters to explicit
benchmarks and milestones for developing and incorporating key
recovery features into their products and services, and for building the supporting
infrastructure internationally.  Initial approval will be contingent on
firms providing a plan for implementing key recovery.  The plan will
explain in detail the steps the applicant will take to develop, produce, distribute,
and/or market encryption products with key recovery features.  The
specific commitments will depend on the applicant's line of business.

<P>The government will renew the licenses for additional six-month periods
if milestones are met.  Two years from now, the export of 56-bit products
that do not support key recovery will no longer be permitted. Currently
exportable 40-bit mass market software products will continue to be
exportable.  We will continue to support financial institutions in their
efforts to assure the recovery of encrypted financial information. Longer
key lengths will continue to be approved for products dedicated to the
support of financial applications.

<P>The Administration will use a formal mechanism to provide industry,
users, state and local law enforcement, and other private sector
representatives with the opportunity to advise on the future of key recovery.  Topics will
include: 

-     evaluating the developing global key recovery architecture <BR>
-     assessing lessons-learned from key recovery implementation <BR>
-     advising on technical confidence issues vis-a-vis access to<BR>
      and release of keys <BR>
-     addressing interoperability and standards issues <BR>
-     identifying other technical, policy, and program issues for<BR>
      governmental action. <BR>

<P>The Administration's initiative is broadly consistent with the recent
recommendations of the National Research Council.  It also addresses
many of
the objectives of pending Congressional legislation.<BR>

         <P>                              ABSTRACT<BR>

  <P>  Encryption plays an essential role in protecting the privacy of
electronic information against threats from a variety of potential
attackers.  In so doing, modern cryptography employs a combination of
_conventional_ or _symmetric_ cryptographic systems for
encrypting data and _public key_ or _asymmetric_ systems for
managing the _keys_ used by the symmetric systems.  Assessing the
strength required of the symmetric cryptographic systems is therefore
an essential step in employing cryptography for computer and
communication security.</P>

                     October 1, 1996----<BR>
                    

         <P>            WASHINGTON (AP) -- The
                     Clinton administration intends to
                     break a deadlock between law
                     enforcement and the U.S. computer
                     industry with a plan announced
                     Tuesday to make it easier for companies to sell powerful
                     data-scrambling software abroad. 

               <P>      Companies could export such technology as long as they
have a
                     system in place that would allow U.S. law enforcement
officials --
                     after getting a court order -- to break the code in
order to
                     intercept communications. 

                     President Clinton will sign an executive order
instituting the plan in
                     the middle of October, said Greg Simon, Vice President
Al Gore's
                     domestic policy adviser. 

           <P>          The plan "will make it easier for Americans to use
stronger
                     encryption products -- whether at home or aboard -- to
protect
                     their privacy, intellectual property and other valuable
information,"
                     Gore said in a statement. 

               <P>      "It will support the growth of electronic commerce,
increase the
                     security of the global information and sustain the
economic
                     competitiveness of U.S. encryption product
manufacturers," he
                     added. 

                     The plan changes U.S. export policy and affirms current
U.S.
                     import policy, which places no restrictions on the sale of
                     encryption devices within the U.S. 

              <P>       The plan mirrors a proposal by the administration this
summer.
                     That proposal, considered more acceptable to industry,
has been
                     criticized by a number of computer trade groups and
computer
                     user groups. 

            <P>         At issue is sophisticated software that allows users to
scramble
                     telephone and computer messages that move across computer
                     networks and the Internet. Users, particularly
businesses, want to
                     keep their data private while law enforcement officials
argue they
                     need the power to unscramble the messages to
investigate crime. 

             <P>        "Law enforcement has been arguing that this is critical
to their
                     continued operations. But virtually everyone else, from
industry to
                     the civil liberties community, has opposed these
proposals," said
                     Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy
Information
                     Center. 

                <P>     While the technology is sold domestically, the U.S. State
                     Department has blocked efforts to export it, although
foreign firms
                     sell their software around the world. 

           <P>          Under the most recent White House plan, U.S. companies
could
                     export the software that scrambles -- or encrypts --
data using
                     codes that are up to 56 bits long, Rotenberg said. As
it stands,
                     codes may only be 40 bits long in exported software.
Bits are the
                     electronic pulses that make up the data being
transmitted. 

                 <P>    In return, U.S. companies would have to design a system
that
                     would allow intelligence officials to get the code if
they obtain a
                     court warrant. 

                <P>     The plan also would transfer authority over encryption
export from
                     the State Department to the Commerce Department, but it
would
                     give the FBI power to review export plans. 

               <P>      This plan replaces the "clipper chip" the Clinton
administration
                     proposed in 1994. That would have allowed computer or
                     telephone communications to be scrambled while giving the
                     government a set of decoding keys to allow for
court-approved
                     electronic surveillance. 

            <P>         The latest plan is different than the clipper chip
because it would
                     make it more difficult for government to unscramble
messages,
                     government officials say. The keys could be held by
third parties
                     and their components would be spread across several
companies. 

                  <P>   The administration believes it will take some time for
the United
                     States to persuade other countries to adopt the same
systems,
                     allowing governments to work together. </P>

<P>MORRISTOWN, N.J. (Sept. 26) BUSINESS WIRE -Sept. 26, 1996--Bellcore, a  leading
provider of communications software, engineering and consulting  services, is a
recognized expert in all aspects of network security. 
<P>   It is therefore our responsibility to alert our customers about the
possibility of any threat to the security of their networks and communications
products and services. As a result, Bellcore has issued an alert to its clients
notifying them about a potentially serious problem that could significantly
impact the security of the "smart cards" that are used by many domestic and
international phone companies and banking institutions.  A smart card can be
manipulated into making a computational error which can then render it
vulnerable to the mathematical techniques used by cryptographers to extract
secrets stored in the card, including the secret key used to authenticate the
legitimacy of that card. Bellcore also notified them that Bellcore is available
to analyze the various devices and computers that are used by all electronic
cash systems to determine the extent of a potential  threat to any one
particular system.  Bellcore also offers unique solutions developed by its team
of security experts that are unavailable anywhere else.  These solutions
generally involve complex mathematical cryptography methods, as well as other
methods that involve the physical characteristics and defenses built into some
existing cards. Bellcore has experts on this subject available to answer
inquiries from the media about this situation.  If you wish to set up an
interview, please contact Bellcore media relations manager Ken Branson on
201/829-2165 and Annie Lindstrom on 201/829-4062. -0- SECURITY ALERT 
<P>   Now Smart Cards Can Leak Secrets; A New Breed Of Crypto Attack on
'Tamperproof' </P>
   Tokens Cracks Even the Strongest RSA Code <BR>
<P>   SEPTEMBER 25, 1996--Security research findings do not usually cause dramatic
changes in the marketplace.  This one will.  It's such a novel approach to
breaking cryptographic security systems that it is considered a new threat
model.  The work is formally called 'Cryptanalysis in the Presence of Hardware
Faults,"  and it exposes a serious flaw in the assumptions made by manufacturers
of smart cards, secure ID cards, and other "tamperproof"  hardware tokens that
are used for secure networked transactions. 
 <P>  The attack targets public key cryptography schemes- such as the well-known
RSA authentication and digital signature algorithms-when they are implemented in
tamperproof devices.  RSA public key cryptography has been licensed to a wide
range of companies for inclusion in their products and services.  Indeed, faith
in the strength of this code underlies much of the market optimism for
electronic commerce. 
<P>  Of all the challenges facing electronic commerce- billing logistics, Internet
congestion, lack of privacy, and so forth-the new attack on tamperproof devices
may be the most debilitating.  It diminishes confidence in smart cards that are
used for stored value, such as some forms of electronic money; and in cards that
personalize cellular phones,  generate digital signatures, or authenticate users
for remote login to  corporate networks.  The security risks in each of these
examples are  impersonation and fraudulent use of data. 
<P>   "Designers of cryptography systems have a new constraint to worry about, '
says Dan Boneh, a Bellcore research scientist and co-developer of the new threat
model along with Richard Lipton, a professor of computer science at Princeton
University and a Bellcore chief scientist, and Richard DeMillo, a Bellcore vice
president and head of Bellcore's Information Sciences and Technologies Research
laboratory.  "'Our attack, "  Boneh explains, "is basically a creative use of a
device's miscalculations, or, faults.  Now, tamperproof devices must not only
conceal the unit's inner circuitry but also be fault resistant." 
<P>   In light of the new threat model, it is dangerous to assume that secret
information stored in a tamperproof device cannot be discovered by an
adversary.  Moreover, according to DeMillo, "designers of tamperproof devices
can no longer claim with impunity that their products are secure.  An external
testing organization, such as Bellcore, must determine to what extent the device
is vulnerable to the new attack-by analyzing the design and manufacture of the
device and playing the results against the new mathematical methodology."  HOW
THE NEW ATTACK WORKS 
<P>   Lipton is given credit for making the crucial observation on which the new
threat model is based.  He noted that once a device performs a faulty
computation, it may well leak information that can be used for cryptanalysis.
This is a new way of looking at the fact, widely acknowledged in the computer
industry, that no computing system can be perfectly fault free. 
<P>   The attack uses an algorithm that, first, compares the faulty values
generated by a device against correct values and, second, infers the
cryptographic code stored inside the device.  Next, in the case of some RSA
implementations, the algorithm efficiently factors the RSA modulus. It is not
difficult to then derive the private key of the private/public key pair. 
<P>   Perhaps the most powerful and surprising aspect of the new threat model is
that it avoids directly factoring the RSA modulus. Therefore, it is equally
effective against moduli of any length.  In contrast, the Number Field Sieve
factoring technique developed by former Bellcore research scientist Arjen
Lenstra and others has, so far, broken RSA implementations using moduli that are
130 digits (i.e., 431 bits) long but has not succeeded against 512-bit
implementations, which are used in products worldwide. 
 <P>  "Even if all of the products currently using RSA authentication or digital
signatures were upgraded to use 1024-bit moduli, we could still break the code
with the new threat model,"  says Boneh.  But, he adds, the algorithm used in
the new threat model is not effective against symmetric or, secret key
cryptographic techniques, such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and
Bellcore's Video Rate Algorithm (VRA). "The algorithm that we apply to the
device's faulty computations works against the algebraic structure used in
public key cryptography,"  Boneh explains.  "Another algorithm will have to be
devised to work against the nonalgebraic operations that are used in secret key
techniques." CREATING FAULTS 
 <P>  The new threat model hypothesizes that a tamperproof device can be easily
subjected to physical stresses that cause it to generate faulty computations at
rare and unpredictable rates.  It is reasonable to assume that an adversary
could easily gain full control over a smart card and card-reading device while
the processor is performing security-related calculations.  Certain levels of
radiation or atypical voltage could then be applied, or for brief periods of
time the device might be given a higher clock rate that it was designed to
accommodate. 
<P>   It would be more difficult to gain this type of control over a larger
computing device housed inside a secure environment.  So far, therefore, it
seems that the new threat model is most acute against such tamperproof devices
as smart cards because we can cause them to make faults.  However, there is a
substantial threat even in the case of servers that operate behind locked doors.
Lipton notes that since all computers make errors from time to time, "even
servers are not safe from our attack.  Our methods work even against machines
that we cannot actively tamper with.  As long as they are not perfect, we can
use our methods to break their security code." 
<P>   The new model has been tested using hypothetical calculations, but the
physical phase of the research has not been carried out.  It is not, however,
necessary to mount the attack in order to emphasize its seriousness.  In the
security community, it is universally accepted that the mere possibility of an
attack's existence is a sign of great danger.  Now that the model called
"Cryptanalysis in the Presence of Hardware Faults" has been proven to work
theoretically, security experts must assume that attackers exist who have the
means of carrying it out. 
 <P>  One way to protect devices against the new attack is to ensure that the
computing device verifies the computed value by, for example, repeating the
computation and checking that the same answer is obtained both times.
Unfortunately, in some systems, this form of protection usually slows down the
computation by a factor of 2.  For some applications, this drag on performance
is not acceptable. 
 <P>  Lipton points out that "checking the computation in this way may not stop all
our attacks."  A better way to protect a tamperproof device is to use protocols
that are fault-resistant.  Lipton believes that it may be possible to create
such protocols. 
   NEW THREAT MODEL BREAKS CRYPTO CODES <BR>
<P>   Fact Sheet Backgrounder for Press Release  WHAT END-USER APPLICATIONS  SUBMIT
TO YOUR CODE-BREAKING SCHEME? 
<P>   Our research discovery proves that all tamperproof devices--such as smart
cards and other hardware security tokens--that use public key cryptography for
user authentication are now at risk.  For example, smart cards that are used for
stored value, such as some forms of electronic money; cards that personalize
cellular phones; cards that generate digital signatures; and cards that
authenticate users for remote login to corporate networks are all open to the
attack that we describe.  The underlying crimes in all these cases are
impersonation and fraudulent use of data.  HOW DOES YOUR RESEARCH AFFECT THE
SECURITY INDUSTRY? 
<P>   Designers of cryptography systems now have a new constraint to worry about.
Our attack is basically a creative use of a devices, miscalculations, or,
faults.  Therefore, tamperproof devices must now not only conceal the device's
inner circuitry but also be fault resistant.  Being tamperproof is no longer
good enough to ensure security.  WHAT IS THE BUSINESS SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
RESEARCH? 
<P>   Designers of "tamperproof" devices can no longer claim with impunity that
their products are secure.  An external organization, such as Bellcore, will
have to determine to what extent the devices are vulnerable.  Bellcore would
analyze the design and manufacture of the device--in effect, test it--and play
the results against the mathematical methodology of the new threat model.  WHAT
IS YOUR NEW THREAT MODEL? 
 <P>  We observed that once a computing device performs a faulty computation, it
might leak information that can be useful for inferring secret data. This is a
novel approach to the widely acknowledged fact that no computing system is safe
from faults. 
 <P>  In our theoretical model, which is called Cryptanalysis in the Presence of
Hardware Faults, we use an algorithm to compare the faulty values with correct
values and then to infer the cryptographic code stored in a tamperproof device.
   It can be likened to a person making a Freudian slip; the listener compares
the phrase with other observations and certain thinking processes to infer
things about the speaker that he might otherwise have wished to keep secret.
WHAT CRYPTOGRAPHIC CODES DOES THIS APPROACH BREAK? 
 <P>  This model is a threat to authentication systems that use public key
cryptography and that are implemented in tamperproof devices.  So far, we have
shown that the following types of public key cryptography can be broken with our
model: RSA, Rabin's Signature Scheme, and the Fiat-Shamir Identification Scheme.
HOW DOES YOUR ATTACK ON RSA COMPARE WITH FACTORING ATTACKS? 
 <P>  Our attack is much more powerful than cryptanalysis that uses factoring.  For
example, the Number Field Sieve factoring technique developed by Arjen Lenstra
and others has so far broken RSA implementations using 130-digit (i.e., 431-bit)
moduli.  But our attack applies to any length of modulus. 
 <P>  Even if all of the products currently using RSA authentication were upgraded
to use 1024-bit moduli, we could still break the code.  DOES YOUR ATTACK
ENDANGER SECRET KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY, SUCH AS DES? 
 <P>  No.  The algorithm that we apply to the device's faulty computations is
effective against the algebraic structure used in public key cryptography.
Another algorithm will have to be devised to work against the nonalgebraic
operations that are used in secret key cryptography. The Data Encryption
Standard (DES) and Bellcore's Video Rate Algorithm (VRA) both use secret key
cryptography, which is also called symmetric key cryptography.  WHY IS YOUR
ATTACK MODEL RESTRICTED TO TAMPERPROOF DEVICES? 
  <P> The attack succeeds because it takes advantage of a processor's faulty
computations.  In our model we hypothesize that tamperproof devices, such as
smart cards or any hardware tokens, can be easily subjected to harmful physical
stresses and thereby forced to make faults.  The attacker can easily gain full
control over a smart card and card-reading device while the processor is
performing security-related calculations. 
<P>   It would be more difficult to gain this type of control over a larger
computing device housed inside a secure environment.  So far, therefore, it
seems that our model is best suited for attacking tamperproof devices.  WHAT
KIND OF PHYSICAL STRESS WOULD BE APPLIED TO THE CARD? 
 <P>  It is reasonable to assume that certain levels of radiation or heat, or
incorrect voltage, or atypical clock rates could be imposed on tamperproof
devices, which are usually small and portable.  These physical stresses can
cause the device to malfunction while it is calculating.  HOW DO YOU USE THE
FAULTY COMPUTATIONAL VALUES? 
  <P> We derived an algorithm that makes use of the faulty values in order to
recover the factors of the stored cryptographic information.  In the case of RSA
implementations, our algorithm efficiently factors the RSA modulus.  It is not
difficult to then derive the public key of the private/public key pair.  WHAT
LONG-TERM SIGNIFICANCE DO YOU ENVISION FOR THIS WORK? 
 <P>  Our threat model will spark a new research trend.  In addition to focusing on
the mathematical properties of the code, researchers may now try to apply the
idea of using hardware faults to other cryptographic schemes and perhaps prove
that certain schemes are resistant to this type of attack.  HOW DOES THIS
COMPARE WITH THE TIMING ATTACK ON RSA ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS YEAR? 
 <P>  They are similar in that both measure things that are taking place within the
processing device.  The timing attack described by Paul Kocher compares the
discrepancies in time required by certain operations and uses this information
to extract the secret information.  Our attack is based on using the occurrence
of hardware faults to extract the secret data.  It may be harder to protect
against our attack than to thwart the timing attack.  HAVE YOU TESTED YOUR
THEORETICAL MODEL? 
<P>  We have tested the algorithm using hypothetical faulty calculations. But we
have not carried out the physical phase of the research, which would involve
using a radiation chamber or high voltage source. 
 <P>  It is not, however, necessary to mount the attack in order to emphasize its
seriousness.  In the security community, it is widely acknowledged that the mere
possibility of an attack existing is a sign of great danger.  Now that we have
proved that the attack model called Cryptanalysis in the Presence of Hardware
Faults works, we must assume that attackers exist who have the means of carrying
it out.  The fact that our work has not yet been experimented with in the
laboratory does not make it a less serious security threat.  HOW CAN DESIGNERS
PROTECT SMART CARDS FROM THIS ATTACK? 
 <P> One way to protect against the attack is to ensure that the device verifies
the computed value by, for example, repeating the computation and checking that
the same answer is obtained both times. Unfortunately, this form of protection
usually slows down the computation by a factor of 2.  For some applications,
this drag on performance is not acceptable.  WHO ARE THE RESEARCHERS WHO
DEVELOPED THE NEW THREAT MODEL? 
   <P>      Richard Lipton, a professor of computer science at Princeton University
and a part-time Bellcore research scientist; Rich DeMillo, a Bellcore vice
president and head of Bellcore's Information Sciences and Technologies Research
laboratory; and Dan Boneh, a Bellcore research scientist.  Richard Lipton made
the crucial observation that once a device performs a faulty computation, it may
well leak information that can be used for cryptanalysis.  --30--bk/ny   rg

Today's news: Simple way found to turn NT Workstation into Server<BR>

Simple way found to turn NT Workstation into Server <BR>
By Eamonn Sullivan <BR>
PC Week online<BR>
<BR>
<P>What really separates Windows NT Server 4.0 from Windows NT Workstation 4.0?
Less than you'd think, apparently. </P>

<P>
Microsoft Corp. claims the Server and Workstation versions of its Windows NT
operating system are designed differently and specifically tuned for
different tasks, but, according to a study to be released Monday, two simple
changes to Windows NT's Registry (where configuration information is stored)
are all that are needed to change an NT Workstation to an NT Server.</P>

<P>O'Reilly and Associates, a Sebastopol, Calif., publishing and software
development company that has butted heads with Microsoft recently over the
licensing restrictions in Windows NT Workstation 4.0, will post an article
Monday at http://software.ora.com/news detailing the results of research
done by Mark Russinovich, a consulting associate for Open Systems Resources
Inc. </P>

<P>Officials of Microsoft, in Redmond, Wash., could not be reached for comment
Friday. </P>

<P>According to Andrew Schulman, a senior editor at O'Reilly, Russinovich
discovered that a single undocumented--but easily accessible--Registry
setting was all that separated the Server and Workstation versions of
Windows NT 3.51. In Version 4.0, two registry settings are needed, and
Microsoft has gone to some effort to hide those registry settings. The
settings are accessible, however, with a little bit of programming.</P>

<P>Other than those settings, the only differences between Workstation and
Server are the bundled programs, such as Internet Information Server, a
Domain Naming System administration tool, and utilities for managing NT-
based networks. The kernel files, such as NTOSKRNL.EXE, KERNEL32.DLL,
HAL.DLL, SRV.SYS and TCPIP.SYS, are identical in Workstation and Server,
Schulman said.</P>

<P>PC Week Labs tested a utility written by Russinovich that changes the
settings he discovered. It works. </P>

<P>O'Reilly officials said they do not plan to release the utility. "We don't
want to encourage individuals to break their license agreement," Schulman
said. "We want Microsoft to change its policy." </P>

<P>When PC Week Labs ran the utility on Windows NT Workstation 4.0, NT
displayed a dialog box that warned us that we were violating the license
agreement. </P>

<P>"The system has detected tampering with your registered product type," the
dialog box said. "This is a violation of your software license. Tampering
with [sic] product type is not permitted." </P>

<P>Once we ran the utility, however, and rebooted the system, Windows NT
Workstation became Server, right down to the product type displayed on the
system "Start" menu. Microsoft applications that are designed to run only on
Server, such as BackOffice and Internet Information Server, installed and ran.</P>

<P>Two weeks ago, we had tested the difference in performance between NT
Workstation and Server by running Netscape Communications Corp.'s Enterprise
Server 2.0 on both products. There was a performance difference. Enterprise
Server was able to serve about 140 connections per second on NT Server, but
only about 120 connections per second on Workstation. Once we ran the
utility, however, the performance difference disappeared.</P>

<P>O'Reilly, which makes the popular WebSite Web server, and other makers of
third-party Web software for Windows NT, including Netscape, has been
fighting with Microsoft over the license for Windows NT Workstation 4.0,
which prohibits using Workstation as a dedicated Web server for more than 10
users at a time.</P>

<P>To run a dedicated Web server, Microsoft said customers must run NT Server,
which includes Microsoft's own Web server, Internet Information Server.</P>

<p><B>From: Bruce Schneier <schneier@counterpane.com></B></P>

<P>Can someone validate this code?</P>

<P>This looks like something that was anonymously posted to the Internet
about a year ago.  It is widely believed to be a hoax; if nothing else,
the key schedule is horrible.  David Wagner broke the algorithm based
on the key schedule alone.</P>

<P>This is what I wrote about S-1 last time around....</P>

<P>Bruce</P>

<HR>

<P>I was in Europe while S-1 was posted, so I missed most of the
discussion.  Better late than never....</P>

<P>Over the last year, I have spent considerable effort collecting
SKIPJACK information.  I have gone through the published
literature, the rumors, and a large stack of documents received
by EPIC through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits.</P>

<P>At Crypto last week I gave a Rump Session talk entitled "Reverse
Engineering SKIPJACK from Open Sources."  I prepared the slides
before I left for Europe.  Here is what I said:</P>

     What the government told us:<BR>
          Single-key block cipher.<BR>
          Can be used in ECB, CBC, CFB, or OFB.<BR>
          64-bit block size.<BR>
          80-bit key size.<BR>
<BR>
     What the review committee told us:<BR>
          32 rounds.<BR>
          No weak keys (like DES has).<BR>
          No key complementation property (like DES has).<BR>
<BR>
     What the hardware specifications tell us:<BR>
          The latency of the Mykotronx chip has 64 clock cycles.<BR>
               This means two clock cycles per round.<BR>
<BR>
     Assorted rumors (excuse me if I don't reveal sources):<BR>
          <P>SKIPJACK does not have rounds in the same sense that
               DES does: i.e., half of the text block is not
               encrypted in each round.
          SKIPJACK has half the total S-box data as DES.
          SKIPJACK has a 48-bit internal structure analogous to a
               32-bit internal structure in DES.</P>
          <P>The masks for the Clipper/Capstone chip are
               unclassified and the chips can be produced in an
               unclassified foundry.  Part of the programming in
               the secure vault includes installing part of the
               SKIPJACK algorithm.  The part of the algorithm
               installed in the secure vault are the "S-tables",
               suggesting that perhaps unprogrammed Clipper chips
               can be programmed to implement other 80-bit key,
               32 round ciphers.</P>

<P>Trying to puzzle out the meaning of the third rumor, Matt Blaze
and I invented something called an Unbalanced Feistel Network.
These are Feistel networks where the source and target blocks are
of different size.  For example, in each round 48 bits might be
used as an input into the F function, and produce 16 output bits
to be XORed with the remainder of the bits.  We called this a
48:16 UFN, and we proposed a design at last year's Algorithms
Workshop in Leuven.  Our design was broken, but I am still
examining the structure.  A 48:16 UFN satisfies the first and
third rumor above, and I think it as good a guess as any
regarding SKIPJACK.</P>

<P>A few months ago, I found some additional information in the form
of documents released under FOIA.  One document was a Mykotronx
design review for "Project Capstone" dated 10 December 1991.  The
design review was unclassified.  Among the details about the
modular multipliers and the SHA code was the following page about
SKIPJACK:</P>

<P>     ECB Processing Rate</P>

          2 clocks per G-Box operation<BR>
          x 1 G-box per shift<BR>
          x 32 shifts per ECB encryption<BR>
          ______________________________<BR>
          64 clocks per ECB<BR>

     <P>64 clocks per ECB / 64 bits out per ECB = 1 clock per bit
     Yields 40 Mbit encryption using a 40 MHz clock.</P>

<P>The only other thing I found was a SECRET memo.  The organization
name (either from or to) is blacked out.  The date is 25 August
1992.  The subject is "SKIPJACK Revision."  Paragraph 2 is
blacked out, but paragraph 1 reads:</P>

     <UL>1.  (U) The enclosed Informal Technical Report revises the
     F-table in SKIPJACK 3.  No other aspect of the algorithm is
     changed.</UL>

<P>That's it.  Rounds are called "shifts," which seems to indicate
that they are not "rounds" in the DES sense.  A shift consists of
a "G-box" operation, which includes not only what we call the F-
F-function but the XOR as well.  And there is something called an
F-table, which could be a table of constants or perhaps a table
of functions.  In any case, it is something that can be revised
without changing the rest of the algorithm.</P>

<P>Now let's look at S-1.  The most probable explanation is that it
is a hoax.  But it is a very good hoax:</P>

     <UL>The hoaxer knew enough about algorithm design to make a
          cipher that was not obviously lousy, while at the same
          time not unduly complicated.  The hoaxer knew enough to
          make a design that included three novel ideas not seen
          anywhere else: S-boxes that are created according to no
          known criteria, a G-table that chooses a rotation of
          S-boxes to use in a given round, and a bizarre key
          schedule.</UL>
     <UL>The hoaxer knew enough about how algorithms are used in the
          military to make a spookish interface.  I am
          particularly interested in the "zeroize" function, the
          separation of the key creation and key loading
          functions, and the key masking.  Blaze said that the
          interface was similar to the Fortezza interface, but
          not the same.</UL>
     <UL>The hoaxer knew about Blaze's and my MacGuffin paper and
          that we thought SKIPJACK was a 48:16 UFN.  We made no
          secret about this, and our paper is on Blaze's web
          page.  The hoaxer knew to use the term F-table.  I
          haven't shown many people what I found in EPIC's
          documents, so the hoaxer either had to look through
          them himself or get them by some other means (maybe an
          independent FOIA request).</UL>

<P>It's not a perfect hoax, though.  The classification markings
look odd: NSA algorithms are SECRET, not TOP SECRET, and the
codeword restriction sentence is strange.  The key schedule is
hopelessly flawed (David Wagner posted an attack to sci.crypt).
The coding style is amateurish, like it was translated from one
language to another.  (Maybe this is clever on the hoaxer's
part.)  And there's even a typo in the code.</P>

<P>And maybe the hardware latency is wrong.  Clearly the design
facilitates parallelization.  You can precompute all possible F-
table outputs in previous shifts, and then use the G-table result
to select between them; I am not sure you can get a shift down to
two clock cycles.  I don't have the hardware background, and
would appreciate comments from others.</P>

<P>And why are there not bitwise permutations?  If SKIPJACK is
designed for hardware, it makes sense to put them in.  They're
free, after all.</P>

<P>Anyway, it's a real good hoax.  Blaze estimated that he could
have done it, but it would have taken him a month of effort.  I
agree with his assessment: one man-month.  It's a lot of time to
spend on a hoax, especially one where the hoaxer doesn't get any
credit.</P>

<P>So, maybe it's SKIPJACK.  It has a 64-bit block size and an 80-
bit key size.  It's a 48:16 UFN with 32 rounds (or shifts, or
whatever).  And it has an F-table.  This is really interesting,
because the structure really is an S-box.  Everyone knows it's an
S-box, and it makes no sense for a hoaxer to call it something
else.  But in S-1 it's called an F-table.  (I think this is very
significant, but others find it less convincing.)</P>

<P>And the F-table has been revised at least once.  In the code it
says that the F-table entries "differ in the S-2 version."  The
code is dated 1 February 1989 and 31 July 1991, and I have a memo
dated 25 August 1992 that says the F-table has been revised in
"SKIPJACK 3."  Pretty convincing, I think.  (Of course this means
that we can't confirm anything by testing the hardware, since the
F-table entries are different.)</P>

<P>Maybe there are no bit permutations because they make analysis
harder, and perhaps they don't add all that much.  Maybe the
algorithm was designed for both hardware and software, or maybe
it was designed for specialized cryptographic hardware with
several parallel microprocessors and some cryptographic
primitives.</P>

<P>If it is real, we have a lot to learn about S-box design.  The S-
boxes are not even balanced.  Maybe they are created just so to
avoid some bizarre attack we can only dream about, but I kind of
doubt it.</P>

<P>But the key schedule is just plain wrong.</P>

<P>So, here's a theory.  Let's assume the code is real.  (Not that
it's SKIPJACK, but that it's a real algorithm from some military
or some corporation.)  Clearly the code is not designed to test
the cryptographic algorithm, but to simulate some kind of
hardware interface: it's called a "software chip simulator."  If
I were the NSA and I designed an algorithm whose security rested
on some tables of constants, I might replace them with phony
constants before giving them to another organization to test.  I
might call the phony version S-1 and the real version S-2.</P>

<P>Maybe the code was originally written in FORTRAN, and then
translated into C.  (NSA doesn't use ADA.)</P>

<P>NSA algorithms are classified SECRET, put perhaps algorithms in
development are classified TOP SECRET.  (We know cryptanalytic
techniques can be TOP SECRET, so perhaps commented code falls
under that category as well.)</P>

<P>And maybe the code originally didn't have an 80-bit key schedule.
Maybe it had a longer key schedule.  The poster then modified
this key schedule to make it look more like SKIPJACK.  (This
might also explain the bug in the code, which might not be a bug
if it still had the original key schedule.)</P>

<P>Which leaves us precisely nowhere.  The most likely explanation
is that it is a hoax, but I am hard-pressed to imagine a hoaxer
with the requisite combination of skills, resources, and
attitude.  I also don't believe that it is SKIPJACK.  It might be
a preliminary design for SKIPJACK, but if both the key schedule
and F-table entries are wrong, we really haven't learned
anything.  If we suddenly discovered that unbalanced S-boxes are
far superior to balanced ones, then all best are off.</P>

<P>    The National Computer  Security Association (NCSA) Thursday announced its Web Site  Certification Program.  </P>
    <P>Under the program, web sites (whether managed internally by an  organization
or through an Internet Service Provider) can be tested  for compliance with NCSA
Labs' computer security guidelines for Web  Sites.  </P>
   <P> The NCSA Web Site Certification program will lead to both  improved security
and improved trust for visitors to web sites on the Internet.  NCSA Labs, with
input from dozens of independent experts,  has developed a suite of criteria
which Web site managers can  implement to significantly reduce risk.  Sites
which appropriately  address all of these criteria can apply to NCSA Labs to be
tested and certified.  NCSA Labs remotely tests the site for compliance with
many of the criteria, and for resistance against common hacking  techniques.
The program specifications were co-developed by NCSA and Georgia Tech Research
Institute, with additional input from  independent security experts.  </P>
    <P>In addition to remote testing, NCSA staff and its Certified Web  Site
Partners also performs on-site security assessments to ensure  compliance with
additional security criteria.  Sites which pass  testing and certification will
display an NCSA Certified Web Site  icon on the home page.  If an end-user
clicks on this icon, they are  linked automatically to NCSA's Web site where
lists of all certified  sites and current certification criteria are maintained.
As the  certification criteria evolve periodically, NCSA labs will perform
random checks on certified web sites to ensure compliance.  NCSA will partner
with Ernst & Young LLP to complete the on-site portion of the certification
program.  </P>
   <P> NCSA Web Site Certification will improve web site security by  addressing a
full range of computer security issues.  "No single  vendor or product can
address the global problem of security on the  Internet. But certification of
Web Sites will lead to both a  significant reduction in risk as well as an
improved perception of  security across the net," said Peter Tippett, president
of NCSA.</P>
   <P> NCSA is an independent organization which facilitates interchange among end
users, industry experts and vendors on information  security, ethics, and
reliability.  NCSA has more than 1600 corporate members who represent a wide
range of commercial, government, and  vendor organizations.  </P>
      <P>Quotes and References:</P>
 
   <P> "NCSA's Web Certification Program is one of the most practical  and
effective ideas around for raising the general level of security  on the
Internet."  --Benjamin Wright, Author, The Law of Electronic  Commerce
(214-526-5254). </P>

  <P>  "Especially in light of the Web's exponential rate of growth,  NCSA's Web
Security Certification program is a boon to the  international Internet
community.  Although certification cannot  guarantee that particular servers are
completely secure, it does  clearly indicate whether a site has met the criteria
necessary for  building and maintaining a secure Web infrastructure."  --Larry
J.   Hughes Jr., an Internet Security Engineer, author, and lecturer
(317-253-7378). </P>

   <P> "By being certified, a Web Site will be perceived as a very low  risk to the
insurance industry thus enabling them to purchase broad  coverage at a reduced
rate."  "There are many sites who won't realize what they are doing wrong until
they see (NCSA's) requirements.  Even if they don't get certified, it will at
least make them think hard  about what they are doing."  --Steven H. Haase,
Senior Vice  President, Hamilton Dorsey Alston Company (770-850-6670). </P>

   <P> "We are pleased to support the development and use of standards  as a tool
in improving the security of the Internet."  --Dr. Myron  L. Cramer, Principal
Research Scientist, Georgia Tech Research  Institute (404-894-7292). </P>

  <P>  "Just as the Web is becoming a major conduit for commerce, issues of privacy
and threats of malicious code have become increasing  concerns of everyone on
the Internet.  Users are looking for  assurance that the sites they visit meet
reasonable standards for  security and trust.  The NCSA, with its extensive
experience testing  information security products, is clearly the organization
to take  the lead on this much needed task."-- Winn Schwartau, President
Interpact, Inc., Infowar.Com., author of Information Warfare and  co-author, The
Complete Internet Business Toolkit. (813-393-6600). </P>
 
   <P> "As a WEB Site developer, it's important to let users know we're  serious
about the Internet and security.  This program helps us do  both."  -- John G.
Sancin, President, Market.al. Inc.   (216-524-2227) </P>
 
   <P> "No single vendor or product can address the global problem of  security on
the Internet.  But certification of Web Sites will lead  to both a significant
reduction in risk as well as an improved  perception of security across the
net."  --Peter Tippett, President,  NCSA.  (717-258-1816 x213) </P>
 
    <P>"NCSA Certification is a great first step that companies can take to make
their web sites secure."  --Scott D. Ramsey, National  Director Information
Security Services, Ernst & Young LLP  (216-737-1213). </P>
 
   <P> "Security remains a major concern for many users of the  Internet," said
Michael S. Karlin, President and COO of Security  First Network Bank, the
World's first Internet bank (404-679-3201).   "The NCSA web site certification
program is an excellent first step  in recognizing secure Internet sites, such
as Security First Network  Bank, and allowing consumers to easily identify those
sites."  </P>
 
    <P>"NCSA's active role in making the Internet a more secure medium  for
electronic commerce is commendable.  A third party, unbiased,  certification of
secure products, including Web Sites, establishes a  level of credibility which
is essentially non-existent today in the  commercial markets.  Any manufacturer
can claim their product is  secure and, unfortunately, that claim's first
challenge comes after  it is in market use.  What NCSA is doing, is giving the
market a  level of comfort with respect to manufacturer claims.  If the product
is stamped 'NSCA Certified' you can trust it has passed a certain  level of test
and evaluation.  We all know that no product is 100%  secure, but it can be
tested against known vulnerabilities, and that  is what the Web Site
Certification is all about.  There are many  electronic commerce packages out
there claiming to secure your Web  Site and related transactions.  Many of these
products are based on  the same underlying encryption technologies.  What NCSA
is testing  goes beyond the encryption mechanisms and investigates potential
vulnerabilities like Denial of Service attacks, probability of  Down-Time,
potential for Virus migration, Data Integrity, etc.  This  process is definitely
a step in the right direction."  --Mark Mercer, President, TECHMATICS
(813-887-3488).</P> 
 
    <P>"The NCSA Certified Web Site program is a great first step to  improving
security on the Internet.  This program will establish the  foundation for self
regulation of the industry while deterring  government regulation."  --Kevin
O'Connor. </P>

   <P> Technical Specifications for Web Site Certification Program:</P>
 
   <P> The National Computer Security Association establishes and  manages
information security-related certification programs.  Many  Information
Technology managers believe security concerns and privacy issues are major
factors inhibiting full business use of the  Internet.  The NCSA Certified Web
Site program provides assurance to  web users, and also to the organizations
represented on web sites,  that these sites meet minimal standards for a range
of logical and  physical security issues.  By implementing the methods,
procedures,  policies and other criteria required to achieve NCSA Certification,
a site and its users can expect significantly reduced risk of  down-time,
intrusion, tampering, data loss, hacking, data theft, and  other security risks
compared with sites which are not NCSA  certified.  </P>
     <P> Criteria Required to Achieve an NCSA Certified Web Site:</P>
 
   <UL> -- The web site must withstand network based attacks.  This can  be
accomplished by utilizing a NCSA Certified Firewall, a filtering  router whose
policy prohibits all protocols which are not necessary  to business operations,
or other appropriate security measures.  </UL>
 
   <UL> -- The Domain Naming Service entries for all Universal Resource  Locator
(URL) referenced systems comprising the site must be  resolvable, both as a
Fully Qualified Domain Name, and as an Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the
InterNIC contact information for the  site's domain name must be accurate.  </UL>
 
   <UL> -- Logging of the connecting IP addresses, date & time, page(s)  being
accessed, date & time of each secure connect and disconnect,  and denials of
access/unauthorized access attempts must be maintained for users accessing the
Certified web server.  </UL>
 
   <UL> -- A generally accepted encryption mechanism (i.e., SSL or SHTTP) must be
used for sensitive data transmission.  </UL>
 
   <UL> -- A person designated as the site's "Common Gateway Interface  (CGI)
evaluator" must examine and evaluate all CGI scripts and  programs which are
accessible on the systems comprising the site.  </UL>
 
   <UL> -- A person designated as the site's "Client Executable (CxE)  evaluator"
must examine and evaluate all CxE's which are accessible  on the systems
comprising the site.  </UL>

    <UL>-- Pages containing or accepting sensitive data must be  non-cacheable.  </UL>
 
    <UL>-- Persistent Client State mechanisms (e.g. Cookies) must not be used to
store sensitive data.  </UL>
 
   <UL> -- The web site server must meet various physical and logical  security
checks (i.e., physical locks, access controls, back-up  procedures, etc.).  </UL>
 
  <UL>  -- Any "back-end" transaction process must be documented, and  available for
review.  </UL>

Thank you to Col. Gary Wilson, OSD/RA GWilson@osd.pentagon.mil<BR>
Ref: (a) MCO P3900.15 (Marine Corps Combat Development Process)<BR>
July 1995<BR>
<P><B>1. INFORMATION.</B>

<P>This Planning Guidance is the 31st Commandant's strategic direction for the
Marine Corps--a Total Force Marine Corps. As discussed in the reference, it
serves as
the keystone document for Marine Corps planning and provides a common
direction to the Marine Corps Total Force. It is a road map that delineates
where the
Marine Corps is going and why, what the Marine Corps will do, and, in some
instances, how and when prescribed actions are to be implemented. Specific
responsibilities in execution of this Planning Guidance will be assigned in
the following pages.

<P><B>2. INTENT.</B>

<P>The two most important things the Marine Corps does for our nation are to
make Marines and to win battles. The success of my predecessors in
accomplishing
these tasks has earned the respect and confidence of the American people.
That will continue.

<P>a. ALMAR 191/95 outlines the five pillars of my most strongly held beliefs:
warfighting, people, core values, education and training, and our naval
character. Each
will be the subject of future correspondence from me. This document takes
the first step in defining how we will translate these beliefs into action.
In essence, the
CPG serves as the Commandant's intent for the next four years and beyond.

<P>b. Specific objectives and priorities contained in this document will be
used in day-to-day decision making. That decision making process must be a
participatory
one, and our policies must be based on a long-range view with a singular
focus on where and what we want the Marine Corps to be in the 21st century.
Therefore,
all policies will be developed without regard to the tenure of any one
Commandant, one administration, or one congressional session. Every plan or
program
developed in support of this planning guidance must include a divestiture
strategy to ensure we do not retain outdated policies, organizations,
weapons systems,
acquisition strategies, or doctrine.

<P><B>3. BACKGROUND</B>

<P>a. My intent is to ensure unity of effort. To that end, I want our
institutional objectives to be perfectly clear. In all that we say and do,
we must continually return to
the strategic concept that makes the Corps a unique institution within our
national military establishment. That concept, articulated by Congress and
contained in law
in Title 10, reflects our very ethos.

<P>"The Marine Corps, within the Department of the Navy, shall be so organized
as to include not less than three combat divisions and three air wings, and
such other
land combat, aviation, and other services as may be organic therein. The
Marine Corps shall be organized, trained, and equipped to provide fleet
marine forces of
combined arms, together with supporting air components, for service with
the fleet in the seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and for the
conduct of such
land operations as may be essential to the prosecution of a naval
campaign.

<P>"In addition, the Marine Corps shall provide detachments and organizations
for service on armed vessels of the Navy, shall provide security
detachments for the
protection of naval property at naval stations and bases, and shall perform
such other duties as the President may direct. However, these additional
duties may not
detract from or interfere with the operations for which the Marine Corps is
primarily organized.

<P>"The Marine Corps shall develop, in coordination with the Army and the Air
Force, those phases of amphibious operations that pertain to the tactics,
technique, and
equipment used by landing forces.

<P>"The Marine Corps is responsible, in accordance with integrated joint
mobilization plans, for the expansion of peacetime components of the Marine
Corps to meet
the needs of war."

<P>b. The Congressional Conference Report that supported the final legislation
clearly explained the background behind our strategic concept and went on
to say that
history . . .

<P>"has fully demonstrated the vital need for the existence of a strong force
in readiness. Such a force, versatile, fast-moving, and hard-hitting, will
constantly have a
very powerful impact in relation to minor international disturbances. . . .
Such a force can prevent the growth of potentially large conflagrations by
prompt and
vigorous action during their incipient stages. . . . The nation's shock
troops must be the most ready when the nation generally is least ready. . .
. to provide a
balanced force in readiness for a naval campaign and, at the same time, a
ground and air striking force ready to suppress or contain international
disturbances short
of large-scale war."

<P><B>4. THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE MARINE CORPS.</B>

<P>The words of the 82nd Congress, so carefully crafted and articulated nearly
45 years ago, provide us with the foundation we need to move into the 21st
century.
We have long been known as "innovators" and "improvisers." As part of our
ethos and together with our strategic concept, innovation and improvisation
serve as
the foundation upon which we will continue to build our institutional
objectives and translate them into a vision for the Marine Corps of the
21st century.

<P>a. The next century will likely be characterized by crisis and conflict. It
will place heavy demands on our nation's military services; demands that
will require deep
reservoirs of military skill, intellect, and innovation. This uncertain
horizon creates an even more pressing imperative for a military force that
can remain versatile yet
act decisively in the face of such uncertainty--a force that can quickly
and surely anticipate change and adapt to a new reality. The Marine Corps
has always been
that versatile, decisive force--and we will continue to be so.

<P>b. We will be well prepared to handle a variety of missions. We will be
trained and equipped to defeat any enemy. The Marine Corps will be
recognized, not just in
the United States, but globally, as the premier crisis response force--ever
ready to project the power and influence of the United States from the sea
to any foreign
shore. Here, crisis is defined as ranging from a military attack against
our nation or its interests, to acts of political violence against
Americans abroad, to those
operations currently falling under the rubric of "Military Operations Other
Than War" (MOOTW). In these areas, the Marine Corps will be first on the
scene, first to
fight, first to quell disturbances, and first to help. The Marine Corps
will be the nation's force of choice--a certain force for an uncertain
world. No matter what the
crisis or the threat, the nation will have one thought: "Send in the
Marines."

</P>c. Operating forward, in fully capable combined arms teams, the Marine
Corps will be America's legion--on the scene, ever ready to protect the
nation's interests.
We will remain fundamentally naval and expeditionary in character, as
comfortable on the seas as on the land and in the air. With the Navy, we
will be able to go
anywhere rapidly and project force across any shore against any foe,
sustaining ourselves from sea or land bases.

<P>d. We will continue to be a force rich in history and traditions, ingrained
with the highest values of honor, courage, and commitment. We will be a
Total Force,
active and reserve, able to effectively integrate a full range of
capabilties--ours as well as those of other services, agencies, and
nations--into a unified and focused
instrument of national power. We will avidly exploit the latest
technologies, concepts, and methods to enhance the operational
effectiveness of our forces. And, as
we have always been, we will be an economical force--able to get more from
less.

<P>e. This superb armed force will be composed of the world's finest military
professionals-- disciplined, motivated, dedicated warriors--stronger,
smarter Marines,
who are filled with the values that have served us well throughout our
history, and infused with the agility of mind and body that will be
required in future conflicts.
They will be educated to act intelligently and independently, trained to
seek responsibility, required to be accountable, and molded to act with
boldness and
individual initiative. They will see at their side a cadre of experienced
civilians who provide depth and continuity and who are an equal key to our
future. We will be
a learning organization that creates individuals who not only can adapt to
changing situations, but who can anticipate and even activate them. We will
be self-critical,
quick to identify shortcomings, and relentless in our efforts to improve.
Our Marines' moral character, courage, and ethical values will dominate any
location or
operational area with the unconditional certainty that the Marine Corps is
a force for good.

<P>f. The future Marine Corps will give our nation an unbeatable force,
composed of highly capable men and women, bound by the unbreakable bond of
our unique
spirit, possessing a singular focus--to serve the nation as its force of
choice.

<P><B>5. FOCUS</B>

<P>a. Foundation

<P>(1) I will be an active participant in the decision making process at HQMC.
To this end, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps has been asked
to
develop an executive decision making body soon--within the next 30 days.
This organization will include membership at the lieutenant general and
general level. It
will, with the Director of the Marine Corps Staff (DMCS) as Executive
Secretary, incorporate a formalized process that ensures complete staffing
prior to, and
thorough follow-up after, decisions.

<P>(2) We need to be organized to ensure we are effective in the Planning,
Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS) process as well as in other
important
deliberations that take place within the Marine Corps, the Department of
the Navy, the Joint Staff, with the CJCS and the Combatant Commanders, and
in the
Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Assistant Commandant of the Marine
Corps has been asked to develop a plan to organize HQMC and Marine Corps
Combat Development Command (MCCDC) to be more effective and in a way that
saves structure. This needs to be accomplished early on. We will not be
able to
get to the future if we cannot get organized to start the journey. This
will also require an all hands effort to fully implement our concept-based
requirement system
and Combat Development Process (CDP) while we come to grips with a more
efficient and effective resource allocation process. The initial brief for
this
organization should be ready for presentation by 15 August 1995, with a
brief on the full proposal by 1 October 1995.

<P>(3) The Marine Corps will continue to build on the foundation established
by my predecessors. This means being adequately resourced to meet the
requirements of
the National Military Strategy. It also means a stable force structure. To
that end, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps has been asked to
evaluate the
merits of consolidating structure sponsorship in such a way that ensures
that our manpower, training, and education plans are stabilized and
complementary to one
another. The initial brief should be ready by 15 August 1995; the study and
recommendations should be completed for presentation by 1 January 1996.

<P>b. Innovation

<P>(1) Building on my predecessors' foundation does not mean doing things the
old way. It is not an excuse to avoid developing new concepts for
organizing, training,
and equipping the Marine Corps. We must do everything that is required to
safely navigate from the Corps of today to the Corps the nation needs the
day after
tomorrow.

<P>(2) A key objective of my planning guidance is to encourage--to demand--
creativity and innovation to ensure that we retain an adaptive and flexible
naval force
able to anticipate events and win across the spectrum of conflict. Our
institution must not restrict or limit the opportunity of any Marine to
think creatively and to
develop new ideas. Marines must be seen, respected, and depended upon to
innovate and improvise. The development of forces for expeditionary duty in
the first
part of this century, the development of the Fleet Marine Force and
amphibious warfare doctrine in the 1930's, the push for the development of
the helicopter and
vertical/short takeoff (V/STOL) technology, and the successes of our
Maritime Prepositioning Force program are all representative of innovations
that have
changed the nature of warfighting. These innovations were the result of
creative thinking; thinking by sergeants and corporals, captains and
lieutenants, generals and
colonels; thinking by Marines who, as others have said, "Think beyond the
moment, live beyond the day." This must continue.

<P>(3) "Marine Mail." To capture this creative thinking, the Director of the
Marine Corps Staff (DMCS) will establish a system to collect ideas and
forward them to
those "who need to know." This will be different from, but complementary
to, the Marine Corps Lessons Learned System. It will be a "mailbox" that
will serve as a
receptor for the innovative and creative ideas of all of our Marines and
civilians from private to general and GS-1 to SES. I want to know three
things: what aren't
we doing that we should be doing; what are we doing that we should do
differently, and, what are we doing that we shouldn't be doing? The
procedure for utilizing
"Marine Mail" will be the topic of correspondence to be released within two
weeks, and it will be operational by 1 August 1995.

<P>(4) We must not be lulled into complacency because we have always been
ready, relevant, and capable. What might be ready, relevant and capable
today, may be
less so the day after tomorrow. We must anticipate change, adapt to it, and
foster it. We will remain relevant only if we are willing to meet future
challenges and
adapt to new needs.

<P><B>6. WARFIGHTING</B>

<P>a. Background.

<P>We exist today because the American people expect their Marines to provide
them a lean, ready, and professional fighting force, a force that
guarantees success
when committed. They have such a force now and are proud of it.

<P>b. Intent.

<P>As good as we are today, we will need to be even better tomorrow. We will
achieve this through the strength of our innovation, ingenuity, and a
willingness to
continually adapt to changes across the spectrum of conflict. We must not
be afraid of reaching outside of the traditional realms of defense
acquisition or technology.
Neither should we be totally wed to our current organization or operational
outlook. We must, however, above all, keep our focus on being ready when
called.

<P>(1) The Marine Corps remains the nation's naval, combined arms,
expeditionary force in readiness. While we stand ready to perform "such
other duties as the
President may direct," our reason for being is what it has always
been--warfighting. With capabilities inextricably linked to structure, it
is vital that our organization
be designed with one goal in mind: success on the battlefield.

<P>(2) Marine Corps operational forces will continue to be organized as Marine
Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTFs), with the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF)
as
the principal warfighting organization. Necessary combat power will be
provided to the committed MEF through global sourcing by the Total Force:
one force
consisting of Marine Forces, both active and reserve.

<P>c. Tasks

<P>(1) Joint.

<P>"Jointness" is a key warfighting capability. It is more about headquarters
and command elements than it is about the capabilities of any individual
unit. With our
experience in coordinating the elements of a MAGTF and the "jointness"
inherent in our relationship with the Navy, the Marine Corps possesses the
resident
expertise necessary to coordinate effectively ground, air, and sea forces.
Augmenting this expertise, we also have many Marines assigned to joint
staffs. DC/S
Plans, Policies and Operations must ensure Marines on joint duty are kept
current on the priorities of the Commandant and the initiatives of HQMC and
MCCDC.

<P>(a) As we continue to develop our joint capabilities, we must also ensure
we have the forces the CINCs need. I believe it is the responsibility of
the Service Chief to
"provide forces" and the responsibility of the Combatant Commanders to
"employ forces." Many of the future discussions regarding force provision,
apportionment,
and employment will hinge on the strength of the relationship and
communication among the Service Headquarters, the Joint Staff, the
Combatant Commanders, and
Marine Force Commanders (COMMARFORs). These lines of communications must
also be sensitive to PPBS-related activities, the Enhanced JROC, the Joint
Warfighting Capability Assessments, and the development of the CINCs
Integrated Priority Lists. While DC/S Plans, Policies and Operations is
responsible for
supporting the Commandant in many of these discussions, for presenting the
COMMARFORs concerns, and for articulating the Marine Corps position and
rationale to Marine component commanders, this will obviously expand beyond
the immediate span of his control. By 1 September 1995, the Assistant
Commandant of the Marine Corps has been asked to develop a strategy which
ensures that the lines of communication between the Commandant, HQMC, and
the
COMMARFORs on this broad range of issues are in place, well understood, and
utilized.

<P>(b) The Marine Corps must provide a fully capable, expeditionary, Joint
Task Force (JTF) Headquarters organized and equipped to move out on a
moment's
notice to meet the uncertainties of a chaotic new world. In concept, this
would be the headquarters of choice when the National Command Authorities
and the
Unified Commanders in Chief are planning to respond to emerging crises
anywhere in the world's littorals. My intent is to establish this
capability within
MARFORLANT/II MEF. By 30 September 1995, the CG, MCCDC, in conjunction with
the COMMARFORLANT, the HQMC staff, and other agencies, will
provide a proposal for the establishment of this JTFHQ.

<P>(c) As an integral part of this nation's forward operating naval
expeditionary forces, Marine units are frequently the first force to arrive
on-scene during a potential
crisis. As such, we must maintain the capability to enable the seamless
introduction of follow-on joint and combined forces and to provide the
command and control
framework for the formation of joint task forces. With these concepts and
the one expressed in the preceding paragraph in mind, by 1 January 1996,
CG,
MCCDC, COMMARCORSYSCOM, and the Assistant DC/S for Command, Control,
Communications, Computers and Intelligence, together with the Force
Commanders are to explore the development of JTF command and control
capabilities in Marine Expeditionary Units which will enable the smooth i
ntegration of a
follow-on JTFHQ. These capabilities must be built to conform with the
Common Operating Environment of the Global Command and Control System.

<P>(2) Strategic.

<P>The nation's ability to project influence and military forces over great
distances depends upon adequate strategic mobility forces. Our Marine
expeditionary forces
must continue to have a number of deployment options including amphibious
lift, maritime prepositioning shipping, self-deployment, and strategic
sealift and airlift.

<P>(a) In a world in which our ability to base forces overseas is declining,
the ability to project power and conduct sea-based operations is crucial. I
remain concerned
about the adequacy of amphibious lift to meet the nation's crisis response
and forward presence requirements. We will work closely with the Chief of
Naval
Operations and his staff to ensure that there are adequate numbers of the
right types of ships, with the right capabilities, to meet national
requirements.

<P>(b) The current amphibious ship building program is carefully crafted to
satisfy an active fleet goal of lifting 2.5 Marine expeditionary brigade
equivalents at the
earliest feasible date. Any slip in new ship procurement will delay
attainment to beyond 2010. In spite of this fiscal "accommodation," we must
remember that this is
a programmatic goal driven by constrained resources. The requirement
remains 3.0 brigade equivalents. Amphibious ships do not simply enhance
deployment
options. They provide the world's only self-sustaining forcible entry
capability. They limit the requirement for a support infrastructure ashore,
allowing the naval
forces to remain at sea indefinitely. And, they provide essential
versatility to adapt to the uncertain international landscape we envision
in the 21st century. To
provide the required presence and deploy highly capable Marine
expeditionary forces with an over-the-horizon launch capability, we need to
maintain the capability
of 12 Amphibious Ready Groups, each built around a large deck, in the
active force.

<P>(c) The Marine Corps Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) provides our
nation a unique capability and is key to the rapid deployment of
large-scale sustainable
Marine forces. MPF flexibility is increased through innovative loading and
deployment option s. We will continue to examine MPF employment options
which
support specific mission requirements as well as review other enhancements
to MPF. Additionally, we must look further into the future and develop the
follow-on
concept for MPF that incorporates a broader view of how we provide
logistics support to the MAGTF. CG, MCCDC, in conjunction with DC/S
Installations and
Logistics and other agencies, as part of the supporting concepts initiative
tasked in paragraph 6c(3)b below, shall update our MPF employment
concept(s).

<P>(d) There is a need for a strategic organization--manned, trained, and
equipped--to counter the growing biological-chemical (Bio-Chem) terrorist
threat. The
Marine Corps will have such an organization--centrally located, available
to be globally sourced to Marine Force Commanders and the National Command
Authorities for duties as the President may direct. This Bio-Chem Unit will
be manned with properly skilled and trained personnel, possibly to include
civilian
experts. It will be equipped with state-of-the-art detection, monitoring,
and decontamination equipment, and it will be suited for operations in a
wide range of
military-civilian contingencies. The CG, MCCDC will develop the concept,
doctrine, organization, and tactics, techniques, and procedu res for this
Bio-Chem Unit
by 1 February 1996.

<P>(3) Operational and Tactical.

<P>"Forward . . . From the Sea," (FFTS) is the Navy and Marine Corps White
Paper that defines the vision for our expeditionary naval service in the
operational and
tactical levels of war. With the Navy, we are structuring a fundamentally
different naval f orce to respond to the new and still emerging strategic
environment. Those
forces must be sufficiently flexible and powerful to satisfy enduring
national security requirements.

<P>(a) The Navy and Marine Corps provide the nation with naval expeditionary
forces shaped for joint operations operating forward from the sea and
tailored for
national needs. For the Navy, this strategic direction represents a
fundamental shift away from open-ocean warfighting on the sea toward joint
operations conducted
from the sea. It also offers the distinct opportunity to integrate further
the maritime warfighting capabilities that the Naval Services bring the
nation. We are
inextricably linked to the Navy and I believe that is good. Our unique
maritime character is as important to defining our Marine Corps ethos as is
the individual
Marine, our recruit and officer training, and our basic tenet of "every
Marine a rifleman." Separately and collectively, these elements are what
set us apart from other
fighting forces.

<P>(b) The Marine Corps' contribution to FFTS is "Operational Maneuver From
the Sea" (OMFTS)--a philosophy and guide for current and future power
projection
ashore. OMFTS couples maneuver doctrine with technological advances in
speed, mobility, firepower, communications, and navigation to achieve a
seamless
transition from ship to shore and the rapid movement inland to exploit
enemy weaknesses. OMFTS is far more than just "ship to shore" movement. It
is a new
concept of naval warfare which covers the full spectrum of conflict and is
as valuable in MOOTW as it is in Major Regional Contingencies. It is not
simply a
theoretical construct of the new maritime battlespace, but rather, reflects
a fundamental re-orientation toward the littoral regions, complemented by
advanced
capabilities provided by new equipment. Any remaining deficiencies, whether
in doctrine, organization, training, or equipment, must be identified and
resolved. We
must develop additional supporting concepts and help the Navy do the same.
The CG, MCCDC will develop and submit a plan of action and milestones that
aggressively address this critical linchpin in our concept-based
requirements system by 1 December 1995.

<P>(c) The Marine Corps Training, Exercise, and Employment Plan (MCTEEP) has
been under development for three years. It is time to bring it to fruition.
The
MCTEEP must be a tool for the Operations Deputy and the Commandant to use
with the CJCS, the Combatant Commanders, and the Joint Staff to manage
commitments. The MCTEEP must help our Force Commanders to reduce the tempo
of operations. It must be a planning and execution tool, NOT a schedule
that
is maintained at HQMC. By 1 January 1996, DC/S Plans, Policies and
Operations and CG, MCCDC, in conjunction with the Force Commanders, will
complete
the implementation of MCTEEP.

<P>(d) The requirement for forward presence forces continues. Forward
operating MAGTFs will continue to provide the Unified Commanders a unique
crisis response
capability. While the Marine Corps will retain the capability to deploy
MAGTFs tailored for specific missions of limited duration, the Marine
Expeditionary Unit
(Special Operations Capable) (MEU(SOC)), forged and tested in real-world
contingencies, remains the benchmark forward operating Marine force. It is
the
"jewel" in our crisis response crown and must be kept ready, relevant, and
capable. Nevertheless, we must continuously remain willing to take a hard
look at both
the MEU(SOC) and our overall amphibious requirements. We must preserve
those elements of our current organization which have co ntinuing relevance
and
quickly jettison those which do not. What serves us well today might not be
what is needed for tomorrow. We need to keep an eye on the future and on
changes in
technology and consider what adaptations we may need to make. CG, MCCDC, in
conjunction with the Force Commanders and the HQMC staff,
COMMARCORSYSCOM, and other agencies will conduct a comprehensive review of
the MEU(SOC), the MEF (Fwd), and the MEF to ensure they are
correctly structured with the right capabilities to meet the requirements
of the combatant commanders. This review is to be completed by 1 February
1996.

<P>(4) Reserves.

<P>My personal experience has led me to believe that there is only one Marine
Corps--a Total Force Marine Corps. The days of two Marine Corps are gone .
. .
forever. Our active and reserve components will be broadly and seamlessly
integrated, and indivisible as a balanced warfighting force. The full
acceptance of this
reality is critical to our future.

<P>(a) Equipped and trained to the same standards as their active
counterparts, the readiness of the selected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR) is
further enhanced
through training and education with the active component. MARFORRES
training will be reflected in the MCTEEP, and MARFORRES integration will be
a goal
and objective of every training event above the battalion/squadron level.

<P>(b) The DC/S Plans, Policies and Operations, DC/S Manpower and Reserve
Affairs, CG MCCDC, and COMMARCORSYSCOM will oversee this broad,
seamless integration.

<P>(5) Tactical Mobility.

<P>One of the keys to achieving decisive action is mobility. Without the
ability to move rapidly, forces cannot concentrate to fight and then
disperse. To preserve the
advantage which speed provides, we must continue to improve our tactical
mobility. From the combat load of the individual Marine to major weapons
systems,
improved battlefield mobility will be a paramount concern. This requires
the acquisition of not only lightweight weapons systems, but also of
advanced technology
mobility assets in quantities sufficient to ensure a mobility advantage on
the future battlefield. This will be a clear objective of CG, MCCDC and
COMMARCORSYSCOM as they research, develop, and acquire the combat tools and
systems for the Marine Corps--with requirements always firmly anchored
in our operational concepts.

<P>(6) Command and Control.

<P>We must reach and execute effective military decisions faster than our
adversaries, in any conflict setting, on any scale. Our command and control
processes and
systems must reflect our warfighting philosophy. Decision making that
focuses on speed and creating tempo, mission control that focuses on low
level initiative,
simple planning processes and orders writing techniques that are measured
by the quality of the intent, all require a command and control system that
is both flexible
and adaptable. In looking at the command and control processes, we will
focus more on people than systems. Processes are what the commander does;
systems
exist only to support the commander's needs. No matter how well we
understand our warfighting concepts or how well we can perform tactical
procedures, if we
do not utilize the right command and control processes or build the right
systems to support them, we are doomed to failure. By 1 January 1996, the
CG, MCCDC,
in conjunction with the AC/S Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
and Intelligence will develop and publish a doctrinal publication on
command and
control that institutionalizes this way of thinking about command and
control and establishes doctrine that our operating forces can execute.

<P>(7) Ground Combat.

<P>We will continue to pursue enhancements which maximize the capabilities of
our ground combat forces. The CG, MCCDC shall ensure the CDP reflects this
in our
MAGTF equipment assessment for POM-98.

<P>(a) We must explore the entire spectrum of technologies that provide and
enhance speed, protection, tactical mobility and lethality--all of which
maximize the
advantage and effects of maneuver. These include not only advanced
technologies for ship to shore movement, but also the technologies which
support Marines in
the field and emerging less-than-lethal capabilities. Their clothing and
individual equipment have a direct and immediate impact on survivability,
lethality, and mission
accomplishment. Every effort will be made to provide more durable, less
bulky, lighter, and more comfortable individual equipment. New combat
boots, infantry
shelters, and sleeping bags are part of the Individual Combat Clothing and
Equipment Program and are examples of what must receive continued emphasis.
But we
must also give individual Marines a capability they do not currently
possess such as "GPS Sensor packs," digital communications at the lowest
levels, fire-and-forget
weapon systems capable of taking out the most formidable opponents,
improved chemical and biological detection and protection equipment, and
non-lethal
systems effective across the entire spectrum of conflict. Getting our
Marines this new equipment is important and COMMARCORSYSCOM shall develop a
plan
to make this happen in time to influence the development of POM-98.

<P>(b) We must determine whether the current Ground Combat Element structure
and organization meet the needs of the Marine Corps of the future. With
advances in
technology, weapons systems, training and education and with a future
threat that remains unclear, we need to be sure that we are organized to be
ready, relevant,
and capable in the chaotic world of the 21st century. By 1 June 1996, CG,
MCCDC should be ready to answer the question we will ask all elements of
the
MAGTF: "Are we organized properly?"

<P>(8) Aviation. We must always keep in mind that the specific language in the
Congressional Conference Report called for both a ground AND air striking
force to be
"most ready when the nation . . . is least ready. . . to provide a balanced
force in readiness. . ." That will continue.

<P>(a) We will study and determine what the aviation requirements are to
support the Marine Corps of the future while maintaining our ability to
meet today's
commitments. Marine aviation will remain capable of providing effective
support to the MAGTF across the spectrum of conflict. To enhance the
MAGTFs
expeditionary utility, we will continue to reduce the number of
type/model/series aircraft with a goal of achieving an all short
takeoff/vertcal landing (STOVL)
aviation component while maintaining state of the art capabilities in air
to ground and air to air combat. Aviation modernization initiatives to
enhance night and
adverse weather effectiveness, to improve aircraft supportability,
reliability and maintainability, and to reduce strategic lift dependency
remain essential to meeting
warfighting requirements. To reach these goals, first, the DC/S Aviation
and the DC/S Plans, Policies and Operations will update the Department of
the Navy
Amphibious Lift and Air Support Requirements Study in light of the current
National Military Strategy, the Defense Planning Guidance and OMFTS.
Second, with
that update completed, by 1 March 1996, DC/S Aviation, DC/S Plans, Policies
and Operations, and CG, MCCDC will answer the question, "Are we organized
properly?" In these analyses, include the following considerations:

<P>1 With the shift in naval focus from open-ocean operations to operations in
the littoral, integration of Marine squadrons into carrier air wings, which
has ample
historical precedent, will continue to the extent it maximizes naval
aviation capabilities.

<P>2 At the same time, we must ensure that the unique capability which Marine
tactical aviation provides to the MAGTF--providing support to the ground
forces in an
expeditionary environment--remains the key signature of Marine Aviation.

<P>(b) The manning levels currently experienced within the Aviation combat
element are unacceptable. They degrade both our ability to support MAGTFs
and our
ability to meet our commitments, and they impact negatively on our Marines'
quality of life. At the same time, critical school seats are going vacant
which means that
manning shortfalls will not be corrected soon. We must fix this. As a "fast
track" element of the Assistant Commandant's evaluation of structure
sponsorship tasked
in paragraph 5a(3), DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs, DC/S Aviation, and
CG, MCCDC will address the recruiting, training, and manning of our
aviation force
and brief me by 1 November 1995 on what we must do to correct the problem.

<P>(9) Combat Service Support (CSS).

<P>Effective, self-sustained combat service support is crucial to success on
the battlefield. CSS must be capable of anticipating needs and responding
with the right
support at the right time in order to reduce the amount of materiel that
maneuver units c arry for themselves.

<P>(a) We must provide flexible, reliable, responsive, and dynamic combat
service support capabilities which are as mobile as maneuver forces. DC/S
Installations and
Logistics, in conjunction with CG, MARCORSYSCOM, will provide a brief no
later than 1 De cember 1995 on a long range plan to increase logistical
mobility
and reduce our logistical footprint.

<P>(b) CSS manning levels in some critical low-density Military Occupational
Specialties (MOSs) are a concern. The DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs,
in
conjunction with the DC/S Installations and Logistics, will examine all CSS
MOSs with a goal of conso lidating and shaping occupational fields to
produce
supportable manning and grade progression. This analysis and resultant
recommendation will be forwarded for review and approval by 1 January
1996.

<P>(c) Again, we must ask the question: "Are we organized properly?" By 1
March 1996, the CG, MCCDC, in conjunction with the DC/S Installations and
Logistics,
will provide an answer to this question with regard to CSS.

<P>(10) Bases and Stations.

<P>None of this matters if we don't provide adequate base infrastructure to
support our forces. The deterioration of the infrastructure of our bases
and stations--which
serve as our Marine aircraft carriers from which we launch our
expeditionary forces--is becoming untenable. We will refine our method of
assessing the shortfalls
and then develop a long term master plan for construction, repair, and
perpetual maintenance for all our bases. This is an issue which will
involve all hands, top to
bottom, in our Corps. It must consider all options: public, private,
contract, and self-help. If we don't solve these problems, it matters
little how we address the
others. We need to focus on this now or suffer the consequences. In
conjunction with appropriate members of the HQMC staff, the CG, MCCDC, and
the CGs of
our bases and stations, and utilizing analyses such as the Base and Station
Planning Group Report of September 1993 and the Long Range Planning Group
Study
(1993-1994), by 1 April 1996, DC/S Installations and Logistics will develop
a proposal for centralized, consistent direction, and oversight of our
facilities and
installations.

<P>(11) Materiel Management.

<P>The functional processes of DC/S Installations and Logistics, the
Commander, Marine Corps Logistics Bases, and COMMARCORSYSCOM present
potential
opportunities for collective streamlining, elimination of duplication, and
improved efficiency through organizational change in order to provide fully
integrated logistics
support to the Marine Corps. By 1 November 1995, the DC/S Installations and
Logistics will provide a plan to realize our full potential for responsive
materiel
management within the Marine Corps. The Materiel Planning Group (MATPG)
Report to the Commandant of January 1994 contained valuable insight into
current
processes and potential process change and should be utilized along with
other analysis ongoing at MCCDC in order to develop the plan. The issue of
collocation
of the involved organizations is not to be revisited.

<P><B>7. PREPARING THE FORCE</B>

<P>a. Background

<P>(1) History has shown that even in an era of diminishing resources, if we
stay highly trained and ready, we can survive both as individuals and as an
institution. It is
imperative that we never be found lacking in our capability or ability to
do what is expected or asked. During previous times of fiscal constraints,
the Marine Corps
has always turned to its training and education systems to keep its
warfighting edge. We must do that today. The use of simulation, virtual
reality, models, and
various warfighting games can make subsequent field training more
effective. We will pursue that kind of technology. In the same vein,
education must become
central to all Marines--not just for a select few, but for all. Education
is the foundation for a Marine Corps that can anticipate and adapt to the
changing world that
we are entering. Training and education must lead to better, more
effective, more adaptable Marines.

<P>(2) "Taking care of our Marines" means we will do everything we can to
ensure they are equipped mentally and physically for the rigors of combat.
To that end,
training and education will be focal points when decisions are made on
spending and in the assignment of personnel. It is my view that while
different, training and
education are inextricably linked. Training is primarily learning by doing.
Education denotes study and intellectual development. We will not train
without the
presence of education; we must not educate without the complementary
execution of well-conceived training. I link the two under "Preparing the
Force" to convey
my vision that success in any mission undertaken by the Corps will flow
directly from our ability both to train and educate every Marine.

<P>b. Intent.

<P>In the long history of conflict, we have learned that battles are more
often won or lost in the minds of the commanders than on the battlefields.
First and foremost,
our warfighting doctrine is an intellectual process which ultimately
attacks our opponent's decision-making and cohesion--his human factors. All
Marines must
understand that it is the human factors in combat which are decisive. All
of our preparations--the school curricula, the Commandant's reading list,
Marine self-study,
and all of our lessons learned--must reinforce this concept.

<P>(1) Our maneuver doctrine and its maritime application, OMFTS, make great
demands upon the men and women of our Corps. Most prominent among these
are
intellectual agility, individual initiative, rapid decision making, very
high quality small unit leadership, moral courage and strength of
character, flexibility in staff action
and command and control, decentralized execution, and a bias for decisive
action.

<P>(2) It is my intent in preparing the force that we account for these
demands by creating Marines and Marine leaders who have superb tactical
judgment and are
capable of rapid decision making under physical and emotional duress, who
possess the technical skills to translate judgments and decisions into
relevant orders and
staff actions which take advantage of fleeting opportunities, and who
possess dominant tactical and military expertise in the execution of orders
to achieve victory in
combat or success in operations short of war. The essential thing is
action; the decision born of thought, the order and preparation for
execution, and the execution
itself all reflecting profound excellence.

<P>c. Tasks.

<P>Preparing the force to win battles is critical. We have limited resources
and, therefore, we must get the maximum return on every dollar spent, every
Marine
assigned to instructional duties, and every minute of instruction. This
will require constancy of purpose, stability among faculty and trainers,
and an understanding of
education and learning theory.

<P>(1) In addition, if we, as a Corps, are to thrive on the decentralized,
dynamic battlefield, our leaders must possess a strength of character and
the sense of ethics and
integrity necessary to make decisions and take actions which will bring
about battlefield success. In all we do, in the recruitment, the accession,
the training, and the
professional military education of our leaders, character development must
be a constant. The CG, MCCDC and DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs will
provide a focus to these activities and develop a plan of action to be
briefed to me no later than 1 April 1996 for these concepts and
requirements.

<P>(2) I intend to put resources--manpower, money, and material--against these
crucial responsibilities. This support will not necessarily reflect net
additions, but rather
a redirection of current resources into more productive venues. I expect
trainers and educators to make maximum use of interactive training and
education.
Simulation and associated technologies and the use of video tapes or video
teleconferencing with live transmission to classrooms across the country,
to afloat forces,
and to forward deployed forces are only representative examples of what I
expect. Further, tactical decision games can be as effective at HQMC as in
the
operating forces in fostering judgment and decision making by leaders at
every level. These games help keep these i ntellectual skills honed even
while away from
the fleet. The CG, MCCDC will provide a focus and a plan of action for
these concepts and requirements and I ask that he brief me on this plan by
1 November
1995.

<P>(3) Commandant's Warfighting Laboratory. An ongoing program will be
established under the CG, MCCDC to serve as the cradle and test bed for
the
development of enhanced operational concepts, tactics, techniques,
procedures, and doctrine which will be progressively introduced into the
FMF in concert with
new technologies.

<P>(a) This program will serve as the integrating ground for new technologies
that we procure or develop with other services. It will provide a focal
point for warfighting
refinements while allowing me, as the Commandant, to accelerate and direct
specific efforts within the process of change. It will be the centerpiece
of operational
reform in the Marine Corps and will help ensure that emerging technologies
for the individual Marine are brought into service expeditiously and
effectively.

<P>(b) This "Warfighting Lab" shall be responsible for development, field
testing, and implementation of future operational and functional concepts,
and potential
doctrinal, organizational, training, educational, and support solutions.
Concepts which are validated will be entered into the CDP. The Commandant's
Warfighting
Lab, closely linked to the MAGTF Staff Training Program, will be a critical
engine to take us towards the 21st century. By 1 August 1995, the CG, MCCDC
will
provide a plan of action for the establishment of this lab. I desire it to
be operational by 1 October 1995.

<P>(4) It is my intent that we reach the stage where Marines come to work and
spend part of each day talking about warfighting: learning to think, making
decisions,
and being exposed to tactical and operational issues. My goal is to
encourage short discussions that make us think daily about our warfighting
philosophy and how
we are going to execute it, and I want those discussions to occur
regardless of MOS or current assignment or location. I consider this a
fundamental leadership
responsibility of every commander and staff supervisor. The CG, MCCDC will
develop a plan of action by 1 March 1996 to take us there. d. Training

<P>(1) Background.

<P>The CG, MCCDC is the Commandant's agent for training in the Marine Corps.
All trainers in the Marine Corps look to MCCDC for establishment of the
training
standards and training management policy necessary to plan and allocate
training resources, and to publish both individual and collective training
standards.

<P>(2) Intent

<P>(a) At every level, from the individual Marine to the MEF, we will train
the way we will fight. Officers are the key leaders in combat. However,
history has taught us
that a heavy leadership burden and a great deal of the fighting rests with
Marine SNCOs and NCOs. Therefore, while individual and unit training may be
centrally
planned, execution will be decentralized to the maximum extent and placed
far more in the hands of our SNCOs and NCOs. The role of the officer does
not
change. The role of our SNCOs and NCOs will be enhanced.

<P>(b) Training must be focused on winning in combat. Whenever possible,
training will be progressive and practical in nature. We must make the most
of every
learning opportunity in garrison before units go to the field. Training
must include appropriate background reading, Tactical Decision Games,
modeling and
simulation--where applicable and available--and exercises and critiques.
The latter are a particularly important part of all performance oriented
training. These are all
critical parts of our training effort.

<P>(3) Tasks

<P>(a) Efficiency.

<P>Vacant school seats are wasteful, inefficient, expensive, and unforgivable.
The CG, MCCDC, in conjunction with the DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs,
the
Marine Corps Recruiting Command, and the functional sponsors, with the
support of others as required, will lead a consolidated and comprehensive
attack to solve
this problem. I want a plan--not a study--completed by 1 February 1996.

<P>(b) Standards.

<P>Our training standards must closely approximate mission performance
standards in combat and will be derived from combat requirements. Standards
must account
for changes in the security environment, doctrine, and equipment and appear
in such a form as to be the principal tool used to determine readiness.
Units should not
train for the test. They should train for combat using these battle-tried
standards as their guide. In all we do, these standards will be considered
a baseline for
measuring unit combat readiness. Units will train for what we expect to
meet on the field of battle, on the field of peacekeeping, or on the field
of humanitarian
assistance.

<P>(c) MAGTF Staff Training.

<P>A major contributor to the preparation of Marine Corps battle staffs is the
MAGTF Staff Training Program (MSTP). Operating under the cognizance of the
CG,
MCCDC, the MSTP prepares and conducts instruction on MAGTF operations for
resident schools at MCCDC, for off-site instruction, and for battle staff
training
with the MAGTFs. The MSTP will continue in this role, ultimately becoming
the principal agent within the Marine Corps for instruction and training of
MAGTF
battle staffs, and where appropriate, the Joint Task Forces built around
MEU(SOC) and MEF headquarters. The MSTP will work closely with the Marine
Corps
University and the Marine Corps Presentation Team to ensure that its
efforts are fully integrated with resident and non-resident instruction,
with the development of
doctrine, and with the public and private articulation of Marine Corps
capabilities. The MSTP will represent the leading edge of our warfighting
thought, as well as
serving as a key mechanism for institutionalizing our lessons learned. The
CG, MCCDC will ensure that the positive momentum that exists now in the
MSTP
increases and that it is tied closely to the Commandant's Warfighting Lab.
The COMMARFORs will aggressively embrace the tremendous utility and
potential that
exists now in the MSTP, help make it better, and extend it to all of our
MAGTFs.

<P>(d) Combined Arms Exercises (CAX).

<P>No unit training is more important to our warfighting capabilities than the
CAX program. As a combined arms live-fire training area, the Marine Corps
Air-Ground
Combat Center (MCAGCC) provides us with a location and opportunity that are
of incalculable value to our Corps. My vision is to provide intense,
meaningful,
live-fire training to infantry battalions at MCAGCC. While the focus is on
the infantry battalion, I want the other MAGTF elements to receive equal
benefit from this
intense training evolution. One way to do that is to network the other
MAGTF elements through the Training Exercise Evaluation Control Group to
participate in a
broader exercise via simulation and interactive video. Using the
progressive "crawl, walk, run" approach, this training is vital to learning
the techniques and
procedures of fire support coordination in a live fire environment. We must
remain clear on the basic purpose of this fundamental training. Our
ultimate objective is
to destroy the enemy's will to fight. To do this, we will use fire and
maneuver to place him on the horns of a dilemma so that if he moves, we
will kill him and,
alternatively, if he chooses to remain in place, we will still kill him.
The ability to put "steel on target" is critical in achieving this
intermediate objective. We have much
to do to reach this goal, but we are moving in the right direction. What I
do not want to see is the piling on of forces and staffs at MCAGCC itself.
Use of
distributive interactive simulation can provide the same type of training
at much less cost. This is a task for CG, MCCDC, the COMMARFORs, and others
as
necessary to undertake with all the appropriate agencies.

<P>e. Professional Military Education (PME)

<P>(1) Background.

<P>The CG, MCCDC has overall responsibility for training and education, but
the President of the Marine Corps University (MCU) is the Commandant's
agent for
PME.

<P>(a) No development within the Corps in recent years has been more
revolutionary than that undertaken in PME. In its many forms, PME has been
embraced not
only by the officer corps, but significantly, by SNCOs and NCOs, and other
ranks as well. PME is the responsibility of every Marine and takes the form
of
professional reading, symposia participation, formal schools, and sharing
experiences gained through actual combat, military operations other than
war, and military
exercises.

<P>(b) Few military problems are without historical antecedents. Professional
study of past military campaigns will strengthen operational proficiency
and leadership,
stimulate interest in military history and tradition, and provoke thought
and discussion. Where before we trained to defeat a specific enemy, we
must--now and for
the foreseeable future--educate broadly enough to permit Marines at every
level to act with confidence and decisiveness across a wide range of
situations and
circumstances.

<P>(2) Intent.

<P>It is my intent that our PME and the focus of Marine self-education should
be oriented toward the development of judgment, decision making skills, and
an
understanding of the human factors in war such as the effects of fear,
deprivation, and fatigue. Marines must be broadly educated in joint and
combined operations,
able to function within the context of our doctrine, and possess the
intellectual agility to meet the full spectrum of challenges in the current
and projected security
environment.

<P>(3) Tasks

<P>(a) The President, Marine Corps University (MCU) will implement my intent
regarding PME. It will provide cohesion and focus for our schools through
a
comprehensive master plan for PME which serves the Marine "from cradle to
grave," encompassing all internal and external education opportunities
including
fellowships, advanced degree programs, other related programs, and
instructional duties with NROTC, the Naval Academy, the Marine Corps
University, and
other service schools.

<P>(b) Education will be part of the promotion process for both officers and
enlisted Marines. PME--either resident or non-resident--must be available
for all Marines,
both active and reserve. I want to reinforce the link between PME and
advancement in grade and responsibility in our Corps, because education is
key in furthering
the development of our best Marines. It is imperative that those being
considered for the responsibilities of the next senior grade have the
requisite foundation of
knowledge to ensure continued success. By 1 March 1996, the DC/S Manpower
and Reserve Affairs, in conjunction with the CG, MCCDC and the President,
MCU shall develop a plan which ensures that the PME program and its support
requirements are sufficient to provide the opportunity for all Marines to
acquire this
essential educational foundation prior to advancement in grade and
responsibility.

<P>(c) The President, MCU will continue to integrate the curricula of our
schools and continue to coordinate the educational requirements of Marines,
both officer and
enlisted, serving in the operating forces and the support establishment.

<P>(d) Professional reading is an important aspect of PME. I strongly support
efforts underway by CG, MCCDC to rejuvenate and revise our professional
reading
program. This must be a matter of some urgency. The CG, MCCDC, in
conjunction with the Director of Public Affairs, will include a plan to
reintroduce this
important program to the Marine Corps.

<P>(e) I strongly support the Commanders' Course and its associated workshop
for the spouses of our commanders. The President, MCU will continue to
improve
and enhance this critical program.

<P><B>8. DOCTRINE</B>

<P>a. Background.

<P>Doctrine represents the fundamental teachings of a profession; yet, our
doctrine development is fragmented.

<P>b. Intent.

<P>At present, our concepts are not as well-linked to tactics, techniques, and
procedures as they must be. Doctrine is that link and it must be developed
in a timely
manner.

<P>c. Tasks.

<P>The President, MCU will be my lead agent for ensuring that concept and
doctrine development are synchronized. That means we need to revise the
relationship
between the MCU and the Doctrine Division at MCCDC. By 1 September 1995,
the CG, MCCDC, in conjunction with DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs, is
to provide a solution to this and the following requirements:

<P>(1) We will participate in, fully support, and help shape the efforts of
the Naval Doctrine Command. We must also maintain an active role in the
joint and combined
doctrinal publication process to ensure the representation of Marine Corps
interests.

<P>(2) We must ensure that those chosen to write doctrine are students of, and
expert practitioners of, our profession. They must be Marines who have had
sufficient
experience to apply new and emerging concepts.

<P>(3) Proponency. CG, MCCDC, with the President MCU in the lead, will
delineate functional proponents for the preparation of our doctrine. These
proponents will
be those Marine Corps agencies, or those Marine Corps elements attached to
other service agencies, most closely connected to developments taking place
with
tactics, techniques, and procedures. These proponents must have clear
connections to concept development at MCCDC and to evolutions in functional
applications
of those concepts in the field. Centralized management by CG, MCCDC is
essential to ensure that those with the expertise best suited to maintain
doctrine have the
tools and the charter to do so. In all cases, COMMARFORS will be active
participants. The goal is to keep our doctrine viable and current.

<P><B>9. ACQUISITION</B>

<P>a. Background.

<P>Through the acquisition process, the Marine Corps procures equipment and
combat systems to support the warfighting requirements that are identified
and validated
through the CDP. The CDP, among other things, determines operational
requirements for new equipment and, in effect, drives the Marine Corps
acquisition
process.

<P>b. Intent.

<P>The acquisition process, while constrained by the fiscal environment, must
be responsive to the needs of the Marine Forces and must be tied tightly to
the concept
based requirements system. To ensure its continued success, we must fine
tune the relationships and communications between the responsible agencies.
Our
strategy must ensure the procurement of those items most critical to the
effective modernization of the Marine Corps equipment inventory. The goal
is to define a
long range, strategic approach to acquisition and the modernization of the
Marine Corps.

<P>c. Tasks.

<P>By 1 July 1996, the CG, MCCDC, in conjunction with COMMARCORSYSCOM and
other appropriate agencies, will develop a comprehensive plan that
inculcates modeling and simulation into our concept based requirements
system in a manner that facilitates well-pla nned investments while
retaining the capability to
react rapidly to unforeseen requirements.

<P>(1) The CG, MCCDC is now and will continue to be responsible for the
implementation, execution, and management of the CDP including coordination
with those
HQMC agencies that contribute to combat development and COMMARFORS on
matters pertaining to combat development.

<P>(2) The Marine Corps Systems Command serves as the sole organization
responsible for the execution of acquisition program management during
research and
development (R&D), and procurement of all ground tactical weapon systems
and equipment. The COMMARCORSYSCOM will coordinate with the CG,
MCCDC to ensure that all acquisition programs are developed to fulfill
requirements validated by the CDP.

<P>(3) Just as everything else starts with the individual Marine, so does
acquisition. I want a concept for equipping the rifleman for the 21st
century that ensures he will
be able to fight and win. We will start our acquisition process for our
individual Marines by studying the one-time issue of "782 gear." I am
convinced there is a
better way to provide our Marines the required personal equipment at less
cost to the Corps and our unit commanders. I know we have studied one time
issue of
"782 gear" and centralized issue points, but in each case, these have been
all or nothing considerations done in the context of our current
procedures. The DC/S
Installations and Logistics is to examine alternatives that consider
changing the process as well as the proc edures. We may find that certain
items should become
issue items vice organizational property, some could be one time issue or
handled at central issue points, and some could become consumable items. By
1 January
1996, DC/S Installations and Logistics will develop a proposal that
achieves the objective to implement the best policies at the least cost.

<P>(4) The COMMARCORSYSCOM will evaluate how we can improve the basic
equipment of our Marines, establish a rapid procurement profile to get the
right
gear in the hands of our Marines, and provide a proposal by 1 October
1995.

<P>(5) We must update and resolve the management of our Tables of Equipment
and resultant equipment distribution so we can better understand our
materiel
readiness and related acquisition requirements. The DC/S Installations and
Logistics, in conjunction with the CG, MCCDC and the functional sponsors,
will forward
a plan by 1 January 1996 which addresses this critical management issue.

<P>(6) Service unique programs should be pursued only when required to support
Marine Corps specific operational requirements.

<P>(7) Wherever practical, we should pursue multi-purpose equipment that
increases our flexibility. The COMMARCORSYSCOM shall pursue the development
and
procurement of multi-purpose systems as we are doing with the Javelin
Program and our multi-mission aviation platforms.

<P><B>10. LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS</B>

<P>a. Background.

<P>Our major goal each fiscal year is to ensure congressional support of all
Marine Corps programs in the Department of Defense and President's budget.
Marine
Corps actions are coordinated through the HQMC Office of Legislative
Affairs (OLA). Legislative initiatives are normally focused in three areas:
orientation
programs for Members and their staffs, legislative liaison involving
crucial programs, and constituent issues.

<P>b. Intent.

<P>Our success with the Congress is the direct result of our credibility and
the effectiveness of our interaction with the members and staffs.
Characteristically open,
honest, and candid, this effectiveness has always been enhanced by allowing
the individual Marine--the lieutenant and the lance corporal--to speak
about and for
their Corps and by encouraging members to observe Marines doing what
Marines do. That will not change.

<P>c. Tasks

<P>(1) The Marine Corps will have a legislative campaign plan that ensures
coordination between Public Affairs (PA) and all general officers and which
consistently
reiterates and reinforces our various legislative positions. This plan will
be updated annually to coincide with the legislative sessions and will
identify key issues,
audiences, and internal and external communication means to be used
throughout the Marine Corps. The Director, OLA will develop a plan by 1
December 1995.

<P>(2) The ongoing effort to educate members and staffs about our roles and
capabilities must consist not only of briefings, but on-site visits to
field exercises and base
facilities. Active participation and observation by Members and their
staffs are vital to their understanding the needs of the Corps. Director
OLA, in conjunction with
DC/S Plans, Policies and Operations, and with input from the Dir, PA, will
be responsible for incorporating this in the legislative campaign plan.

<P>(3) Our assistance to Congress on constituent and other issues is
important. All commanders must remain aware of the requirement for prompt,
accurate, and
concise replies to legislative inquiries coordinated through the Director,
OLA.

<P><B>11. PUBLIC AFFAIRS</B>

<P>a. Background.

<P>The media is an increasingly important part of our national fabric and our
democratic process.

<P>b. Intent.

<P>Our policy is clear: honesty, openness, and accessibility to the maximum
extent possible consistent with the demands of national security. We will
take full advantage
of the variety of both internal (personal visits, awards, Marine Corps
Reserve organizations, Marine Corps League, and the Navy League) and
external (press
conferences, interviews, editorial boards, public speaking, and articles)
communication opportunities. As with our legislative initiatives, our best
spokesmen and
women are, and will continue to be, individual Marines demonstrating their
capabilities and speaking for and about their Corps. Our goal is to provide
an informed
perspective concerning Marine Corps capabilities, programs, and intentions
to develop a foundation of public understanding and support for our
requirements.

<P>c. Tasks

<P>(1) Our Public Affairs efforts must not, and will not, be limited to the
Washington, D.C. area. The Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps,
working closely
with OLA, MARFORRES, and PA, will to develop plans to expand our existing
programs throughout the country utilizing the recruiting and reserve
infrastructure
to re-invigorate "grass roots" support for the Marine Corps. The POA&M to
reach this goal should be ready by 1 January 1996.

<P>(2) The Headquarters and every major subordinate command will have a media
campaign plan that ensures coordination between Public Affairs, OLA, and
all
general officers to consistently reiterate and reinforce our capabilities
and objectives. This plan, which will be used throughout the Total Force
Marine Corps, will be
updated quarterly and will identify key issues, audiences, and selected
media to ensure that we convey an accurate and consistent message.

<P>(3) The capability to permit and support news media coverage must be
planned at all levels of activities. We must be prepared to meet, brief,
escort, transport, and
host media personnel to ensure coverage opportunities and accurate content.
All Marines represent the Marine Corps and must be prepared for
opportunities to tell
our story. Therefore, public affairs and media interview training
initiatives will be developed at every major subordinate command. A
progress report on these
initiatives should be presented by 1 January 1996, coordinated by the
Director, Public Affairs.

<P>(4) The whole dimension of public information about the Marine Corps--using
both print and electronic media--will be coordinated by the Dir, PA. This
will include
the coordination of speakers, public appearances, topic selection, and
presentation. As well, Public Affairs will support our speakers bureau with
materials
calculated to make the greatest impact for distribution at the site (for
example, draft remarks given by other members of the speakers bureau on
related subjects,
multiple copies of Marine Corps informational documents, and advertising
and recruiting materials).

<P><B>12. PEOPLE</B>

<P>a. Background.

<P>I have left my guidance for personnel issues to the end for a specific
reason: everything starts and ends with the individual Marine. The
principal challenge facing the
Marine Corps today lies in continuing to fulfill its charter as an
expeditionary force in readiness with a leaner force structure and with
fewer Marines. Because
Marines are the centerpiece of the Corps, how we recruit them, train them,
instill in them our core values and a sense of integrity and
accountability, equip them to
do their jobs, and treat them with dignity, care, and concern must be our
principal emphasis.

<P>b. Intent.

<P>Our ability to win battles boils down, as it always has, to our Marines.
The most important thing we do in the Marine Corps is make Marines. The
individual Marine
IS the Corps.

<P>(1) Because Marines are our most precious asset, we will protect them
through fair, scrupulous, and unbiased treatment as individuals--caring for
them, teaching
them, and leading them. I see it as the obligation of each member of the
chain of command, from top to bottom, to ensure that this sense of fairness
is constant and
genuine. I expect commanders to take prompt and vigorous action wherever
any violation of this obligation is discovered. Simply stated, I expect
every Marine to
treat every other Marine with dignity.

<P>(2) Leadership is a core competency--in our officers, in our SNCOs, and in
our NCOs. The 30th Commandant's capstone leadership manual, FMFM 1-0,
"Leading Marines," provides superb guidance for us all in this area.

<P>(3) I expect Marines to epitomize that which is good about our nation and
to personify the ideals upon which it was founded. I do not intend for
"honor, courage,
and commitment" to be just words; I expect them to frame the way we live
and act as Marines. There is no room in the Marine Corps for situational
ethics or
situational morality; those found wanting will be held accountable.

<P>(4) I want to be absolutely clear that, outside the areas of morality and
ethics, Marines can make mistakes as long as they learn from those mistakes
and move on to
accomplish their mission. In areas not involving character, we must
continue to work to remove the last vestiges of a "zero defects" mentality.
We must be allowed
to err in peacetime to ensure we do not err in combat. We will not be able
to survive if we do otherwise.

<P>(5) A sense of fairness is key to our manpower processes--recruiting,
classification, assignment, promotion, education, re-enlistment, and,
eventually, retirement. I
am committed to making these processes work for each Marine, as well as the
institution. DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs is tasked with continually
reviewing
these processes to ensure fairness in all areas.

<P>(6) Taking care of Our Own. This has long been a hallmark of our Corps,
and, as has been said before, the best way to take care of our Marines is
to bring them
back alive from combat. Therefore, funding equipment, readiness, and
training that will enable us to succeed on the battlefield is the first way
that we take care of
our own. "Taking care of our own" also means seeing to the well-being of
our Marine families and of our Marines when they are "back home." Adequate
housing
and MWR facilities will be a key factor in the earlier tasking for
centralized oversight of facilities and installations. As we work toward an
overall improvement in
housing, our junior Marines will be our first concern.

<P>(a) I support the Key Volunteer Program as an essential element in ensuring
the well-being of our Marines and their families. Family Service Centers
will continue to
be supported as the main mechanisms through which a variety of programs
will be provided to our single and married Marines. For medical services
and child care,
we will examine establishing priorities for service and care based on
genuine need, with special consideration going to junior Marines.

<P>(b) Taking care of our own also includes recognizing the men and women who
serve honorably in our units. When our Marines move on, whether to a new
duty
station, a discharge back to civilian life, or to retirement, I expect
supervisors and commanders at all levels to spend as least as much effort
thanking those who have
rendered faithful service as they do welcoming "new Marines" to their
organizations.

<P>(7) Marines have always been physically and mentally tough. We must keep
squarely in our sights the fact that toughness can be decisive in combat.

<P>c. Manpower Management Policies

<P>(1) Background.

<P>Manpower actions are managed to ensure the readiness of our units while
limiting the adverse impact on individual Marines.

<P>(2) Intent.

<P>Manpower management requires a personal touch as we continue to recruit,
train, assign, and retain the right men and women. One of our goals is the
reduction of
non-EAS attrition. Other goals, including the current campaigns focused on
increasing diversity within the officer corps and revising women Marine
assignment
policies, will remain a priority.

<P>(3) Tasks

<P>(a) If we are going to recruit the right people--the lifeblood of our
Corps--we must provide those who recruit them with all the resources they
need. Our recruiters
are truly at the forefront of making Marines, and they are there every day,
365 days a year. I recognize how important their mission is to the future
of the Corps and
they deserve rewards commensurate with their sacrifice and success. Aside
from ensuring that they have adequate professional resources to accomplish
their
mission, we must provide our enlisted recruiters with an increased
opportunity for meritorious promotion. Recruiting Station Commanding
Officers, Executive
Officers, Operations Officers, and Officer Selection Officers will have a
choice of school or duty station upon completion of a successful tour in
recruiting. The
DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs will implement this policy immediately
and will develop a set of proposals which recognize and reward the
critical
contributions and sacrifices the recruiters and their families make to
their Corps.

<P>(b) Recruiters are, of course, only the first Marines that our new
enlistees contact. I am mindful of the vital role played by our Drill
Instructors as they help civilians
transition into our Corps. Their role in imbuing recruits and officer
candidates with what it means to be a Marine is central to a vibrant and
healthy Marine Corps.
DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs shall ensure that the sacrifices of our
Drill Instructors are similarly recognized alongside our recruiters.

<P>(c) The needs of the Corps will continue to drive our recruitment and
selection process. Our objective will always be to provide opportunities
for all members of our
society who wish to join our ranks and enable them to compete on an equal
footing. Our proud history and tradition has shown that young men and women
can
meet our demanding standards. Therefore, DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs
will develop programs to help prospective applicants meet enlistment
standards,
young Marines to meet non-commissioned officer standards, and
undergraduates to meet commissioning standards.

<P>(d) Non-EAS attrition is a sea anchor on a Marine Corps moving at battle
speed. Every year we lose one-third of our first term force before they
complete their
first enlistment. The drag this has on our recruiters, our entry level
training pipeline, and our entire manpower management process has gone on
too long. It is a drain
on our personnel and fiscal resources that we will no longer accept. The
DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs will spearhead a comprehensive effort
that includes
the FMF and supporting establishment to develop a plan which reduces
non-EAS attrition. I do not want another study. I want a plan. This effort
must incorporate
a new look at everything from how we prepare Marines for entry level
training, to our entry level training process, to how we bring Marines on
board when they
check-in to a unit, to who leads and how we lead our young Marines, to the
creation of a "learning organization" that underscores how we "take care of
our own."
The results of this effort, and those listed in the preceding paragraphs,
are to be briefed by 1 January 1996.

<P>(e) We are about to transition to an entirely reserve officer accession and
commissioning program. This means that within 2 to 4 years, we will select
100 percent of
our future career officer corps through the augmentation process. This will
be a critical transition, one that we must accomplish correctly. The DC/S
Manpower and
Reserve Affairs will develop a selection process that properly defines and
shapes the Marine Corps officer corps and present a "first look" briefing
on the progress
of this effort prior to the 1995 General Officer Symposium.

<P>(f) Command. Nothing is more important than command. Our Command Screening
Program is designed to ensure that Marines and Marine units are led by the
best
qualified and available officers in the Corps. That is where I expect them
to serve because our Marines deserve nothing less. Those officers who are
not afforded an
opportunity to command still have an important role to play in our Corps. I
recognize the deleterious effect that the current program may have on
individuals and, by
extension, on our Corps. I expect that our assignment and promotion system
will recognize the contributions and the sacrifices every Marine officer
makes to ensure
the security of our nation. With that in mind, the DC/S Manpower and
Reserve Affairs will look at how we can optimize this critically important
process. In this
effort, we must ensure we establish the right relationship between
selection for command and selection for PME. This is a discussion item for
the 1995 General
Officer Symposium.

<P>(g) Unit Cohesion. A four-to-five year tour in a single geographical area
that minimizes the turbulence in both command and staff billets and
facilitates the assignment
of Marines to split tours in an FMF unit and with the supporting
establishment are my goals. This stabilization and cross-pollination will
improve support to both and
will enhance unit cohesion. Longer tours would also provide less turbulence
for Marine families and minimize the number of geographical bachelors. The
DC/S
Manpower and Reserve Affairs will evaluate the impact of changing these
assignment policies and provide a recommendation prior to the 1995 General
Officer
Symposium.

<P>(h) Manning. We must come to grips with the manning problems experienced in
the operating forces. Presently, fleet and operational commands are manned
on a
"pro share" basis. We know what our mission is: responding to crises and
being prepared to win when we get there. We will make our operational
forces that
accomplish this mission the focus of our effort. To do that, we must
consider more than just a change in staffing precedence. We must conduct a
zero-based review
of our excepted and priority billets that examines our manning requirements
from a long-term perspective. The DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs will
evaluate
the impact of changing our staffing precedence and develop a comprehensive
solution to these problems for discussion at the 1995 General Officer
Symposium.

<P>(i) Fitness Reports. There are shortcomings in our current Performance
Evaluation System. There also is a growing lack of faith of our Marines in
the system's ability
to accurately identify their skills and potential. This is the focus of an
on-going study. The DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs will take the
findings of this study
and, by 1 January 1996, develop a plan to fix this problem.

<P>(j) None of the foregoing will interfere with the most effective use of our
Marines. We will get back in the business of "managing" the assignments of
our Marines
rather than just "monitoring" them and ensure that, if necessary for the
good of the Corps, we take the extraordinary steps necessary to solve tough
problems. The
institution and the individual Marine deserve no less.

<P>(k) Civilian Employees. Our civilian employees, like their active-duty
counterparts, are subject to mandated reductions. A recent study identified
significant
shortages in civilian manning and, like the operating forces, no apparent
decrease in commitments. This is true in a reas such as environmental and
child care
programs. We will carefully manage when and where civilian manpower
reductions occur to ensure continued supporting establishment support to
tenant
commands. By 1 July 1996, DC/S Manpower and Reserve Affairs will ensure
we:

<P>1 Make the civilian manpower plan fully responsive to the operating
forces.

<P>2 Focus our civilian assets on core functions using consolidation and
contracted support where cost effective.

<P>3 Develop strategies to streamline management, to monitor career patterns,
and to ensure equal opportunity for all employees.

<P>4 Develop opportunities for civilian training and career development. We
will do for our civilian employees what we do for our Marines.

<P><B>13. SUMMARY GUIDANCE</B>

<P>a. This is a comprehensive document. It must be so in order to adequately
frame the actions needed to bring the future direction of the Corps to
fruition. I do have
priorities--a focus of action. These are:

<P>(1) Securing the adequate resources needed to sustain the Marine Corps'
warfighting capability. This means developing and implementing an optimal
organization
that enhances the effectiveness of HQMC and MCCDC in the PPBS and other
deliberative processes within the Department of Defense.

<P>(2) Ensuring that our manpower management processes and policies are fair
to our Marines and to the Marine Corps in which they serve--and that they
are
understood to be so. While doing this, we must look for new, more effective
ways to manage our structure and man our units. It also means we must
reduce
non-EAS attrition.

<P>(3) Making our education and training processes and institutions
technologically innovative, challenging, and fun. While doing this, we must
not forget that our
maneuver doctrine is also a way of thinking that can help us derive
imaginative solutions to the challenges we face at our bases and stations
and in our administrative
headquarters as often as it does to tactical and operational tasks and
missions. Using our maneuver warfare doctrine in a wide range of practical
applications will
help keep our warfighting edge.

<P>(4) Establishing the Commandant's Warfighting Lab as the crucible for
operational and technological innovation for the Marine Corps.

<P>(5) Establishing a CONUS-based, world class JTFHQ capability and developing
JTF command and control capabilities for our MEU(SOC)s.

<P>While I will be working these issues personally, my interest will not
diminish in the other important initiatives I have discussed. From time to
time, I will update these
priorities.

<P>b. This guidance provides a sense of what is intended to be accomplished
within the Marine Corps. In some cases, it details specific actions and due
dates. These
taskings are intended to provide a general sense for relative priorities. I
fully recognize and expect the Commanders, Deputy Chiefs of Staff,
Directors, and others
requiring action in this CPG to evaluate taskings for interrelationships,
appropriate sequencing and timing. Adjustments will be authorized as
necessary to ensure a
logical and reasonable progression in our collective efforts. Where
required, notify the Director of the Marine Corps Staff of necessary
adjustments to specific
taskings.

<P>c. Within 30 days, the Director of the Marine Corps Staff will develop a
plan of action and milestones reflecting this guidance with the necessary
reports and
progress checks. There are, of course, other required actions found in
other plans, studies, and Marine Corps orders or publications. Implementing
actions for those
will occur in the normal course of events and will take place at all Marine
Forces and supporting units, organizations, and activities. All Marines
need to understand
what needs to be done. When they do, I expect they will actively contribute
to the solutions. Through a Corps-wide effort, we will continue to make
Marines and
win the nation's battles.

<P>d. This is our opportunity, collectively, to move forward and build on the
foundation established by my predecessors. We will continually survey the
horizon to see if
we are where we expected to be and re-evaluate where we are headed. We will
move out smartly to maintain our momentum while examining every facet of
our
Corps--from doctrine to equipment to personnel--to ensure we are as ready
tomorrow as we are today. The American people want a Corps of Marines who
will
accomplish any task, do their duty, fight, and win. We owe them nothing
less.

<P>e. In the final analysis, my guidance simply is to be prepared to fight, on
the shortest notice, under any circumstances of weather or resistance, in
conflicts large or
small. Be prepared to integrate Marine combat power smoothly into the
overall matrix of other U.S. services or other nations. Be prepared, in
conjunction with the
U.S. Navy, to project power from the sea. Be ever mindful of technological
opportunities to enhance combat proficiency and to promote logistic
economy. Be also
mindful of the deep meaning in Title 10 of the U.S. Code of the requirement
that Marines shall be prepared to discharge "such other duties as the
President may
direct," whatever those duties may be. But, most of all, be prepared to
fight and win.</P>

<H3>1. Introduction</H3>
<P>
The prosecution of a successful Information Warfare (IW) campaign against an industrialised or post industrial opponent will require a suitable set of tools. As demonstrated in the Desert Storm air campaign, air power has proven to be a most effective means of inhibiting the functions of an opponent's vital information processing infrastructure. This is because air power allows concurrent or parallel engagement of a large number of targets over geographically significant areas [SZAFRANSKI95].
<P>
While Desert Storm demonstrated that the application of air power was the most practical means of crushing an opponent's information processing and transmission nodes, the need to physically destroy these with guided munitions absorbed a substantial proportion of available air assets in the early phase of the air campaign. Indeed, the aircraft capable of delivery laser guided bombs were largely occupied with this very target set during the first nights of the air battle.
<P>
The efficient execution of an IW campaign against a modern industrial or post-industrial opponent will require the use of specialised tools designed to destroy information systems. Electromagnetic bombs built for this purpose can provide, where delivered by suitable means, a very effective tool for this purpose.
<P>
<H3>2.The EMP Effect </H3>
<P>
The ElectroMagnetic Pulse (EMP) effect <A HREF="#1">[1]</A> was first observed during the early testing of high altitude airburst nuclear weapons [GLASSTONE64]. The effect is characterised by the production of a very short (hundreds of nanoseconds) but intense electromagnetic pulse, which propagates away from its source with ever diminishing intensity, governed by the theory of electromagnetism. The ElectroMagnetic Pulse is in effect an electromagnetic shock wave.
<P>
This pulse of energy produces a powerful electromagnetic field, particularly within the vicinity of the weapon burst. The field can be sufficiently strong to produce short lived transient voltages of thousands of Volts (ie kiloVolts) on exposed electrical conductors, such as wires, or conductive tracks on printed circuit boards, where exposed.
<P>
It is this aspect of the EMP effect which is of military significance, as it can result in irreversible damage to a wide range of electrical and electronic equipment, particularly computers and radio or radar receivers. Subject to the electromagnetic hardness of the electronics, a measure of the equipment's resilience to this effect, and the intensity of the field produced by the weapon, the equipment can be irreversibly damaged or in effect electrically destroyed.  The damage inflicted is not unlike that experienced through exposure to close proximity lightning strikes, and may require complete replacement of the equipment, or at least substantial portions thereof.
<P>
Commercial computer equipment is particularly vulnerable to EMP effects, as it is largely built up of high density Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) devices, which are very sensitive to exposure to high voltage transients. What is significant about MOS devices is that very little energy is required to permanently wound or destroy them, any voltage in typically in excess of tens of Volts can produce an effect termed gate breakdown which effectively destroys the device. Even if the pulse is not powerful enough to produce thermal damage, the power supply in the equipment will readily supply enough energy to complete the destructive process. Wounded devices may still function, but their reliability will be seriously impaired. Shielding electronics by equipment chassis provides only limited protection, as any cables running in and out of the equipment will behave very much like antennae, in effect guiding the high voltage transients into the equipment.
<P>
Computers used in data processing systems, communications systems, displays, industrial control applications, including road and rail signalling, and those embedded in military equipment, such as signal processors, electronic flight controls and digital engine control systems, are all potentially vulnerable to the EMP effect.
<P>
Other electronic devices and electrical equipment may also be destroyed by the EMP effect. Telecommunications equipment can be highly vulnerable, due to the presence of lengthy copper cables between devices. Receivers of all varieties are particularly sensitive to EMP, as the highly sensitive miniature high frequency transistors and diodes in such equipment are easily destroyed by exposure to high voltage electrical transients. Therefore radar and electronic warfare equipment, satellite, microwave, UHF, VHF, HF and low band communications equipment and television equipment are all potentially vulnerable to the EMP effect.
<P>
It is significant that modern military platforms are densely packed with electronic equipment, and unless these platforms are well hardened, an EMP device can substantially reduce their function or render them unusable. 
<P>
<H3>3. The Technology Base for Conventional Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
The technology base which may be applied to the design of electromagnetic bombs is both diverse, and in many areas quite mature. Key technologies which are extant in the area are explosively pumped Flux Compression Generators (FCG), explosive or propellant driven Magneto-Hydrodynamic (MHD) generators and a range of HPM devices, the foremost of which is the Virtual Cathode Oscillator or Vircator. A wide range of experimental designs have been tested in these technology areas, and a considerable volume of work has been published in unclassified literature.
<P>
This paper will review the basic principles and attributes of these technologies, in relation to bomb and warhead applications. It is stressed that this treatment is not exhaustive, and is only intended to illustrate how the technology base can be adapted to an operationally deployable capability.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=" pulses.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
<H3>3.1. Explosively Pumped Flux Compression Generators</H3>
<P>
The explosively pumped FCG is the most mature technology applicable to bomb designs. The FCG was first demonstrated by Clarence Fowler at Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL) in the late fifties [FOWLER60]. Since that time a wide range of FCG configurations has been built and tested, both in the US and the USSR, and more recently CIS.
<P>
The FCG is a device capable of producing electrical energies of tens of MegaJoules in tens to hundreds of microseconds of time, in a relatively compact package. With peak power levels of the order of TeraWatts to tens of TeraWatts, FCGs may be used directly, or as one shot pulse power supplies for microwave tubes. To place this in perspective, the current produced by a large FCG is between ten to a thousand times greater than that produced by a typical lightning stroke [WHITE78].
<P>
The central idea behind the construction of FCGs is that of using a fast explosive to rapidly compress a magnetic field, transferring much energy from the explosive into the magnetic field. 
<P>
The initial magnetic field in the FCG prior to explosive initiation is produced by a start current. The start current is supplied by an external source, such a a high voltage capacitor bank (Marx bank), a smaller FCG or an MHD device. In principle, any device capable of producing a pulse of electrical current of the order of tens of kiloAmperes to MegaAmperes will be suitable.
<P>
A number of geometrical configurations for FCGs have been published (for examples see REINOVSKY85, CAIRD85, FOWLER89) The most commonly used arrangement is that of the helical FCG. The helical arrangement is of particular interest in this context, as its essentially cylindrical form factor lends itself to packaging into munitions.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=" coaxfcg.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
In a typical helical FCG , a cylindrical copper tube forms the armature. This tube is filled with a fast high energy explosive. A number of explosive types have been used, ranging from B and C-type compositions to machined blocks of PBX-9501. The armature is surrounded by a helical coil of heavy wire, typically copper, which forms the FCG stator. The stator winding is in some designs split into segments, with wires bifurcating at the boundaries of the segments, to optimise the electromagnetic inductance of the armature coil.
<P>
The intense magnetic forces produced during the operation of the FCG could potentially cause the device to disintegrate prematurely if not dealt with. This is typically accomplished by the addition of a structural jacket of a non-magnetic material. Materials such as concrete or Fibreglass in an Epoxy matrix have been used. In principle, any material with suitable electrical and mechanical properties could be used. In applications where weight is an issue, such as air delivered bombs or missile warheads, a glass or Kevlar Epoxy composite would be a viable candidate.
<P>
It is typical that the explosive is initiated when the start current peaks.  This is usually accomplished with a explosive lense plane wave generator which produces a uniform plane wave burn (or detonation) front in the explosive. Once initiated, the front propagates through the explosive in the armature, distorting it into a conical shape (typically 12 to 14 degrees of arc). Where the armature has expanded to the full diameter of the stator, it forms a short circuit between the ends of the stator coil, shorting and thus isolating the start current source and trapping the current within the device. The propagating short has the effect of compressing the magnetic field, whilst reducing the inductance of the stator winding. The result is that such generators will producing a ramping current pulse, which peaks before the final disintegration of the device. Published results suggest ramp times of tens to hundreds of microseconds, specific to the characteristics of the device, for peak currents of tens of MegaAmperes and peak energies of tens of MegaJoules. 
<P>
The current multiplication (ie ratio of output current to start current) achieved varies with designs, but numbers as high as 60 have been demonstrated. In a munition application, where space and weight are at a premium, the smallest possible start current source is desirable. These applications can exploit cascading of FCGs, where a small FCG is used to prime a larger FCG with a start current. Experiments conducted by LANL and AFWL have demonstrated the viability of this technique [KIRTLAND94, REINOVSKY85].
<P>
The principal technical issues in adapting the FCG to weapons applications lie in packaging, the supply of start current, and matching the device to the intended load. Interfacing to a load is simplified by the coaxial geometry of helical and conical FCG designs. Significantly, this geometry is convenient for weapons applications, where FCGs may be stacked axially with devices such a microwave Vircators. The demands of a load such as a Vircator, in terms of waveform shape and timing, can be satisfied by inserting pulse shaping networks, transformers and explosive high current switches.
<P>
<H3>3.2. Explosive and Propellant Driven MHD Generators</H3>
<P>
The design of explosive and propellant driven Magneto-Hydrodynamic generators is a much less mature art that that of FCG design. Technical issues such as the size and weight of magnetic field generating devices required for the operation of MHD generators suggest that MHD devices will play a minor role in the near term. In the context of this paper, their potential lies in areas such as start current generation for FCG devices.
<P>
The fundamental principle behind the design of MHD devices is that a conductor moving through a magnetic field will produce an electrical current transverse to the direction of the field and the conductor motion. In an explosive or propellant driven MHD device, the conductor is a plasma of ionised explosive or propellant gas, which travels through the magnetic field. Current is collected by electrodes which are in contact with the plasma jet [FANTHOME89].
<P>
The electrical properties of the plasma are optimised by seeding the explosive or propellant with with suitable additives, which ionise during the burn [FANTHOME89, FLANAGAN81]. Published experiments suggest that a typical arrangement uses a solid propellant gas generator, often using conventional ammunition propellant as a base. Cartridges of such propellant can be loaded much like artillery rounds, for multiple shot operation.

<H3>3.3. High Power Microwave Sources - The Vircator</H3>
<P>
Whilst FCGs are potent technology base for the generation of large electrical power pulses, the output of the FCG is by its basic physics constrained to the frequency band below 1 MHz. Many target sets will be difficult to attack even with very high power levels at such frequencies, moreover focussing the energy output from such a device will be problematic. A HPM device overcomes both of the problems, as its output power may be tightly focussed and it has a much better ability to couple energy into many target types.
<P>
A wide range of HPM devices exist. Relativistic Klystrons, Magnetrons, Slow Wave Devices, Reflex triodes and Vircators are all examples of the available technology base [GRANATSTEIN87, HOEBERLING92]. From the perspective of a bomb or warhead designer, the device of choice will be at this time the Vircator. This is because the Vircator is a one shot device capable of producing a very powerful single pulse of radiation, yet it is mechanically simple, small and robust, and can operate over a relatively broad band of microwave frequencies.
<P>
The physics of the Vircator tube are substantially more complex than those of the preceding devices. The fundamental idea behind the Vircator is that of accelerating a high current electron beam against a mesh (or foil) anode. Many electrons will pass through the anode, forming a bubble of space charge behind the anode. Under the proper conditions, this space charge region will oscillate at microwave frequencies. If the space charge region is placed into a resonant cavity which is appropriately tuned, very high peak powers may be achieved. Conventional microwave engineering techniques may then be used to extract microwave power from the resonant cavity. Because the frequency of oscillation is dependent upon the electron beam parameters, Vircators may be tuned or chirped in frequency, where the microwave cavity will support appropriate modes. Power levels achieved in Vircator experiments range from 170 kiloWatts to 40 GigaWatts over frequencies spanning the decimetric and centimetric bands [THODE87].
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=" vircator.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
The two most commonly described configurations for the Vircator are the Axial Vircator (AV) (Fig.3), and the Transverse Vircator (TV). The Axial Vircator is the simplest by design, and has generally produced the best power output in experiments. It is typically built into a cylindrical waveguide structure. Power is most often extracted by transitioning the waveguide into a conical horn structure, which functions as an antenna. AVs typically oscillate in Transverse Magnetic (TM) modes.  The Transverse Vircator injects cathode current from the side of the cavity and will typically oscillate in a Transverse Electric (TE) mode. 
<P>
Technical issues in Vircator design are output pulse duration, which is typically of the order of a microsecond and is limited by anode melting, stability of oscillation frequency, often compromised by cavity mode hopping, conversion efficiency and total power output. Coupling power efficiently from the Vircator cavity in modes suitable for a chosen antenna type may also be an issue, given the high power levels involved and thus the potential for electrical breakdown in insulators.
<P>
<H3>4. The Lethality of Electromagnetic Warheads</H3>
<P>
The issue of electromagnetic weapon lethality is complex. Unlike the technology base for weapon construction, which has been widely published in the open literature, lethality related issues have been published much less frequently.
<P>
While the calculation of electromagnetic field strengths achievable at a given radius for a given device design is a straightforward task, determining a kill probability for a given class of target under such conditions is not.
<P>
This is for good reasons. The first is that target types are very diverse in their electromagnetic hardness, or ability to resist damage. Equipment which has been intentionally shielded and hardened against electromagnetic attack will withstand orders of magnitude greater field strengths than standard commercially rated equipment. Moreover, various manufacturer's implementations of like types of equipment may vary significantly in hardness due the idiosyncrasies of specific electrical designs, cabling schemes and chassis/shielding designs used.
<P>
The second major problem area in determining lethality is that of coupling efficiency, which is a measure of how much power is transferred from the field produced by the weapon into the target. Only power coupled into the target can cause useful damage.
<P>
<H3>4.1. Coupling Modes</H3>
<P>
In assessing how power is coupled into targets, two principal coupling modes are recognised in the literature:
<P>
\(bu Front Door Coupling occurs typically when power from a electromagnetic weapon is coupled into an antenna associated with radar or communications equipment. The antenna subsystem is designed to couple power in and out of the equipment, and thus provides an efficient path for the power flow from the electromagnetic weapon to enter the equipment and cause damage.
<P>
\(bu Back Door Coupling occurs when the electromagnetic field from a weapon produces large transient currents (termed spikes, when produced by a low frequency weapon ) or electrical standing waves (when produced by a HPM weapon) on fixed electrical wiring and cables interconnecting equipment, or providing connections to mains power or the telephone network [TAYLOR92, WHITE78]. Equipment connected to exposed cables or wiring will experience either high voltage transient spikes or standing waves which can damage power supplies and communications interfaces if these are not hardened. Moreover, should the transient penetrate into the equipment, damage can be done to other devices inside.
<P>
A low frequency weapon will couple well into a typical wiring infrastructure, as most telephone lines, networking cables and power lines follow streets, building risers and corridors. In most instances any particular cable run will comprise multiple linear segments joined at approximately right angles. Whatever the relative orientation of the weapons field, more than one linear segment of the cable run is likely to be oriented such that a good coupling efficiency can be achieved.
<P>
It is worth noting at this point the safe operating envelopes of some typical types of semiconductor devices. Manufacturer's guaranteed breakdown voltage ratings for Silicon high frequency bipolar transistors, widely used in communications equipment, typically vary between 15 V and 65 V. Gallium Arsenide Field Effect Transistors are usually rated at about 10V. High density Dynamic Random Access Memories (DRAM), an essential part of any computer, are usually rated to 7 V against earth. Generic CMOS logic is rated between 7 V and 15 V, and microprocessors running off 3.3 V or 5 V power supplies are usually rated very closely to that voltage. Whilst many modern devices are equipped with additional protection circuits at each pin, to sink electrostatic discharges, sustained or repeated application of a high voltage will often defeat these [MOTO3, MICRON92, NATSEMI86].
<P>
Communications interfaces and power supplies must typically meet electrical safety requirements imposed by regulators. Such interfaces are usually protected by isolation transformers with ratings from hundreds of Volts to about 2 to 3 kV [NPI93].
<P>
It is clearly evident that once the defence provided by a transformer, cable pulse arrestor or shielding is breached, voltages even as low as 50 V can inflict substantial damage upon computer and communications equipment. The author has seen a number of equipment items (computers, consumer electronics) exposed to low frequency high voltage spikes (near lightning strikes, electrical power transients), and in every instance the damage was extensive, often requiring replacement of most semiconductors in the equipment <A HREF="#2">[2]</A>.
<P>
HPM weapons operating in the centimetric and millimetric bands however offer an additional coupling mechanism to Back Door Coupling. This is the ability to directly couple into equipment through ventilation holes, gaps between panels and poorly shielded interfaces. Under these conditions, any aperture into the equipment behaves much like a slot in a microwave cavity, allowing microwave radiation to directly excite or enter the cavity. The microwave radiation will form a spatial standing wave pattern within the equipment. Components situated within the anti-nodes within the standing wave pattern will be exposed to potentially high electromagnetic fields.
<P>
Because microwave weapons can couple more readily than low frequency weapons, and can in many instances bypass protection devices designed to stop low frequency coupling, microwave weapons have the potential to be significantly more lethal than low frequency weapons.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=" empbomb.gif">
</CENTER>

<P>
What research has been done in this area illustrates the difficulty in producing workable models for predicting equipment vulnerability. It does however provide a solid basis for shielding strategies and hardening of equipment. 
<P>
<I>The diversity of likely target types and the unknown geometrical layout and electrical characteristics of the wiring and cabling infrastructure surrounding a target makes the exact prediction of lethality impossible.
</I><P>
A general approach for dealing with wiring and cabling related back door coupling is to determine a known lethal voltage level, and then use this to find the required field strength to generate this voltage. Once the field strength is known, the lethal radius for a given weapon configuration can be calculated. 
<P>
A trivial example is that of a 10 GW 5 GHz HPM device illuminating a footprint of 400 to 500 metres diameter, from a distance of several hundred metres. This will result in field strengths of several kiloVolts per metre within the device footprint, in turn capable of producing voltages of hundreds of volts to kiloVolts on exposed wires or cables [KRAUS88, TAYLOR92]. This suggests lethal radii of the order of hundreds of metres, subject to weapon performance and target set electrical hardness.

<P>
<P>
<H3>4.2. Maximising Electromagnetic Bomb Lethality</H3>
<P>
To maximise the lethality of an electromagnetic bomb it is necessary to maximise the power coupled into the target set.
<P>
The first step in maximising bomb lethality is is to maximise the peak power and duration of the radiation of the weapon. For a given bomb size, this is accomplished by using the most powerful flux compression generator (and Vircator in a HPM bomb) which will fit the weapon size, and by maximising the efficiency of internal power transfers in the weapon. Energy which is not emitted is energy wasted at the expense of lethality.
<P>
The second step is to maximise the coupling efficiency into the target set. A good strategy for dealing with a complex and diverse target set is to exploit every coupling opportunity available within the bandwidth of the weapon.
<P>
A low frequency bomb built around an FCG will require a large antenna to provide good coupling of power from the weapon into the surrounding environment. Whilst weapons built this way are inherently wide band, as most of the power produced lies in the frequency band below 1 MHz compact antennas are not an option. One possible scheme is for a bomb approaching its programmed firing altitude to deploy five linear antenna elements. These are produced by firing off cable spools which unwind several hundred metres of cable. Four radial antenna elements form a "virtual" earth plane around the bomb, while an axial antenna element is used to radiate the power from the FCG. The choice of element lengths would need to be carefully matched to the frequency characteristics of the weapon, to produce the desired field strength. A high power coupling pulse transformer is used to match the low impedance FCG output to the much higher impedance of the antenna, and ensure that the current pulse does not vapourise the cable prematurely.
<P>
Other alternatives are possible. One is to simply guide the bomb very close to the target, and rely upon the near field produced by the FCG winding, which is in effect a loop antenna of very small diameter relative to the wavelength. Whilst coupling efficiency is inherently poor, the use of a guided bomb would allow the warhead to be positioned accurately within metres of a target. An area worth further investigation in this context is the use of low frequency bombs to damage or destroy magnetic tape libraries.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=" helixvco.gif"></CENTER>

<P>
Microwave bombs have a broader range of coupling modes and given the small wavelength in comparison with bomb dimensions, can be readily focussed against targets with a compact antenna assembly. Assuming that the antenna provides the required weapon footprint, there are at least two mechanisms which can be employed to further maximise lethality.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=" hpmbomb.gif"></CENTER>

<P>
The first is sweeping the frequency or chirping the Vircator. This can improve coupling efficiency in comparison with a single frequency weapon, by enabling the radiation to couple into apertures and resonances over a range of frequencies. In this fashion, a larger number of coupling opportunities are exploited.
<P>
The second mechanism which can be exploited to improve coupling is the polarisation of the weapon's emission. If we assume that the orientations of possible coupling apertures and resonances in the target set are random in relation to the weapon's antenna orientation, a linearly polarised emission will only exploit half of the opportunities available. A circularly polarised emission will exploit all coupling opportunities.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="empfootprint.gif"></CENTER>

<P>
The practical constraint is that it may be difficult to produce an efficient high power circularly polarised antenna design which is compact and performs over a wide band. Some work therefore needs to be done on tapered helix or conical spiral type antennas capable of handling high power levels, and a suitable interface to a Vircator with multiple extraction ports must devised. A possible implementation is depicted in Fig.5. In this arrangement, power is coupled from the tube by stubs which directly feed a multi-filar conical helix antenna. An implementation of this scheme would need to address the specific requirements of bandwidth, beamwidth, efficiency of coupling from the tube, while delivering circularly polarised radiation. 
<P>
Another aspect of electromagnetic bomb lethality is its detonation altitude, and by varying the detonation altitude, a tradeoff may be achieved between the size of the lethal footprint and the intensity of the electromagnetic field in that footprint. This provides the option of sacrificing weapon coverage to achieve kills against targets of greater electromagnetic hardness, for a given bomb size (Fig.7, 8). This is not unlike the use of airburst explosive devices.
<P>
In summary, lethality is maximised by maximising power output and the efficiency of energy transfer from the weapon to the target set. Microwave weapons offer the ability to focus nearly all of their energy output into the lethal footprint, and offer the ability to exploit a wider range of coupling modes. Therefore, microwave bombs are the preferred choice.
<P>
<H3>5. Targeting Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
The task of identifying targets for attack with electromagnetic bombs can be complex. Certain categories of target will be very easy to identify and engage. Buildings housing government offices and thus computer equipment, production facilities, military bases and known radar sites and communications nodes are all targets which can be readily identified through conventional photographic, satellite, imaging radar, electronic reconnaissance and humint operations. These targets are typically geographically fixed and thus may be attacked providing that the aircraft can penetrate to weapon release range. With the accuracy inherent in GPS/inertially guided weapons, the electromagnetic bomb can be programmed to detonate at the optimal position to inflict a maximum of electrical damage.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=" hpmfootprint.gif"></CENTER>

<P>
Mobile and camouflaged targets which radiate overtly can also be readily engaged. Mobile and relocatable air defence equipment, mobile communications nodes and naval vessels are all good examples of this category of target. While radiating, their positions can be precisely tracked with suitable Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and Emitter Locating Systems (ELS) carried either by the launch platform or a remote surveillance platform. In the latter instance target coordinates can be continuously datalinked to the launch platform. As most such targets move relatively slowly, they are unlikely to escape the footprint of the electromagnetic bomb during the weapon's flight time.
<P>
Mobile or hidden targets which do not overtly radiate may present a problem, particularly should conventional means of targeting be employed. A technical solution to this problem does however exist, for many types of target. This solution is the detection and tracking of Unintentional Emission (UE) [HERSKOWITZ96]. UE has attracted most attention in the context of TEMPEST <A HREF="#3">[3] </A>surveillance, where transient emanations leaking out from equipment due poor shielding can be detected and in many instances demodulated to recover useful intelligence. Termed Van Eck radiation [VECK85], such emissions can only be suppressed by rigorous shielding and emission control techniques, such as are employed in TEMPEST rated equipment.
<P>
Whilst the demodulation of UE can be a technically difficult task to perform well, in the context of targeting electromagnetic bombs this problem does not arise. To target such an emitter for attack requires only the ability to identify the type of emission and thus target type, and to isolate its position with sufficient accuracy to deliver the bomb. Because the emissions from computer monitors, peripherals, processor equipment, switchmode power supplies, electrical motors, internal combustion engine ignition systems, variable duty cycle electrical power controllers (thyristor or triac based), superheterodyne receiver local oscillators and computer networking cables are all distinct in their frequencies and modulations, a suitable Emitter Locating System can be designed to detect, identify and track such sources of emission. 
<P>
A good precedent for this targeting paradigm exists. During the SEA (Vietnam) conflict the United States Air Force (USAF) operated a number of night interdiction gunships which used direction finding receivers to track the emissions from vehicle ignition systems. Once a truck was identified and tracked, the gunship would engage it <A HREF="#4">[4]</A>.
<P>
 <CENTER>
<IMG SRC="gpsbomb.gif"></CENTER>

<P>
Because UE occurs at relatively low power levels, the use of this detection method prior to the outbreak of hostilities can be difficult, as it may be necessary to overfly hostile territory to find signals of usable intensity <A HREF="#5">[5]</A>. The use of stealthy reconnaissance aircraft or long range, stealthy Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) may be required. The latter also raises the possibility of autonomous electromagnetic warhead armed expendable UAVs, fitted with appropriate homing receivers. These would be programmed to loiter in a target area until a suitable emitter is detected, upon which the UAV would home in and expend itself against the target.
<P>
<H3>6. The Delivery of Conventional Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
As with explosive warheads, electromagnetic warheads will occupy a volume of physical space and will also have some given mass (weight) determined by the density of the internal hardware. Like explosive warheads, electromagnetic warheads may be fitted to a range of delivery vehicles.
<P>
Known existing applications <A HREF="#6">[6]</A> involve fitting an electromagnetic warhead to a cruise missile airframe. The choice of a cruise missile airframe will restrict the weight of the weapon to about 340 kg (750 lb), although some sacrifice in airframe fuel capacity could see this size increased. A limitation in all such applications is the need to carry an electrical energy storage device, eg a battery, to provide the current used to charge the capacitors used to prime the FCG prior to its discharge. Therefore the available payload capacity will be split between the electrical storage and the weapon itself.
<P>
In wholly autonomous weapons such as cruise missiles, the size of the priming current source and its battery may well impose important limitations on weapon capability. Air delivered bombs, which have a flight time between tens of seconds to minutes, could be built to exploit the launch aircraft's power systems. In such a bomb design, the bomb's capacitor bank can be charged by the launch aircraft enroute to target, and after release a much smaller onboard power supply could be used to maintain the charge in the priming source prior to weapon initiation.
<P>
An electromagnetic bomb delivered by a conventional aircraft <A HREF="#7">[7]</A> can offer a much better ratio of electromagnetic device mass to total bomb mass, as most of the bomb mass can be dedicated to the electromagnetic device installation itself. It follows therefore, that for a given technology an electromagnetic bomb of identical mass to a electromagnetic warhead equipped missile can have a much greater lethality, assuming equal accuracy of delivery and technologically similar electromagnetic device design.
<P>
A missile borne electromagnetic warhead installation will comprise the electromagnetic device, an electrical energy converter, and an onboard storage device such as a battery. As the weapon is pumped, the battery is drained. The electromagnetic device will be detonated by the missile's onboard fusing system. In a cruise missile, this will be tied to the navigation system; in an anti-shipping missile the radar seeker and in an air-to-air missile, the proximity fusing system. The warhead fraction (ie ratio of total payload (warhead) mass to launch mass of the weapon) will be between 15% and 30%<A HREF="#8"> [8]</A>.
<P>
<P>
An electromagnetic bomb warhead will comprise an electromagnetic device, an electrical energy converter and a energy storage device to pump and sustain the electromagnetic device charge after separation from the delivery platform. Fusing could be provided by a radar altimeter fuse to airburst the bomb, a barometric fuse or in GPS/inertially guided bombs, the navigation system. The warhead fraction could be as high as 85%, with most of the usable mass occupied by the electromagnetic device and its supporting hardware.
<P>
Due to the potentially large lethal radius of an electromagnetic device, compared to an explosive device of similar mass, standoff delivery would be prudent. Whilst this is an inherent characteristic of weapons such as cruise missiles, potential applications of these devices to glidebombs, anti-shipping missiles and air-to-air missiles would dictate fire and forget guidance of the appropriate variety, to allow the launching aircraft to gain adequate separation of several miles before warhead detonation.
<P>
The recent advent of GPS satellite navigation guidance kits for conventional bombs and glidebombs has provided the optimal means for cheaply delivering such weapons. While GPS guided weapons without differential GPS enhancements may lack the pinpoint accuracy of laser or television guided munitions, they are still quite accurate (CEP \(~~ 40 ft) and importantly, cheap, autonomous all weather weapons.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=" tossbomb.gif"></CENTER>

<P>
The USAF has recently deployed the Northrop GAM (GPS Aided Munition) on the B-2 bomber [NORTHROP95], and will by the end of the decade deploy the GPS/inertially guided GBU-29/30 JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition)[MDC95] and the AGM-154 JSOW (Joint Stand Off Weapon) [PERGLER94] glidebomb. Other countries are also developing this technology, the Australian BAeA AGW (Agile Glide Weapon) glidebomb achieving a glide range of about 140 km (75 nmi) when launched from altitude [KOPP96].
<P>
The importance of glidebombs as delivery means for HPM warheads is threefold. Firstly, the glidebomb can be released from outside effective radius of target air defences, therefore minimising the risk to the launch aircraft. Secondly, the large standoff range means that the aircraft can remain well clear of the bomb's effects. Finally the bomb's autopilot may be programmed to shape the terminal trajectory of the weapon, such that a target may be engaged from the most suitable altitude and aspect.
<P>
A major advantage of using electromagnetic bombs is that they may be delivered by any tactical aircraft with a nav-attack system capable of delivering GPS guided munitions. As we can expect GPS guided munitions to be become the standard weapon in use by Western air forces by the end of this decade, every aircraft capable of delivering a standard guided munition also becomes a potential delivery vehicle for a electromagnetic bomb. Should weapon ballistic properties be identical to the standard weapon, no software changes to the aircraft would be required.
<P>
Because of the simplicity of electromagnetic bombs in comparison with weapons such as Anti Radiation Missiles (ARM), it is not unreasonable to expect that these should be both cheaper to manufacture, and easier to support in the field, thus allowing for more substantial weapon stocks. In turn this makes saturation attacks a much more viable proposition.
<P>
<H3>7. Defence Against Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
The most effective defence against electromagnetic bombs is to prevent their delivery by destroying the launch platform or delivery vehicle, as is the case with nuclear weapons. This however may not always be possible, and therefore systems which can be expected to suffer exposure to the electromagnetic weapons effects must be electromagnetically hardened.
<P>
The most effective method is to wholly contain the equipment in an electrically  conductive enclosure, termed a Faraday cage, which prevents the electromagnetic field from gaining access to the protected equipment. However, most such equipment must communicate with and be fed with power from the outside world, and this can provide entry points via which electrical transients may enter the enclosure and effect damage. While optical fibres address this requirement for transferring data in and out, electrical power feeds remain an ongoing vulnerability.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=" faraday.gif"></CENTER>

<P>
Where an electrically conductive channel must enter the enclosure, electromagnetic arresting devices must be fitted. A range of devices exist, however care must be taken in determining their parameters to ensure that they can deal with the rise time and strength of electrical transients produced by electromagnetic devices. Reports from the US <A HREF="#9">[9]</A> indicate that hardening measures attuned to the behaviour of nuclear EMP bombs do not perform well when dealing with some conventional microwave electromagnetic device designs.
<P>
<P>
It is significant that hardening of systems must be carried out at a system level, as electromagnetic damage to any single element of a complex system could inhibit the function of the whole system. Hardening new build equipment and systems will add a substantial cost burden. Older equipment and systems may be impossible to harden properly and may require complete replacement. In simple terms, hardening by design is significantly easier than attempting to harden existing equipment.
<P>
An interesting aspect of electrical damage to targets is the possibility of wounding semiconductor devices thereby causing equipment to suffer repetitive intermittent faults rather than complete failures. Such faults would tie down considerable maintenance resources while also diminishing the confidence of the operators in the equipment's reliability. Intermittent faults may not be possible to repair economically, thereby causing equipment in this state to be removed from service permanently, with considerable loss in maintenance hours during damage diagnosis. This factor must also be considered when assessing the hardness of equipment against electromagnetic attack, as partial or incomplete hardening may in this fashion cause more difficulties than it would solve. Indeed, shielding which is incomplete may resonate when excited by radiation and thus contribute to damage inflicted upon the equipment contained within it.
<P>
Other than hardening against attack, facilities which are concealed should not radiate readily detectable emissions. Where radio frequency communications must be used, low probability of intercept (ie spread spectrum) techniques should be employed exclusively to preclude the use of site emissions for electromagnetic targeting purposes [DIXON84]. Appropriate suppression of UE is also mandatory.
<P>
Communications networks for voice, data and services should employ topologies with sufficient redundancy and failover mechanisms to allow operation with multiple nodes and links inoperative. This will deny a user of electromagnetic bombs the option of disabling large portions if not the whole of the network by taking down one or more key nodes or links with a single or small number of attacks.
<P>
<H3>8. Limitations of Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
The limitations of electromagnetic weapons are determined by weapon implementation and means of delivery. Weapon implementation will determine the electromagnetic field strength achievable at a given radius, and its spectral distribution. Means of delivery will constrain the accuracy with which the weapon can be positioned in relation to the intended target. Both constrain lethality.
<P>
In the context of targeting military equipment, it must be noted that thermionic technology (ie vacuum tube equipment) is substantially more resilient to the electromagnetic weapons effects than solid state (ie transistor) technology. Therefore a weapon optimised to destroy solid state computers and receivers may cause little or no damage to a thermionic technology device, for instance early 1960s Soviet military equipment. Therefore a hard electrical kill may not be achieved against such targets unless a suitable weapon is used.
<P>
This underscores another limitation of electromagnetic weapons, which is the difficulty in kill assessment. Radiating targets such as radars or communications equipment may continue to radiate after an attack even though their receivers and data processing systems have been damaged or destroyed. This means that equipment which has been successfully attacked may still appear to operate. Conversely an opponent may shut down an emitter if attack is imminent and the absence of emissions means that the success or failure of the attack may not be immediately apparent.
<P>
<I>Assessing whether an attack on a non radiating emitter has been successful is more problematic. A good case can be made for developing tools specifically for the purpose of analysing unintended emissions, not only for targeting purposes, but also for kill assessment.
</I><P>
An important factor in assessing the lethal coverage of an electromagnetic weapon is atmospheric propagation. While the relationship between electromagnetic field strength  and distance from the weapon is one of an inverse square law in free space, the decay in lethal effect with increasing distance within the atmosphere will be greater due quantum physical absorption effects <A HREF="#10">[10]</A>. This is particularly so at higher frequencies, and significant absorption peaks due water vapour and oxygen exist at frequencies above 20 GHz. These will therefore contain the effect of HPM weapons to shorter radii than are ideally achievable in the K and L frequency bands.
<P>
<P>
Means of delivery will limit the lethality of an electromagnetic bomb by introducing limits to the weapon's size and the accuracy of its delivery. Should the delivery error be of the order of the weapon's lethal radius for a given detonation altitude, lethality will be significantly diminished. This is of particular importance when assessing the lethality of unguided electromagnetic bombs, as delivery errors will be more substantial than those experienced with guided weapons such as GPS guided bombs.
<P>
Therefore accuracy of delivery and achievable lethal radius must be considered against the allowable collateral damage for the chosen target. Where collateral electrical damage is a consideration, accuracy of delivery and lethal radius are key parameters. An inaccurately delivered weapon of large lethal radius may be unusable against a target should the likely collateral electrical damage be beyond acceptable limits. This can be a major issue for users constrained by treaty provisions on collateral damage [AAP1003].
<P>
<H3>9. The Proliferation of Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
At the time of writing, the United States and the CIS are the only two nations with the established technology base and the depth of specific experience to design weapons based upon this technology. However, the relative simplicity of the FCG and the Vircator suggests that any nation with even a 1940s technology base, once in possession of engineering drawings and specifications for such weapons, could manufacture them. 
<P>
As an example, the fabrication of an effective FCG can be accomplished with basic electrical materials, common plastic explosives such as C-4 or Semtex, and readily available machine tools such as lathes and suitable mandrels for forming coils. Disregarding the overheads of design, which do not apply in this context, a two stage FCG could be fabricated for a cost as low as $1,000-2,000, at Western labour rates [REINOVSKY85]. This cost could be even lower in a Third World or newly industrialised economy.
<P>
While the relative simplicity and thus low cost of such weapons can be considered of benefit to First World nations intending to build viable war stocks or maintain production in wartime, the possibility of less developed nations mass producing such weapons is alarming. The dependence of modern economies upon their information technology infrastructure makes them highly vulnerable to attack with such weapons, providing that these can be delivered to their targets.
<P>
Of major concern is the vulnerability resulting from increasing use of communications and data communications schemes based upon copper cable media. If the copper medium were to be replaced en masse with optical fibre in order to achieve higher bandwidths, the communications infrastructure would become significantly more robust against electromagnetic attack as a result. However, the current trend is to exploit existing distribution media such as cable TV and telephone wiring to provide multiple Megabit/s data distribution (eg cable modems, ADSL/HDSL/VDSL) to premises. Moreover, the gradual replacement of coaxial Ethernet networking with 10-Base-T twisted pair equipment has further increased the vulnerability of wiring systems inside buildings. It is not unreasonable to assume that the data and services communications infrastructure in the West will remain a "soft" electromagnetic target in the forseeable future.<P>
At this time no counter-proliferation regimes exist. Should treaties be agreed to limit the proliferation of electromagnetic weapons, they would be virtually impossible to enforce given the common availability of suitable materials and tools.
<P>
With the former CIS suffering significant economic difficulties, the possibility of CIS designed microwave and pulse power technology leaking out to Third World nations or terrorist organisations should not be discounted. The threat of electromagnetic bomb proliferation is very real.
<P>
<P>
<H3>10. A Doctrine for the Use of Conventional Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
A fundamental tenet of IW is that complex organisational systems such as governments, industries and military forces cannot function without the flow of information through their structures. Information flows within these structures in several directions, under typical conditions of function. A trivial model for this function would see commands and directives flowing outward from a central decisionmaking element, with information about the state of the system flowing in the opposite direction. Real systems are substantially more complex.
<P>
This is of military significance because stopping this flow of information will severely debilitate the function of any such system. Stopping the outward flow of information produces paralysis, as commands cannot reach the elements which are to execute them. Stopping the inward flow of information isolates the decisionmaking element from reality, and thus severely inhibits its capacity to make rational decisions which are sensitive to the currency of information at hand.
<P>
The recent evolution of strategic (air) warfare indicates a growing trend toward targeting strategies which exploit this most fundamental vulnerability of any large and organised system <A HREF="#11">[11]</A>. The Desert Storm air war of 1991 is a good instance, with a substantial effort expended against such targets. Indeed, the model used for modern strategic air attack places leadership and its supporting communications in the position of highest targeting priority [WARDEN95]. No less importantly, modern Electronic Combat concentrates upon the disruption and destruction of communications and information gathering sensors used to support military operations. Again the Desert Storm air war provides a good illustration of the application of this method.
<P>
<P>
A strategy which stresses attack upon the information processing and communications elements of the systems which it is targeting offers a very high payoff, as it will introduce an increasing level of paralysis and disorientation within its target. Electromagnetic bombs are a powerful tool in the implementation of such a strategy.
<P>
<H3>10.1 Electronic Combat Operations using Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
The central objective of Electronic Combat (EC) operations is the command of the electromagnetic spectrum, achieved by soft and hard kill means <A HREF="#12">[12]</A> against the opponent's electronic assets. The underlying objective of commanding the electromagnetic spectrum is to interrupt or substantially reduce the flow of information through the opponent's air defence system, air operations environment and between functional elements of weapon systems. 
<P>
<P>
In this context the ability of electromagnetic bombs to achieve kills against a wide range of target types allows their general application to the task of inflicting attrition upon an opponent's electronic assets, be they specialised air defence assets or more general Command-Control-Communications (C3) and other military assets.
<P>
Electromagnetic bombs can be a means of both soft and hard electrical kill, subject to the lethality of the weapon and the hardness of its target. A hard electrical kill by means of an electromagnetic device will be achieved in those instances where such severe electrical damage is achieved against a target so as to require the replacement of most if not all of its internal electronics.
<P>
Electronic combat operations using electromagnetic devices involve the use of these to attack radar, C3 and air defence weapon systems. These should always be attacked initially with an electromagnetic weapon to achieve soft or hard electrical kills, followed up by attack with conventional munitions to preclude possible repair of disabled assets at a later time.  As with conventional SEAD operations, the greatest payoff will be achieved by using electromagnetic weapons against systems of strategic importance first, followed in turn by those of operational and tactical importance [KOPP92].
<P>
In comparison with an AntiRadiation Missile (ARM - a missile which homes on the emissions from a threat radar), the established and specialised tool in the conduct of SEAD operations, an electromagnetic bomb can achieve kills against multiple targets of diverse types within its lethal footprint. In this respect an electromagnetic device may be described as a Weapon of Electrical Mass Destruction (WEMD). Therefore electromagnetic weapons are a significant force multiplier in electronic combat operations.
<P>
A conventional electronic combat campaign, or intensive electronic combat operations, will initially concentrate on saturating the opponent's electronic defences, denying information and inflicting maximum attrition upon electronic assets. The force multiplication offered by electromagnetic weapons vastly reduces the number of air assets required to inflict substantial attrition, and where proper electronic reconnaissance has been carried out beforehand, also reduces the need for specialised assets such as ARM firing aircraft equipped with costly emitter locating systems.
<P>
The massed application of electromagnetic bombs in the opening phase of an electronic battle will allow much faster attainment of command of the electromagnetic spectrum, as it will inflict attrition upon electronic assets at a much faster rate than possible with conventional means. 
<P>
Whilst the immaturity of conventional electromagnetic weapons precludes an exact analysis of the scale of force multiplication achievable, it is evident that a single aircraft carrying an electromagnetic bomb capable of concurrently disabling a SAM site with its colocated acquisition radar and supporting radar directed AAA weapons, will have the potency of the several ARM firing and support jamming aircraft required to accomplish the same result by conventional means. This and the ability of multirole tactical aircraft to perform this task allows for a much greater concentration of force in the opening phase of the battle, for a given force size.
<P>
In summary the massed application of electromagnetic weapons to Electronic Combat operations will provide for a much faster rate of attrition against hostile electronic assets, achievable with a significantly reduced number of specialised and multirole air assets <A HREF="#13">[13]</A>. This will allow even a modestly sized force to apply overwhelming pressure in the initial phase of an electronic battle, and therefore achieve command of the electromagnetic spectrum in a significantly shorter time than by conventional means.

<H3>10.2. Strategic Air Attack Operations using Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
The modern approach to strategic air warfare reflects in many respects aspects of the IW model, in that much effort is expended in disabling an opponent's fundamental information processing infrastructure. Since we however are yet to see a systematic IW doctrine which has been tested in combat, this paper will approach the subject from a more conservative viewpoint and use established strategic doctrine.
<P>
Modern strategic air attack theory is based upon Warden's Five Rings model [WARDEN95], which identifies five centres of gravity in a nation's warfighting capability. In descending order of importance, these are the nation's leadership and supporting C3 system, its essential economic infrastructure, its transportation network, its population and its fielded military forces.
<P>
Electromagnetic weapons may be productively used against all elements in this model, and provide a particularly high payoff when applied against a highly industrialised and geographically concentrated opponent. Of particular importance in the context of strategic air attack, is that while electromagnetic weapons are lethal to electronics, they have little if any effect on humans. This is a characteristic which is not shared with established conventional and nuclear weapons.
<P>
This selectivity in lethal effect makes electromagnetic weapons far more readily applicable to a strategic air attack campaign, and reduces the internal political pressure which is experienced by the leadership of any democracy which must commit to warfare. An opponent may be rendered militarily, politically and economically ineffective with little if any loss in human life.
<P>
The innermost ring in the Warden model essentially comprises government bureaucracies and civilian and military C3 systems. In any modern nation these are heavily dependent upon the use of computer equipment and communications equipment. What is of key importance at this time is an ongoing change in the structure of computing facilities used in such applications, as these are becoming increasingly decentralised. A modern office environment relies upon a large number of small computers, networked to interchange information, in which respect it differs from the traditional model of using a small number of powerful central machines.
<P>
This decentralisation and networking of information technology systems produces a major vulnerability to electromagnetic attack. Whereas a small number of larger computers could be defended against electromagnetic attack by the use of electromagnetic hardened computer rooms, a large distributed network cannot. Moreover, unless optical fibre networking is used, the networking cables are themselves a medium via which electromagnetic effects can be efficiently propagated throughout the network, to destroy machines. Whilst the use of distributed computer networks reduces vulnerability to attack by conventional munitions, it increases vulnerability to attack by electromagnetic weapons.
<P>
Selective targeting of government buildings with electromagnetic weapons will result in a substantial reduction in a government's ability to handle and process information. The damage inflicted upon information records may be permanent, should inappropriate backup strategies have been used to protect stored data. It is reasonable to expect most data stored on machines which are affected will perish with the host machine, or become extremely difficult to recover from damaged storage devices.
<P>
The cost of hardening existing computer networks is prohibitive, as is the cost of replacement with hardened equipment. Whilst the use of hardened equipment for critical tasks would provide some measure of resilience, the required discipline in the handling of information required to implement such a scheme renders its utility outside of military organisations questionable.  Therefore the use of electromagnetic weapons against government facilities offers an exceptionally high payoff. 
<P>
Other targets which fall into the innermost ring may also be profitably attacked. Satellite link and importantly control facilities are vital means of communication as well as the primary interface to military and commercial reconnaissance satellites. Television and radio broadcasting stations, one of the most powerful tools of any government, are also vulnerable to electromagnetic attack due the very high concentration of electronic equipment in such sites. Telephone exchanges, particularly later generation digital switching systems, are also highly vulnerable to appropriate electromagnetic attack.
<P>
In summary the use of electromagnetic weapons against leadership and C3 targets is highly profitable, in that a modest number of weapons appropriately used can introduce the sought state of strategic paralysis, without the substantial costs incurred by the use of conventional munitions to achieve the same effect.
<P>
Essential economic infrastructure is also vulnerable to electromagnetic attack. The finance industry and stock markets are almost wholly dependent upon computers and their supporting communications. Manufacturing, chemical, petroleum product industries and metallurgical industries rely heavily upon automation which is almost universally implemented with electronic PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) systems or digital computers. Furthermore, most sensors and telemetry devices used are electrical or electronic.
<P>
Attacking such economic targets with electromagnetic weapons will halt operations for the time required to either repair the destroyed equipment, or to reconfigure for manual operation. Some production processes however require automated operation, either because hazardous conditions prevent human intervention, or the complexity of the control process required cannot be carried out by a human operator in real time. A good instance are larger chemical, petrochemical and oil/gas production facilities. Destroying automated control facilities will therefore result in substantial loss of production, causing shortages of these vital materials.
<P>
Manufacturing industries which rely heavily upon robotic and semiautomatic machinery, such as the electronics, computer and electrical industry, precision machine industry and aerospace industries, are all key assets in supporting a military capability. They are all highly vulnerable to electromagnetic attack. Whilst material processing industries may in some instances be capable of function with manual process control, the manufacturing industries are almost wholly dependent upon their automated machines to achieve any useful production output.
<P>
Historical experience<A HREF="#14"> [14]</A> suggests that manufacturing industries are highly resilient to air attack as production machinery is inherently mechanically robust and thus a very high blast overpressure is required to destroy it. The proliferation of electronic and computer controlled machinery has produced a major vulnerability, for which historical precedent does not exist. Therefore it will be necessary to reevaluate this orthodoxy in targeting strategy.
<P>
<P>
The finance industry and stock markets are a special case in this context, as the destruction of their electronic infrastructure can yield, unlike manufacturing industries, much faster economic dislocation. This can in turn produce large systemic effects across a whole economy, including elements which are not vulnerable to direct electromagnetic attack. This may be of particular relevance when dealing with an opponent which does not have a large and thus vulnerable manufacturing economy. Nations which rely on agriculture, mining or trade for a large proportion of the their gross domestic product are prime candidates for electromagnetic attack on their finance industry and stock markets. Since the latter are usually geographically concentrated and typically electromagnetically "soft" targets, they are highly vulnerable.
<P>
In summary there is a large payoff in striking at economic essentials with electromagnetic weapons, particularly in the opening phase of a strategic air attack campaign, as economic activity may be halted or reduced with modest expenditure of the attacker's resources. An important caveat is that centres of gravity within the target economy must be properly identified and prioritised for strikes to ensure that maximum effect is achieved as quickly as possible.
<P>
Transport infrastructure is the third ring in the Warden model, and also offers some useful opportunities for the application of electromagnetic weapons. Unlike the innermost rings, the concentration of electronic and computer equipment is typically much lower, and therefore considerable care must be taken in the selection of targets.
<P>
Railway and road signalling systems, where automated, are most vulnerable to electromagnetic attack on their control centres. This could be used to produce traffic congestion by preventing the proper scheduling of rail traffic, and disabling road traffic signalling, although the latter may not yield particularly useful results.
<P>
Significantly, most modern automobiles and trucks use electronic ignition systems which are known to be vulnerable to electromagnetic weapons effects, although opportunities to find such concentrations so as to allow the profitable use of an electromagnetic bomb may be scarce.
<P>
The population of the target nation is the fourth ring in the Warden model, and its morale is the object of attack. The morale of the population will be affected significantly by the quality and quantity of the government propaganda it is subjected to, as will it be affected by living conditions.
<P>
Using electromagnetic weapons against urban areas provides the opportunity to prevent government propaganda from reaching the population via means of mass media, through the damaging or destruction of all television and radio receivers within the footprint of the weapon. Whether this is necessary, given that broadcast facilities may have already been destroyed, is open to discussion. Arguably it may be counterproductive, as it will prevent the target population from being subjected to friendly means of psychological warfare such as propaganda broadcasts.
<P>
The use of electromagnetic weapons against a target population is therefore an area which requires requires careful consideration in the context of the overall IW campaign strategy. If useful objectives can be achieved by isolating the population from government propaganda, then the population is a valid target for electromagnetic attack. Forces constrained by treaty obligations will have to reconcile this against the applicable regulations relating to denial of services to non-combatants [AAP1003].
<P>
The outermost and last ring in the Warden model are the fielded military forces. These are by all means a target vulnerable to electromagnetic attack, and C3 nodes, fixed support bases as well as deployed forces should be attacked with electromagnetic devices. Fixed support bases which carry out depot level maintenance on military equipment offer a substantial payoff, as the concentration of computers in both automatic test equipment and administrative and logistic support functions offers a good return per expended weapon.
<P>
Any site where more complex military equipment is concentrated should be attacked with electromagnetic weapons to render the equipment unservicable and hence reduce the fighting capability, and where possible also mobility of the targeted force. As discussed earlier in the context of Electronic Combat, the ability of an electromagnetic weapon to achieve hard electrical kills against any non-hardened targets within its lethal footprint suggests that some target sites may only require electromagnetic attack to render them both undefended and non-operational. Whether to expend conventional munitions on targets in this state would depend on the immediate military situation.
<P>
In summary the use of electromagnetic weapons in strategic air attack campaign offers a potentially high payoff, particularly when applied to leadership, C3 and vital economic targets, all of which may be deprived of much of their function for substantial periods of time. The massed application of electromagnetic weapons in the opening phase of the campaign would introduce paralysis within the government, deprived of much of its information processing infrastructure, as well as paralysis in most vital industries. This would greatly reduce the capability of the target nation to conduct military operations of any substantial intensity.
<P>
<I> Because conventional electromagnetic weapons produce negligible collateral damage, in comparison with conventional explosive munitions, they allow the conduct of an effective and high tempo campaign without the loss of life which is typical of conventional campaigns. This will make the option of a strategic bombing campaign more attractive to a Western democracy, where mass media coverage of the results of conventional strategic strike operations will adversely affect domestic civilian morale.  
</I><P>
The long term effects of a sustained and concentrated strategic bombing campaign using a combination of conventional and electromagnetic weapons will be important. The cost of computer and communications infrastructure is substantial, and its massed destruction would be a major economic burden for any industrialised nation. In addition it is likely that poor protection of stored data will add to further economic losses, as much data will be lost with the destroyed machines.
<P>
From the perspective of conducting an IW campaign, this method of attack achieves many of the central objectives sought. Importantly, the massed application of electromagnetic weapons would inflict attrition on an opponent's information processing infrastructure very rapidly, and this would arguably add a further psychological dimension to the potency of the attack. Unlike the classical IW model of Gibsonian CyberWar, in which the opponent can arguably isolate his infrastructure from hostile penetration, parallel or hyperwar style massed attack with electromagnetic bombs will be be extremely difficult to defend against.
<P>
<H3>10.3. Offensive Counter Air (OCA) Operations using Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
Electromagnetic bombs may be usefully applied to OCA operations. Modern aircraft are densely packed with electronics, and unless properly hardened, are highly vulnerable targets for electromagnetic weapons.
<P>
The cost of the onboard electronics represents a substantial fraction of the total cost of a modern military aircraft, and therefore stock levels of spares will in most instances be limited to what is deemed necessary to cover operational usage at some nominal sortie rate. Therefore electromagnetic damage could render aircraft unusable for substantial periods of time.
<P>
Attacking airfields with electromagnetic weapons will disable communications, air traffic control facilities, navigational aids and operational support equipment, if these items are not suitably electromagnetic hardened. Conventional blast hardening measures will not be effective, as electrical power and fixed communications cabling will carry electromagnetic induced transients into most buildings. Hardened aircraft shelters may provide some measure of protection due electrically conductive reinforcement embedded in the concrete, but conventional revetments will not.
<P>
Therefore OCA operations against airfields and aircraft on the ground should include the use of electromagnetic weapons as they offer the potential to substantially reduce hostile sortie rates.
<P>
<H3>10.4. Maritime Air Operations using Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
As with modern military aircraft, naval surface combatants are fitted with a substantial volume of electronic equipment, performing similar functions in detecting and engaging targets and warning of attack. As such they are vulnerable to electromagnetic attack, if not suitably hardened. Should they be hardened, volumetric, weight and cost penalties will be incurred.
<P>
Conventional methods for attacking surface combatants involve the use of saturation attacks by anti-ship missiles or coordinated attacks using a combination of ARMs and anti-ship missiles. The latter instance is where disabling the target electronically by stripping its antennae precedes lethal attack with specialised anti-ship weapons.
<P>
An electromagnetic warhead detonated within lethal radius of a surface combatant will render its air defence system inoperable, as well as damaging other electronic equipment such as electronic countermeasures, electronic support measures and communications. This leaves the vessel undefended until these systems can be restored, which may or may not be possible on the high seas. Therefore launching an electromagnetic glidebomb on to a surface combatant, and then reducing it with laser or television guided weapons is an alternate strategy for dealing with such targets.
<P>
<H3>10.5. Battlefield Air Interdiction Operations using Electromagnetic Bombs</H3>
<P>
Modern land warfare doctrine emphasises mobility, and manoeuvre warfare methods are typical for contemporary land warfare. Coordination and control are essential to the successful conduct of manoeuvre operations, and this provides another opportunity to apply electromagnetic weapons.  Communications and command sites are key elements in the structure of such a land army, and these concentrate communications and computer equipment. Therefore they should be attacked with electromagnetic weapons, to disrupt the command and control of land operations.
<P>
Should concentrations of armoured vehicles be found, these are also profitable targets for electromagnetic attack, as their communications and fire control systems may be substantially damaged or disabled as a result. A useful tactic would be initial attack with electromagnetic weapons to create a maximum of confusion, followed by attack with conventional weapons to take advantage of the immediate situation.
<P>
<H3>10.6. A Strategy of Graduated Response</H3>
<P>
The introduction of non-nuclear electromagnetic bombs into the arsenal of a modern air force considerably broadens the options for conducting strategic campaigns. Clearly such weapons are potent force multipliers in conducting a conventional war, particularly when applied to Electronic Combat, OCA and strategic air attack operations.
<P>
The massed use of such weapons would provide a decisive advantage to any nation with the capability to effectively target and deliver them. The qualitative advantage in capability so gained would provide a significant advantage even against a much stronger opponent not in the possession of this capability.
<P>
Electromagnetic weapons however open up less conventional alternatives for the conduct of a strategic campaign, which derive from their ability to inflict significant material damage without inflicting visible collateral damage and loss of life. Western governments have been traditionally reluctant to commit to strategic campaigns, as the expectation of a lengthy and costly battle, with mass media coverage of its highly visible results, will quickly produce domestic political pressure to cease the conflict.
<P>
An alternative is a Strategy of Graduated Response (SGR). In this strategy, an opponent who threatens escalation to a full scale war is preemptively attacked with electromagnetic weapons, to gain command of the electromagnetic spectrum and command of the air. Selective attacks with electromagnetic weapons may then be applied against chosen strategic targets, to force concession. Should these fail to produce results, more targets may be disabled by electromagnetic attack. Escalation would be sustained and graduated, to produce steadily increasing pressure to concede the dispute. Air and sea blockade are complementary means via which pressure may be applied.
<P>
Because electromagnetic weapons can cause damage on a large scale very quickly, the rate at which damage can be inflicted can be very rapid, in which respect such a campaign will differ from the conventional, where the rate at which damage is inflicted is limited by the usable sortie rate of strategic air attack capable assets <A HREF="#15">[15]</A>.
<P>
<P>
Should blockade and the total disabling of vital economic assets fail to yield results, these may then be systematically reduced by conventional weapons, to further escalate the pressure. Finally, a full scale conventional strategic air attack campaign would follow, to wholly destroy the hostile nation's warfighting capability.
<P>
Another situation where electromagnetic bombs may find useful application is in dealing with governments which actively implement a policy of state sponsored terrorism or info-terrorism, or alternately choose to conduct a sustained low intensity land warfare campaign. Again the Strategy of Graduated Response, using electromagnetic bombs in the initial phases, would place the government under significant pressure to concede. 
<P>
As a punitive weapon electromagnetic devices are attractive for dealing with belligerent governments. Substantial economic, military and political damage may be inflicted with a modest commitment of resources by their users, and without politically damaging loss of life.
<P>
<H3>11. Conclusions</H3>
<P>
Electromagnetic bombs are Weapons of Electrical Mass Destruction with applications across a broad spectrum of targets, spanning both the strategic and tactical. As such their use offers a very high payoff in attacking the fundamental information processing and communication facilities of a target system. The massed application of these weapons will produce substantial paralysis in any target system, thus providing a decisive advantage in the conduct of Electronic Combat, Offensive Counter Air and Strategic Air Attack.
<P>
Because E-bombs can cause hard electrical kills over larger areas than conventional explosive weapons of similar mass, they offer substantial economies in force size for a given level of inflicted damage, and are thus a potent force multiplier for appropriate target sets.
<P>
The non-lethal nature of electromagnetic weapons makes their use far less politically damaging than that of conventional munitions, and therefore broadens the range of military options available. 
<P>
This paper has included a discussion of the technical, operational and targeting aspects of using such weapons, as no historical experience exists as yet upon which to build a doctrinal model. The immaturity of this weapons technology limits the scope of this discussion, and many potential areas of application have intentionally not been discussed. The ongoing technological evolution of this family of weapons will clarify the relationship between weapon size and lethality, thus producing further applications and areas for study.
<P>
E-bombs can be an affordable force multiplier for military forces which are under post Cold War pressures to reduce force sizes, increasing both their combat potential and political utility in resolving disputes. Given the potentially high payoff deriving from the use of these devices, it is incumbent upon such military forces to appreciate both the offensive and defensive implications of this technology. It is also incumbent upon governments and private industry to consider the implications of the proliferation of this technology, and take measures to safeguard their vital assets from possible future attack. Those who choose not to may become losers in any future wars.

<A NAME="1">1</A> Electromagnetic pulse or EMP device is a generic term applied to any device, nuclear or conventional, which is capable of generating a very intense but short electromagnetic field transient. For weapons applications, this transient must be sufficiently intense to produce electromagnetic power densities which are lethal to electronic and electrical equipment. Electromagnetic weapons are electromagnetic devices specifically designed as weapons. Whilst the terms 'conventional EMP weapon' and 'High Power Microwave or HPM weapon' have been used interchangeably in trade journals (see FULGHUM93), this paper will distinguish between microwave band and low frequency weapons. The term 'electromagnetic bomb' or 'E-bomb' will be used to describe both microwave and low frequency non-nuclear bombs. This paper will not address the use of nuclear EMP, or alternate uses of HPM technology. HPM technology has a broad range of potential applications in EW, radar and directed energy weapons (DEW). The general conclusions of this paper in the areas of infrastructure vulnerability and hardening are also true for microwave directed energy weapons. This paper extends the scope of earlier work by the author on this subject [KOPP93].

<A NAME="2">2</A> - One bizzare instance of lightning strike electrical damage was described to the author by an eyewitness technician, tasked with assessing the damage on the site. A lightning bolt impacted in the close vicinity of a transmitter shed. RF and power cables ran from the transmitter shed to a transmission tower through a rectangular, metal shielded tunnel. The effect of the lightning strike was to produce an electromagnetic  standing wave in the tunnel, much like in a microwave waveguide. All cables within the tunnel were burned through at regular spacings along the tunnel, corresponding precisely to the half wavelength of the standing wave in the tunnel.

<A NAME="3">3</A> The NACSIM 5100A standard specifies acceptable emission levels for TEMPEST (Transient ElectroMagnetic Pulse Emanation Standard) rated equipment. 
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="4">4</A> The Northrop/Lockheed ASD-5 Black Crow DF receiver was fitted to the AC-130A Pave Pronto gunships, rebuilt from obsoleted C-130 transports [ICH10]. 
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="5">5</A> A noteworthy technical issue in this context is that even equipment not-rated to TEMPEST standards will radiate energy at very low power levels, in comparison with intentional transmissions by radar or communications equipment. A receiver designed to detect, identify and locate sources of UE radiation will either need to be highly sensitive, or deployed very close to the emitter. It is worth noting that UE from computer monitors and networks exhibit known regular patterns, and correlation techniques could be used to significantly improve receiver sensitivity [DIXON84].

<A NAME="6">6</A>  Fulghum D.A., ALCMs Given Non Lethal Role, AW&ST, Feb 22, 1993. This recent report indicates that the US has progressed significantly with its development work on electromagnetic warhead technology. An electromagnetic warhead was fitted to the USAF AGM-86 Air Launched Cruise Missile airframe, involving both structural and guidance system modifications. The description in this report suggests the use of an explosive pumped flux generator feeding a device such as a Vircator. References to magnetic coils almost certainly relate to the flux compression generator hardware.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="7">7</A> The Journal of Electronic Defence [JED96] recently reported on the USAF Phillips Laboratory at Kirtland awarding a $6.6M HPM SEAD weapon technology demonstration program contract to Hughes Missile Systems Co. This contract will see Hughes conduct design studies in order to define design goals, and then fabricate brassboard demonstration hardware using government developed technology. JED speculate that the weapon will be a FCG driven microwave tube, which is most likely the case given the USAF's prior research activities in this area [REINOVSKY85]. An earlier report [JED95] indicated the existence of a related program which addresses command and control warfare and counter-air capabilities. In any event, the devices produced by these programs are likely to become the first operationally fielded HPM electromagnetic bombs for delivery by combat aircraft.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="8">8</A> This may be readily determined by calculating the ratio of warhead mass to total weapon launch mass, for representative missile types. Taking the  AGM-78 Standard as a lower limit yields 15.9%, whereas taking the AGM/BGM-109 Tomahawk as an upper limit yields about 28%. Figures are derived from manufacturers' brochures and reference publications eg Jane's Air-Launched Weapons.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="9">9</A> Staines, Fulghum. This is entirely consistent with theoretical expectations, as the different spectral characteristics of microwave electromagnetic warheads, compared to nuclear electromagnetic weapons, will significantly affect the effectiveness of protective filters. What is important from an electrical engineering viewpoint is that a filter designed to stop signals in the lower frequency bands may perform very poorly at microwave frequencies.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10">10</A> See International Countermeasures Handbook, 14th Edition, pp 104. 
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="11">11</A>  Gary Waters, Gulf Lesson One.  Chapter 16 of this reference provides a good discussion of both the rationale and implementation of this strategy.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="12">12</A> Soft kill means will inhibit or degrade the function of a target system during their application, leaving the target system electrically and physically intact upon the cessation of their application. Hard kill means will damage or destroy the target system, and are thus a means of inflicting attrition.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="13">13</A> - this is also the stated intent of the USAF HPM SEAD technology demonstration program. The fact that the first application of a HPM bomb is electronic combat underscores the tactical, operational and strategic importance of first defeating an air defence system when prosecuting a strategic air war.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="14">14</A>  The classical argument here is centred upon Allied experience in bombing Germany during WW2, where even repeated raids on industrial targets were unable to wholly stop production, and in many instances only served to reduce the rate of increase in production. What must not be overlooked is that both the accuracy and lethality of weapons in this period bore little comparison to what is available today, and automation of production facilities was almost non-existent.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="15">15</A> This constraint primarily results from limitations in numbers. Strategic air attack requires precision delivery of substantial payloads, and is thus most effectively performed with specialised bomber assets, such as the B-52, B-1, B-2, F-111, F-15E, F-117A, Tornado or Su-24. These are typically more maintenance intensive than less complex multirole fighters, and this will become a constraint to the sortie rate achievable with a finite number of aircraft, assuming the availability of aircrew. Whilst multirole fighters may be applied to strategic air attack, their typically lesser payload radius performance and lesser accuracy will reduce their effectiveness. In the doctrinal context, this can be directly related to existing USAF aerospace doctrine [AFM1-1], in several areas.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 10/31/96 - 18:00CST<BR>
Contact:  Paul Anderson, Asst. Manag. Editor<BR>

Visualization; Training For the Future<BR>
<P>Chicago, IL, October 31, 1996 (ENN) --The following article appeared in
the November,1996 edition of the Reader's Digest, on page.14:

<P>"I was stationed at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas, when I was told I
would have to qualify to use a .38-caliber pistol. Having only held a
gun on two other occasions I was apprehensive.  When I fired my first
shot, the loud bang and gun's kick startled me so much I almost dropped
the pistol.  Worst of all, in my panic I forgot to keep the gun pointed
down range and drew a stern reprimand from my sergeant.

<P>When I retrieved my targets, however, I was amazed to see that I had
qualified with flying colors. The sergeant looked at my scores with
disbelief and commented that he had been certain that I would fail.
Smiling, I held up my index finger and thumb in a mock gun position and
said one word that explained it all;  'Nintendo'." - - Contributed to
Reader's Digest by Peggy Alston

<P>At first glance, this anecdote appears to be just another humorous
addition to the "Humor in Uniform" section of the magazine.  But, it
also points out that there may be more than one way to learn
marksmanship and other skills that may be needed in a military/crisis
environment.

<P>Experiments are reportedly underway at several military research centers
and private institutes to explore the use of virtual reality and 3-D
computer programs in the training of military and emergency services
personnel. The idea is not new, as extremely realistic flight simulators
have been in use by the U.S. Air Force and commercial airlines for
several years. But, extending this concept to multi-layered ground
combat and disaster scenarios is something that has only been
investigated in recent years.

<P>Recently, reports have surfaced of a U.S. Marine Corp experiment with a
modified version of the popular game "Doom", that allows troops to
interact and practice fairly realistic small unit tactics and fireteam
drills without any danger to them. It would appear to be a safe and cost
effective training alternative for CQB (Close Quarter Battle) and
urban/guerilla warfare tactics.

<P>Sun MicroSystems and other computer simulator makers are also said to
have developed workstations that allow company, battalion, brigade, and
even division level officers to practice large unit engagement
techniques in realistic virtual circumstances. These computer
developments allow combat commanding officers to develop interactive
skills that are useful in practicing modern "Air-Land-Battle" doctrine,
that is need on today's extremely fluid battlefield environment.

<P>On the emergency service side of the training simulation business,
companies like the Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI) have
been advocating the possibility of using virtual reality systems to
allow paramedics to practice treatment protocols on virtual patients,
firefighters to burn and fight fires in virtual buildings, and police
officers learn street survival skills and arrest virtual criminals.
Additionally, ERRI thinks that it would be an efficient and cost
effective way for multiple emergency agencies to participate in mock
disaster scenarios over a network.  And, all without danger to either
citizens or the emergency responders.

<P>One of the biggest problems in both the military and emergency services
is to expose "rookie" responders or low-ranking soldiers/sailors/airmen
to enough "experiences" to allow them to function effectively in a
crisis or combat situation. Reportedly, many injuries and even deaths
occur in both training and in their first few months or even years on
the job. It is believed by ERRI and others  that by using realistic
virtual reality training that this "experience quotient" can be rapidly
increased and unnecessary casualties prevented. Additionally, the
quality of emergency service that is provided to the public can be
bettered while interagency cooperation and communication improves.

<P>By the use of computer networks, it would even be possible for military
and civilian emergency agencies to "virtually" work and drill together,
as might prove necessary in the event of a terrorist attack,
chemical/biological release, or other large scale disaster situation.
"The possibilities of this concept are endless...for improving our
national response capabilities and facilitating effective and more
realistic training for those that protect us on a daily basis,"
according to Clark Staten, ERRI executive Director.

<P>Staten says that he can see a transference of simulation capability and
technology from an already developed military capability to the civilian
emergency response sector and that closer cooperation between the two is
both needed and inevitable in the coming century.</P>

<P> Today there are no shortages of modern-day threats to stability and 
     security as reflected in challenges emerging in form of stateless 
     warfare or sometimes referred to as 4th generation warfare. 
     
<P>     The CPG recognizes that with the end of the Cold War, our nation faces 
     more diverse and complex challenges. The central security concern of 
     the past half century, communist expansion, is gone, but civil 
     conflict is spreading and rogue states threaten regional stability 
     coupled with undefined threats of stateless warfare that have not yet 
     been identified.
     
 <P>    The rapid diffusion of information, people, and technology raises the 
     risk of proliferation of advanced weapons, including weapons of mass 
     destruction. So too, global demographic pressures are contributing to 
     large-scale environmental and resource degradation sapping economies 
     and undermining political and regional stability. 
     
<P>     While there has been conflicts over oil,international confrontations 
     over water are simmering across the globe unless more rational steps 
     are taken to conserve that dwindling resource. One in five countries 
     is suffering water shortages. National and international conflicts are 
     already brewing over rights to scarce water and will certainly worsen 
     if we do not begin to use global resources like water more 
     efficiently. Population growth has outstripped food production 
     increases in one-third of all countries in the worlds increasing the 
     potential for regional instability.
     
 <P>    Meeting stateless threats to stability and security requires an 
     enduring commitment to military readiness. The CPG provides insight to 
     where leadership, bold innovative thinking, people, and technology, 
     can play a key role in adapting naval expeditionary forces for the 
     undefined threats of stateless warfare that lay in wait and fester up 
     as regional instability and criminal activity of international gangs.
    
 <P>    Technological innovation and bold thinking have advanced our military 
     capabilities for decades, often ensuring the Corps' position as the 
     world's premier force in readiness. Today, the demands of new global 
     challenges in the form of stateless warfare are growing, along with 
     the demands on our limited resources and operational forces.
     
 <P>    For the Corps, the operational challenge is to ready our forces to 
     address a more varied set of stateless threats , the unexpected, and 
     the yet-to-be-define threats, while at the same time downsizing and 
     restructuring to respond to the defense needs of the 21st century. 
     
<P>    To achieve these objectives in concert with the CPG, Quantico, in 
     extremely close concert with the operational forces must launch a 
     series of initiatives to use mature technologies.  The CWL 
     (Commandant's Warfighting Lab) is the cornerstone in furnishing the 
     Corps' overarching window on the future as we integrate people with 
     technology in the combat development process.
     
<P>     The CPG clearly signals CMC's commitment to "leveraging" technology 
     (both high and low tech) to ensure that our Corps maintains the 
     best-trained and best-equipped forces in the world. Critical are near- 
     term technologies that can dramatically enhance our ability to both 
     prepare for and execute military actions. By supporting advances in 
     information technologies, sensors, and simulation, we strengthen our 
     ability to anticipate and execute military operations, while training 
     our forces in more realistic settings. 
     
<P>     Technologies are central to greater situational awareness by enabling 
     our forces to acquire large amounts of information, analyzing it 
     quickly, and communicating it to others concurrently for coordinated 
     and precise action. Technological breakthroughs are changing the face 
     of conflict and how we prepare for the unexpected and high-risk 
     missions.
     
 <P>    Highly trained Marines with the right technology can help underwrite 
     our ability to succeed in high-risk missions, capitalize on all of our 
     Corps' global capabilities, while quickly coordinating actions. New 
     technologies are being developed to strengthen our efforts in 
     peacekeeping such as nonlethal munitions. Technological advances such 
     as JDIS, JMCIS, and GCCS are being pursued to fortify the joint 
     fighting capabilities.
     
 <P>    Technology advances must be cheap, easy to use,  and make complex 
     tasks simple. Towards this end CPG reminds us to consider new ways of 
     doing business by modernizing our thinking as well as our equipment.  
     Research, development, and acquisition initiatives must be put in 
     place to remove barriers that separate the defense industry from the 
     commercial industry. The goal is to see that the military gets the 
     highest quality equipment at the lowest cost. 
     
<P>     The DOD dual-use technology policy recognizes that we can no longer 
     afford to maintain two distinct industrial bases because of high 
     costs. The military needs to learn how to exploit the rapid rate of 
     innovation of commercial industry to meet military needs. 
     
 <P>    CPG suggests  leveraging commercial technology to create military 
     advantage and eliminate the need to make expensive commitments to 
     product procurement.  So it recognized that in some situation "no" 
     solutions or tactical solutions are viable alternatives as well.  To 
     be sure CPG does safe on the over reliance on technology by 
     emphasizing people over things.  This particularly key in dealing with 
     some aspects of the broad class of global threats associated with 
     stateless warfare.
     
<P>     The Corps and its CWL recognize there is a broad class of global 
     threats that endangers the security and well-being of Americans and 
     others around the world. With undefined threats emerging, complicated 
     by technology and  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
     there are requirements for military and technology investments. For 
     example, the United States Marine Corps is boldly expanding its 
     cooperation with other services and agencies to provide a world class 
     biochem response unit.
     
 <P>    The likelihood of a state or nonstate entity will use biochem weapons 
     of mass destruction against U.S. interesting is growing. Concordant 
     with the CPG the USMC is training a response team based at Camp 
     Lejeune shored up by an cyber,Reachback Advisory Group, a computer 
     network with U.S. scientific experts on modern-day biochem threats.
     
 <P>    Clearly there are no shortages of modern-day threats to stability and 
     security. General Krulak's Commandant's Planning Guidance (CPG) renews 
     our enduring commitment to military readiness and gives us insight 
     into the critical role people and technology play in national security 
     and the changing security environment indicative of stateless warfare.

<P>Frequently asked questions:

<P>1. WHAT IS A LISTSERV?  

<P>Answer>> It is a computer which is always on, and which is always 
connected to the Internet.  A single address is attached to a 
membership list of email addresses for those people who are 
subscribed by the list moderator.  When a message is sent to the 
listserv address, the computer automatically copies the message, 
and sends it to all the members immediately.  

<P>2. Is this a discussion group, an information dissemination
resource, or both?

<P>Answer>> Primary focus is dissemination of information useful to
DOD intel and counter intel field operatives.  Co-primary focus
is research support for assistance requests posted by CI/intel
types.  Concise/brief analysis, and citation-supported/brief
predictions & conclusions are welcomed.  General discussion is 
discouraged, except to aid in analysis, predictions, and conclusions.

<P>3. How many posts per day should I send in?

<P>Answer>> If most members delete-without-reading a message posted,
then it probably wasn't germane to g-two's audience.  Stated 
differently, posts should be eyeball magnets, drawing the interest
and readership of CI and intel operatives.  Rule of thumb: Never
fail to post an eyeball magnet, think twice about posting
low-interest material.

October 28, 1996<BR><BR>

<P>According to a recent study that was conducted for the U.S. Air
Force by the Rand Corporation, Russian air force modernization
is at a standstill and its tactical aircraft inventory has
dropped by more than 50 percent.

<P>The Rand study reported that there was was one single new Russian
combat aircraft budgeted in 1996.  The air force only purchased 23
planes in the combined years of 1993 and 1994.  By comparison,
during the early 1980s, the Soviet Union purchased 400 to 450
aircraft per year.

<P>The study, entitled, "Russia's Air Power at the Crossroads," was
written by veteran analyst Benjamin S. Lambeth.  Lambeth says
that in 1989, the Soviet Union had more than 5,000 combat aircraft.
Today, it has less than half that number.  About one-third of
the available aircraft today are fourth generation MiG-29s and
Su-27s.  The remainder of the air fleet are older aircraft that
are scheduled to be retired by the year 2000.

<P>According to Russian Air Force estimates, if current Russian budget
trends continue, the inventory of tactical aircraft will drop from
2,280 to 1,670 in 1997.  By the year 2000, the fleet will decline
to 1,440.  And by the year 2005, Russia will have 1,330 planes.

<P>The Rand report stated, "Russia face no air-to-air or other
operational challenge today that would even remotely warrant
the expenditure of large amounts of scarce funds on the Russian
Air Force's state need for a new combat fighter.  The main thrust
of Russia's current defense planning is being directed toward
power projection, not high-technology air warfare, as the air
force's recent combat experience in Chechnya has amply attested."

<P>The Rand study added, Russian defense officials' top priority
is transport aircraft.

<P>Lambeth and his study also documented a long list of woes that
have recently become familiar in discussions of the Russian
military.  But in regards to the air force, problems seen include:
<UL>
-- The decline of air defense.  In 1991, at the time of the collapse
of the Soviet Union, the air force had 2,300 intercepters.  Today,
they have less than half that number.<BR>

-- The Russian air force faces a fuel shortage of crisis proportions
and fuel prices continue to increase rapidly.<BR>

-- The pilot-to-aircraft ratio is much too high.  Fighter pilots
are only averaging 25 flying hours per year.<BR>

-- A shortage of spare parts and manpower to maintain aircraft.<BR>
</UL>

<P>On Friday, Russian Defense Minister Igor Rodionov warned that
Russia faces an erosion of its military readiness unless the
decline in the military budget is reversed.  Rodionov was said
to have painted a grave picture of the state of the Russian
military.

<P>The Defense Minister said, "The armed forces are on the edge,
beyond which extremely undesirable and even uncontrollable
events might take place."

<P>In recent years, Russia's spending on defense has fallen sharply.
Rodionov said, "If the 1997 defense budget is not corrected,
Russia might lose its armed forces as integral and capable state
structure."

<P>Since the end of the Cold War, the Russian army's prestige has
also fallen.  It recent battles in Chechnya, the Russian army
was said to have been humiliated by Chechen fighters.

<P>The proposed 1997 budget has earmarked $18.5 billion for defense
spending.  Rodionov says that it will cover about 33 percent of
what the military really needs.  He cited the "decreasing levels
of combat and mobilization readiness."  Rodionov added that
many soldiers and officers have not been paid in months.

<P>The once-feared Russian military has been in retreat since the
breakup of the Soviet Union five years ago.  The army is said
to be short of money and its poorly trained personnel show
little will to fight -- as evidenced by the setbacks it received
on the battlefield in Chechnya.

<P>Rose Gottemoeller, the deputy director of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said, "The problem
at the moment is the chaotic implosion of the armed forces.
They need to downsize and profesinalize, but it needs to be
a planned and controlled process."

<P>Since the end of the Cold War, the Russian military has
struggled to define a new role for itself.  It lacks both
the resources and a clear foreign enemy.  This lack of
direction is seen as dangerous to some military analysts.

<P>Fortunately, most analysts do not foresee any revolt in the
military.  True, there are some hardliners in the officer
corps who wish for the lost empire of the Soviet era, there
are also many officers who support pro-reform.

<P>The vast majority of the soldiers are conscripts and they only
desire to get out of the military and cannot be counted upon
to back any attempt of a coup.

<P>Retired Lt.-General Mikhail Surkov, the deputy chairman of the
Duma's defense committee, said, "If urgent measures aren't taken,
the state may be left without well-trained military forces.  It's
better to have no armed forces than to have them untrained."

<P>The Russian economy is in crisis.  The armed forces have been
unable to pay many of their officers and men with even decent
rations.  The number of personnel in the military has dropped
from 2.7 million in 1992 to 1.5 million today.  Many analysts
say that number is still too high for what Russia needs.

<P>Defense Minister Rodionov wants to slash 300,000 men from the
ranks.  He also wants to decrease the number of combat divisions
from 78 to 12.  This would allow the Russian Army to be made
truly operational and will allow them to be supplied with more
modern weapons and be trained as truly professional soldiers.

<P>A specialist of the Russian military at Scotland's Edinburgh
University, John Erikson, said, "Russian capability at the
moment consists probably of being able to put one fully equipped
division in the field and to conduct limited operations outside
its borders -- provided it could operate under air superiority."

<P>Taking an even dimmer view of the Russian military is Alexander
Konovalov, who is the director of a military policy center at
Moscow's Institute of USA and Canada.  He says the Russian
military is "definitely not strong enough" to operate outside
of its borders.  But, he added, that is no longer its mission.

<P>In analyzing Defense Minister Rodionov's plans, Konovalov said,
"If he is thinking of reducing the military to twelve divisions,
this is a man who is ready for painful, decisive, responsible
steps."

<P>
The views and opinions expressed in this article express those
of solely the author and should not be construed to represent
the official views of the Department of Defense or the National
Defense University 
<P>
 What constitutes an &quot;act of war&quot; in the &quot;information
age.  This is a question that most members of the &quot;IW community&quot;
have wrestled with, and it's a question that places one squarely
on the horns of a dilemma: if you cannot easily answer whether
an act belongs to the legal codes of war or peace, how can you
make a determination of the act's ethical status?  
<P>
 There is a mindset that IW has become part of the ongoing debate
about non-lethal weapons and military technologies.  While this
is not the place to enter the debate about the effectiveness or
utility of such technologies and capabilities, this is a good
place to briefly explore what we mean by &quot;non-lethal&quot;?
 A bomb that blows up a train or airplane is certainly &quot;lethal&quot;,
but what of a HERF Gun that disables all electronically controlled
systems, including signal devices or movement controls, and thus
causes crashes or other movement failures that result in injuries
and death...is that &quot;non lethal?&quot;  The distinction between
what could be called first-order and second-order effects is important.
 A laser-guided bomb, delivered precisely against a target of
clear military value and entirely in accordance with the existing
laws of armed conflict--an electric power plant--might not kill
or injure anyone in the immediate explosion of the bomb, yet help
create the conditions that later lead to illness and fatalities.
 The distinction between immediate and longer-term collateral
damage is not new to the information age, but its technologies
exacerbate the uncertainty as well as focus the publicity that
accrues from such events.  If these issues are the subject of
vigorous and widespread debate over old and long existing technologies
such as aerial-delivered high explosive bombs, how long will we
wrestle with the uncertainty surrounding the use of new and technologically
sophisticated devices?  
<P>
 This leads almost directly into another key issue, the growing
intermingling in the integrated information society of systems
used and needed by both the military and civil sides of society.
 A century ago this was a minor problem because of the limited
reach and range of weaponry.  Armies fought in linear formations
and engaged with shoulder arms, while the range of turn of the
century artillery was limited to just a few miles.  Its targets
were almost always clearly military in nature, except for those
rare situations when a siege was undertaken, and the laws of land
warfare have always been relatively forgiving in the case of sieges.
 What changed all this was the airplane, because its range was
orders of magnitude greater than artillery.  Suddenly (and I use
the term intentionally...a leap in range of at least 1000% over
the span of less than a decade qualifies as &quot;sudden&quot;)
all of the army's &quot;rear areas&quot; were open to attack,
including perhaps its capital city, such as London or Paris. 
The result of the synergies between new technology (the bomber)
and human factors (the revulsion against the futility and slaughter
of WW I-style trench warfare) was--to use the current buzz phrase--a
revolution in military affairs.  Airmen such as Giulio Douhet,
Billy Mitchell, and Hugh Trenchard thought they saw a way to avoid
a repetition of the carnage and bloodbath of WW I.  The airplane
could take the war directly to new and vital targets...the social,
political and industrial centers of national power that had heretofore
been unreachable.  But this placed the new weapon precisely on
the horns of a sharp ethical dilemma.  Unlike armies on a battlefield,
these targets were often totally interspersed with the noncombatant,
civilian populace that the law of war was expressly intended to
protect.  Which, then, was the greater evil or good...to protect
the civilians at the expense of another generation of Europe's
 young men, or to spare hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions,
of young soldiers by killing and injuring a lesser but still very
large number of innocent civilians?  Not until the recent development
and demonstrated proof of the effectiveness of precision weaponry
has this conundrum been alleviated, albeit at the cost of a new
conundrum discussed earlier.  
<P>
 This returns to the information society's intermingling of military
and civilian systems, for Information Warfare forces us to face
anew the ethical difficulty faced by Douhet, Mitchell and Trenchard.
 If Bits and Bytes offer an alternative form of exerting  national
power than bombs and bullets,  which ethical mandate should we
follow?  That which attempts to hold separate the military from
the civilian, no matter what the overall cost in blood and suffering,
or that which attempts to minimize the destructiveness and duration
of the conflict, even at the expense of affecting systems or functions
that are clearly and unquestionably civilian?  Worse, might our
own national infrastructures and systems lead an opponent into
precisely this course of action?  Since by our own admission over
90% of DOD's daily communications travel over civilian owned and
operated communication systems, doesn't this condition make our
national information infrastructure a viable, legal and ethical
target in case of conflict?  Perhaps, and it well illustrates
the dilemma that the integrated information society poses for
the military planner who must take such legal and ethical concerns
into consideration when planning possible military operations.
 As with airpower theory in the 1920s and 30s, the new technology
combines with human factors such as the desire to reduce bloodshed
to provide a new form of warfare...IW.  
<P>
 The development of new capabilities has not simplified the situation,
only exacerbated it.  Some of these capabilities can be grouped
into four general types: intelligence; offensive computer weaponry
(hardware and software); directed energy-type weaponry (HERF guns,
EMP devices, etc); and PSYOPs.  In a narrow sense the discussion
of intelligence might seem out of place, since espionage has not
been considered the same <B>as</B> warfare (it lacks the destructiveness
and violence, for starters), although it is indispensable <B>to
</B> warfare.  Henry Stimson's famous adage &quot;gentlemen don't
read other gentlemen's mail&quot; notwithstanding, it is clear
that throughout history men (gentle or otherwise) HAVE read other
men's mail, especially when in the service of state or sovereign.
 In modern times the ability to electronically gather intelligence
has become not only understood and accepted but its ethical correctness
has become enshrined in the arms control lexicon as &quot;national
technical means&quot;, a crucial part of the verification process,
without which the SALT and START agreements would have been impossible.
 But the new technologies of the information age raise a new and
frightening specter...the inability to distinguish between espionage
and war.  In the &quot;good old days&quot; the two were clearly
separate.  Even such dangerous and legally-suspect activities
as overflights of the USSR by U-2s in the 1950s were obviously
not war; and if a state of armed conflict such as that between
the USA and North Vietnam existed, activities (such as overflight)
that would have been prohibited otherwise had the legal sanction
as a permissible activity of a belligerent.  But what if the espionage
is conducted by computer, probing into adversary databanks and
control systems to determine, for example, how their air defense
system functions.  Is the penetration passive, merely intelligence
gathering, or was a trojan horse or logic bomb planted in the
process, designed to &quot;lower shields&quot; on command?  Would
that be considered an &quot;act of war&quot;?  The legal and ethical
implications are a bit murky, and much might depend on the surrounding
context and history. 
<P>
 Even this, however, does not get as murky as economic espionage.
 The &quot;traditional&quot; espionage that states conduct concerning
political-military subjects are better understood...fighter plane
design, treaty negotiations, weapons testing, etc.  But suggestions
that governments, at least those of free market economies, engage
in espionage to gain economic intelligence immediately raises
the issue of who will receive the coveted information...all of
the different companies making the new and improved widgets, or
just one company?  Are any of the companies involved transnational,
involving significant foreign elements?  This may be the most
difficult ethical issue involved in this suggestion because it
involves domestic business practices and existing national business
law.  Yet his observation that other countries certainly engage
in economic espionage is well taken, and faces us with the possibility
that perhaps in some situations our ethical and legal restrictions
on such activities may place us at a severe disadvantage in dealing
with a country that does not share the same set of moral and ethical
scruples as we.
<P>
 The second general type of capability cited above concerns a
form of computer warfare...modifying either the internal software
or hardware to cause the enemy's computer to behave in a manner
other than they expect.  Software modifications are perhaps the
better known of the two...viruses, logic bombs, trojan horses,
and all the other means that have been developed to get the software
or programming to carry out actions or instructions that serve
your  purposes.  Hardware modifications, such as &quot;chipping&quot;
the microchip to add or delete key functions, are more difficult,
requiring access to the chip before it is ever installed in the
machine.  Not surprisingly, there are a couple of ethical questions
that come to the surface.  
<P>
 Although much depends on &quot;when&quot; the action is being
taken, gaining entry into someone's operating system (and whether
that someone is a person or a state does matter) and planting
software instructions carries the same ethical concerns as carrying
out that action for intelligence gathering purposes.  If we are
&quot;at peace&quot; such an act could range from being a criminal
act to being an act of information age statecraft, although the
laws and ethical standards that guide the conduct of individuals,
corporations and states vary significantly.  If we are &quot;at
war&quot; or in a state of armed conflict such an act would be
a legitimate act of belligerency...although we'll leave the definition
of &quot;at war&quot; open for the moment.  It would seem that
when engaged in war, the degree of intrusiveness required to gain
access to an adversary computer system and alter the programming
would be minor compared to the amount of intrusiveness necessary
to place a 1000lb laser guided bomb in the programming!  In the
case of peacetime hardware modifications, however, such as   
  &quot;chipping&quot;, the issues become murkier.  Unless one
postulates the ability to gain physical access to the enemy computer
during wartime and insert the &quot;secret chip&quot;, this would
have to be accomplished during &quot;peacetime&quot;, which carries
some interesting ethical issues.  If the chip being &quot;chipping&quot;
is commercially manufactured, are we involving the manufacturer
in the effort?  There could be some interesting legal complications
from that action downstream.  If other nations that do business
with the firm learn of its complicity and cut their ties, is the
government responsible for their loss?  Even if such a loss is
not a legal liability, is it an ethical one?  If we take such
an action, have we crossed an invisible line that separates &quot;prudent
preparation&quot; from &quot;hostile action&quot;?  If you take
into account modern electronic warfare that can provide the rationale
for using deadly force (firing an anti-radiation missile against
a radar site) based solely on the way electrons are used (switching
a radar from the surveillance mode to target acquisition/firing
mode), there are interesting and pragmatic precedents for gauging
hostility solely on the way one uses cyberspace.
<P>
 The third category of information weaponry, those that employ
some form of energy, seem to be the most similar to traditional
forms of weaponry, even if they work their impact by rearranging
electrons rather than atoms, steel plates, or body parts.  The
ethical conundrums would come from the target against which the
weapon would be used and the existence or lack of a state of war.
 Disabling the electronics of a fighter plane or air defense radar
during wartime would be fully in agreement with the existing laws
of war and would face no ethical dilemmas regarding such an action;
disabling the electronics of a civilian airliner or an air traffic
control radar during peacetime, however, would be a criminal act,
and even if done during wartime might very well violate one or
more of the basic principles that instruct the law of war, such
as discrimination or proportionality.  In short, the ethical issues
involved here stem from the function or capability of the target
being struck and whether a state of conflict exists at the time
of use.  These are issues similar to those faced in the use of
current and traditional kinetic weaponry.
<P>
 It is in the fourth general category, psychological operations
or PSYOPS, that we find an interesting blend of the traditional
and the new to pose ethical concerns surrounding the use of information
warfare.  Propaganda and disinformation have a long and storied
history in the annals of warfare and statecraft.  Napoleon's agents
preceded the armies of Revolutionary and Imperial France as they
marched across Europe, posting handbills in soon-to-be-liberated
towns announcing the imminent arrival of the Enlightenment.  In
World War I, the British decision to sever all of the transatlantic
telegraph cables that linked Germany to the outside world meant
that the view of the war seen in New York was the one filtered
through a lens in London.  In 1995, Ecuador went onto the Net
with web pages full of information proving that Peru was the aggressor
in their border clash.    Earlier information technologies such
as the radio and TV provided new and potent ways to engage in
IW, and the microchip has not simplified the issue.  Can anyone
who saw Tom Hanks conversing with John F Kennedy in the movie
&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; have any doubts that it is technologically
possible to produce computer-enhanced or &quot;morphed&quot; videotape
that clearly and conclusively shows adversary leadership violating
sacred religious or cultural precepts, in order to destabilize
a regime?  How would the new technology have served George, the
protagonist of Orwell's novel <I>1984</I>, who's job it was to
rewrite history?  What will happen when someone generates &quot;new&quot;
Holocaust imagery and thus calls into question the entire body
of information regarding the Nazi's genocide campaign?  What will
happen to the old saw, &quot;seeing is believing&quot; when the
eyes can be so easily fooled?  What are the ethical issues involved
in such possible techniques and operations?  Does the status or
location of the intended or target audience (domestic, international,
enemy, etc) affect this issue?  This is not an area for which
the law currently has many answers...mostly questions that fall
well outside of the common understanding of the law of war.  There
are existing American laws that address the issue of conducting
psyops or propaganda within the US...it's against the law!  But
new information technologies make some of these prescriptions
difficult.  There have already been cases in which material disseminated
overseas by the USIA has been electronically posted to the internet
and thus became available domestically to American citizens, which
resulted in threatened lawsuits.  The issue here is the dreaded
term &quot;perception management&quot;, and the possibility that
the information being used manage the perceptions of foreign audiences
and groups could be used by someone to shape or manage the perceptions
of the American populace.  Both the legality and ethics of such
an activity would be questionable, regardless of the technology
used to carry it out.  
<P>
 A particularly thorny issue that is surfacing concerns the possibility
for assymetrical conflict between a state and a non-state.  The
Information Age offers some unique capabilities for non-state
entities to engage in conflict with one state while using another
for cover, or even the reverse...a state using an NGO for cover!
 The legal and ethical mix is fascinating...how would a state
respond to such an action, especially if the means used were informational
or non-lethal.  Could a digital, electronic informational attack,
whether by a state or another entity, meet the criteria of the
terminology used in the UN Charter, such as &quot;armed attack&quot;
and &quot;Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts
of Aggression&quot;?
<P>
 This last point brings us full circle and to closure on the question
&quot;what is an act of war in the Information Age?&quot;  Does
the oft-cited &quot;Clausewitzian Paradigm&quot; require force,
violence, and nation-state actors for there to be &quot;war&quot;?
 It's somewhat ironic that despite entirely appropriate caution
about the current overuse of the word &quot;War&quot;, our Services
do not have a &quot;Law of War&quot;, but rather a &quot;Law of
Armed Conflict&quot;!  And how do we define &quot;force&quot;
and &quot;violence&quot;?  If we compel another state or political
actor to do our will haven't we &quot;forced&quot; them to do
so, whether or not we've used high explosive?  Must the means
used to exert the force be violent, in isolation of the ends or
outcomes?  To further argue the issue, what is the real difference
whether a hostile state used surface-to-air missiles to shoot
down 10 airliners and kill 1000 people or used advanced technological
IW devices to jam their flight controls so that the same airliners
crashed and the same people were killed?  Is there an ethical
or legal difference between those actions?  By 6AM local time
on 17 January 1991 there was no doubt that a &quot;state of armed
conflict&quot; existed between Iraq and the UN Coalition, after
we had physically destroyed much of their integrated air defense
system.  Would the situation have been significantly different
if we had been able to do so solely using advanced technological
means, without penetrating or violating Iraq's sovereign airspace
or dropping any high explosive bombs?  Would that exercise and
demonstration of information power equate to &quot;war&quot;,
as did the 1991 exercise of airpower.  The book is still very
much open, and we need a vigorous and spirited debate, on the
ethical and legal status of IW and the new paradigm of information
age national security.  There's a new technology in town, there's
a new environment in which we're just beginning to learn how to
operate, and if history  is any guide, we'll be wrestling with
these issues for decades to come.

From: Crypt Newsletter <crypt@sun.soci.niu.edu><BR>
Subject: File 3--The fictive environment of DoD infowar kooks<BR>

<P>The September 8-15 issue of Defense News magazine featured an
article on information warfare kooks at the Pentagon and elsewhere
in the western world. Coming together at the National Computer Security
Association's annual InfoWar Con in Washington, DC, various political
and military attaches were quoted making amusing and fantastic
claims by reporter Pat Cooper.

<P>One of the best examples was given by the Australian embassy's defense
attache in Washington, air vice marshal Brendan O'Loghlin. O'Loghlin
was reported to say information warfare could be used to destroy enemy
computers through the release or deployment of computer viruses into
foreign networks.

<P>Of course, this will feed more computer virus myths on the effectiveness
of trivial replicating programs as weapons.  It also overlooks the
problem of "blowback," or what happens when a military option imposed
on an enemy blows back over friendly borders and becomes a menace at
home.

<P>Indeed, the entire history of computer viruses shows their epidemiology
is no respecter of diplomatic treaties, allies, or international
borders.
Spread of computer viruses is by practical definition uncontrollable.

<P>Does this mean a branch of the Australian military is actually thinking
about writing computer viruses or procuring them as potential weapons?
Hard to say.

<P>But it does raise the question why a politico-military appointee in the
Australian diplomatic corps isn't censured by his home office for
spouting such arrant stupidity in a high profile public forum.

<P>Another trenchant quote was provided to Cooper by Marine General John
Sheehan, head man at Atlantic Command in Norfolk, VA.  Sheehan said
he was getting involved in information warfare because "We don't
want to get our butts kicked by a bunch of long-haired 26-year-olds
with earrings."

<P>And the world of infowar kooks is not without its own evolving jargon,
too, where old phenomena and plans evolve into new words that make no
sense but which serve to hide spoiled old wine in new bottles.

<P>One of the better terms Crypt has seen is "fictive environment."
Coined by infowar kooks at the Air Force College of Aerospace Doctrine
at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, a "fictive environment" is
one created when the U.S. military spams a bogus electronic press
(or a radio or TV broadcast) release on Saddam Hussein kissing a pig
into, say, the Iraqi communications network.  This used to be called
psychological operations but information warfare kooks have cleverly
renamed it "fictive environment," perhaps to avoid being downsized
when the psy-ops budget is cut.

<P>Of course, information warfare kooks in the U.S. military believe
such a stunt would discredit enemy leaders in the eyes of their troops,
causing foreign soldiers to march to our side -- or at least be gripped
by indecision.  The U.S., say the information warfare kooks, is
immune to a "fictive environment" since we have an open society and
no one ever gets taken in by bogus news stories on computer networks
or television broadcasts.  The skeptical reader is forgiven for
wondering
what planet Department of Defense information warfare kooks have been
living on.</P>

<P>According to official reports, the U.S. Army has
announced the activation of the new 310th Chemical Company, a unit
designed to detect biological warfare agents in combat, something that
the Army has acknowledged it could not previously do.

<P>"This is the very first biological detection company in our country,"
according to Maj. Gen. Ralph Wooten, commander of Fort McClellan. "If
necessary, we have a unit that can be immediately deployable." In the
1991 Gulf War the U.S. military found itself facing a foe that had
developed several types of biological weapons.

<P>The military concluded after the Gulf War that Iraq never used any of
the weapons, such as anthrax, but it conceded that it had no way to
effectively detect or defeat biological weapons. "Our Achilles' heel was
biological warfare," Wooten said Saturday.

<P>The 310th Chemical Company, a reserve unit at Fort McClellan, has mobile
biological detection laboratories mounted on reinforced Humvees. Each of
the 35 labs weighs 10,000 pounds and costs taxpayers about $1 million,
officials said.  The on-board "Biological Integrated Defense Systems"
can detect four types of biological agents, although the Army won't
specify which ones.

 First of all, this paper would not have been possible without
the support of INSS.  I also wish to thank Colonel Carl Reddel,
Professor and Head, USAFA Department of History.  The following
people contributed in some way, either through interviews, e-mails,
phone conversations, &quot;B-S&quot; sessions, and proofreading.

<P>
<U>Executive Summary</U>
<P>
 This paper answered a question posed by HQ USAF/INXI: What do
Air Force personnel need to learn in order to operate effectively
in an information warfare (IW) environment?  The question asks
for a bridge to the twenty-first century multipolar world. The
author contends that the Air Force will not be adequately configured
to meet the next century until its leaders demand, and pursue,
fundamental restructuring of our educational, training and operational
frameworks. Seventeen specific recommendations are outlined to
show the way toward this goal.
<P>
 This paper challenges the Air Force to seek long-lasting change
by reaching deep into the very soul of the institution and redefining
its <I>core values</I> and <I>core competencies</I>.  Our current
core values of  <I>integrity, service before self, and excellence
in all we do</I> make no mention of warfighting, intellectual
prowess or creativity.  One of our core competencies, <I>information
dominance</I> is unrealistic.  No IW education program ever devised
will achieve it. Rather, we should pursue <I>situational awareness
on a global scale</I> and prepare our personnel to operate effectively
in an environment of uncertainty.  
<P>
 Until these values are changed, no education and training program
-- even those based on the recommendations of this paper -- will
last long enough to ensure victory in the future.  More importantly,
until these values are wholeheartedly <I>embraced</I> by the Air
Force leadership and all Air Force personnel, they will only be
hollow words incapable of preventing institutional fragmentation.
 Therefore, a call to meet the information warfare environment
is truly a call to meet the future as a unified, airminded, Air
Force.

<P>
Nowadays it's the beginning of a new age - the age of information
civilization, the age of open community. We have less then half
a decade to go into the third Millennium.
<P>
The main theme of this conference InfoWarCon 5 - electronic civil
defense - is rather urgent. Not long ago the priority of using
computer systems was fixed by military and scientific institutes.
Now it has passed in the hands of civil population. All of us
are users of computers: politicians, militaries, businessmen,
scientists, practically every person and even children. Advantages
of using a computer today are out of question. However potential
dangers and threats from using modern computer technologies have
a global scale.
<OL>
<LI>The Information reality and the problem of personal security
</OL>

<P>
Almost all activity of a person now is mediated by machines. That's
the point why our civilization is determined now as human-machine
civilization. Thus, the person becomes a component, factor of
more common integrity, namely formed during last decade of the
information reality. The creation of this symbolic and spiritual
information reality is the expression of becoming of Noosphere
as a common knowledge and intellect of the planet. It is also
a law-governed consequence. This reality is available to each
one as a component of environments. And everyone is responsible
its cleanness and safety. This virtual psychological and informational
reality can become a special factor of mastering the evolution
of modern community in conditions of personal security maintenance.
<P>
The problem of informational and psychological safety of the person
is a component of the noospheric world outlook.
<OL>
<LI>Matter - Energy - Information - Knowledge - Wisdom
</OL>

<P>
&quot; We have forgotten the wisdom for the sake of knowledge,
we lose knowledge in streams of the information.&quot; This statement
made by T.Elliot is not only a poetic exaggeration. It is one
of global problems of our existence in Noosphere. Cognition of
nature is a condition of life and development of the person, so
the understanding of artificial reality is a condition of survival
in it.
<P>
It is necessary to get rid from the illusion, that possessing
the information is identical to knowledge, understanding and wisdom.
Now it's a situation, when we can say that the more we know the
less we understand. Thus transformation of mass media in the tools
of information war - is a superficial symptom of a more serious
illness of the mankind.
<P>
In such circumstances the paradigm shift is necessary: from the
information - to knowledge, from knowledge and intelligence -
to meta-knowledge and wisdom. Several decades ago it was a priority
of material resources (energetic, financial...). Today it is substituted
to a priority of human intelligence and information. Probably,
such a point of view on the Information Warfare will remove its
actuality in the nearest future as it was already done with Space
Warfare. However the problem of personal security of the person
will not be strike off the agenda.
<OL>
<LI>Information War and a person
</OL>

<P>
The InfoWar definition accepted on this conference covers a wide
spectrum of problems, which are connected to security of information.
But now we shall focus our attention at some methodological aspects
of protection users of computer from different effects it can
provide.
<P>
The people were and still remain the major strategic resources
of a nation. The threat to the person is considered to be a key
questions of national security.
<P>
The modern scientific data testify potential possibility of effecting
on complex technical objects (technosphere), on consciousness
of the person (psychosphere), and on group consciousness of a
community (noosphere) (fig.1). This can be done by technical and
psychotechnical means, including mass media and psychotechnologies.
<P>
We consider that correct diagnosis of the danger is the condition
of choosing the correct strategy of defense, or, at least, adaptation.
<OL>
<LI>Scientific approaches to the Computer Operator's Security
Problem
</OL>

<P>
The Computer Operator's Security Problem (the COS-problem) is
a multidisciplinary one. It states a great number of nontrivial
questions to the modern science. The traditional approach of natural
sciences does not cover a list of psychophysical phenomena, which
are connected to consciousness of the person and to psycho-physiological
state of an organism. Integrative efforts in different areas of
knowledge - physics, biology, psychology, cybernetics, philosophy
and religion - are needed (fig.2).
<P>
Physiological approach of traditional medicine considers a person
only as an organism - a closed system of organs. This can be illustrated
on fig.3. Modern natural - scientific representation of the person
consider him to be an open system, which communicates with environment
using material, energy and information flows. So it is better
to illustrate this by fig.4. As we can see there are also energetic
acupuncture channels, energetic centers - chacres and energy-information
field shell - aura. Such a picture can be obtained using special
registration devices, such as, for instance, photograph in high
frequency currents (Kirlian's method) and some others.
<P>
There are opinions of the scientists that there is a dynamically
stabile holographic structure around the body as a result of interference
of various sorts of radiation. This structure is connected to
internal systems of an organism also with external environment.
<P>
It is stated that we can effect on the given structure by means
of various radiation (electromagnetic, acoustic, and etc.) and
cause changes in psycho-physiological condition of an organism.
<OL>
<LI>The Computer Operator's Security Problem
</OL>

<P>
We can consider the security of an operator to be a condition
in which personal mentality, consciousness and organism is defended
from deliberate effect of physical and psychical factors of informational
and/or of energetic nature. This factors are representing a threat
to stable existence and steady development as of an individual,
groups of individuals, population, state and society (fig.5).
<OL>
<LI>Operator as the target of attack
</OL>

<P>
The human possibilities are determined by levels of physical,
mental, intellectual and spiritual potentialities. All of them
are considered as potential targets of possible attack through
a computer. Let us look in detail to some basic targets.
<OL>
<LI>Organism
</OL>

<P>
The effect can be targeted on various organs and systems of a
human body which are ensuring the vital ability of the person
as a biological organism. Brain, central nervous system, immune
system, also systems of breathing, blood circulation, reproduction
and other vital systems and organs can be exposed to attack (fig.3).
<OL>
<LI>Psychics: mentality, consciousness and subconsciousness
</OL>

<P>
The highest and most subtle forms of human activity - mentality,
consciousness - appear to be targets of effect. They aren't protected
from deliberate destructive effects.
<OL>
<LI>Typology of Computer - Operator effects
</OL>

<P>
Let us consider a general classification of all possible effects
on an operator (fig.6) in the system &quot;Person - Environment&quot;.
<P>
Effects can be of natural or artificial origin. We can consider
physical, biophysical effect of the environment to be natural
ones. Energetic, informational and combined (energy-informational)
are artificial effects. Effects can be deliberate and indeliberate
by its character, destructive, neutral or constructive by its
direction. Apparently, physical nature of certain effect is the
main classifying feature.
<P>
Therefore we can differ three main types of effects: energetic,
informational and combined ones: energy-informational.
<OL>
<LI>Energetic effects
</OL>

<P>
Under power effect we understand deliberate or indeliberate effect
of physical fields of a various origin (electromagnetic, gravitational,
acoustic and other fields), which have an ability to influence
on vital processes of a person (fig.7).
<P>
The target of such an effect is mainly the organism as a physical
body. Energetic effects can cause violation of normal functions
of organs and systems. The level of violation vary from decreasing
adaptive capacity, tissues destruction and even to death.
<P>
Powerful electromagnetic superhigh-frequency radiation, ionizing
rays can be examples of such an effect. Electromagnetic, radiological,
acoustic weapons are already realized as non-traditional &amp;
non-lethal means of InforWar. As we can imagine a computer can
be modified to be such a weapon but at some extent. Because it
has all types of energetic effects already built-in.
<OL>
<LI>Information effects
</OL>

<P>
The role of the information in man-machine interaction is extremely
great. Modern driver goes not by highway itself, but mostly by
symbolic signs near it. The car goes along the road, but the driver
goes along the &quot;information field&quot;. A pilot controls
the plane with a control panel. An astronaut need not to look
out of the rocket to control it. And so on and so forth... Operator
becomes the profession of the century as you can see.
<P>
The world appears in the form of diverse information flows. And
the main task of a person it to process it in most effective way.
Continuous information noise creates a dense shielding between
a person and true reality, which is substituted by virtual reality.
<P>
Informational effects are deliberate or indeliberate influence
on a person by transmitting information (signals, messages, items
of information, images etc.).
<P>
The main target of information effect is consciousness of a person
or a group of the people. It is possible to distort an objective
reality of the environment. There can be various objectives of
such a distortion: from modification of behavior (individual or
collective) up to pathological violation of mental ability of
the person.
<P>
Commercials on TV are a vivid example of information effect through
mass media. And we are successfully imposed to destructive models
of behavior (aggressive, sexual etc.).
<OL>
<LI>Energy-informational effect
</OL>

<P>
Energy-informational effects are deliberate or indeliberate effect
of physical fields of a various origin, modulated by semantic
information signals, which can be perceived by biological organisms.
<P>
All natural systems and organisms participate in process of energy-information
interactions. Human being and some technical systems also can
be a source of deliberate energy-information effects.
<P>
Organism of the person, and all levels of his psychics (mentality,
subconsciousness, consciousness, superconsciousness) are targets
of energy-information effects.
<P>
Energy-information effects can cause violation of physiological
and mental processes (disease, disorder of organs and systems
of an organism, modification of behavior, suppression of thinking,
manipulation with consciousness, Zombie-effects, psychopathology
and destruction of personality and other).
<P>
Remote psychokinetic effect on state of biological objects and
physical systems, influence on highest mental functions of vital
organisms, healing are reliable examples of energy-information
effect.
<OL>
<LI>The computer as the Information Warfare
</OL>

<P>
Today we know various methods of non-lethal effect based on energy-informational
nature of a person as physical, biological and social object.
In the Information Warfare arsenal they are described as non-traditional
types of weapon: electromagnetic weapon (microwaves EHF and ELF),
infrasonic acoustic bombs, laser weapon, computer viruses (fig.7).
Their application is possible during any stage of Information
War. Potentially, in the modern computer all these type of weapons
can be integrated. And a system effect is not equal to a simple
sum of components.
<OL>
<LI>The computer as an acoustic bomb
</OL>

<P>
Acoustic bomb and multimedia computer can provide acoustic waves
of low frequency, like that of an earthquake. They are capable
to cause a strong nausea. Internal ear and mechanism of balancing
are irritated. Moreover mechanical devices can be programmed on
a resonance ultrasonic or infrasonic oscillations.
<OL>
<LI>The computer as an electromagnetic weapon.
</OL>

<P>
The electromagnetic radiation in large cities has reached critical
levels. The All-world Public Health Organization had included
this problem in the list of the most urgent ones for the mankind.
A new factor of an environment - electromagnetic fields (EMF)
comes into being. Experts calls EMF an active environmental factor
with disastrous consequences for all living nature. EMF capacity
increased near the power transmissions, radio and TV stations,
communication and radiolocation means and computers certainly.
<P>
Spectral range of electromagnetic radiation from the computer
is rather wide - from low-frequency oscillations of a power current,
superhigh-frequency radiation of processor units up to visible
light and ionizing radiation of the screen. In the InfoWar period
it is quite probable to use the computer as an active radiator
through the global network.
<OL>
<LI>The computer as a psychophysical weapon
</OL>

<P>
Psychophysical weapon is a kind of sensation and fiction at once.
But still it is a strange to see a smoke without a fire for at
least half a century.
<P>
August 13, 1994. It was an accident in Voronezsh city. One user
of personal computer had lost his consciousness in less then twenty
minutes of working at it. His friend - a programmer - told that
he felt a strange feeling, as though he was wholly tightened inside
the computer screen with Norton Commander menu. Also he felt headache
and some noise in ears. It was almost impossible to go away, as
though it was a hypnoses. Luckily he managed to put off the computer.
His friend was dead some time later, not coming in consciousness.
The diagnosis was bleeding inside the brain (insult).
<P>
The cause of his death was a computer virus named &quot;666&quot;.
Experts determined, that it produces on the screen so called 25-th
frame with a special color combination, that can immerse the person
in the sort of hypnotic trans. Each 25-th frame the picture changes.
And subconscious perception of a new pattern results in arrhythmia
of heart activity. Blood pressure sharply increases, and then
falls also sharply. And blood-vessels of a brain can not withstand
those pulses.
<P>
Later near 50 similar cases of sudden death are registered. Wasn't
it an information weapon ?
<OL>
<LI>Basic defensive methods and means
</OL>

<P>
In order to maintain security it is necessary to know from what
and how to be defended. First it is necessary to explore possible
types of effect on a person through the computer. Then development
of registration and measuring technique is needed. And at last
we are to determine a nature of the effect in order to apply corresponding
defensive methods.
<OL>
<LI>Development of registration methods
</OL>

<P>
In the described case it was enough to apply anti-virus program
and methods of video-registration with strobing of video-signal.
<P>
Detection of energy-informational effects is much more complicated
because the most perfect sensors are capable to register radiation
with capacity of 10-14-16 Joule. According to assumptions of scientists
capacity of a characteristic radiation of living organisms is
less then 10-20-22 Joule. However there are several methods of
indirect measurement of extremely low capacity radiation. Here
is a result of one of them.
<P>
On an energy-informational scheme (fig.8) we can determine characteristic
phantom radiation of biological objects and radiation of technical
systems. We can also see zones of long-term staying of persons,
or communication tools and computer with strong information flows.
The description of an obtained image allows to make conclusions,
for example, about favorable or unfavorable effect of a computer
on a person, or even person to a person.

<LI>Shielding
</OL>

<P>
The simplest method of protection from electromagnetic radiation
is shielding. Certainly we can not stay for a long time in Faraday
camera and we will not wear a leaden suit. A metalized cloth is
an effective shield from EMF of wide frequency range - from extremely
low to superhigh. Filters for computer displays made from &quot;Voskhod&quot;
cloth decreases EMF ten times more effective in comparison with
&quot;Energostar&quot; screen which is considered to be the best
one. It will be necessary to the professionals, who works constantly
on the computer, to wear suits or overall made from metallized
cloth. It is the most reliable protection. Offices pasted over
with such a cloth and curtains are protected from harmful effect.
Signals of &quot;radio-bugs&quot; will not go out of the room.
<P>
However, besides protecting body and face from electromagnetic
radiation, we have eyes and ears open for obtaining the information.
And not always the information is good to a person.

<LI>Psychotechnologies
</OL>

<P>
Mastering the methods of psycho-physiological regulation and psycho-technologies
can become an effective individual protection. It is not a secret,
that a polygraph can be deceived  using special tricks of self-regulation.
Psychological methods can decrease efficiency of electro-acoustic
effect and a number of others.

<LI>Personal safety in the National and International law.

<P>
There is no public institution, which can inspect and control
destructive applications of computer - operator effects. The community
appears to be defenseless from methods, which can appear in the
hands of a criminal or a terrorist.
<P>
Certainly we can call applications of a computer effects in InfoWar
a humanistic weapon. But there can be no humanity in any weapon
at all. We hope, that UN will revise the list of prohibited sorts
of weapons, and this can eliminate the level of danger. We consider,
that it is necessary to raise a question about informational and
psychological security of computer users in the UN Security Council.
And such a representative conference as InfoWarCon 5 can be the
first to tell to a world community some consideration about the
problem.
<P>
Admiral Vladimir Pirumov, the Head of the Scientific Council of
Security Council of Russian Federation and Vice-President of Russian
Academy of Natural Sciences consider this problem to be a subject
of attentive exploration. Under his leadership the Department
of Geopolitics and National Security have been preparing systematic
analysis of scientific research in this field and corresponding
questions of defending personal rights and national security.

<LI>Conclusion
</OL>

<P>
The English proverb says: &quot;The difference between man and
boy is the cost of their toy&quot;. The modern toys have a monstrous
potential, which can easily turns in destructive power in hands
of modern adult boys. The whole world can become for them such
a toy.
<P>
The phenomenon of total information war can become the most dangerous
threat of our civilization on a threshold of third millennium.
There is the task stated before the mankind. Without refusing
from scientific and technological progress we are to subordinate
it to common values of humanism: &quot;Everyone is free within
the limits of rights of others on the same freedom.&quot;
