<TITLE>Regional Transit Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>5/10/95</P><H1><P>Regional transit: learning the hard lessons of WPPSS</P></H1><P>           COUNTY executives from King, Pierce and Snohomish counties recently sent a letter to the state Legislature asking for a &quot;transportation summit&quot; to address a broad range of issues related to transportation in the Puget Sound region. The proposed two-day summit, tentatively scheduled for June, represents an excellent opportunity to educate legislators and the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) about least-cost analysis</P><P>       On March 14, voters in portions of these three counties rejected the Regional Transit Authority's proposed Regional Transit System. Without a doubt, they had many motivations for voting &quot;no.&quot; What is clear is that voters have moved much farther up the learning curve than the RTA's backers.</P><P>     Transportation bureaucracies across the U.S. show a consistent bias toward capital-intensive, inflexible systems that require continuing, expensive bureaucratic oversight. Voters, who after all are the ones who have to pay for this idea, have expressed their belief that we can reduce travel times, pollution and stress more cheaply and effectively by other means.</P><P>     One approach is to apply least-cost planning to transit. This is not easy, but few important things are. It took the WPPSS fiasco to thrust least-cost planning upon the electric-utility industry. And as King Cushman (Director of the Transportation Planning Department at the Puget Sound Regional Council) correctly cautions, transit is an inherently more complex area than electric power.</P><P>     Least-cost planning has been used for years in the electric industry and it may take years to make it similarly useful for transit. Nevertheless, least-cost planning has proven useful in addressing the complex and changing Northwest power market; it could also help us evaluate our transit options.</P><P>     The mission of least-cost planners is to satisfy various demands at the lowest total cost. This is important because there are many worthy tasks competing for our limited public resources. Adopting relatively cheap, highly effective solutions first allows us to adjust and meet demands more quickly.</P><P>     The first principle of least-cost planning is to find options consistent with our goals. In its own master plan, the RTA found Western Washington's proposed $6.7 billion transit system would not significantly reduce traffic congestion or automobile-related air pollution.</P><P>     Who would seriously consider a plan that fails to accomplish its primary goals? Is the RTA seriously trying to diminish congestion, or does it have another agenda? If so, what is it?</P><P>       The second principle is to study all options fairly. WPPSS failed in part because planners looked at nuclear power through rose-colored glasses. Many people, myself included, have a romantic view of trains. This may cloud our perception of light rail as it appears in the regional transit plan. But only a bureaucracy spending other peoples' money could indulge a romantic association with trains to the tune of $6.7 billion.</P><P>     Whenever anyone proposes additional taxes to raise money for public projects, we should look critically at our options. This seems especially difficult when it comes to trains. In &quot;A Desire Named Streetcar,&quot; U.S. Department of Transportation analyst Don Pickrell reviewed transit plans in eight cities. He found that officials refused to reconsider their support for rail, even when presented with figures showing that rail projects would not cover even the operating costs, ignoring capital costs.</P><P>     In our region, planners presented reasonable estimates of ridership and costs. Both estimates showed that the proposal was hugely expensive and would not reduce congestion or automobile-related pollution. Nevertheless, many officials, including Seattle Mayor Norm Rice and King County Executive Gary Locke, publicly supported the RTA proposal. The desire for streetcars left them and others as blind to the transit situation as Blanche DuBois was blind to her emotions in the Tennessee Williams play.</P><P>     There are many alternatives to the RTA's proposal. Present policies allowing parking on city streets and enabling firms to provide &quot;free&quot; parking for their employees make driving less burdensome. These policies could be changed. Drivers could also be charged congestion tolls, collected electronically without time-consuming toll booths, to induce them to acknowledge the social costs of driving.</P><P>     Air-quality programs could do more to reduce automobile pollution by using remote sensing to detect and require cleanup of the dirtiest cars. The dirtiest 10 percent of cars, those responsible for 60 percent of pollution, could be purchased with gas-tax money and removed from the roads.</P><P>     Walking and biking are clean and cheap transit options. Such options can be encouraged by constructing more pedestrian-friendly thoroughfares like the Burke Gilman Trail. Carpools, vanpools, smaller buses and more HOV lanes all make better use of existing roads.</P><P>     The RTA's plan is not a precise analog to WPPSS' poorly considered nuclear dream-cum-nightmare. However, the two projects do share a focus upon massive, capital-intensive, inflexible systems. Both evidence a gross inattention to effectiveness and cost. Both imply Olympic-class hubris.</P><P>     Least-cost planning could have saved Northwest electricity consumers millions of dollars and much embarrassment. Let us not have another fiasco with our roads.</P><P>_______<BR> John A.

Ill-conceived federal price controls and OPEC's last successful petroleum embargo combined to create an emergency. The results were disastrous, the predictable consequence of policies that disrupt the market process and favor special interests  </P><P>      In response to this &quot;crisis,&quot; Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, commonly referred to as PURPA. Designed to spur research into &quot;alternative&quot; energy sources, this law produced several unintended consequences including higher energy prices for the consumer.</P><P>Resource Data International, Inc., a Boulder, Colo., consulting firm, estimates the PURPA will cost consumers up to $200 billion between now and the turn of the century, in direct subsidies and also in &quot;deadweight&quot; losses from overcapacity. The PURPA fiasco provides an expensive lesson in what happens when regulators ignore the market's signals. Efficiency, innovation and conservation become casualties of politics.</P><P>PURPA's creators should have been familiar with the law of unintended consequences, for this legislation was designed to address some of the unforeseen results of the Depression-era Rural Electrification Administration (REA). Despite the merits of rural electrification - and they are numerous and significant - governmental policies imposed unanticipated costs. Specifically, subsidies for capital-intensive, coal- and oil-fired electricity inhibited research into and development of alternative energy sources. Hence, from the mid-1930s until the late 1970s there was a hiatus of research in renewable energy.</P><P>     Many people are surprised to learn that serious interest in renewable energy began in the late 1800s. Before the REA, the high cost of stringing power lines to remote areas made wind, solar and small hydroelectric technologies highly attractive. The profit motive encouraged entrepreneurship. The REA and its subsidies to centrally generated power and rural electrification undermined money-making opportunities, and research into renewable energy evaporated.</P><P>     Something is amiss when the government creates a problem, then 40 years later claims that government action is necessary to correct the problem, yet this is precisely what happened in 1978. Proponents of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act couched their rhetoric in national-security terms. PURPA was to compensate for the absence of research into renewable energy sources.</P><P>     My colleague at Montana State, Richard Stroup, and I were concerned about this back in 1979. Writing about the lack of research and development in renewable energy, we wrote:</P><P>      &quot;Our current retarded position, caused largely by subsidies, has led to arguments that we should not subsidize the development of alternative energy systems. But clearly there is a problem with subsidies. Specifically, a subsidy inhibits developments in areas not subsidized. Since the future is uncertain we cannot know what the cost of our bias will be. We can only know that there will be a cost.&quot;</P><P>      When governments distort market signals, problems follow. Government subsidies of the 1930s caused a sharp decline in research and development of alternative energy sources. Price controls in the 1970s produced long lines at the gas pumps and reduced incentives to find greater energy efficiency.</P><P>The cost of subsidizing renewable energy sources is at least $200 billion between now and the turn of the century, and consumers are the ones who end up paying. In addition to granting direct subsidies for renewable energy, PURPA required public utilities to purchase the power generated by these sources - solar, wind and &quot;waste-to-energy&quot; - at prices far above the market price. Renewable energy now sells for up to 16 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh). Even in Hawaii and Alaska, where energy prices are among the highest in the country, the Edison Electric Institute estimates that energy costs from all sources range from 7 to 9 cents per kilowatt hour, far below the break-even point for renewable energy.</P><P>     Subsidies and guaranteed prices had the predictable result. We now have power plants that lie idle, built by tax-deferred municipal bonds and then abandoned because the plants can not cover their operating costs. Some operate far below capacity and are in disrepair because, as in pre-1989 Eastern Bloc energy production, the revenues from the additional capacity would not cover the repairs.</P><P>     One of the sorriest examples is the Altamont Pass windfarm just east of San Francisco. Not only does its electricity cost 11 cents a kilowatt hour to produce but the unsightly windmills kill birds; in the past two years some 500 raptors - including 78 golden eagles - have been sucked into the blades. PURPA even gave rise to the world's only commercial-scale manure-fired power plant. Power from this plant cost eight times the market price to produce, and the plant operators had trouble keeping the fuel lit. Recent floods finally accomplished what the market was prevented from doing and shut down the plant.</P><P>     No firm fully accountable for its costs would persist with such schemes. REA, PURPA, and energy price controls force us to pay twice for errors in political judgment. First, as taxpayers, since our taxes fund these subsidies, and second, as ratepayers, since utilities pass high-priced energy costs on to the consumer. Altamont Pass and the manure-fired power plant in El Centro, Calif., are illustrative examples of an important truth: Government efforts to direct innovation and promote particular outcomes have unintended and often pernicious consequences.</P><P>     Free markets and free prices help entrepreneurs and investors sift through the cow manure. We should remember the lessons of history as we consider how to promote conservation and efficiency in our energy future. </P><P>_______________<BR>  John A.

I end my career with the course I began 25 years ago at Indiana University, The Political Economy of Environmental Policy. Throughout my career, I have advocated environmental policies based on incentives, not commands  </P><P>      I helped create an environmental paradigm that views economies as ecosystems. Both adapt to changing conditions and widely dispersed information. Both involve complex webs of individuals linked into a whole greater than the sum of its parts. My approach is an alternative to the traditional green model, which assumes that if we only love nature enough, select good managers, and give them enough authority, we can protect our environment. The traditional model is fatally flawed. When people set out to govern by love, they end by ruling through force and fear.</P><P>     While environmental values are important guides for behavior, I stress the importance of information, incentives and institutional design. These are the pillars of a new field of political economy, the New Resource Economics (NRE).</P><P>     The NRE approach emphasizes property rights, market incentives and the constructive potential of voluntary cooperation. These concepts help us understand how economic progress can be harmonized with liberty and environmental quality. The NRE's strong ethical and philosophical foundations build on the classical liberal ideals of America's founders, especially Jefferson and Madison.</P><P>     The NRE draws heavily on the analytic leverage of microeconomic theory leavened with Austrian economics, public-choice economics, and property-rights theory. Taken together, these schools of thought yield several general principles for environmental management:</P><P>       1. Liberty and individual responsibility are fundamental to a constructive and harmonious social order. Social order fosters prosperity, and since demand for environmental quality increases with wealth, environmentalists have a stake in promoting prosperity.</P><P>     2. There is no one perfect system for economic and social coordination. Markets, governments and private nonprofit organizations each have predictable benefits and flaws. When advocating specific environmental reforms, we should consider each of these systems, focusing upon the information and incentives each produces.</P><P>     3. Economies are like ecosystems. The most basic law of each states that everything is interrelated: It is impossible to do just one thing. In economies as in ecosystems, human actions have effects beyond those intended.</P><P>     4. Individuals are self-interested. When evaluating a decision, they first ask: &quot;How will this decision affect me and the things I value?&quot; The welfare of others, especially relatives and friends, is normally considered, but self-interest influences perceptions of problems, alternatives, and solutions.</P><P>     5. Incentives influence decisions. Individuals weigh the relative costs and benefits of competing alternatives. As the costs to the decision-maker of choosing a particular option increase, that option becomes less attractive.</P><P>     6. Decision-makers generally conserve only the resources over which they have control and for which they face responsibility. When the decision-maker is insulated from the costs of his/her actions, or denied access to the benefits, problems usually follow. For example, when pollution is &quot;free,&quot; it is overproduced, and when regulations are free to the regulator, they too are overproduced.</P><P>     7. Information is costly in terms of time, effort and money. Individuals stop acquiring additional information when its expected value is less than the burden of acquisition. Hence, voters are relatively ill-informed about most policy issues. To the individual, both the costs of ignorance and benefits of knowledge are lower in public than in private decisions.</P><P>     8. Legal and economic institutions differ greatly in the quality of information and type of incentives they generate. When institutions hold individuals accountable for their actions, economic progress and environmental quality are complements, not competitors.</P><P>     9. Increases in efficiency give us greater value from equal or fewer resources. Otherwise, nothing of value is free. For example, to have wilderness areas we give up the opportunity for development. Although I often find this &quot;trade-off&quot; worthwhile, it is intellectually irresponsible to deny that opportunities are forgone when we declare a parcel of land to be wilderness.</P><P>     10. Scarce goods must be rationed and the rationing system we select affects the amount there is to ration. This is why institutional design is so important. Political allocation exacerbates scarcity while eroding ethics. Markets economize on love and goodwill while fostering efficiency.</P><P>      As Aldo Leopold explained in &quot;The Land Ethic,&quot; environmental values are important. But values and good intentions will not suffice. When considering reform, focus on the information and incentives generated by the proposed institutions. In the policy arena, an understanding of political economy is indispensable in achieving our environmental goals.</P><P>_______________<BR>  John A.

<TITLE>New West Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>9/27/95</P><H1>A new coherence emerging in the West</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P><P>At each summer's end, I leave our Montana ranch and return to Washington.  I love to drive the West.  </P><P>This is a good time to reconsider our culture, ecology, economy and politics.  Increasingly, I'm having second thoughts about these subjects.  Many friends, academics, business people and environmentalists, are also re-evaluating their approach to environmental goals.  </P><P>Our culture, economy, and politics were based upon the exploitation of natural resources.  This gave the West coherence.   The default position was to dam rivers, graze grass, cut timber, butcher buffalo.  Even our great National Parks were promoted by railroads for their potential tourist revenue.  </P><P>Some people were rapacious and opportunistic; a blessed few were prudent stewards.  But the dominant politics and economics were insensitive to noncommercial or spiritual aspects of our environment.  In the past generation, a majority of people have became environmentalists.  The West changed.  </P><P>It's time for another.  A new environmental paradigm is emerging and perhaps with it, a new coherence for the West.  </P><P>This approach accepts the significance of noncommercial and spiritual values.  It also recognizes the critical importance of information and incentives.  Good intentions and education will not suffice.  Big bureaucracies will stray from their mission.  Political force will lead to plunder.  And takings, even for good ecological cause, are perverse.  It is irresponsible to pretend these problems away.</P><P> Economic logic has powerful analytic tools but they alone are not enough.  Even though I came to economics from anthropology, and should have known better, I slighted community while focused on efficiency.  (Sometimes it takes years to de-program the lessons of graduate school.)  </P><P>Driving down the Blackfoot Drainage toward the Columbia, I realized that no one has ever gone to the wall for efficiency.  And only the naive would even think of mobilizing citizens under its banner.  The variables that economists can best measure are not those which matter most.  But this is not to recommend some New Age eco-romanticism.  We must consider ecological science, political economy and culture if we are to design successful reform.  In isolation, none will do the job.</P><P>Modern societies can be destructive and corrupting but they provide the means for sensitive and constructive action.  Our task is to foster their humane potential and make them ecologically sustainable.  Science and prosperity are our best allies in this effort.  A return to the folkways and mores of the Native Americans, even were it possible, gives no answer.  Here's a second thought for romantics to consider.</P><P>Early man was not the far-sighted ecological steward of myth.  The ideal of sustainable harvests were as foreign as IRAs.  </P><P>Charles Kay is a wildlife research ecologist at Utah State University.  For 20 years he has examined the archeological record of Greater Yellowstone.  He and other researchers have noted that with the arrival of Homo sapiens on on the North American continent, many species of large herbivores went extinct.  </P><P>There is an emerging theory of &quot;aboriginal overkill.&quot;  Humans were effective predators.  Can any other animal run a mile, swim a river, climb a tree and organize a pack to hunt?  Add fire as a tool and a real killer emerges.  Kay writes:</P><I><P>[Aboriginal peoples] . . . acted in ways that maximized their individual fitness regardless of the impact on the environment.  By limiting ungulate numbers and purposefully modifying the vegetation with fire, Native Americans structured entire plant and animal communities of western North America.</P</I>><P>The Plains Indians were smart, tough and remarkably skillful.  When they received the horse, steel knife and finally the gun, it became much easier and safer to kill bison.  These new tools gave the Indians a huge discount on buffalo.   At the lower price, they rationally bought more.     This behavior is an efficient adjustment by individual tribes to changing &quot;prices&quot; of bison.  The buffalo were fugitive resources, they really did roam. This movement, coupled with tribal competition for them, made it impossible for the Indians to manage the buffalo as a renewable resource. Slaughter by whites greatly compounded the problem.  </P><P>Early white explorers noted that large ungulates were extremely rare when Whites came to the Rocky Mountain region.  Kay writes, &quot;Between 1835 and 1876, twenty different parties spent a total of 765 days traveling through the Yellowstone ecosystem . . .[T]heir first-person journals contain 45 references to a lack of game or a shortage of food.&quot;  Lewis and Clark nearly starved and were reduced to eating dogs when traversing this region.  Today, the area is over run, over grazed and over browsed - by game.  </P><P>Several Native Americans tribes managed beaver streams and salmon fishing sites with clear and transferable property rights.  However, the Plains Indians' could not control access.  They had no property rights to constrain other hunters.   </P><P>Today many environmentalists are reconsidering means to their ecological ends.  Sustainability does not arrive through ideology.  They can't count on government management for bureaucracies generate pathologies.  And unless constrained, firms will neglect or abuse environmental values.  </P><P>There is no single answer to our goals.  It is time for second thoughts.  I will share some in this series of columns. </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

In the ESA, they confront nasty conflicts between Congressional intent to save endangered species and our Bill of Rights.  </P><P><CITE>In Saving All the Pieces</CITE>, Rocky Barker notes that federal mandates generally require agencies to provide protection 'when practicable'.  But the ESA is different.  Protection of all species is absolute.  There is no room for equivocation; no provision for tradeoffs among competing legitimate and important values.  An endangered species trumps all other values.  </P><P>The Fifth Amendment to our Constitution concludes with, &quot;...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot;  It's not in the Bill of Rights by accident.  It was intended to preclude plundering by politicians and bureaucrats, what ever their justification.  Americans' experience with the ESA demonstrates why the Founders were so concerned with uncompensated takings.  </P><P>The application of the ESA demonstrates the mischief and unintended consequences which follow when we attempt to take value from individuals without &quot;just compensation&quot;.  When endangered species are found on private land,  the owners lose opportunities to undertake legitimate actions.  Land value is often reduced, sometimes eliminated.  Consequences are bound to follow.  Many of them harm habitat of endangered species.</P><P>Many well intentioned environmental activists discount, ignore or pretend these losses away.  This seems intellectually and ethically irresponsible.  But what if ecological integrity trumps both the ethics of the case and the value of logical consistency?  Honorable people could hold this position.  </P><P>The ecological goals which motivated the Act's creation maintain wide support.  It's the commando approach, seize control of the land, which causes problems for species and people.  Let's consider the environmental consequences of takings by the ESA's administrators.  We will keep two ecological guidelines in mind; we can never do only one thing, and everything is tied to everything else.  These principles are as valid in political economy as in ecology.</P><P>The Act commonly transforms harmless and inherently cute critters including the Spotted Owl and Red-cockaded woodpecker, into enemies of the landowner.  Animals such as the gray wolf and grizzly bear, creatures which can pose genuine threats to people or property, carry a double burden.  If we care to protect them (and I do), and if we were to name one group of individuals whom we should want to like an endangered species, it surely would be its host, the land owner.  Why make them foes of ESA's goals?</P><P>The Act grants unprecedented powers to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, some even greater than powers of the Department of Defense in wartime. The Third Amendment of our Bill of Rights states that: &quot;No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law&quot;.  Various creatures, some quite unappealing to most people, have greater rights.  The government must pay for what it takes when supplying our military.  This is why it is so difficult to close down a base.  In contrast, the land owner suffers if The Fish and Wildlife Service finds a listed species on her land. </P><P>The exercise of these powers under the ESA has perverse but predictable consequences.  The land owner has few incentives to protect habitat for the species and strong incentives to modify it preemptively to make it less attractive.  Alternatively, he may simply &quot;shoot, shovel and shut up&quot;.  The Act encourages land owners to break the spirit and the letter of the law.  This is not a sustainable policy for protecting endangered species.  And it's not achieving its goals.  </P><P>This is why an increasing number of environmental advocates believe it's time to rethink the Act.  The ESA is one troublesome example of keeping our Progressive Era's &quot;scientific management&quot; approach in place long after it was found wanting.  Many distinguished analysts are having second thoughts about the ESA and the entire scientific management, command-and-control approach which it represents.  </P><P>Professor Robert Nelson teaches Public Policy at the University of Maryland after spending two decades as a senior researcher in the Department of Interior, the home agency of the Fish and Wildlife Service.  He predicts that over the next twenty or thirty years new approaches will replace the failed system.  Nelson believes the current period has many similarities with the Progressive Era.  In his words, &quot;A new set of ideas and a new institutional framework are required, just as the progressives saw such a need one hundred years ago.&quot;  </P><P>A century ago American Progressives saw serious problems in America.  Many of these came from the ability of business to neglect a public interest in favor of narrow self interest.  Businesses could ignore costs imposed on others.  The Progresives' solution was to impose regulation and management by wise and competent bureaucrats.  </P><P>Today, the ESA follows this model to its logical but counterproductive conclusion.  It clearly is time for serious second thoughts about better ways to protect endangered species.  Reform requires that we acknowledge the importance of secure property rights and regulatory stability.  As the Founding Fathers understood, it's too expensive to permit government to take things for free.  </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

Baden</P><P>     Whether we're trying to save species or specie, decisions are based on information and incentives.  Reform that generates poor incentives simply won't work.  Good intentions are not enough.</P><P>     Congress tried to protect endangered species via the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  Prior to 1973, landowners could operate even if their activities harmed the habitat of endangered species.  This was a problem.  Lawmakers saw prohibition of such activities as the answer.  It wasn't.  </P><P>     While well intentioned, the ESA produces many unintended and adverse consequences.  It tried to force landowners to maintain habitat.  This made endangered species the enemy of landowners.  It pits socially valuable activities such as forestry and farming against habitat protection.  </P><P>     The Act empowers the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control private lands harboring endangered species.  They can ignore the lost opportunities imposed.  Social or landowner costs don't enter their calculations.  The administrators have no incentive to economize when protecting habitat.   </P><P>     This command-and-control approach pits landowners against endangered species.  Landowners fear the liability of owning endangered species habitat; its use may be restricted without any compensation.  Today's ESA encourages people to modify habitat.  Biologists consult with landowners to find ways to make their land inhospitable.  Ironically, the ESA's mandate to protect habitat often encourages landowners to repel endangered species.</P><P>     We have real and tragic examples across America.  Cone's Folly is an illustrative case.  In the 1930s Ben Cone, Sr. purchased 7,200 acres of land in North Carolina.  His friends called it &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; for it was deforested.  With careful sylvaculture by Ben Cone, Sr., and later Ben Cone, Jr., the &quot;folly&quot; became a well managed forest.  Fish, game, and non-game critters became abundant.  </P><P>     They actively managed for wildlife with frequent controlled burns and carefully managed small timber sales.  Their stands of rare long leaf pines were ideal for much wildlife.  Cone's stewardship attracted many songbirds, deer, quail, wild turkey, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.  </P><P>     In 1991, the ESA required the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to halt Cone's management of the 1560 acres of property inhabited by 29 of the rare woodpeckers.  Cone lost rights to cut and sell the timber on nearly two-and-half square miles of his land, drastically reducing its value.  He received no compensation and must still pays taxes for timberland unharvestable while woodpecker habitat.  The woodpeckers he once liked became a multi-million dollar liability.   </P><P>     Cone now clearcuts around the woodpecker haven.  This prevent them from infecting more of his property.  And neighboring landowners have rushed to do likewise before their land also becomes suitable for woodpeckers.  </P><P>     The chart shows how the Act dramatically changed Cone's harvesting practices after 1991.  Cone reduced the rotation of harvest from 80 years to 40 years, thereby eliminating the old stands that attract the woodpeckers.   The ESA has given the woodpeckers a temporary safe haven.  It will eventually rot or burn, the woodpeckers will move, and Cone will regain control.</P><P>     Ironically, the ESA has given &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; a whole new meaning.  Ben Cone's folly was to take such good care of the land that the ESA stripped much of the value from more than a fifth of his property.</P><P>     &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; is one of the many cases demonstrating the importance of incentives to habitat protection.  &quot;Takings&quot; produce predictable but unintended consequences.  When landowners who harbor endangered species face stiff penalties for doing so, they minimize suitable habitat.  Those of us who care about endangered species want landowners to favor the creatures and eagerly provide habitat.  Can this be achieved by government coercion and &quot;takings&quot;?  At what cost?  Are there better ways?</P><P>     Compensating landowners for the costs of maintaining suitable habitats for species like the red-cockaded woodpecker and spotted owl removes some costs of doing so.  If regulations are stable and agencies forced to face the costs of their actions they will seek more efficient protection.  </P><P>     Tax breaks for habitat motivates landowners to provide it.  And many species already have interest groups advocating their protection.  The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the North American Wild Sheep Foundation protect two formerly threatened species.  Furthermore, information would improve as wildlife biologists would find entrepreneurial niches consulting landowners on how to create, rather than avoid, suitable habitat.  </P><P>     Landowners, like the habitat they own, are diverse.  There are huge untapped opportunities for improving and protecting habitat.  We might not expect ranchers to welcome wolves or timber companies to embrace beavers.  But beavers don't eat livestock, and wolves don't eat trees.  Plum Creek Timber Co., Inc. agreed and found dens for wolves.  Defenders of Wildlife benefits when wolves find dens, the wolves most certainly benefit, and Plum Creek benefits from publicity and cash awards.  </P><P>     With positive incentives we can harmonize prosperity and environmental diversity.  This must be the foundation of any successful reform of the ESA.  Otherwise we risk more counterproductive policies which condemn both landowners and rare species.</P><P>___________________<BR>John A.

Baden</P><P>     Each fall my thoughts return to a boyhood of hunting.  Opening day trumped Thanksgiving and even rivaled Christmas.  Our rituals and gear provided anthropological fodder.     </P><P>      In fifth grade I created the Concord Conservation Club.  Like most rural people of my generation (I'm in my mid-50s), the green path ran through Field and Stream, the leading outdoors magazine.  I still see sportsmen as great preservers of habitat.  But with few Americans with rural roots, the links between hunting and environmentalism grow tenuous.  </P><P>     There's a growing tension, indeed an antipathy, between younger environmentalists (often vegetarians) and their elders who came to ecology through the &quot;blood sports&quot;.  Today's mainstream environmental magazines commonly ignore or denigrate hunting and hunters.</P><P>     The millions of hunters in America, however, play a powerful, direct and active role in environmental protection.  Ducks Unlimited protects over 20 million acres of wetland.  On their 6,000-acre Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch, the venerable Boone &amp; Crockett Club conducts research to harmonize agriculture with wildlife while providing habitat for elk, mule deer, grizzly bears, cougars, eagles and cutthroat trout.  The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Pheasants Forever and the Ruffed Grouse Society also protect wildlife habitat by purchasing land and development rights.  Hunters have a huge stake in preserving the wildlife they sometimes hunt. </P><P>     Yet America's hunters are maligned or ostracized.  Here's a story from my last trip East:</P><P>     5:00am Saturday was dark, rainy, cold and windy.  Volvo wagons were sleeping in their driveways when a man came out of his garage with two golf bags which he leaned against a GMC Suburban.  He walked back to the kitchen and emerged with a thermos and an excited yellow lab.  The dog jumped into the Suburban, and the man lifted a golf bag behind the driver's seat.  He turned toward the lights of a tow truck pulling into his drive.  The man from AAA got out.</P><P>     &quot;Have you heard a crash?  A car hit a deer near here.  We just got the call.  Driver's all shook up and didn't give good directions.  Totaled the front end and busted the windshield.  Lucky he didn't get a deer in the face.  I gotta drag the car in; third one this week.  It gits worse every fall...</P><P>     &quot;You didn't hear anything?  No wonder with the wind and rain.  You must be nuts to play golf in this stuff...</P><P>     &quot;You're what?  Hunting ducks with golf clubs?  You must be damn good with a driver or you really are crazy...</P><P>     &quot;You've got what?  A 12 gauge and decoys in your golf bags?  Are you sure you're OK?  Did YOU hit the deer and bump your head?</P><P>     &quot;Oh, you hide the gear in golf bags!  Your neighbors would get real upset if they knew you were a hunter...</P><P>     &quot;Or even if they knew you kept guns around?  Their kids couldn't play with yours?  You must be nuts to live here.&quot;</P><P>The deer in the story, like so many animals, has lost its natural predators.  In many areas cars, not carnivores, kill deer.</P><P>     Organizations like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Fund For Animals (FFA) assert that wildlife populations lacking predators will achieve a &quot;natural balance&quot; without degrading their environment.  But sound science and commonplace observations reveal how truncated food chains degrade ecosystems.  To protect ecosystems, we must acknowledge missing links and respond responsibly.  This is a place for tough love.  </P><P>     Hunters can promote healthy game and non-game animals.  The Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge in north Virginia, for example, safeguards endangered bald eagles.  But during the 1980s the deer population exploded and exceeded the refuge's carrying capacity by tenfold.  Without predators checking deer population, the entire Mason Neck ecosystem was distorted to the eagle's peril.  Starving deer consumed entire generations of young trees -- essentially destroying future bald eagle roosts.  And the deer weren't faring so well either.  Only disease and starvation regulated their population.  </P><P>     Despite the fervent protests and litigation of the Humane Society of America, Mason Neck managers instituted a deer hunting season in 1989.  The results are in.  Contrary to predictions of human carnage, no hunting accidents have occurred.  The deer population, although still too high, is now a fifth of its 1989 size.  The deer are healthier, exhibiting increased body weight and antler mass.  Lastly, trees and eagles' imperiled ecosystems are recovering.</P><P>     The new generation of environmentalists often finds hunting distasteful.  Vegans rarely join Ducks Unlimited.  And some activists invest millions in litigation against hunters and now fishermen.  But most have the maturity to understand how this counters habitat protection and healthy wildlife populations.  </P><P>     Hunters affect the natural balance and generate the political will which helps conserve habitat.  Members of PETA and FFA have weaker incentives to protect habitat -- so they don't.  In contrast, Ducks Unlimited bought protection for over 17 million acres of nesting grounds in Canada, 2 million acres of winter grounds in Mexico, and nearly a million acres of wetlands in the U.S.  If anti-hunting groups bought &quot;hunting-free&quot; refuges, they could introduce predators or learn that sparing Bambi can spoil entire ecosystems.  </P><P>     When considering this positive possibility, I suggest we place our hopes and expectations in separate baskets.  Anthropologists and economists can explain why hunters are important friends of habitat.  While anti-hunting activists may resist the ecological benefits of hunting, they will eventually learn that nature bats last.  And the clean-up process is seldom pretty.</P><P>_________________________________________<BR> John A.

Baden</P><P>    	Markets economize on love, that most precious of values.  They encourage cooperation and civility among disparate people.  This was one of the great lessons of Kenneth Boulding, a Quaker economist who was founding editor of <CITE>The Journal of Conflict Resolution</CITE>.  Boulding developed the concept of &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; with the understanding that we're all in this together. </P><P>   	We should cherish social arrangements which foster harmony and inhibit conflict without requiring that people love one another.  The ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, terrorism in the Mid-East, and discord in Canada are powerful reminders of perennial conflict among groups with differing values and goals.</P><P>    	While markets favor efficiency and profits, they also encourage diverse people to interact harmoniously.  They promote civil, coordinated, and constructive social order.  Here's a homey example.</P><P>    	Bozeman, Montana, a town with 30,000 people, has several supermarkets.  Each offers valuable lessons.  Although I shop them all, I know best the Albertson's by my office.  It has tens of thousands of different items.  There is evolutionary competition among stores, among brands within each store, and among products within individual brands.  And between Albertson's and Safeway is the Community Food Co-op which offers an alternative blend of exotics and local, organic products.</P><P>    	These stores compete with differing mixes of service, economy, and products.  Even the check-out lines vary in lengths and degree of service.  Each grocer behaves as though he cares while seeking consumers with varying income, interests, and values.  </P><P>    	Consumer preferences are continuously monitored at the check-out line.  As clerks scan the products, consumer preferences are entered into the store's computer which adjusts inventory and orders.  With their purchases consumers elect the stores and product lines they find most attractive. </P><P>    	Among stores and within stores, winners are determined by voluntary transactions.  The losers gradually lose shelf space.  Ultimately they either improve their products' appeal or disappear.  The consumer really is sovereign.  The market registers consumer preference and automatically adjusts to harmoniously reconcile changing demands with new supplies.</P><P>    	This process is quite remarkable.  It demonstrates that, at root, the market is a social arrangement which efficiently generates information about people's wants and reservations while providing incentives to heed disparate, oft conflicting preferences.</P><P>    	Free and open markets offer a setting where each can satisfy his or her wants without imposing their preferences on others.  The market process promotes diversity, freedom of choice, and innovations -- blessings in this imperfect world.  Yet, there is another huge advantage we normally take for granted. </P><P>    	Though market efficiency is marvelous, the harmony fostered by voluntary exchange seems an even greater value, especially as inter-group conflict becomes so significant. </P><P>    	Market exchange by competent individuals, permits people with radically differing views to peacefully coexist.  Like most college towns, Bozeman has many committed vegetarians.  They shop peacefully and amicably with rancher and logger carnitarians, people who eat vegetables only as occasional concessions to health. </P><P>    	Ranchers mingle with Dallas blondes with big hair and Big Sky condos.  Counterculture refugees of the 1960s mix with fun hogs who bounce among Montana's ski slopes, white-water rivers, and mountain trails. Vegetarian Seventh Day Adventists, teetotaling Mormons, and New Age vegans freely intermingle at Albertson's, Safeway, and the Community Co-op.  These markets accomodate the teetotalers', and those for whom dinner implies good wine.  When transactions are voluntary, interactions are peaceful.</P><P>    	Clear private property rights and free exchange foster civility and cooperation.  Coercion doesn't occur with these institutions.  Committed vegetarians and prohibitionists cooperated with those holding antithetical views. </P><P>    	What if grocery store management was political?  Fighting would erupt between vegetarians and carnitarians; teetotalers and Epicureans; organic fanatics who protest pesticides and farmers who use chemicals; populists opposed to corporate agriculture and shareholders in those firms; working parents who want the stores open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and fundamentalists who believe they should be closed on Saturday or Sunday.  Vegans might demonstrate in front while ranchers lobby managers in back.  Supervisors would set prices according to interest group power.  We then might see bread quotas, veal purchasing regulations, subsidies for union-labeled wine, and shortages common.  Political power would trump consumer preferences, just like it does with public forest management today.</P><P>    	Since wealth and political power go together, the poor are usually advantaged when we move decisions from the political arena to the marketplace.  They are usually disadvantaged when we decide politically.  </P><P>    	Montana State University Professor Ramona Marotz-Baden summarizes, &quot;Fortunately, we have pretty much kept these decisions out of the political arena.  People make decisions and exercise their consciences instead of imposing their preferences by using the force of the state.  Peace, progress, and efficiency are the result we have learned to expect.&quot; </P><P>    	No single set of institutions is perfect.  There's an appropriate role for government, for public non-profit organizations (huge ones like The Boy Scouts and Nature Conservancy, or small ones like FREE and the Gallatin Institute), and for the marketplace.  In general, there are strong ethical and material reasons to shift decisions away from government.  Harmonious diversity is one of the best. </P><P>_______________ <BR>John A.

<P>     	Ocean fisheries exemplify &quot;common-pool resources&quot;.  It's difficult, if not impossible, to fence in or brand marine fish.  Their freedom is bound by the forces of nature.</P>

<P>     	These fish are fugitive resources.  Their migration ignores political, social, and legal boundaries.  This often leads to great tragedy.  Fisheries demonstrate the classic &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;.  They are increasingly imperiled by fishermen engaging in traditional and honorable activities: bringing high quality food from the sea to people.  </P>

<P>     	Two problems plague both society and fish.  The first problem is that increasing world demand and technological capabilities exceed the reproductive capacity of many ecosystems.  The pre-1970s illusion of infinite abundance is gone.  </P>

<P>     	Second, and most important, fisheries lack a sustainable system of rationing the valuable, but increasingly scarce, resources.  Today, the world's fisheries are predominantly open-access.  It's first come first serve, almost devoid of rules fostering responsible behavior.  </P>

<P>     	Open-access subjects fisheries to the profound pathologies of the commons.  Fisheries suffer from overexploitation and declining profitability because fishermen behave predictably when access to a valuable resource is open to all.  In such circumstances individually and socially rational behavior diverges. Self-restraint and conservation is trumped by incentives that encourage overfishing.  Individual fishermen reel in short-term profits from overfishing while society as a whole bears the costs of economic and environmental waste.  </P>

<P>     	Fisheries commons result in ecological and economic tragedy.  Fishermen aren't dumb; they want to stop fishing once they optimize the yield of the fishery -- but if they act responsibly, they watch others continue fishing.  More and more fishermen and boats will arrive until profits disappear altogether.  As fish become harder to find, profits vanish and the long-term health of the fishery deteriorates.</P>

<P>        	Overfishing is exacerbated by another pathology: overcapitalization.   The race to reel in more and more fish encourages fishing capacity far in excess of the fishery's reproductivecarrying capacity.  Economic distortions couple environmental degradation with overinvestment in fishing capacity.  Unbridled competition produces bigger vessels, better sonar, and larger nets.  Taxpayers subsidize newer boats and better nets.  This only aggravates the situation as national politics fights marine international ecosystems.</P>

<P>     	This process spawns other pathologies.  Bycatch, the incidental landings of unsellable species, wastes enormous quantities of fish every year (Discards in shrimp fisheries can outweigh shrimp landings eight to one.).  Many fishermen practice high-grading, throwing out less valuable fish.  Fishermen lack incentives to conserve the discarded fish, because they do not bear the costs of waste.  </P>

<P>     	Regulating restraint through quotas on catch levels, minimum mesh sizes, and shortened seasons, often worsens matters.  Fishermen lobby for overinflated quotas and more subisidies for boats capable of grabbing a bigger slice of the pie.  More overcapitalization brings satellites, surveillance planes, and the latest in technology to bear in a mad scramble for fish.  Cutthroat competition in derby-style seasons presses captains to employ dangerous tactics in already hazardous fishing conditions.  </P>

<P>    	When fish cross boundaries, pathologies multiply. There is no guarantee that fish leaving one nation's waters will ever return, so the impetus is to catch as much as possible before the fish migrate.  Fishermen play one area off against the other.  The jurisdiction with the weakest regulations becomes the most popular -- and the anarchic &quot;high seas&quot; beats them all.  Some fishermen fill their quota at home, then travel to foreign waters and fish again.</P>

<P>     	There is a fisheries crisis indeed.  The pathologies involve ecology, ethics, economics, and politics.  Dozens of fisheries are depleted, many have collapsed.  Subsidies, price supports, dislocated fishermen, and sportsfishing restictions all take their toll.  The fisheries crisis caused nearly thirty international conflicts in 1994 alone.  </P>

<P>     	Avoiding the problems and preventing the tragedy of the commons requires institutional reform.  Currently, institutions usually reward fishermen for lobbying to increase subsidies and quotas, for increasing fleet capacity, for entering a fishery, and for maximizing landings in the short term.  </P>

<P>     	But there is reason for cautious hope.  The astronomical costs of maintaining fisheries commons present political entrepreneurs opportunities to innovate.  Market forces and property rights have proven effective tools for sensitive and sensible resource management.  Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs), as a sort of private-property fishing rights, are finding success in New Zealand and some Alaskan fisheries.  </P>

<P>     	Economists can explain how fishermen, under better conditions, could restrain their efforts to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of fishing over the long run.  A fisherman guaranteed sole and indefinite proprietorship of an ocean resource is unlikely to squander it by overfishing.  Like responsible farmers and foresters, profit-maximizers would conserve and optimize resources -- not harvest like there is no tomorrow.  Sustainability is key, because, for them, there is a tomorrow.</P>

<P>     	Individuals and society will benefit by overcoming the political costs of reform.  Fishermen have become addicted to government subsidies for survival in overcapitalized, overexploited fisheries.  Up to now, policy-makers have lacked the political will to restrain &quot;rugged individualist&quot; fishermen.  Increasing scarcity and environmental degradation are making privatization with monitored and enforceable rules ever more attractive. </P>
 
<P>    Leaders in the fishing industry understands that pathologies of the commons are leading to disaster.  Without secure rights granted to communities or individuals, the beleaguered fisheries will drown in a tragic tide. The task is to develop institutional arrangements that harmonize ecological realities with laws of human behavior.  </P>

<P>If you aren't a good boy, you'll find a lump of coal in your stocking Christmas morning.   This is an unhappy prospect for most American children.  However, we can imagine situations in which a large lump of coal would be a blessing, for example in a city under siege.  Coal would be a wonderful gift for people in Sarajevo lacking fuel for cooking and heating.  The value of a gift depends upon the circumstances of the recipient.  </P>

<P> In the spirit of giving coal to those whose lives it would improve, I propose reform of liabilities and standards on urban Superfund sites called brownfields.  Yes, we can help poor people by relaxing some environmental regulations,  those with perverse consequences.  Superfund is a liability time bomb that strikes fear into the hearts of entrepreneurial developers.  It triggers a slew of environmental and social woes.</P>

<P>	 Like the best solutions to many environmental problems, this gift seems counter-intuitive.  Relaxing the environmental protection standards on brownfields would help clean up our inner cities and improve opportunities.  Brownfields are lands abandoned because of alleged contamination.  They do more than just blemish urban landscapes.  They create multiple problems for inner cities, suburbs, and rural areas.</P>

<P>	 Many brownfields persist due to Superfund's poorly considered regulations and exorbitant litigation costs.  Further, they suffer from laws which make illegal today actions which were legal, proper and productive when undertaken.  These retroactive joint and several liability arrangements are windfalls for lawyers and bureaucrats but they too often harm our most disadvantaged citizens.  </P>

<P> People once believed that such strict regulation and liability were advantageous.  They didn't understand how market incentives encourage cleanup of hazardous sites.   Thanks to scholars such as Don Coursey at the University of Chicago, we now have better understanding of how bureaucracies and markets operate to deal with these problems.  </P>

<P> The derelict lands have been condemned by the EPA due to a mix of real and imagined health risks and bureaucratic errors of classification.  As a result, these lands are taboo for would-be developers.  Urban areas are stuck with empty brownfields. These lands could be used for parks, factories, and housing.  Seattle's Gasworks Park is a stellar example of a blighted site becoming an amenity.  </P>

<P> Superfund shunts industrial development from the urban brownfields to  the &quot;greenfields&quot; of the suburbs and rural periphery.  Farmland and forests are invaded by industry which could move into brownfield sites.  Were it not for the extreme and oft silly operation of Superfund, many of these new developments would be in urban areas.</P>

<P> The invasion of greenfields causes a host of other problems.  Duplicating the necessary infrastructure is expensive.  Economic growth in the suburbs increases urban sprawl and exacerbates traffic problems.  Unemployment in inner cities remains high.  </P>

<P> Worst of all, the brownfield sites remain contaminated.  No one has incentives to clean up the mess.  And nobody converts it into valuable real estate.  It's a lose-lose situation.</P>

<P>	 But there is hope for reform.  Michigan began an effort to turn brownfields and other Superfund sites into attractive real estate for developers.  With covenants-not-to-sue and other legal protections, firms may develop sites without fearing liability for earlier pollution by others. </P>

<P> States have incentives to reform Superfund.  Practical politicians and regulators, and even the EPA itself, realize that we don't need industrial plants with dirt clean enough for kids to eat.  Justice Steve Breyer's Harvard University Press book, Breaking the Vicious Circle,  adds force to this argument.</P>

<P>	 Businesses see potentially profitable ventures in once-idle brownfields.  Local residents benefit as the neighborhood rebounds.  With EPA's co-operation, over 450 properties have begun redevelopment under Michigan's initiative.</P>

<P>	 Business leaders and local authorities band together to remove disincentives to develop brownfields.  Few environmental groups object for they are aware of Cleveland's 167 brownfields, Chicago's 2,000, and 450,000 more across America.  They see how they hurt our inner cities.  Rural environmentalists support reform for they see urban sprawl encroaching on the greenfield buffer zones surrounding metropolitan pollution.</P>

<P>	 Thus far, 27 states have introduced legislation empowering developers to take advantage of brownfields.  By granting assurances that developers wouldn't be held liable for existing contamination, developers are converting the brownfields into productive sites.  Entrepreneurship joins environmentalism.</P>

<P>	 The possibilities for cleaning up brownfields are immense.  Relaxing some standards and removing retroactive liability rules will free entrepreneurs to clean and develop contaminated sites in inner cities.  While they improve blighted inner-city landscapes, the peripheral greenfields will also benefit. </P>

<P>	 All of this can be attained with a simple gift: change the regulations and liabilities for brownfields.  It would cost little.  Inner-city and countryside environments could benefit greatly.  And reform would be a gift that keeps on giving.</P>

The tragedy of the commons develops in this way. Picture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons. Such an arrangement may work reasonably satisfactorily for centuries because tribal wars, poaching, and disease keep the numbers of both man and beast well below the carrying capacity of the land. Finally, however, comes the day of reckoning, that is, the day when the long-desired goal of social stability becomes a reality. At this point, the inherent logic of the commons remorselessly generates tragedy.
<P>
As a rational being, each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he asks. "What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?" This utility has one negative and one positive component.
<OL>
<LI>The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the positive utility is nearly + 1.
<P>
<LI>The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by one more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the herdsman, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only a fraction of -1.</OL>
<P>
Adding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. And another. . . .  But this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit-in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.
<P>
Some would say that this is a platitude. Would that it were! In a sense, it was learned thousands of years ago, but natural selection favors the forces of psychological denial.<A HREF="#8">8</A> The individual benefits as an individual from his ability to deny the truth even though society as a whole, of which he is a part, suffers. Education can counteract the natural tendency to do the wrong thing, but the inexorable succession of generations requires that the basis for this knowledge be constantly refreshed.
<P>
A simple incident that occurred a few years ago in Leominster, Massachusetts, shows how perishable the knowledge is. During the Christmas shopping season the parking meters downtown were covered with plastic bags that bore tags reading: "Do not open until after Christmas. Free parking courtesy of the mayor and city council." In other words, facing the prospect of an increased demand for already scarce space, the city fathers reinstituted the system of the commons. (Cynically, we suspect that they gained more votes than they lost by this retrogressive act.)
<P>
In an approximate way, the logic of the commons has been understood for a long time, perhaps since the discovery of agriculture or the invention of private property in real estate. But it is understood mostly only in special cases which are not sufficiently generalized. Even at this late date, cattlemen leasing national land on the Western ranges demonstrate no more than an ambivalent understanding, in constantly pressuring federal authorities to increase the head count to the point where overgrazing produces erosion and weeddominance. Likewise, the oceans of the world continue to suffer from the survival of the philosophy of the commons. Maritime nations still respond automatically to the shibboleth of the "freedom of the seas." Professing to believe in the "inexhaustible resources of the oceans," they bring species after species of fish and whales closer to extinction.<A HREF="#9">9</A>
<P>
The National Parks present another instance of the working out of the tragedy of the commons. At present, they are open to all, without limit. The parks themselves are limited in extent--there is only one Yosemite Valley-- whereas population seems to grow without limit. The values that visitors seek in the parks are steadily eroded. Plainly, we must soon cease to treat the parks as commons or they will be of no value to anyone.
<P>
What shall we do? We have several options. We might sell them off as private property. We might keep them as public property, but allocate the right to enter them. The allocation might be on the basis of wealth. by the use of an auction system. It might be on the basis of merit, as defined by some agreed-upon standards. It might be by lottery. Or it might be on a firstcome, first-served basis, administered to long queues. These, I think, are all objectionable. But we must choose--or acquiesce in the destruction of the commons that we call our National Parks.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4  COLOR = "#006699" ><I><B>Pollution</B></I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT=3>
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE=6 WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=151 SRC="OldMill.gif">In a reverse way, the tragedy of the commons reappears in problems of pollution. Here it is not a question of taking something out of the commons, but of putting something in--sewage, or chemical, radioactive, and heat wastes into water; noxious and dangerous fumes into the air; and distracting and unpleasant advertising signs into the line of sight. The calculations of utility are much the same as before. The rational man finds that his share of the cost of the wastes he discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying his wastes before releasing them. Since this is true for everyone, we are locked into a system of "fouling our own nest," so long as we behave only as independent, rational, free-enterprisers.

The tragedy of the commons as a food basket is averted by private property, or something formally like it. But the air and waters surrounding us cannot readily be fenced, and so the tragedy of the commons as a cesspool must be prevented by different means, by coercive laws or taxing devices that make it cheaper for the polluter to treat his pollutants than to discharge them untreated. We have not progressed as far with the solution of this problem as we have with the first. Indeed, our particular concept of private property, which deters us from exhausting the positive resources of the earth favors pollution. The owner of a factory on the bank of a stream--whose property extends to the middle of the stream--often has difficulty seeing why it is not his natural right to muddy the waters flowing past his door. The law, always behind the times, requires elaborate stitching and fitting to adapt it to this newly perceived aspect of the commons.

The pollution problem is a consequence of population. It did not much matter how a lonely American frontiersman disposed of his waste. "Flowing water purifies itself every ten miles," my grandfather used to say, and the myth was near enough to the truth when he was a boy, for there were not too many people. But as population became denser, the natural chemical and biological recycling processes became overloaded, calling for a redefinition of property rights.

<FONT COLOR = "#006699"   SIZE=4><I><B>Mutual Coercion Mutually Agreed Upon</B></I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
The social arrangements that produce responsibility are arrangements that create coercion, of some sort. Consider bank robbing. The man who takes money from a bank acts as if the bank were a commons. How do we prevent such action? Certainly not by trying to control his behavior solely by a verbal appeal to his sense of responsibility. Rather than rely on propaganda we follow Frankel's lead and insist that a bank is not a commons; we seek the definite social arrangements that will keep it from becoming a commons. That we thereby infringe on the freedom of wouldbe robbers we neither deny nor regret.
<P>
The morality of bank robbing is particularly easy to understand because we accept complete prohibition of this activity. We are willing to say "Thou shalt not rob banks," without providing for exceptions. But temperance also can be created by coercion. Taxing is a good coercive device. To keep downtown shoppers temperate in their use of parking space we introduce parking meters for short periods, and traffic fines for longer ones. We need not actually forbid a citizen to park as long as he wants to; we need merely make it increasingly expensive for him to do so. Not prohibition, but carefully biased options are what we offer him. A Madison Avenue man might call this persuasion; I prefer the greater candor of the word coercion.
<P>
Coercion is a dirty word to most liberals now, but it need not forever be so. As with the fourletter words, its dirtiness can be cleansed away by exposure to the light, by saying it over and over without apology or embarrassment. To many, the word coercion implies arbitrary decisions of distant and irresponsible bureaucrats; but this is not a necessary part of its meaning. The only kind of coercion I recommend is mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon by the majority of the people affected.
<P>
To say that we mutually agree to coercion is not to say that we are required to enjoy it, or even to pretend we enjoy it. Who enjoys taxes? We all grumble about them. But we accept compulsory taxes because we recognize that voluntary taxes would favor the conscienceless. We institute and (grumblingly) support taxes and other coercive devices to escape the horror of the commons.
<P>
An alternative to the commons need not be perfectly just to be preferable. With real estate and other material goods, the alternative we have chosen is the institution of private property coupled with legal inheritance. Is this system perfectly just? As a genetically trained biologist I deny that it is. It seems to me that, if there are to be differences in individual inheritance, legal possession should be perfectly correlated with biological inheritance--that those who are biologically more fit to be the custodians of property and power should legally inherit more. But genetic recombination continually makes a mockery of the doctrine of "like father, like son" implicit in our laws of legal inheritance. An idiot can inherit millions, and a trust fund can keep his estate intact. We must admit that our legal system of private property plus inheritance is unjust--but we put up with it because we are not convinced, at the moment, that anyone has invented a better system. The alternative of the commons is too horrifying to contemplate. Injustice is preferable to total ruin.
<P>
It is one of the peculiarities of the warfare between reform and the status quo that it is thoughtlessly governed by a double standard. Whenever a reform measure is proposed it is often defeated when its opponents triumphantly discover a flaw in it. As Kingsley Davis has pointed out,<A HREF="#21">21</A>  worshipers of the status quo sometimes imply that no reform is possible without unanimous agreement, an implication contrary to historical fact. As nearly as I can make out, automatic rejection of proposed reforms is based on one of two unconscious assumptions: (1) that the status quo is perfect; or (2) that the choice we face is between reform and no action; if the proposed reform is imperfect, we presumably should take no action at all, while we wait for a perfect proposal.
<P>
But we can never do nothing. That which we have done for thousands of years is also action. It also produces evils. Once we are aware that the status quo is action, we can then compare its discoverable advantages and disadvantages with the predicted advantages and disadvantages of the proposed reform, discounting as best we can for our lack of experience. On the basis of such a comparison, we can make a rational decision which will not involve the unworkable assumption that only perfect systems are tolerable.
<P>
<FONT COLOR = "#006699" SIZE=4><I><B>Recognition of Necessity</B></I></FONT>
<P>
.....<BR>
First we abandoned the commons in food gathering, enclosing farm land and restricting pastures and hunting and fishing areas. These restrictions are still not complete throughout the world.

Somewhat later we saw that the commons as a place for waste disposal would also have to be abandoned. Restrictions on the disposal of domestic sewage are widely accepted in the Western world; we are still struggling to close the commons to pollution by automobiles, factories, insecticide sprayers, fertilizing operations, and atomic energy installations.

In a still more embryonic state is our recognition of the evils of the commons in matters of pleasure. There is almost no restriction on the propagation of sound waves in the public medium. The shopping public is assaulted with mindless music, without its consent. Our government has paid out billions of dollars to create a supersonic transport which would disturb 50,000 people for every one person whisked from coast to coast 3 hours faster. Advertisers muddy the airwaves of radio and television and pollute the view of travelers. We are a long way from outlawing the commons in matters of pleasure. Is this because our Puritan inheritance makes us view pleasure as something of a sin, and pain (that is, the pollution of advertising) as the sign of virtue?

Every new enclosure of the commons involves the infringement of somebody's personal liberty. Infringements made in the distant past are accepted because no contemporary complains of a loss. It is the newly proposed infringements that we vigorously oppose; cries of "rights" and "freedom" fill the air. But what does "freedom" mean? When men mutually agreed to pass laws against robbing, mankind became more free, not less so. Individuals locked into the logic of the commons are free only to bring on universal ruin; once they see the necessity of mutual coercion, they become free to pursue other goals. I believe it was Hegel who said, "Freedom is the recognition of necessity."<BR>

<H3>Theoretical Foundations:  Market Failure and the Environment</H3>
<P>Systematic analysis of environmental problems must begin with the theory of market failure. Market economies generally do a good job serving the needs of consumers. Why, then, should the market fail to provide environmental am enities--from clean air and water to nature preserves and wildlife conservation--that many consumers clearly desire? This ostensible inability of the market to provide certain goods and services has been labeled by economists "market failure."
<p>
What are the fundamental causes of market failure? Two qualities of goods and services have been recognized as contributors to market failure: nonexcludability and nonrivalrous consumption. Nonexcludability means that the seller of a good unable to prevent nonpayers from consuming the good (or that is inefficient to do so because the marginal cost of exclusion exceeds the marginal benefit).  National defense, for instance, is nonexcludable good: once the good is produced, the seller is unable to exclude those who refuse to contribute to the good's reduction. Nonrivalrous consumption means that the marginal cost of a seller providing the good to an additional customer is zero; that is, any number of consumers may enjoy a good characterized by nonrivalrous consumption without detracting from the enjoyment of others. One good that has this quality is a movie theater: any number of patrons may enjoy a movie (up to the theater's capacity) without detracting from the enjoyment of other viewers and without imposing any additional costs upon the owner.
<p>


<Font Size =3 COLOR = "#003366" >
<center><img VSPACE= 12  WIDTH=442 HEIGHT=199 src= "Chart.gif" ALT="Chart"></center>
These two qualities can be used to construct a chart that gives a taxonomy of market failure. (See above figure.) This chart has four components. First, there are goods, called "private goods," that display neither of the two qualities. These goods do not contribute to market failure. Second, there are goods, which we may label "public goods," that are characterized by nonrivalrous consumption alone. A private movie theater would be a useful example of a public good, because the owner can exclude those who refuse to pay, but an additional patron's consumption imposes no costs on others. Third, there are goods, named "commons," that display nonexcludability but whose consumption is rivalrous. The living room of a student apartment is a good example of a commons: no one living in the apartment can be prevented from using it, but its use by one individual does often detract from the enjoyment of other users. Finally, there are those goods, which we may label "collective goods," that have both qualities. Again, national defense is the paradigmatic example: one can't exclude nonpayers from enjoying the benefits of national defense, and one person's consumption doesn't detract from the consumption of others.
<p>
Why do collective goods, public goods, and commons pose a problem for the marketplace? Commons and collective goods are both characterized by nonexcludability. Nonexcludability leads to a difficulty known as the "free-rider problem." Certain individuals may benefit from a good without paying to support the good's production; they are called "freeriders.' In the commons, such freeriding may lead to an inefficient exploitation of the commons resource; because nobody has the power to exclude, the commons will be used without regard for the costs imposed. This problem is typically referred to as "The Tragedy of the Commons". The problem has been known for centuries and was dealt with by great thinkers from Aristotle to David Hume.
<p>
This problem is especially noteworthy in such commons as the atmosphere. Arthur Pigou used the example of atmospheric pollution to illustrate his wellknown distinction between social and private costs. Pigou argued that because industrial polluters did not take into account the costs their pollution imposed on neighboring landowners, pollution would be produced at an inefficiently high level. By taking the pollution of factories into account through imposition of effluent charges, the private costs of production could be brought in line with the true, social costs of production, and pollution would fall to an efficient level.
<P>
Another area in which market-oriented solutions to environmental problems have been used is pollution abatement. Privatizing the commons has been tried with excellent results in at least one instance: British streams. In Britain, the right to fish a particular part of a lake or stream is a private property right that can be bought, sold, and traded. This propertyrights structure has not only prevented overfishing but has also kept British streams remarkably clean: owners of fishing rights take polluters who damage their fishing grounds to court--and the owners consistently win.
<p>
<H3>Conclusion:</H3>
The theoretical and practical aspects of FME. though substantial, need to be further researched and developed. The theories of market failure, governmental failure, and environmental economics need to be more solidly unified than they are now. Although this effort at unification has to some extent been attempted, no one has yet unified them in a way that fully takes account of property rights and their use in solving environmental problems. For instance, how can migratory herds be privatized? What contractual methods can be used to provide environmental amenities on a large scale? On a more practical level, further research needs to be done into the implications of FME in the real world. And finally, are there some environmental problems (e.g., nonpoint toxic discharges) that are simply not amenable to a market solution? (Even if this were true, of course, it does not detract from the superiority of private property solutions for other environmental problems.)

<Font Size =3  COLOR = "#003366" >[W]hether or not politicians comprehend or care about the particularities of the mountain, or the savanna, or the lowland rainforest, they make decisions and set policies affecting those ecosystems and the human communities within them.  It isn't entirely illogical that they should, since rural communities by their nature are small, whereas ecosystems by their nature are extensive, and the consequences of resource depletion or ecological degradation extend far beyond the boundaries of any given community. Deforestation in a highland drainage could deprive farmers downstream of perennial water supplies, or destroy a subsistence fishery with siltation. A single community along the migratory route of the Serengeti wildebeests could exterminate the herds and preempt the livelihoods of thousands of Tanzanians and Kenyans involved in the tourism industry. Western and Wright had made these points in their introductory paper. They had also recognized that the strong trend toward centralized national authority, characteristic of most countries during the modern era, has tended to subvert the traditional, local systems of communal authority. Increasing urbanization during recent decades has exacerbated the problem, since rural communities generally lack the political potency of urban populations when it comes to influencing national policies. The imbalance is aggravated further when rural areas hold commodity resources such as minerals, oil, or timber that offer tantalizing potential for financing industrial development, servicing foreign debt, or simply getting rich. What's the remedy for this tension between national and local concerns?  "Should a government abrogate its broader responsibility in the process of devolving proprietary rights to local communities?" asked Western and Wright. The Airlie participants had grappled with that riddle too.

No global assessments of the success of state-owned parks and protected areas exist.  The Nature Conservancy's assessments of parks in Latin American found that the ecological integrity of many of the parks surveyed was at risk.  An informal survey of knowledgeable field biologists from Latin America, Africa, and Asia yielded the uniform opinion that states everywhere are failing to carry out their full responsibilities to manage biodiversity and in fact may be contributing to its destruction.  The status of the world's "public" forest reserves is better studies; rapid deforestation of these forests has been recognized as a global crisis.
<p>
Conservation failures under strong public tenure are, in part, the result of factors noted in Neotropical Forests and Policy: government's tendency to support economic development, its lack of sensitivity to socioeconomic needs and conservation interests, and its lack of resources to monitor resource conditions.  In addition, many case studies (see Niger, Amboseli, India) cite widespread evidence to conclude that strong public tenure has failed to support conservation because states have followed colonial patterns of mining natural resources for quick capital to maintain state coffers and the political status of its elites.
<p>
Negative impacts on biodiversity have paralleled the erosion of traditional community-based tenurial rights that occur as states impose "public" rights.  The most well-documented causal links between loss of tenurial security and biodiversity loss come out of studies seeking the causes behind the loss of the world's tropical forests.
<p>
States historically have assumed rights over forests, particularly for revenue generation; these include rights to decide harvest schedules, royalties, who can harvest (timber permits), export tax, and rights to nontimber forest products, etc.  (see India, Annapurna).  In this process, states generally have ignored customary property rights.  In India, for example, the state incrementally overcame local resistance and community-level assertions of rights to manage forests by slowly shifting from granting communities fores "rights" to restricting communities to more limited "usufruct (use) rights" and "privileges," and finally to denying all rights to forest products and other privileges altogether.  Local communities fought to retain forest management rights, but over several decades, the state eliminated all community-level tenurial security.
<p>
Historical records show that India's forests were biologically rich, despite being used by high populations of people and livestock for thousands of years prior to central control under British colonization.  Tribal authorities, local elites, and princes enforced strict local forest management rules through methods including taxes, fines, land-use zoning, required labor commitments, and community forest guards.  The British ignored these local institutions and transformed community-managed forests into state forests that became de facto open-access areas.  Now, after the forest and their biodiversity have become severely degraded, various Indian states are granting certain tenurial rights to local communities in recognition of strong empirical evidence that  communites can effectively manage and, in this case, regenerate their own forests (see India).
<p>
<img align=left Hspace=10 Vspace=16  WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=236 src= "TropicalTree.gif">This degradation of biodiversity under public control is not limited to forests.  That inappropriate management and ignorance of traditional regimes have contributed to the degradation of grasslands and wildlife in Africa is widely accepted (see Amboseli, CAMPFIRE).  Establishment of parks and wildlife reserves sometimes has led to degradation or destruction of biodiveristy by people who view the park as territory taken from the by outsiders for outsiders' benefit.  Likewise, numerous cases in which traditional communities have attemtpted to defend their fishing territories against outside fishing interests are well documented in Oceania and other coastal zones throughout the world.  The resulting degradation of fisheries has been especially well documented in India but applies globally.
<p>
By insisting that biologically rich lands are owned by the state (under public tenure), national government often create conditions of "open access."  Garrett Hardin's (1968) "<A HREF="TragedyCommons.html">The Tragedy of the Commons</A>" was actually about the tragedy of open accesss, a situation that is promoted when community-based tenure is weakened, biodiversity if often pillaged in a wide-open race for short-term gain.  In effect, public land, or other public resources, belong to no one in particular but to everyone in general.  This ambiguous official status acts as a magnet that pulls charcoal makers, loggers, landless farmers, and other short-term users onto "public" forest land.
<p>
In practice, however, access generally is not equally open to all when profits can be made from exploiting public resources.  Many nation-states grant legal privileges either to favored elites (e.g., logging concession holders, plantation developers) or to troublesome "excess" populations of the landless rural poor through planned or incentive-assisted resettlement schemes.  As an example of such political use of public resources, in many countries, land tenure laws reward new settlers with titles if they "improve" land by clearing it of trees (see Boscosa).  In a twist of the usual story, an indigenous Sarawak community made the hard choice to cut down their forest when the state designated it as a public forest reserve.  If they had tried to fight the reserve, arguing that the forest was theirs, the community would have lost its village lands as well as the right to harvest the forest.  On the other hand, migrants following logging roads would have been permitted to cut down the trees with the legal protection of the government and granted title to the same land.  By cutting down all the trees, the existing community was able to secure tenure to the land, since village lands are deemed "agricultural land" once they are cleared.  The village paid a small fine and then planted rubber trees.
<p>
When communities traditionally have manged resource sustainably, government claims may destroy any incentive to continue to do so.  Without official recognition, communities do not have access to the formal legal structure to exclude those who encroach on their rights and overexploit their resources, be they local elites, multinational corporations, or landless migrants.  Lacking legal recognition, indigenous peoples and migrants living on "public" lands can not legally benefit from exploitation of the local natural resources base.  Deprived of the legal means and incentives to exclude newcomers and manage the forest for long-term sustainable benefit to themselves, many communities become increasingly responsive to market pressures to overexploit and join in the free-for-all.
<p>
In the case of wildlife, public management is often nonexistent, although most states claim the right to regulate hunting.  As noted in Amazon and CAMPFIRE, local communities tend to carry out wildlife management in rural areas more effectively than government authorities.
<p>
In summation, rational human beings face disincentives to make long-term improvements and take short-term losses to sustainbly manage their local resource base when they lack assurance that they and their successors will continue to profit from their investments.  The growing clamor for tenurial security by rural people around the world demonstrates the importance of this assurance.  Simply stated, tenurial security is an important precondition for sustainable resource management, principally because it encourages long-term planning and greater investments of labor and resources.  In the words of Harvard economist Theodore Panayotou,
<blockquote>Property rights need to be secure.  If there is a challenge to ownership, risk of appropriation (without adequate compensation), or extreme political or economic uncertainty, well-defined and exclusive property rights provide little security for long-term investment such as land improvements, tree planting, and resource conservation. (1989)</blockquote>

The Glenfeshie estate, which consists of 42,000 acres of Cairngorm wilderness, may be about to become the latest and largest victim of an intriguing new trend: the collectivisation of land ownership. Until now, most land in this country has belonged to individuals. But it is collective owners -- the Government, quangos, pension funds, conservation bodies and companies -- that are the future of land ownership. The day of the individual landowner is passing.
<p>	The owner of Glenfeshie, a fitted-kitchen entrepreneur who bought the estate in 1988 for more than 2.5 million, is selling because, rumour has it, he is fed up with trying to run an estate overrun with hikers and semi-official busybodies. What's the point, he must have wondered, in owning the land when other people tell him what he can and cannot do? The favourite candidate to buy the estate is the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
<p>	But even if a private millionaire does buy it, his hands will be tied. Last month there was a revealing letter in <CITE>The Scotsman</CITE> from Michael Scott of 'Plantlife', who said:
<blockquote>
'A potential purchaser of the estate might expect for 4-5 million to buy the unfettered right to own and manage the land, but that is far from the case . . . He will need extremely broad shoulders because there will be very many people looking over them. I trust the selling agents will make this clear to potential purchasers.'</blockquote>
<p>
<img align=right Vspace=5  Hspace=12  WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=186 src="PastoralWCastle.gif">Translated, this means, 'Let's try to talk down the price so a conservation organisation can buy it'. But what Mr Scott said is absolutely true. Ownership of land no longer means what it used to. When you buy land you acquire rights that have been greatly restricted and circumscribed. If there are buildings, the planners decide what may be done with them down to the last window sash. If there are woods, the Forestry Commission and the planners dictate whether you may fell them and how you must replant them. If there are fields, the Ministry of Agriculture tells you how many of them you may plant each year. If there is a bog, English Nature or its Scottish or Welsh equivalent will designate it as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and give you your orders; if a river bank, expect a call from the National Rivers Authority. There is now no kind of land - except a back garden - that you may do what you like to without permission from a bureaucrat. Only the costs and taxes of ownership are still yours in full.
<p>	But, aside from this creeping confiscation of ownership rights by the national government, there has been a steady expansion of collective forms of land ownership: that is, land owned by a corporate, public or voluntary body. The National Trust, the RSPB, the British Rail Pension Fund, farming companies, the Forestry Commission, the Ministry of Defence, local authorities - these are all the great modern landlords, vastly greater than all the dukes and earls put together. I would guess that more than half the land in this country is now in such collective hands. They have one huge advantage: they never pay inheritance tax.
<p>	There is nothing automatically wrong with collective landowners. Many are excellent stewards of the land, just as many individual landowners are incompetent, absentee and thoughtless. The RSPB in particular is an attentive and responsible steward of its reserves. Indeed, what is happening is probably just part of an historical trend, as, a century ago, privately owned firms mostly gave way to limitedliability public companies.
<p>	But, as with public companies, something valuable is lost. There is a loss of accountability (try finding out who to blame if something goes wrong), a loss of local control (collective landowners usually take decisions in distant London committee rooms, whereas not all millionaires are absentee), a loss of eccentricity (who ever heard of the National Trust commissioning a folly?), and a loss of continuity (wardens and executives move on or retire after a few years; earls do not).
<p>	Many Scotsmen resent the way their mountains became private playthings of the rich in Victorian times. But they should be wary of leaping out of that frying pan into a nationalised fire.

A quick glance at today's news reveals the conflict and controversy over the economics and ecosystems of fisheries.  The challenge is to find the best system for achieving two seemingly contradictory goals:   the simultaneous exploitation and preservation of the fishery.  Solutions require understanding <A HREF="#item2">externalities</A> and <A HREF="#item1">entrepreneurs.</A> 


<p>
Optimizing the harvest of fish stocks while maintaining their viability is not easy. The very nature of fisheries makes optimizing difficult.  Fish, unlike agricultural products, are mobile and hidden resources of the sea.  These conditions make oceanic fisheries a nearly perfect example of a 'commons'.  <A HREF="#item3">Commons</A> are characterized by (1) potentially depletable resources are (2) open to all.  The buffalo of the early American West provide a popular <A HREF="#item4">example.</A>
<p>
Fisheries, like all commons, are subject to the forces which lead to the "tragedy of the commons". The tragedy occurs when all individuals race to exploit the resource while neglecting the adverse effects to society.  Like polluters, fishermen are encouraged to fish as much as they can because the penalties of overfishing are shared among all society.  When social and legal arrangements give incentives to overfish the commons, fishermen will do so.  This is the tragedy.
<p>
When the private costs of fishing are much lower than the social costs, an externality is present in the economy of the fishery.  Externalities, like air pollution, are the product of a system which permits fishermen private benefits while making society pay the costs. 
<p>
A simple example of this can be seen in the case of the North Pacific fur seal. Until 1890, the fur seals were harvested in a regulated, sustainable manner. Then, changes in technology and the market price of fur seals made high-seas harvesting of the fur seals possible and cost-effective. The fur seal fishery was not managed on the high seas. Not surprisingly within 20 years, the population of fur seals fell to one-tenth its previous level.
<p>
It was entrepreneurial spirit that exposed the powerful externalities in the fur seal economy.  The freedom offered by unregulated fisheries permitted entrepreneurs wide berth in their efforts to create value.  In a commons characterized by an imbalance between private and social costs, such innovations can damage society.  Entrepreneurial innovation made it valuable to increase seal harvests even after its population has been decimated.  In this way, entrepreneurs can speed up the process of overfishing (just like some inventions have introduced more efficient ways to pollute).
<p>
Off the Pacific coast, one can find an example of the tragedies occurring in fisheries throughout the world.  The widow rockfish became overfished between 1979 and 1981, despite a 70% drop in its market price during that time.  Why?  By chance, an Oregon fisherman discovered that widow rockfish concentrate in a single area at night.  This discovery led to phenomenal increases in catches.  Entrepreneurship invented a great deal of value from the fishery where there previously was little.  The tragedy manifested after 1982 as declining productivity in the fishery, higher long-term costs for rockfish, and scores of vessels with nothing to catch.
<p>
There are many ways to avoid these 'tragedies'.  The root of the problems lies in the synergy created by externalities and the commons.  In the commons, fishermen impose great costs on society, and it often costs too much to stop them.  A solution lies in establishing a system that either discourages or prohibits fishermen from imposing such high costs.  Making the fish private property discourages fishermen from using the fish in manner costly to society.  Because privatizing fish is inherently problematic, fisheries managers have turned their attention to regulating access.  Regulating access to the fishery can place limits on externalities fishermen can create.
<p>
In the struggle to strike a balance between preserving a resource and exploiting it, we've seen some successes.  After depleting the North Pacific fur seal population, the United States and other nations established ownership of the fur seals.  Social costs and harvesting costs became one in the same, removing externalities.  The fur seals have made a remarkable recovery, and profits have increased under this regime.
<p>
Regulating the commons usually means placing it under government control.  Beware, though, for this alone is not enough.  The widow rockfish were under U.S. jurisdiction, and catastrophe still happened.  The system, be it private property or a moratorium on fishing, must be wary of the nature of fisheries. 
<p>
Externalities should be minimized.  In such a system, entrepreneurial fishermen will find ways to increase the productivity of the fishery.  And in such a system, society as a whole will benefit. These effects normally follow private property and free market processes.  They are very rare in fisheries, but not impossible. 
<p>
Herein lies a real entrepreneurial challenge:  find a way to minimize externalities and thereby create value for individuals and society.  This way, entrepreneurship works on two levels.  While technological entrepreneurs create valuable enterprises and innovations, public policy entrepreneurs can improve our institutional arrangements to harmonize individual pursuits with greater welfare.  We need the foresight to encourage both sorts of entrepreneurship.

<H4>GLOSSARY</H4>
<p>
<H5><A NAME="item1">Entrepreneurs:</A> </H5>
  Entrepreneurs are those individuals who create wealth by exploiting market imperfections and taking risks in innovative enterprises.  They catalyze technological invention, improved business practices, and more effective institutional design.  Entrepreneurs make the dynamic adaptation and adjustment of market economies possible.  Entrepreneurs exercise their judgment and ingenuity to fill market niches and exploit new opportunities.  Entrepreneurs are a fundamental force in the economy, both in spite of and because of their highly variable and unpredictable nature.
<p>
<H5><A NAME="item2">Externalities:</A> </H5>
 When voluntary, individual actions impose adverse consequences for others, this is considered an "externality".  They are termed so because these actions take place outside of the institution of voluntary exchange, where we usually expect that trade-offs and compensation are made.  When a landowner charges a fee for other ranchers to graze their flock on their land, we expect that each party (landowner and rancher) will be relatively satisfied so long as both enter the agreement voluntarily.  Conversely, when there is no negotiated trade-off or exchange, individual actions quite likely impose costs on others while providing benefits to the actor.  Those externalized costs are known as "externalities".  When ranchers can freely graze their livestock on land owned as a commons, they'll individually reap the benefits of fatted calves while everyone feels the externality of a destroyed grazing commons.

<H5><A NAME="item3">Commons:</A> </H5>
  See the <A HREF="EconomicsEcologyExchange.html">Robert Taylor</A> piece for further description of a commons.  In short, all commons are relatively open-access, meaning anyone in a group can freely exploit that resource without needing permission, having a quota, or other limits.  Also, commons are "subtractable".  The more an individual exploits a commons, the less there is of it for others to exploit.

<H5><A NAME="item4">Buffalo commons:</A> </H5>
   <blockquote> The Plains Indians very eagerly accepted modern technology in the form of horses, guns, and steel tools....  By 1840 the Indian had driven the buffalo from portions of the Great Plains area and there is evidence of concern about this problem.  E. F. Murphy states that "[o]nly the simplicity of weaponry and the small numbers of these nomadic peoples kept the buffalo from meeting its fate two centuries sooner."....  
	[T]he buffalo were driven close to the point of no return.  Given multiple tribes and the fact of no real cooperation, the Indians were incapable of managing the buffalo as a common pool resource....  The benefits from harvesting one more buffalo accrue to the individual hunter, while the costs of depletion of the herd are spread among all hunters.  The true costs of hunting are not borne by the hunter and over-use is predictable.</blockquote>

Baden</P><P>TOMORROW is the Seattle meeting of the President's Council on Sustainable Development. According to their news release, the council's goal is to: &quot;explore and develop policies that encourage economic growth, job creation, and effective use of our natural resources.&quot; Council leaders want to learn what works in environmentally sound economic-development policies.</P><P>       The council includes prominent environmental officials from the Clinton administration such as Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, EPA Administrator Carol Browner and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary. They know that Al Gore is emerging as the most influential vice president in our history, a leader with genuine responsibility for establishing and guiding policy in several areas, especially environmental policy. With the Clintons preoccupied by health care, foreign affairs and recurrent allegations of scandal, Gore's importance will grow. We may see a Gore presidency in the year 2000 or before.</P><P>     How might a Gore presidency affect America's natural resource and environmental policies? Will his policies work? For starters, Gore seems to care a great deal about our environment. He correctly identifies many serious problems - species extinction, population pressures, aquifer depletion - in his book, &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot;.</P><P>     Unfortunately, although he gets many facts straight, his proposed reforms are likely to be genuinely harmful; he has learned little from history. Gore sees the problem as evil and ignorant people and insufficient government management. His approach to environmental bliss is naive - place good, intelligent people in positions of authority and empower them to pursue rational, publicly beneficial policies. He assumes that political bureaucracies can consistently promote environmental ends. While this may work at the community level, it normally fails at the national level as both ecological sensitivity and economic efficiency are trumped by politics.</P><P>     Gore's policy inclinations are right in the trivial sense that many environmental problems could easily be dealt with if we could &quot;rewire&quot; people and produce a new environmental man. This creature would enthusiastically support programs that improved the quality of the environment, even if they implied significant personal costs. Environmental man's self interest is subservient to ecology. But this is as unrealistic as the Soviet's efforts to create a &quot;new socialist man,&quot; another altruistic creature. And like the Soviet's efforts, rewiring - or in this case repainting people a new shade of green - will fail, causing much environmental mischief and fostering political opportunism.</P><P>     The key to environmental protection is not reliance upon more extensive political micromanagement. Neither is it dependence upon good people in high places or mass conversion to a more ecologically responsible perspective. True, my fellow conservationists and I would rest easier if we could count upon having people such as Aldo Leopold, a profound social observer and a founder of wildlife science, as Interior Secretary. And yes, I'd be delighted if voters shared my views and joined in mass support of The Nature Conservancy and Ducks Unlimited.</P><P>     But in reality, no society has learned how to identify Platonic despots, i.e., people who will wisely and disinterestedly safeguard the public good. Likewise, mass political movements that inspire sacrifice and achieve sustained, dedicated support normally generate horrid results. Castro, Franco, Hitler, Pol Pot and Stalin are but extreme examples of the corruption inherent to centralized power.</P><P>     The temptations to abuse power are enormous in environmental policy and elsewhere. If we accept Gore's approach, with its heavy reliance on good intentions, good people and strong government, we invite abuses. Good people will not always be in top positions and ordinary people will not always act in environmentally beneficial ways. As America's founders clearly explained, government power is likely to be misdirected. Political management and ecological sustainability are not complementary for several reasons.</P><P>     The most important reason is that a politician must capture campaign contributions to survive. This means he typically must favor his constituents over the national interest. The greater the government's role in the economy, the more costly it is to neglect one's voters in favor of the public interest in the environment.</P><P>     We can learn this lesson from federal agencies such as the Forest Service (1897), Bureau of Reclamation (1902) and Park Service (1906). The creators of these agencies, the first Progressives, expected good people to use scientific principles to publicly manage natural resources. But as the power of these agencies grew, so did the subsidized abuse to Western environments and citizens. Gore seems not to understand that these earlier efforts failed because their incentives were perverse and the information they generated was of poor quality.</P><P>     Gore has taken the important first step of recognizing our environmental ills. But like the progressive reformers of a century ago, he has misdiagnosed the causes and hence the cures. A few in the Clinton administration, including Browner but excluding Babbitt, seem to understand the importance of property rights and incentives to a greener future. I'm afraid that if Gore doesn't learn these lessons and we follow his lead, we will have the worst of all worlds: ineffective environmental protection, inefficient economics and a citizenry disenchanted with environmental causes. The trick is to harmonize economics with ecology. Unfortunately, Gore hasn't learned it.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

Baden</P><P>I'VE sent my check to the Salvation Army for the relief of California's earthquake victims (Salvation Army, Earthquake Fund, 615 Slaters Lane, P.O. Box 269, Alexandria, VA 22313). People are in genuine distress and there is clearly a need for outside help. But I've also written letters to my congressional representatives, urging them to not provide federal aid for long-term relief. This is because I firmly believe long-term federal aid does more harm than good.</P><P>       In the last century, when we were much poorer and more vulnerable, efforts to dispense federal disaster aid met fierce resistance. For example, the Texas Seed Bill of 1887, a measure to distribute $10,000 to help farmers in drought-stricken Texas, was vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. Why veto so small a sum for so good a cause? Cleveland justified his action stating: &quot;A prevalent tendency to disregard the (government's) limited mission  . . . should be steadfastly resisted to (enforce the lesson) that, though the people support the Government, the Government should not support the people.&quot; Cleveland was being compassionate, not cruel, and his advice remains sound today. He understood the slippery slope of political aid.</P><P>     Providing voluntary aid to one's fellow citizens is admirable, and emergency federal assistance (e.g., tents, food and water, and National Guard troops) for areas struck by major natural disasters is justified. Such aid serves a humanitarian purpose in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. It is cruel to apply narrowly economic criteria during this period. But it is vital that economic incentives play a major role during the recovery. Long-term federal aid that reduces the costs of rebuilding or repairing homes and other property is a subsidy. Like most subsidies, it distorts useful economic incentives and has perverse consequences.</P><P>     The problem is twofold. First, when people do not bear the consequences of their actions they are encouraged to build and live in places prone to disasters, e.g., flood plains and earthquake zones. Second, the availability of federal aid encourages officials to grant disaster aid to areas that lack genuine need. We have seen raids on the Treasury grow ever larger as people come to expect federal bailouts.</P><P>     The first problem is easy to understand. It is an example of what economists call &quot;moral hazard.&quot; When people are not responsible for the full costs of their actions, they behave in riskier (i.e., potentially more costly) ways. Thus, rental cars are often abused because the people who rent them never directly pay for the wear and tear they inflict on transmissions or brakes. Very similar are people who build on earthquake faults, flood plains or barrier islands if they receive insurance that subsidizes the cost of repairing damaged homes, cars and so forth. They take fewer precautions, precautions that may extend to not living, or building expensive structures, in disaster-prone locations.</P><P>     The moral question to ask is not whether people who are suffering should be helped, but what incentives are we creating for future behavior? If the government encourages unsafe construction practices and locations via subsidies, the human and material costs of disasters will only grow larger than otherwise. This includes significant environmental costs because many disaster-prone locations have substantial biological or aesthetic value. In effect, by helping victims now, we create many more victims, human and ecological, later.</P><P>     The second consideration is equally important. It may have been President Cleveland's main concern. As long as federal disaster subsidies remain, politicians will have significant incentives to acquire those monies, even if they have not suffered anything remotely approximating a disaster. The prospect of receiving federal aid may have prompted Montana's governor to declare a state of emergency following the eruption of Mount St. Helens (May 18, 1980), even though the post-eruption situation in Montana was far from disastrous.</P><P>     When aid is available, opportunism can color decisions. President Clinton had incentives to move quickly to disburse emergency aid in part because of California's importance to his re-election and to the 1994 congressional races. Making federal aid available during real disasters generates pleas for such aid when more local and perhaps private efforts would suffice. Eventually, disaster aid disproportionately goes to the politically shrewd or powerful. Moreover, the generosity of federal aid programs rachets upward while non-federal matching proportions slide.</P><P>     Even when raw political considerations are not paramount, the question remains: Where do we draw the line? When do disasters merit federal subsidies? Clear distinctions are impossible and the mindset &quot;they got theirs and I should get mine&quot; dominates since relative need or merit cannot be exactly determined.</P><P>     Direct federal costs grow, politicians feed on federal monies, and worst of all, the impulse toward private giving is eroded. The loss of such civic virtue is of vital concern, but is exceedingly difficult to measure. Its presence builds bonds of fellowship among Americans.</P><P>     We should feel compassion for the quake victims. But let us not pursue policies that foster worse situations in the future. It is tempting to open the federal purse. But we should do so with great reluctance, realizing that some consequences are quite negative. President Cleveland got it right: the government should not support the people. It is indeed a slippery slope.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

Baden</P><P>ECONOMIES are like ecosystems in that everything is tied to everything else. We cannot do only one thing. Protecting owls by limiting timber harvest has multiple consequences, mostly unintended. People anticipate outcomes, estimate how regulations affect their security and livelihood, and often change their behavior accordingly.</P><P>       Regulations that ignore this interconnectedness can make matters worse, despite good intentions. For example, giving people orders seems cheaper than creating positive incentives for them to cooperate, especially if the order limits what people can do rather than taking physical possession of their property. But we should be extremely careful because over the long run, &quot;takings&quot; are expensive. At a minimum, they erode faith in government's most important role: the fair protector of social life.</P><P>     Most people agree that forests are environmentally and economically important. This is why there are strong pressures to impose regulations preserving watersheds, ecosystems, biodiversity and other forest values. But these restrictions do not come free. They may be worth the price they exact but we should recognize that they impose substantial costs upon owners, society and even ecosystems. As John Muir taught us more than a century ago, everything is tied to everything else.</P><P>     In the Douglas fir region of the Northwest a landowner typically invests $300 to $500 per acre preparing the soil, planting it and tending the seedlings until they are established. This investment generates nothing until the first commercial thinning perhaps 25 to 35 years later. In Western Washington a landowner would normally have the final cut 50 to 75 years after planting. Some owners prefer older stands and keep timber standing long after it is economically mature.</P><P>     Restrictive regulations, or the mere prospect of such regulations, reduce or eliminate the owner's future security. Without the certainty that they can harvest their trees a generation or two later, or sell to someone who can, landowners have weaker incentives to be good stewards. Trees are likely to be cut prematurely and the land converted to non-forestry use. This is happening throughout the Northwest today.</P><P>     Throughout the 1980s, small woodlands owners in Washington obtained about 8,000 permits to cut their timber. That rose 50 percent by 1990 and preliminary estimates by the Washington Farm Forestry Association suggest an additional 50 percent increase by 1993. Money and fear, a powerful combination, are two important reasons for this increase.</P><P>     First, let's consider money. Today, owners see extraordinarily high prices for timber from private lands. Concern for the spotted owl dramatically reduced the timber available from federal lands, shifting demand to private and state forests. Until recently, prices in the export market have been high. Finally, low interest rates have substantially increased new home construction and hence demand for forest products. Each factor contributes to higher log prices and stronger incentives to harvest timber.</P><P>     Fear is also important, particularly the fear that if timber is not sold now, it will be impossible to sell later. This fear seems justified to many people who were counting on their timber as an investment, perhaps for retirement. There are many horror stories in the media and far more floating around rural cafes of people whose &quot;nest egg&quot; has been cracked by restrictive regulations. This gives landowners very strong incentives to cut while they still can.</P><P>     Likewise, if timber mills fear that logs won't be available later, their buildings and equipment will decline in value and may become essentially worthless. They have incentives to run as long as they cover their out-of-pocket costs and just a smidgen more and wear out their capital. This fear causes them to buy logs at higher prices than could be sustained over the long run.</P><P>     Forestry is quite different when people are secure in their holdings. Most important, people secure in their rights can prudently look ahead 35 to 60 years. When their rights to harvest in the future are secure, there are many things that landowners will often do to increase yields. For example, people can plant expensive but genetically improved seedlings, and thin, prune and fertilize. These practices can increase productivity per acre over 50 percent. This means fewer acres will be cut.</P><P>     At the minimum, concern over regulatory &quot;takings&quot; causes rational people to dramatically reduce their investment in yield-enhancing efficiency. In addition, when productive forestry practices are reduced on private lands in the United States, more trees will be cut elsewhere. According to U.C. Berkeley forestry professor W.J. Libby, we will lose 49 species for every 25,000 acres of rain forest cut. To the degree that demand is shifted to tropical rain forests, some species will go extinct. Also, as wood supplies are constrained, substitutes with greater environmental impacts will displace wood products, e.g., steel studs in house construction.</P><P>     Actions have consequences, in ecosystems and markets. Regulatory &quot;takings&quot; of private property will encourage behavior that defeats our environmental goals and strengthens opposition to environmental reforms. We should consider the reality of unintended consequences when designing environmental reforms. </P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>PRESIDENT Clinton is desperately looking for places to cut the budget. He even hints of hitting the Rural Electrification Administration. REA is an egregious example of government subsidies that enrich the wealthy while retarding environmentally beneficial innovation.</P><P>       REA was established in 1935 by President Roosevelt. It subsidized the delivery of electric power to remote rural locations at a time when few rural areas were electrified. Because the costs of stringing miles of power lines to isolated customers was so high, and alternative energy just developing, only 10 percent of farms had electricity.</P><P>     Lack of electricity contributed to low rural living standards. With collectivism in vogue, it appeared reasonable for the public to pay for power delivery. Taxpayers were to lose nothing: Federal subsidies were made at interest rates higher than the government's costs of borrowing. However, being a political promise, it was short-lived.</P><P>     Economies are like ecosystems in that you cannot do only one thing. REA had unintended, perverse consequences. Once these consequences are understood, the REA's appeal shrinks. But it has built a constituency and it won't quietly go away.</P><P>     First, few of the REA's subsidies actually benefit poor, rural areas. They did for a while, but do not now. Today, subsidies go to wealthy resort communities such as Vail, Aspen and Beaver Creek, Colo., and Hilton Head, S. C. They also go to wealthy suburbs of Atlanta, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Washington, D.C. Over half the subsidies benefit Fortune 500 companies. The REA is subsidizing skiers, suburbanites, resorts and big businesses with middle-class taxes.</P><P>     Second, the REA loans almost $2 billion annually, and more than 60 percent of these loans will never be repaid because interest rates on the loans are less than the rates the government must pay to borrow money. However, subsidies for the rich and increases in the federal deficit pale in comparison to the third consequence of the REA: nearly 60 years of discouraging research into alternative energies and conservation.</P><P>     The REA subsidized centrally generated power. This created a bias against small-scale alternative energies. Centralized power plants sometimes have cost advantages, what economists call economies of scale. But if delivering this power is expensive, alternative energy sources (e.g. biomass conversions, solar, wind, small-scale hydroelectric, and tidal power) become competitive. Also, people are encouraged to conserve by seeking more-efficient appliances, machinery and tools.</P><P>     The REA eliminated the delivery-cost advantages of alternative energies and discouraged their development. Research into solar and wind power and organic fuels declined sharply after the creation of the REA. Inventors and investors realized that oil, coal, large-scale hydroelectric and eventually nuclear power were favored over small-scale alternatives.</P><P>     For example, Marcellus Jacobs, founder of the once-successful Jacobs Wind Electric Co., states that the spread of REA-subsidized facilities signaled the end of his business. The solar water-heating industry, resurging after World War II, was also stunted by cheap electric rates. Likewise, the ultimate demise of research into tidal power is attributable to the subsidized introduction of cheap electricity.</P><P>     Subsidies usually have negative environmental consequences. In this case, some of the environmental costs are the loss of nearly 60 years of research and development in conservation and alternative energy. In rural areas, the cost of centrally generated power is high. This gave incentive for research and development into small-scale alternative energy and energy conservation. But REA subsidies favored central power.</P><P>     Even when subsidies do some good, such as electrifying rural America, they frequently do great hidden harm. In the case of the REA, the harm is almost 60 years of lost alternative energy research. Subsidized rural electricity has deepened dependence on foreign oil, on dirty coal, on big dams, and on expensive nuclear power.</P><P>     Since alternative futures are unknowable, we cannot know the costs of stifling innovation with subsidies. But we do know there will be costs, and that they are often significant. We know that government subsidies often become twisted to serve the interests of the rich and powerful at the expense of the weak and vulnerable. In the case of the REA, the financial and environmental costs of subsidies have been huge.</P><P>     Government subsidies are dangerous and costly, even when originally intended for good purposes. And once in place, they are very hard to eliminate. Let the public remember this when considering the Clinton administration's new budgets.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>GOLD mining on federal lands, raising sugar cane near the Everglades, and irrigating Western deserts all illustrate the critical differences between being pro-free market and pro-business.</P><P>       It is easy to see why many people confuse the two. Wise Use groups and others, out of duplicity or ignorance, posture as defenders of the free market. But in fact, they often argue for special privileges and protections that cost the environment, consumers and taxpayers dearly. It is important to understand the difference between advocating the free market as a process and advocating special treatment for businesses.</P><P>     The market is a system of information and incentives. It coordinates human action and allocates resources to their highest valued uses with greater efficiency than other systems. It works extremely well, though never perfectly, with commodities such as minerals, agricultural goods and manufactures.</P><P>     However, some valuable things, such as clean air, species diversity, migratory waterfowl, and scenic landscapes are difficult to protect and allocate through the market. Economists call these public goods and common-pool resources. It is difficult or impossible to price or to establish clear property rights over them - and without clear and transferable property rights, the market cannot function well. If markets are to minimize waste and efficiently protect the environment, people must bear the costs of their actions.</P><P>     Businesses are players within the market framework. Each shares the framework with other groups as well as unorganized individuals. Businesses in the market are like organisms in an ecological system.</P><P>     Businesses have incentives to avoid the full costs of their actions. They often favor policies that advantage themselves and impose costs on others. If responsible for their full costs, the things they produce may be more expensive. For example, gold mining, which can involve dynamiting entire mountains and bathing the rubble in poisonous cyanide solutions to leach out the gold, may not be profitable if ecological, aesthetic and health costs are counted. Companies may even have to give up their mines. Society (i.e. all of us) would reap a net gain, but stockholders and employees would suffer losses.</P><P>     A pro-market position puts the public's well-being ahead of special privileges for any business. In contrast, the phrase &quot;pro business&quot; means allowing certain people to evade responsibility for the costs of their actions and to insulate themselves from competition. Many businesses try to avoid or ignore environmental costs because by doing so, they gain in the short run. To avoid costs, businesses lobby legislatures to limit competition, obtain subsidies, or ignore certain costs.</P><P>     Consider Florida sugar growers. U.S. sugar quotas protect them from less-expensive imports. Moreover, sugar growers can ignore the enormous ecological damage they inflict on the Everglades. Their political power (even then-Sen. Al Gore voted to protect them) allows them to retain these subsidies at the financial and environmental expense of the country.</P><P>     But such pro-business strategies always advantage one industry by disadvantaging others. For instance, candy manufacturers who use sugar have higher costs than Canadian competitors because U.S. sugar prices are kept artificially high by quotas. They have been forced to use corn syrup as a higher cost and imperfect substitute for sugar. And now the corn syrup producers lobby to keep the quotas on foreign sugar. In economies as in ecology, everything is tied to everything else.</P><P>     Or consider the Mining Act of 1872. It grants companies the right to mine federal lands virtually for free. It probably made sense 100 years ago, but today it is an indirect subsidy to environmentally destructive mining. Mining companies favor the law because they don't want to pay market prices for the lands they mine and be responsible for the environmental damage they cause. Again, being pro-market by requiring mining companies to bear these environmental costs would hurt the companies while benefiting the public.</P><P>     Federal subsidies for irrigation are a notorious pro-business strategy. With water delivered at 10 percent of its cost, it is profitable to grow water-intensive crops such as rice in semi-deserts like the Central Valley of California. But the &quot;cheap&quot; water does not reflect the opportunity costs of taxpayers' money, the wildlife habitat and fish runs damaged by dams and water diversions, and the pollution created by chemical runoff from irrigated fields. Subsidized water costs society a great deal. Here again, being pro-market puts us at odds with the private interests of agribusiness.</P><P>     People who take pro-market stands take equally strong stands against special privileges for businesses. Both justice and efficiency demand that businesses bear full responsibility for the costs their actions impose on society, including the environmental costs. Market principles favor the environment because many environmental problems arise when people are isolated from the costs of their actions. This insulation comes from favors for the politically powerful. This is why being pro-market supports the public's interests first and foremost. As environmentalists learn this distinction, I hope to see a union of pro-market and environmental forces.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>Some of the questions raised in this column are addressed in FREE's forthcoming book, &quot;Environmental Gore: A Constructive Response to Earth in the Balance.&quot;</P><P>  THE global warming debate, like many environmental issues, is scientifically complex and highly emotional. Its complexity hinders informed debate and its emotionalism makes consensus elusive. Part of the problem is that climatology (the discipline dealing most directly with global climate issues) is a young and inexact science. But much of the problem can be traced to special interest's manipulation of the political process.</P><P>     Contrary to conventional wisdom, many fundamental questions about global warming remain unanswered. Two crucial questions are: 1) Is significant human-induced global warming actually occurring? 2) If it is occurring, will the net effects be beneficial or harmful? In neither case is the answer an unambiguous &quot;yes.&quot;</P><P>       First, significant global warming may not be occurring. Certainly, the historical relationship between CO and temperature changes is ambiguous. Although levels of atmospheric CO have risen nearly 40 percent since the turn of the century, data from within the United States indicates no statistically significant increase in mean annual temperatures. In fact, between 1920 and 1987, there was a slight cooling trend.</P><P>     Data also indicates that the rise in hemispheric temperature has been significantly less than expected given the increase in CO. And the region most likely to see temperature increases, the Arctic, has actually cooled since about l940.</P><P>     Furthermore, the climate models used to predict warming depend on numerous unknowns. For example, we do not know how changes in cloud cover will affect global temperatures. Although the models agree that a warmer earth is likely to be a cloudier earth, it is unknown whether more clouds will cool the planet by reflecting sunlight or warm the planet by trapping re-radiated heat before it escapes into space. The net effect is unclear. Neither do the models explain the impact of temperature changes on polar ice and snow. A warmer climate may increase precipitation and produce more ice and snow in colder areas. This would increase the earth's albedo and cool the planet.</P><P>     The empirical and theoretical uncertainties surrounding global warming counsel caution before making policy. Scientists are certainly being cautious; a Feb. 13, 1992 Gallup poll shows that most climate scientists doubt there has been any significant human-caused global warming to date.</P><P>     But even if global warming does occur, it is unlikely to be a catastrophe. Robert Balling, director of the Office of Climatology at Arizona State University, and Richard Lindzen, Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at M.I.T., conclude that doubling atmospheric CO is likely to produce an average global temperature increase of approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. This, increase is likely to be most significant at night, at high latitudes, and during the winter. It will not melt polar ice caps nor raise sea levels more than a few inches. There will not be super-hurricanes and there will not be endless summers of blazing temperatures.</P><P>     In fact, there are many benefits associated with increased atmospheric CO. Doubling CO levels will favor bigger plants and may increase average crop yields by an estimated 33 percent. More atmospheric CO allows plants to grow using less water by reducing evapotranspiration - water evaporating after it is released from plants' pores. Precipitation and soil moisture may rise, and droughts may become less frequent.</P><P>     Amidst the uncertainties, one thing is certain: Some groups benefit if the public believes global warming is a genuine crisis that can only be stopped with massive political mobilization. Irresponsible efforts by these groups fuel fears of widespread drought and crop failures, of super powerful hurricanes, of oceans engulfing coastal cities, and of blazing summer temperatures. How do they gain by hyping global warming?</P><P>        For environmental groups, global warming is the ultimate issue. It affects everyone, it is dramatic and thus captures the public's attention, and it can only be solved by mobilizing government to impose regulations and develop programs. For those environmentalists hostile toward industrial civilization, global warming provides a rationale to impose their version of ecotopia. The threat of global warming gives license to those who seek to profit from crises.</P><P>     Insurance companies may also gain from government efforts to control global warming. Insurers are motivated more by profits than ideology. If global warming causes increased hurricane damage or floods, they may lose immense amounts of money. Massive carbon taxes or regulation may halt warming and their losses. Since they as taxpayers will pay only a trivial portion of any regulatory bill, it is reasonable for them to seek such measures. If global warming never manifests, they lose little, but society loses a lot.</P><P>     When making decisions and facing uncertainty, responsible people evaluate the most likely costs and benefits of alternative strategies. Given our current understanding, the changes wrought by global warming may well bring small costs or perhaps benefits. Massive prevention programs will surely be expensive, they will slow economic progress worldwide. Moreover, delaying action for a few years, while our understanding of climate change improves, is likely to lead to more prudent policies. If substantial warming is going to occur, a few years delay will make very little difference.</P><P>     The global warming debate is far from settled. In deciding what to do, we should consider both the merits of the arguments and the possibility that they are being manipulated for hidden agendas. If we do not, we are likely to be stampeded into public policies with huge immediate costs and few if any benefits.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>I OFTEN defend the habitat of species I care for deeply: grizzly bears, wild trout and birds of all kinds. But, like most people, I care even more about preserving the quality of my own habitat, my neighborhood and community. Within that habitat, we not only worry about pollution and disease, we are concerned with human predators (i.e. criminals).</P><P>       This concern has recently resurfaced in a vigorous debate about the merits of gun control and its impact on crime. Is it wise to support gun control? This is a difficult question, one worthy of careful attention.</P><P>     National Public Radio, The New York Times and The Atlantic Monthly exemplify progressive thinking on many matters of social policy. Hence it is revealing that they have recently featured articles challenging the conventional view that citizens' access to handguns should be severely constrained. In these articles, Daniel Polsby of Northwestern University's School of Law and James Q. Wilson of UCLA argue that this sort of policy is likely to be ineffective and indeed counterproductive.</P><P>     In Polsby and Wilson's view, handguns are tools that give their owners an advantage when bargaining or interacting with others.</P><P>     For example, I am a healthy, athletic, 6-foot, 190-pound male - a difficult mark for an unarmed person. However, if I left my neighborhood cash machine some evening and a 97-pound weakling with an Uzi demanded my money, he would surely get it. The Uzi gives my assailant the upper hand.</P><P>     If guns are tools they are subject to the laws of economics. Using economic logic, we can ask: Who will give up their guns if an aggressive program of handgun control is enacted?</P><P>       People who expect to use guns frequently, such as criminals, find them very valuable. They are unlikely to easily relinquish their guns. People who value guns very little, perhaps professors who live and work in safe neighborhoods, are  most likely to relinquish them. Thus gun control will have the most impact on those least likely to commit crimes. Should gun control succeed, the habitat of once-safe communities will degrade as still more armed criminals confront an increasingly vulnerable (i.e. unarmed) populace.</P><P>     Consider a lesson from the Montana ranch my wife and I own. For many years, we ran sheep on rangeland between our low-lying fields and the higher-elevation timberlands. Although the area is beautiful, it is also burdened with an abundance of predators. We suffered losses from bears, coyotes and an occasional mountain lion. Late summer, when coyote pups learn to hunt, was the worst time. They wounded many sheep while learning to kill. Tending wounded sheep was wrenching and most unpleasant because the cuts are hidden under the wool, where they often become infected and maggot infested. But we felt an obligation to care for and protect them.</P><P>     In the late 1970s we adopted an ancient strategy to defend our stock: guard dogs. Long before the invention of guns, steel traps and poison, Europeans trained guard dogs to stay with livestock to protect it from wolves, bears and human raiders. Though hardly perfect, this strategy works quite well. Guard dogs very rarely kill predators, even when two 100-pound dogs confront a 25-pound coyote and her pups. And because our dogs, a Komondor and a Sharplenenitz, are big and white and look much like sheep from a distance, the predators cannot easily know when the dogs are nearby and when they are not. The dogs raise the cost of predation by &quot;arming&quot; the sheep. They make our stock too risky a target for most coyotes, cougars and bears.</P><P>     An armed household is like a herd of sheep protected by guard dogs. A serious human predator, a career criminal, is reticent about striking a residence if its occupants are likely to be armed. However, if a criminal knows that a house is unarmed, the dangers are less and the pickings are easier. It is as if the sheep have no guard dogs.</P><P>     In the short run, we can do little about the presence of guns in our town, neighborhood or city. About the only thing we can do is make sure that our houses contain no weapons. I am not at all sure that people would disarm themselves if they realized that by going unarmed, and letting everyone know it, they were making life easier for criminals. Yet this is exactly what conventional gun control seeks to do. The consequences are clear if my ranch analogy holds.</P><P>     Ask yourself, would I like to have this sign and display it on my house? If you would, let me know; I would be happy to sell you one and donate the proceeds to charity. But if not, perhaps you agree with the economic argument that guns in the hands of honest citizens raise the costs of crime and make crime less likely.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>1995 will be the silver anniversary of Earth Day. This will be a significant event, for it marks a full generation since we formally recognized our environment's fragility and value. To celebrate the anniversary, I suggest that we begin a campaign to buy Siberia. This would be America's Earth Day present to the world. Buying Siberia was suggested by Walter Mead, a researcher who has traveled in the region and noted the vast scale of environmental destruction caused by insensitive development of natural resources.</P><P>       Earth Day celebrations usually blend pantheism and pontification. There is much blame-fixing, but little careful analysis of the causes of environmental problems. On Earth Day, many greens are carried away by their enthusiasm and identify corporate greed and individualism as our problems. If everyone could purge greed from their hearts, become informed, and commune with earth spirits, all might be well.</P><P>     My approach is quite different. I focus on the critical shortage - lack of good institutional arrangements. If we buy Siberia we can replace its existing institutions, legacies of socialism and corruption, with institutions that harmonize environmental responsibility and economic progress. Like Yellowstone Park, the world's first national park, this can be America's environmental gift to the world.</P><P>     Just as the United States bought Alaska from Russia in 1867, so we could buy Siberia in 1995. We know enough to avoid past mistakes. After the U.S. bought Alaska it made the mistakes common throughout the American West; it gave government bureaucracies and perverse laws control over the land. The results are clear. The Forest Service, Park Service, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, and the Mining Law of 1872 fostered abuse of the West's land, water and wildlife.</P><P>     Today, the Forest Service subsidizes destructive logging in the Rocky Mountain states, Park Service mismanagement turns Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks into overgrazed, simplified ecosystems, the Bureau of Reclamation supports dams that lose money and destroy salmon runs, and the Mining Law of 1872 continues the primacy of mining over other values.</P><P>     Siberia resembles the American West of a century ago - a sparsely inhabited, resource-rich frontier. Siberia's 3.5 million-plus square miles are home to fewer than 15 million people and contain enormous reserves of oil, natural gas, gold, diamonds and timber. Siberia also houses environmental treasures such as Lake Baikal, the deepest lake in the world and an ancient ecosystem; diverse taiga forests of cedar, fir, pine and spruce; endangered species like the Siberian tiger, and dozens of free-flowing rivers.</P><P>     Like the American West of the 1800s, Siberia's environment is threatened by reckless economic development. Lake Baikal and the Angara River are dying from pollution, soil erosion is destroying agricultural land, air pollution is poisoning the people, and toxic mining wastes are simply dumped.</P><P>     Russia lacks the technology, expertise and will to protect environmental values. Poverty and hardship encourage extensive logging, mining and drilling with little thought for the long-term consequences. With many resources located in fragile environments, irresponsible development would be disastrous.</P><P>     Recognizing the threat, some environmentalists advocate creating a huge Siberian wilderness area, off-limits to development. Such proposals reflect self-delusion and intellectual naivete. Surging world demand for natural resources and Russians' desire for development make resource development inevitable. The only questions are: at what environmental costs and for whose benefit?</P><P>       Since we could not halt development even if we wanted to, sincere environmentalists have to foster institutions that will ensure ecologically friendly development. Federal management has failed miserably on the public lands of the United States. Responsible management by the nonprofit and for-profit sectors provides the path to responsible greenness. This requires institutions that provide incentives to consider ecology and community as well as economic values.</P><P>     I recommend we create a public, quasi-governmental corporation to purchase Siberia from Russia. The federal government could legitimize the enterprise and perhaps guarantee the bonds used to raise the cash. After an ecological inventory, the corporation would sell some land (with environmental easements and covenants) to companies and private individuals. The rest would be held as a public resource by environmental trusts modeled after the Nature Conservancy, but not managed by politicians or government bureaucrats.</P><P>     Development would be limited in environmentally sensitive areas. There would be no subsidies for economic development or extractive activities. For example, mining rights would not be subsidized as they currently are in the United States by the Mining Law of 1872. Restoration bonds would hold polluters responsible for any environmental damage they cause. This is necessary to constrain industrial emissions and dumps. Development could be prohibited in irreplaceable environmental areas, places like Lake Baikal, an ecological analog to Yellowstone Park.</P><P>     At the same time, environmentally sensitive development efforts would be encouraged, with the developers liable for any damages they cause. This requires clear and enforceable property rights. Finally, land use would be taxed at rates reflecting its actual use, rather than its most financially valuable potential use. This would eliminate the pressures to develop land in order to meet tax obligations.</P><P>     By creating legally enforceable incentives for nongovernmental landowners to responsibly develop Siberian resources we create a situation in which many good things go together: economic progress for local populations, resources for the world, but most important, development with environmental sensitivity. This example could be an Earth Day present for the world.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>HARVARD University Press recently published a book on risk regulation written by Stephen Breyer, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, First Circuit. Breyer argued that &quot;the resources available to combat health risks are not limitless.&quot; He is exactly right. We maximize health and environmental quality by investing our money and efforts where the payoffs are highest.</P><P>       It makes good sense to prioritize environmental protection. Unfortunately, good sense is conspicuously absent in current efforts to ban the use of chlorine. Greenpeace calls for a &quot;chlorine-free society.&quot; Support also comes from other environmental organizations. George Coling of the Sierra Club states &quot;. . . the debate is no longer whether to phase out these chemicals, but how&quot; and Tim Eder, of the National Wildlife Federation notes, &quot;When it comes to (these chemicals) you don't make them, produce them, or dispose of them . . . you just get rid of them!&quot; We should be wary of their claims, for they suggest political opportunism, not sound science.</P><P>     Greenpeace and its allies argue that chlorine and all organochlorines (i.e. compounds containing chlorine) threaten wildlife and people. They see an outright ban as the quickest and most effective way to improve environmental quality. Further, they claim that a &quot;chlorine-free society&quot; is achievable at modest economic cost. None of these claims are accurate.</P><P>     Their first mistake is failing to distinguish among chlorinated compounds. A rigorous toxicology analysis composed by CanTox, a group of consultants in toxicology, health and environmental sciences, convincingly argues that the mere presence of chlorine does not render a compound carcinogenic. Assuming a substance is harmful merely because it contains chlorine is akin to assuming water is flammable simply because it contains hydrogen, a highly flammable element. Different compounds with the same elements often have very different properties.</P><P>     Clearly, certain chlorinated substances, such as PCBs, DDT and dioxin, do harm wildlife at sufficiently high concentrations. However, PCBs and DDT were banned years ago and today dioxin emissions are kept to virtually undetectable levels. The point is this: Regulations should target specific substances whose environmental harm has been clearly demonstrated through rigorous scientific studies. The ad hoc reasoning used by Greenpeace and others is no substitute for careful risk analysis.</P><P>     In addition, it's hard to tell if a chemical &quot;causes harm.&quot; Harm varies with the extent of exposure and disappears entirely below certain threshold doses. In the Great Lakes, bald eagles, double-crested cormorants and other predator bird populations rebounded as DDT and PCBs were phased out and emission regulations reduced dioxin concentrations. Moreover, at the concentrations typically found in our environment, no organochlorines seem to cause identifiable human health problems.</P><P>     Industrial uses aside, it is worth remembering that until chlorination became widespread, dirty water was the most serious public health problem, spreading cholera, typhoid fever and dysentery. Contaminated water supplies still kill 25,000 children a day in the Third World. The substitutes Greenpeace favors are more costly and much less effective at maintaining water purity.</P><P>     Will chlorine substitutes be safer than chlorine? No one can be certain. But, we have an enormous amount of practical experience using and controlling chlorine - experience that does not exist for many substitutes and cannot exist for many innovations. Past experience indicates that new risks will appear once the substitutes are used regularly. Thus, Greenpeace presents us with a false choice - the danger of chlorines or the safety of substitutes. Chlorines are not nearly as dangerous as they portray and substitutes are unlikely to be as safe as they claim.</P><P>     A chlorine ban also implies substantial economic costs. For example, pulp and paper manufacturers often use chlorine to bleach wood pulp to create high quality paper. Switching to chlorine-free processes (i.e. &quot;totally chlorine-free bleaching&quot;), would require extensive reconstruction of many mills at a cost of roughly $9.4 billion. The switch would cost an additional $2.4 billion per year because chlorine-free production is a less effective and less well-known method of manufacturing. The cost across all industries of a chlorine-free society, given current technology, would approach $91 billion annually.</P><P>     The EPA has proposed a regulation that &quot;only&quot; eliminates the use of elemental chlorine in pulp and paper manufacture. Chlorine compounds such as chlorine dioxide (ClO) are permitted. This is the mildest response we could expect from an agency where politics often trumps science.</P><P>     Ultimately, the effort to ban chlorine is not a simple struggle between greedy industries and good, public-spirited environmentalists. Alleged defenders of the public interest reap money and power by advocating and enforcing regulations. If successful, they often divert time, money and personnel from genuine and important environmental risks. This is the social cost of crisis entrepreneurship.</P><P>     Industrial chemicals are produced for beneficial public purposes, not for corporate whim. Although we should insist that these chemicals be managed in an environmentally responsible manner, we should also be vigilant toward those who amplify and exploit public concerns and reap private gains. No one has a monopoly on virtue or knowledge.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>TWICE I've cried in a movie. The first time I was 4 years old and saw Bambi. The second was in 1970, when I saw a tear-provoking &quot;documentary&quot; of a polar bear hunt.</P><P>       The few polar bears I've seen in the wild inspired awe and admiration. But during this film, a faux-sportsman was flown onto an ice flow where he killed, with a long range shot, a she bear. She had two young cubs who presumably would die of starvation and neglect. This was a repulsive act, one contrived to make sensitive people feel embarrassed to be hunters. It worked for me.</P><P>     People who share my interest and concern have no easy way to channel their feelings into effective action. As Adam Smith explained, when its hard to organize people, many worthwhile things aren't done. That's why we use government to protect endangered species - to reduce the difficulties of achieving group goals.</P><P>     But all institutions have imperfections. For-profit firms discount or ignore values lacking market prices. No-profit organizations have serious problems with recruitment and motivation. And when tasks are given to political organizations, decisions are made by political calculus where ecology, economics and equity are trumped by politics.</P><P>     So we have problems dealing with endangered species, especially those without commercial value. Corporations have weak incentives to preserve their habitat. No-profits find it difficult to mobilize support for species lacking romantic appeal. What about government?</P><P>       Don Coursey, a University of Chicago economist, considered endangered species for a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He identified the key issue: &quot;At a practical level of analysis, the country must decide how much to spend on protecting endangered species and how to distribute this amount among each endangered plant and animal.&quot;</P><P>       He went on to study the actual amount and distribution of spending on endangered species.</P><P>     Coursey observed that expenditures are determined by a competitive, complicated political process.</P><P>     Data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showed total state and federal expenditures on 247 endangered species totaled $84,894,000 in 1990. This excludes hidden regulatory costs imposed on people in the private sector.</P><P>     The 20 animals that receive the most attention and money tend to be &quot;charismatic megafauna,&quot; big romantic creatures such as the grizzly bear, woodland caribou, eastern cougar and large birds of prey.</P><P>     In contrast, the bottom 20 are obscure rodents, insects or snails. In a national survey, Coursey found that those animals that are highly rated by the public receive more money - a beauty pageant of endangered species.</P><P>     Professional ecologists and wildlife biologists differ from the general public. They weigh ecosystem balance, interdependencies, and genetic information more heavily and advocate systems that enable every species to exist and adapt.  They want ecological analogs to Noah's Ark.</P><P>     But we can't have it all. Choices will and must be  made. Noah's Ark is on a budget. And when these choices are made in the political arena, it is the public  rather than the scientists' values that drive policy.</P><P>     Popular versus elite preferences is a classic democratic problem. This creates ecological problems when the public's values conflict with the long term health of most species and ecosystems.</P><P>     Even when scientists have their technical facts straight and understand ecological cause and effect, they often exhibit naivete when considering political economy. Many advocate keeping species protection a primarily public enterprise.</P><P>     But as long as it remains with public, political institutions, it is dominated by the general public's  values and superficial understandings. Healthy ecosystems require we shield management from misinformation and ill-informed democratic opinions.</P><P>     Clearly, national and international governments must deal with large scale issues such as atmospheric pollution and migratory wildlife. However, many of the minor ecological treasures neglected by the public, the non-charismatic minifauna, have relatively modest requirements for their preservation.</P><P>     These are best handled by community-based voluntary groups which include scientists. Private sector, not-for-profit organizations can respond to local interests just as museums and schools cater to specialized tastes. Such organizations can avoid the problems created when profits or  political advantages are paramount.</P><P>     Some scientists have a strong antipathy to property rights and the market process. They ignore private sector innovations and cling to the mirage of benevolent, environmentally sensitive federal government.</P><P>       Following the Progressive Era myth of &quot;scientific management&quot; the government will someday empower them as philosopher kings of the ecological domain. Finally, they hope, after a 100 years of trying we may have finally got it right with Jack Ward Thomas running the U.S. Forest Service and Bruce Babbitt (temporarily) our Secretary of Interior.</P><P>     Both experience and theory tell us they are surely wrong. It is no accident that political spending and ecological integrity don't easily mix. In the political calculus, scientific opinion counts less than popular enthusiasm. Non-popular but scientifically well-founded views are more likely to prevail in the voluntary sector. This is where environmentalists should focus their efforts as we seek preservation and sustainable future.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>IT is easy to understand why some people find banning private log exports an attractive idea. Superficially, it appears to save jobs, reduce domestic timber prices and slow environmental degradation caused by logging. But there are good, ethical reasons why a ban makes little sense. In later columns, I will discuss the likely economic and environmental consequences of a ban.</P><P>       Government exists to promote harmony and foster prosperity. These goals are hard to attain if political power is used to strip some people of their property to benefit others. Such actions eventually hurt everyone for they erode the foundations of a free society. When property is taken for legitimate public purposes, owners should be compensated for their losses. This is not to happen if private tree farms are prohibited from selling logs abroad. The prohibition surely feels like plunder to those who may suffer it.</P><P>     Protection from political coercion must remain our paramount concern even if raw log exports cost a significant number of Northwest jobs, a far from certain outcome. Liberals and conservatives who understand the social value of the market process understand this. A productive and cooperative social order requires property rights that are secure from arbitrary seizure or reduction in value. Even if a ban on the export of private timber would save jobs, the process it legitimizes leads to increasing conflict and to ethical erosion in relationships among citizens.</P><P>     Some politicians face strong incentives to prohibit timber owners from selling their logs to foreigners. They seek political gain by playing on people's fears that global commerce means the loss of jobs and security. Politicians flirt with a destructive game when they try to generate campaign contributions and electoral support by favoring one group or person at another's expense. Yet, average citizens remain unaware of the unintended consequences of these actions.</P><P>     Opportunistic behavior, not compassion, explains the export ban. This is no accident. In politics, duplicity accompanies opportunism and honorable behavior is a severe liability. Honorable politicians are like vegetarian coyotes in that they face a great handicap when competing with their red-meat opponents.</P><P>     Although many of us are disgusted with pork-barrel politics, we often reward our representatives with re-election when they secure our pork. Congress loses respect but our representative is well-regarded. It is easy to rationalize socially destructive behavior by someone we know well. People often see their representative as a good person who must compete in an institution where principles are a liability. The institution brings out their worst and causes many to flee national politics.</P><P>     Everyone has good reason to oppose political opportunism. The reason is simple: Politicians who will steal for you will also steal from you. History shows that politicians are rarely bought, but often rented until someone is willing to pay more. This is why it is so important to reward politicians who are true to their principles. (And why so many of us are offended by the hypocrisy of &quot;conservatives&quot; who advocate governmental subsidies for the rich.) When government can arbitrarily constrain property rights and freedom to trade on our own terms, no one is safe. Even if intentions are pure and ends legitimate (e.g., saving jobs), relying on coercion to impose an uncompensated loss is neither ethical nor wise.</P><P>     In economics as in ecology, we can never do just one thing. We cannot predict the mischief that will arise to confound our intentions when we use politics to generate private benefits for one by taking from another, e.g., taking markets from owners of private timber. The more government becomes the granter of special opportunities and special privileges, the more people will seek them from government. And they always come at others' expense.</P><P>     An export ban may preserve jobs in timber processing while destroying those in shipping. It may even harm Northwest mill workers as disinvestment occurs and private timber investment shifts to the Southeast and abroad. More generally, we create an environment in which no one's property, income, or job is safe when we legitimize transferring resources among citizens by stripping or attenuating the property rights of one group to benefit another. We create the Founding Fathers' nightmare: a political economy of plunder.</P><P>     When constitutional protections of individual rights and limits on government power are respected, they serve us admirably. These protections - embodied in the takings, contract and commerce clauses, provisions for impartial trials, and the safeguards in the Bill of Rights and later amendments - are designed to shield us from the predations of government. The U.S. Constitution was designed to foster a political economy of justice with respect for other's possessions. Society becomes less civil and less productive when we stray from this design.</P><P>     The ban on log exports would cause economic and environmental harm. This is important and I'll discuss these problems in my next column. But most of all, the ban violates fundamental ethical principles that underlie our Constitution and our nation. Arbitrarily taking something of value from one group and giving it to another can only undermine liberty and security. The export ban may be good short-term politics but it is pregnant with mischief.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>MANY people share my deep concern with improving and protecting the wildlife, watersheds, and recreation values of forests. Good policy links these goods with sound economic practices. All require landowners' confidence in the future. The proposed export ban on raw logs from private lands subverts this confidence and undermines the management required to reach these goals.</P><P>       Proponents of the export ban claim it will save jobs and prevent foreign exploitation of our timber resources. These claims reflect poor thinking or personal interests promoted at the public's expense, not legitimate economic, ethical or environmental arguments.</P><P>     A ban on private log exports has several important, negative effects. It undermines the value of private stands of trees. A ban reduces the prices bid for raw logs and the timber's value. Private owners fear that future laws or regulations may further reduce the value of their timber. Owners and exporters who suffer a politically induced loss today are wary about the possibility of future losses. Hence an export ban shortens investors' time horizons.</P><P>     Trees take a long time to become harvestable; 50 to 100 years is common. Many of us prefer even older forests for we want forests to produce old-growth values. This is what Jerry Franklin and Jack Ward Thomas' &quot;New Forestry&quot; is about: managing forests to resemble old growth.</P><P>     If someone is to invest money, effort and time growing and preserving trees for a lifetime or longer, they need strong assurances that their timber's value will not be reduced by unexpected government intervention. The value of their land depends on expectations of the future value of their trees.</P><P>     Lower timber values immediately reduce people's incentives to preserve and grow timber. Mere talk of a ban could induce some people to log immediately, just as the possibility of endangered species moving to a landowner's land leads many to destroy suitable habitat. A desire to leave the timber market could encourage the rapid conversion of timberland close to cities to residential or commercial use.</P><P>     Moreover, if owners fear for the future, they plant short-rotation monocultures, trees such as cottonwood and eucalyptus that can be harvested for fiber in 10 years or less. By reducing the time between planting and harvest, they reduce the risk of new, unfavorable laws. A ban thus helps promote monocultures and shorter harvest rotations. Do proponents of an export ban really want this?</P><P>        The incentives an export ban creates for timber owners have significant environmental consequences. The public goods associated with long-rotation forests - complex ecosystems, wildlife habitat, biodiversity and aesthetics - will be reduced. We can also expect increased soil erosion, stream siltation and damaged salmon runs.</P><P>     It is important to remember that the most sensitive and valuable ecosystems - those found in old-growth forests - are largely confined to the national forests and parks. Raw log exports from federal forestland have been banned for 25 years. Most private lands harbor second- and third-growth forests. We want their owners to have the means and incentive to adopt ecologically friendly new forestry. An export ban has the opposite impact.</P><P>     A ban will also induce Japan to import more logs from Third World nations that have less stringent environmental protections than the United States. Increasing the demand for their timber is likely to increase environmental damage abroad. Do environmentalists really wish to increase environmental pressures in places with weak democratic institutions and ineffective environmental protections?</P><P>        The employment impact of an export ban, much like the environmental consequences, is sometimes misunderstood. Raw log exports cost few, if any, U.S. jobs. Instead, they create many high-paying jobs in export-related industries such as ocean shipping and inland rail. In addition, the premium foreign timber consumers pay for raw logs is additional money injected into the U.S. economy. Nor are bans likely to protect mill jobs. For example, the 1979 ban of red cedar exports failed to halt a decline in Washington cedar mills from 337 to 52.</P><P>     Raw log exports also lead to the purchase of forest products such as wooden doors and paneling. Raw logs introduce foreign consumers to the quality of U.S. products. The initial exposure builds contacts and leads to the purchase of our timber products. Commerce Department data reveals that processed products comprise 89 percent of the $17 billion market in U.S. forest products exports.</P><P>     Thus, neither economic theory nor historical experience supports the belief that a ban will preserve U.S. jobs. The Center for International Trade and Forestry's (CINTRAFOR) computer model, backed by 10 years of research, supports this criticism. Congressman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society and others who support the ban base their position on bad economics or expedient politics, not the public interest.</P><P>     A ban on exports has negative economic and environmental consequences. It contains disincentives to long-term forestry, to environmentally valuable habitat preservation, to jobs in the Northwest and elsewhere, and to increasing the sale of finished wood products in foreign markets. But most important, it erodes the ethical foundations of our society and political economy. The ethical problem alone is sufficient reason to strongly oppose the ban.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>THIS is my last column until I return from Montana next autumn.</P><P> While there, I'll continue working on the three E's of environmental policy: ecology, economics and ethics. Only systems that link freedom to act with responsibility for the results of the action work well in dealing with them. Others fail. Linking action with accountability for outcomes is a classic problem of political economy. It plagues efforts to harmonize our environmental and economic interests.</P><P>     All my columns deal with these themes. Next fall, when I return to FREE's Seattle office and the University of Washington, I will again apply economic thinking to pressing environmental and ethical issues. I often think of my columns while bicycling.</P><P>     Seattle and a ranch near Bozeman, Mont., are great places to live. For years, I have wanted to make the spring pilgrimage from Seattle to Bozeman by bicycle. This year my wife Ramona and I joined 110 participants for the first week of Cycle America's annual trip across America.</P><P>     Some bicycle tourists go self-contained. We see these hardy individuals on the road each summer. Their bikes resemble over-loaded pack animals with lumps of clothing, cooking gear, sleeping bags, and tents. Imagine a Porche 911 Carrera towing a U-Haul. These riders proudly identify as self-supported cyclists - others might call them masochists.</P><P>     In contrast, Cycle America provides fully supported tent touring. Trucks transport the extra clothing, sleeping bags and tents, and vans pick up the stragglers. Meals are prepared by people in local communities. The support staff is excellent, cheerful and highly competent. These cycle tourists are neo-Spartan hedonists.</P><P>     In the most luxurious kind of bicycle touring, cyclists carry only sun screen, water and a credit card. They sleep at inns and eat fine food. This Stoic Epicurean cycling is my favorite kind of tour. Each year FREE offers such a &quot;Seminar on Wheels&quot; for special friends. These Bozeman-based tours are &quot;rolling salons&quot; with readings for each day and seminar discussions over dinner. Last year we biked from Yellowstone to Glacier National Park. This year we'll tour the Big Hole Country of Southwest Montana.</P><P>     Linkages between economic and environmental systems are especially clear when cycling. For example, our Cycle America Tour left Bellingham and headed over Rainey and Washington Pass and into Grand Coulee. This area was logged early in the century. We saw large stumps from four to eight feet off the ground. Cyclists asked, &quot;Was logging only in the winter and was stump height determined by snow depth?&quot; No, I explained, the relative value of wood and labor, not snow depth, explains the high stumps of years ago.</P><P>     America had a huge timber inventory. Trees were so plentiful that their value was often negative. Fertile cleared ground was often worth more than land with standing timber.</P><P>     Because trees swell at their base, timber cutters created temporary platforms from which they sawed the trees above the butt swell. This left much high quality wood in the forest, but it saved labor. Our ancestors &quot;wasted&quot; wood to economize on labor.</P><P>     Today the relative values are reversed.</P><P>     We biked past several dozen sawmills filled with second-growth and third-growth logs. Today, some mills utilize tops down to 2 inches in diameter. Twenty-five years ago, some mills would take no top less than 7 inches. But as relative values shift, the market naturally adjusts, responding quickly to changing scarcities.</P><P>     Another adjustment is coming. On the third day of the trip, we arrived at Grand Coulee and Lake Roosevelt. I spoke with Gary Kuiper, recently retired superintendent of Lake Roosevelt National Recreational Area. He had served on parks throughout the United States and loves the Park Service.</P><P>     Throughout his career, he saw politics interfering with sound and sensitive management. He saw no way out of the dilemma between long-term protection and constant short-term political pressures. This political problem is increasingly obvious. It's the natural result of the &quot;scientific management&quot; model of the Progressive Era, a century ago.</P><P>     This approach assumes federal control by experts uncontaminated by self interest or political pressures. However, bureaucratic and political entrepreneurship normally trump scientific understanding, concern for local communities, and property rights. Ecological damage, economic waste, and ethical violations result.</P><P>     As problems grow, concerned citizens seek new answers. People who are intellectually and ethically responsible don't expect different results from the same institutions. They want institutional change. To be successful, new approaches must replace political management. I suggest that we adopt a variety of alternative institutional arrangements. These should be modest and careful experiments that rely on various mixes of nonprofit and for-profit organizations, not federal bureaucracies. The feds will monitor, not manage.</P><P>     We've had a hundred years experience with sylvan socialism and we know a lot about what doesn't work. This summer I'll explore new approaches to these problems with academic and business leaders, federal judges, journalists and environmental writers, and some Montana fun-hog cyclists. I look forward to sharing the results with you during the next academic year.</P><IMG SRC="/free/Images/biker.gif" WIDTH=341 WIDTH=249><IMG SRC="/free/Images/van.gif" WIDTH=212 HEIGHT=176><P>__________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P> EACH summer I'm reminded why John Steinbeck thought that Montana would be heaven if it only had an ocean. This summer, the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) again hosted conferences for federal judges, seminars for environmental writers, bike trips, and research on environmental economics and policy.</P><P>       But I see changes in Montana. One is congestion and the new rich who've discovered the &quot;last best place.&quot; Also, new bureaucratic pathologies have arrived. A dramatic example is the Idaho Pole Superfund site in north Bozeman. Though many cities have Superfund sites - Denver and Salt Lake have three, Seattle has four - they are ripples in the economic ocean of a big city. In Bozeman, they are tidal waves.</P><P>     Professor Richard Stroup, my former colleague, and Sandra Goodman recently published a report on Superfund, EPA's effort to clean up toxic waste (&quot;Rights vs. Regulation; How to Reform Superfund&quot;). Their report includes a description of Bozeman's Idaho Pole facility and indicates that Idaho Pole exemplifies many Superfund sites where health risks are overstated and bureaucratic power enhanced. This is not an accident, for the EPA has strong incentives to push caution to dangerous levels.</P><P>     Twenty-five years ago, I worked in the woods and helped send some of the best and largest lodgepole pines to Idaho Pole. They treated these logs with chemicals to make long lasting wooden utility poles. At some point, a chemical used to treat these poles, pentachlorophenol (PCP), was spilled, leaving what the EPA says are potentially harmful concentrations. The EPA has tried to convince the public that the Idaho Pole site is a threat to the community.</P><P>     But the EPA is probably wrong. EPA calculations of the future risks posed by the Idaho Pole site, as at many other Superfund sites, rely upon shaky assumptions. The EPA assumed that Idaho Pole's property would become a residential trailer park within two years - even though Idaho Pole is profitable - and that residents would drill wells for drinking water even though Bozeman's municipal water supply is already there. The EPA also ignored information from its own Office of Toxic Substances indicating that the concentration of PCP in water decreases by half every 20 to 200 days. Risks that may exist will diminish significantly over time.</P><P>     Stroup and Goodman see further problems with the EPA's risk assessments. In identifying Superfund sites, the EPA consistently assumes unlikely, risk-enhancing situations and ignores mitigating factors in their Superfund decisions. Such methodological errors undermine the agency's judgment and make the usefulness of its National Priorities List highly suspect. Yet the Superfund law severely limits the accused polluter's right to review EPA claims in court.</P><P>     Stroup and Goodman do not discuss, but I find more disturbing, Superfund's apparent violations of the spirit of our constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws - laws that make past actions illegal and punishable. It forces firms to finance cleanups of perfectly legitimate activities when no actual harm has been demonstrated.</P><P>     If people were engaged in legal, productive activities and we later decide that cleanup is necessary, we the public should pay. It is not just or equitable to impose cleanup costs on someone whose responsibility is tangential and trivial. But with Superfund's joint and several liability, any involvement can lead to complete responsibility as EPA searches for deep pockets.</P><P>     To a political economist, these problems are predictable consequences of the EPA's incentives. The EPA is blamed when toxic waste harms people directly, but rarely criticized if its regulations harm people in hidden ways. For example, if a highly carcinogenic chemical leached into groundwater, and the EPA failed to act, there would be severe repercussions in Congress.</P><P>     The EPA takes this logic to the extreme, concocts its farfetched &quot;reasonable maximum exposures&quot; and uses them to guide action. Concurrently, the agency discounts the consequences of its cleanup mandates: disruption of local communities and increasing exposure to a chemical by site disturbance. The incentives are to overstate the risks of toxic waste and to discount the human and financial costs of cleaning up.</P><P>     Improving Superfund's environmental performance and reducing its ethical and economic costs requires fundamental reform. First, the EPA's farfetched risk assessments should be replaced by more sober science. Second, people should only be liable for past actions if real harms were wrongly imposed on other people. Even then, they should pay in rough proportion to their responsibility. And third, we should remove the near prohibition on accused polluters having their day in court to challenge EPA directives.</P><P>     Toxic chemicals are not romantic. They lack the appeal of parks or forests. But their lesson is applicable throughout environmental policy: Well-intended government programs often go awry. Successful environmental reform must heed the ecological insight that many actions have unintended consequences. It applies to political economy as well as biology. I explore this theme in future columns.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>LAST week, the Mont Pelerin Society met in Cannes, France, to celebrate the work of its founder, Nobel Prize winning economist Friedrich Hayek.</P><P>       The Mont Pelerin Society is the world's foremost group of classical liberal academic, business and governmental leaders.</P><P>     Six of its 500 members, including Milton Friedman, Gary Becker and George Stigler, a Seattle native, have received Nobel Prizes in economics. This year's keynote address was given by Vaclav Klaus, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic.</P><P>     The Mont Pelerin Society was formed in 1947 by people who feared that communist, fascist and socialist regimes would dominate the world.</P><P>     They were prescient in anticipating the crisis of the socialist enterprise, discussed in Professor Daniel Chirot's book &quot;The Crisis of Leninism: The Decline of the Left and the Revolutions of 1989.&quot; They sought to reassert the values of liberty, private property and toleration of people of diverse religious, ethnic and racial backgrounds.</P><P>     Today's members are ahead of the curve in understanding the ethical and economic problems inherent in America's pervasive bureaucratization and regulation of private affairs. Their perspective can help us develop environmental reforms that are both sensitive and practical.</P><P>     I believe that Hayek's classic 1945 article from the American Economic Review, &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; is the best introduction to economics ever written.</P><P>     Hayek shows us how economies are like ecosystems. They are interdependent, complex, and must constantly adjust. When we read this article, we can better understand why there are such huge conflicts between bureaucracies, which drive toward uniformity, and ecosystems, where knowledge of local circumstances is critically important.</P><P>     Planning fails because the information needed to create products and coordinate human activity is widely scattered. Central planners, like everyone else, can obtain only a tiny fraction of this knowledge, and are thereby precluded from serving people's economic desires and fostering innovation.</P><P>     Hayek's simple, yet tremendously powerful and far-reaching insight has grown in importance over time. Economies, like ecosystems, cannot be designed. No one can run them. Both evolve and prosper to the extent that their inhabitants remain in sync with the laws of nature.</P><P>     A capitalist ecosystem is populated by organizations and industries rather than organisms and species.</P><P>     Economic life evolves by technological innovation and market competition much as biological life evolves by genetic mutation and natural selection. Both involve intricate webs of innumerable participants, each pursuing his own interests, but linked into a whole greater than the sum of the parts.</P><P>     Hayek's legacy is powerful because his insights are timeless; they speak to all ages and cultures. But equally important, they have been vindicated by experience. As he warned in &quot;The Road to Serfdom,&quot; socialism has failed everywhere it was tried at the national level, creating police state nightmares from Utopian dreams and economic chaos from &quot;rational planning.&quot;</P><P>       One of socialism's many victims was environmental quality. Throughout the former U.S.S.R. the legacy of bureaucracies' single-minded focus on industrialization and production is starkly evident.</P><P>     For example, at Russia's Magnitogorsk, site of the world's biggest steel complex, 90 percent of the children born in the city suffered from pollution-related illnesses. Feshbach and Friendly, authors of &quot;Ecocide in the U.S.S.R.,&quot; state that in 1992, &quot;there are no major industrial cities in the Soviet Union where air pollution is not shortening the life expectancy of adults and undermining the health of their children.&quot;</P><P>       Aside from a few professors insulated from reality, Americans realize that communism and socialism are corrupting and economically bankrupt systems. Less clear, but just as pernicious, are the consequences of our experiments in sylvan socialism, begun with the creation of the U.S. Forest Service in 1897.</P><P>     The Forest Service was the prototype for much of environmental management. Our most recent major creation, the EPA, relies on the same assumptions with tragic consequences. For example, a joint EPA-Amoco Corporation study of Amoco's Yorktown refinery found that EPA-mandated pollution controls were three times more costly than necessary. By making environmental protection more expensive, the EPA reduces the amount of protection people demand and can afford.</P><P>     As we prepare to celebrate the centennial of the Forest Service, it is incumbent on us to consider the deficiencies of the socialist model. Hayek contributes to our understanding. By following his principles we can create policies that harmonize ecological and economic values.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>IS economics an enemy of ecology? Many environmentalists seem to think so. They portray economists as insensitive number crunchers with Republican leanings, people stricken by a ghoulish preference for money over ecological integrity. The perceived focus of economics - money, business and mathematics - is distasteful to people motivated by environmental concerns.</P><P>       But greens' conventional wisdom is wrong. Economic analysis can be environmentalism's best tool. By considering how economics can further environmental objectives, we may be able to alleviate greens' allergy to economics.</P><P>     Since most resources are scarce, we lose opportunities if we fail to minimize waste. Tumbleweeds in Arizona, spotted knapweed in Montana and bureaucrats in the Department of Agriculture are so overabundant that they are &quot;bads&quot; - not goods. Items we value should be treated as though they are scarce.</P><P>     When environmental policies waste talent, time or material, the price of environmental protection is higher than necessary. The economist's &quot;first law of demand,&quot; a social analog to the law of gravity, states that as the price of a good rises, demand falls. Making environmental quality needlessly expensive subverts environmental goals because the expense lowers people's demand for environmental protection. Americans' growing opposition to needlessly expensive Superfund sites is just one example.</P><P>     To make the most of limited environmental dollars and to achieve real improvements in pollution control, watershed protection and other important goals, we should first address those problems where the payoffs are greatest per dollar invested. This requires risk-benefit analysis, a method of comparing values (lives, endangered species) that can be saved by investing resources on different problems. Not all activities generate equal benefits. Since we can't do everything, risk-benefit analysis helps us choose among our options.</P><P>     Greens have shown a curious reluctance to accept risk analysis. Some groups have included it in the &quot;unholy trinity&quot; of principles they oppose in environmental legislation.</P><P>     But, in terms of achieving green values, environmentalists are misguided when they reject risk analysis. Eliminating some very expensive regulations would save lives or improve health if we thereby free up resources enabling people to achieve less-onerous environmental objectives. Eliminating extremely costly regulations also increases incomes, saving roughly one life for every $7.5 million added to our economy. Richer really is safer and cleaner.</P><P>     Risk analysis is one way to get more for our environmental efforts. Another is minimizing government micromanagement. When government agencies try to specify how people are to reach environmental objectives, waste and ineffective policies are the predictable result.</P><P>     Consider the case of the Amoco Corporation's Yorktown, Va., oil refinery. Amoco and the EPA conducted a two-year joint study into how chemical emissions from the Yorktown plant were addressed by existing regulations. They found that EPA regulations required pollution controls that ignored major sources of pollution and were roughly $30 million more expensive than the more-effective approaches uncovered by the study. Amoco's costs were nearly four times greater than needed to achieve regulatory goals, $41 million versus $11 million. Nevertheless, existing regulations disallow the more-efficient strategies.</P><P>     The Yorktown case illustrates problems endemic to national environmental regulations. Sweeping, undifferentiated regulations are necessarily inflexible, excessively costly, and do little to control pollution. They make few allowances for local situations. Like the Forest Service, BLM and other large centralized bureaucracies, the EPA's regulations are at odds with the ecology of particular places.</P><P>     Thoughtful risk analysis and the end of regulatory micromanagement can yield better and less-expensive environmental protection.</P><P>     Some environmental organizations, such as Defenders of Wildlife and the Environmental Defense Fund, are pursuing principled, innovative and constructive policies. However, the leaders of other organizations, including Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council, see a niche in crisis entrepreneurship. They use shoddy science and biased media coverage to exaggerate (as with chlorine) or fabricate (as with Alar) environmental dangers. These efforts pressure government officials to adopt wasteful policies.</P><P>     By exaggerating environmental dangers, and posturing as the great green hope with full-page ads in The New York Times, crisis entrepreneurs seduce members and donations. Their budgets, professional status and political influence may increase in the short run. But environmental protection is lost and ethical standards are eroded. Ultimately, the credibility of the environmental movement is reduced.</P><P>     Economics does not offer a cure-all. Environmental quality implies real changes and real costs. But economics helps us better use our scarce efforts to craft effective policies. It exposes those seeking to use the public's interest in environmental protection for private ends. This is why some fear the use of environmental economics.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>&quot;THE Tragedy of the Commons&quot; appeared in Science magazine in 1968.</P><P> Though written by an ecologist, Garret Hardin, the article is a classic of political economy.</P><P>     Understanding the logic of this article should be a requirement of running for political office. It explains how and why we should expect waste when biological resources such as fisheries are openly available.</P><P>     The logic of the commons is straightforward. When no one has control over a resource, be it a parcel of ocean or a dormitory lounge, it tends to be poorly maintained, overused, or depleted. Without social or legal constraints, some people will maximize their personal advantages to the detriment of others. All users suffer, while benefits go to the exploiting individual. The incentive is for people to seek narrow personal advantages at the expense of the group and the resource. Few people act as wise stewards because others take a &quot;free ride&quot; on such actions, and rarely reciprocate.</P><P>     The North Pacific groundfish fishery within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone off Alaska exemplifies a commons problem. Under the current open-access regime, there are only indirect controls on fishing. Short seasons and restrictions on fishing boats' size and horsepower are examples. These controls are extremely inefficient, have resulted in billions of dollars in excessive capital investment, and encourage chaotic races for fish that magnify the dangers of an already risky job.</P><P>     Experience suggests the problem may get worse under the current open-access system. Human, ecological and financial losses are likely to increase as the race for the fish becomes more frenzied. Brief, hurried seasons will increase pressure on fish populations and promote bycatch - the incidental capture of non-target species. Fortunately, unlike many of the world's fisheries, the basic stock remains healthy for now.</P><P>     A smart, honest and principled political leader could create huge safety, economic and ecological benefits by seriously addressing our fishery commons. Action need not be difficult, for we already have a solution. It is individual transferable quotas (ITQs) - a method of creating secure, transferable and reasonably well-defined property rights to fish. Here's how they work.</P><P>     First, peer reviewed research establishes the biologically sustainable yield of a fishery: how many fish can be taken without reducing the quantity or quality of the catch over time. Because these are estimates, not certainties, the allowable catch is always less than the theoretical maximum. Based on this estimated yield, a set of quotas is issued. Each entitles its holder to a fixed percentage of the total allowable catch.</P><P>     The initial distribution of rights has wealth implications. That's why parceling out quotas is the contentious feature of ITQ systems. Assigning quotas is one of the main factors delaying action by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, the body overseeing the region's fisheries. The two principal alternatives for distributing quotas are a giveaway to existing fishermen, or an auction, perhaps one open to the public.</P><P>     With an ITQ system, quota holders have secure claims to a percentage of the total allowable catch. Only those with quotas may fish. Fishermen need not race to get their share. An extended fishing season means fewer days at sea for long hours or in dangerous weather. We'd also expect reductions in bycatch.</P><P>     Quotas give their owners incentives to conserve fish. As long as fisheries remain a commons, there are strong incentives to catch as many fish as quickly as possible. With ITQs, fishermen can increase the value of their quota and the size of their future catch, by allowing fish populations to increase. Such behavior has already been observed in the wreckfish, Southern bluefin tuna and various shellfish fisheries.</P><P>     With ownership, quotas can be bought and sold. Some fishermen will exit the industry. The more efficient fishermen and those who love fishing will buy or retain quotas and remain. Fewer ships and less equipment will be needed to catch a given amount of fish, reducing overhead and improving efficiency. And ITQs do not necessarily favor large operations over smaller ones.</P><P>     An increasing number of professional environmentalists, including well-respected economists with the Environmental Defense Fund, are showing an interest in ITQs. ITQs have the support of associations representing more than 80 percent of the seafood harvested in the North Pacific fisheries. They are the least painful way to downsize an industry made dangerous by short seasons and by federal subsidies that have promoted excessive investments in men, ships and equipment.</P><P>     The North Pacific Fishery Management Council has, overall, resisted consideration of ITQs, although its own staff concluded such a system would solve many of the industry's problems.</P><P>     Political entrepreneurs such as Greenpeace and the Alliance Against IFQs (IFQs being roughly similar to ITQs) have opposed ITQs because they fear the impact of such quotas on their private interests. Though we may sympathize with their concerns, political leadership is required to overcome their opposition to a valuable improvement in fishery management. Without it, more lives will be lost and politically sanctioned ecological plunder will continue. </P><P> _________</P><P>  John A.

Baden</P><P>IN addition to their disappointment with the elections, major environmental groups are learning the pain of limits to growth.</P><P>       From 1990 to 1993, membership fell 33 percent for Greenpeace and 35 percent for the Wilderness Society. The Sierra Club has lost 130,000 members and has accumulated deficits of nearly $3 million. Although groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the folks who brought us the Alar hoax, have held even, overall memberships peaked in 1990 and have been falling ever since. Only the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that values entrepreneurship and stresses incentives, has gained a substantial number of members.</P><P>     What explains these dramatic losses? Why are people electing to invest less time and money in the traditional green groups? As with most interesting economic changes, several forces are at work.</P><P>     First, with Clinton in the White House, Gore at the Naval Observatory, Babbitt in Interior, and ecologist Jack Ward Thomas as titular head of the Forest Service, some environmentalists believe that our environment is in good hands. They think they can relax their vigilance, secure in the belief that the people from the Potomac will manage our natural resources with prudence and sensitivity. With the environment covered by jolly green giants, concerned greens can direct their efforts to other causes.</P><P>     Today's situation is similar to that faced when Jimmy Carter was in office. The &quot;good guys&quot; were in Washington and green groups' memberships and money declined. Some believe God sent Jim Watt, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Interior, to save the environmental movement. Watt personified evil and exploitation, making it easy to recruit crusaders to battle him.</P><P>     Second, the upper middle class and the wealthy provide most of the financial support for environmental groups. At the same time, Americans in the top 5 percent of the income distribution pay 43 percent of all personal income taxes. This is a terribly big hit. With government taking an ever bigger first bite, charities are bound to suffer. If the top 5 percent were paying 25 percent rather than 43 percent, contributions to all charities, the arts, churches, hospitals and schools, would increase dramatically. When government takes more there is simply less for worthy causes.</P><P>     The third reason is by far the most complex. It involves culture and political evolution as well as economics. However, the short version is easily stated: Professional environmentalists have been found out.</P><P>     For 25 years, the professional environmental groups have postured as selfless defenders of the public interest. The myth is that these underpaid servants of ecological integrity fight the public's battles against big business. Armed mainly with truth, virtue and purity, they fight the good fight though heavily outgunned. Clearly, all well-intentioned people would support such champions. But after a generation of success, the environmental organizations grew fat and rich. Their myth is losing its luster. Increasingly, people believe that under the costume of virtue lies sleaze and flab.</P><P>     Jim Watt actually hurt the environmental groups because he cost them their purity. Before Watt, most of us who joined were active in the outdoors. Although there was overlap, Audubon was for bird watchers, Sierra Club was for climbers, the Wilderness Society was for backpackers, and so forth. We were lifestyle members; our environmentalism was integrated with our living.</P><P>     Watt so offended those sensitive to environmental values that previously uninvolved people stampeded to the environmental movement. The organized groups became trapped by their gains. As David Foreman, a founder of Earth First! told me, Sierra stressed Club more than rocks and Wilderness emphasized Society more than trees. For most of the new members, environmentalism was a cause rather than a lifestyle, and today most causes have short lives. Stable members became ephemeral. Homelessness, world hunger, reproductive rights and other causes offered competing opportunities for well-intentioned people to demonstrate their good intentions by writing letters and sending checks.</P><P>     With every good cause competing, the leaders of green groups emphasized marketing. They became salesmen, their product was their cause. A premium was placed on exaggerating or fabricating environmental crises to galvanize members and attract new recruits. But there's a tension between maintaining integrity and making the sale.</P><P>     Incentives to make environmental problems big, dramatic and scary led to half-truths or outright lies about the actual risks of many alleged environmental crises. Alar, toxic waste, ivory, global warming, and other issues were often distorted by green groups as they tried to maintain their membership and budgets.</P><P>     Time has exposed environmentalists as just another special interest. Every dollar spent on a cause defined in New York and D.C. offices is a dollar less for local problems people can see and feel. The obvious failures of legislation such as Superfund and the problems with the Endangered Species Act caution people to be skeptical of dire warnings from Manhattan and the Beltway.</P><P>     Just as political corruption and deception have fueled a voter backlash, so deception by green groups has real consequences. A new environmentalism that recognizes the importance of property rights, entrepreneurship and incentives must emerge if we are to preserve environmental quality and ethical integrity.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>HOW HAS Forbes magazine, the self-described capitalist tool, become a green advocate? The influential people at Forbes see markets as the most ethical and efficient means to coordinate much of society.</P><P>       In contrast, political management implies economic inefficiencies and ecological destruction. These are logical consequences of political incentives.</P><P>     A recent Forbes feature by Ellie Winninghoff explains how government subsidies promote environmental harm. Here is a sordid story of socialism for the wealthy and duplicity by politicians whose opportunism trumps their environmentalism.</P><P>     Three-fourths of the Pacific Northwest's electricity comes from hydroelectric dams. Many of these, including Bonneville and Grand Coulee, were financed by the taxpayers through the Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers.</P><P>     Once built, the feds subsidized electricity, making power here far cheaper than in other regions of the country. Nearly $1 billion in annual subsidies keep Washington's power prices at about 3 cents per kilowatt hour. Industrial consumers such as Alcoa, Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical, and Reynolds Metals pay even less.</P><P>     But insulating households and businesses from the real costs of power production has negative consequences. In addition to lost revenue, these costs include diminished salmon runs, lost wild rivers, wasteful irrigation and  additional coal-fired power elsewhere. These dams, along the Columbia and Snake, strangle formerly rich salmon runs. Salmon populations are only 15-25 percent of their 19th century levels. Some runs are gone.</P><P>     Here's how dams effect salmon. When hatchlings move from the upriver spawning beds to the Pacific, the slack, warm waters of reservoirs and the blades of hydroelectric turbines take a high toll. Mortality runs about 15 percent per dam. When mature salmon swim from the Pacific to the inland Northwest, the big dams again pose a formidable obstacle. Even with fish ladders, upstream travel has a mortality of 5-13 percent per dam.</P><P>     With 14 major dams on the main stem of the Columbia, and 10 on the Snake River, mortality quickly mounts. The Grand Coulee and Hells Canyon dams completely block salmon from the upper stretches of these rivers. Transporting hatchlings around dams and using hatchery fish has sorry results; hatchery fish are weaker and more disease prone than wild salmon. Thus, in spite of expensive efforts, the runs are dying. Ecological health declines, outdoor recreation suffers, and a perpetually renewable resource is lost.</P><P>     In the Northwest the price of electricity is less than its cost. With rates kept at 3 cents per kilowatt, Northwest consumers use 60 percent more electricity than average Americans. This compares to New York's 10.2 cents, Califomia's 9.7 cents, and Florida's 7 cents. In an age when power can be wheeled around the country, this implies huge unnecessary economic and environmental waste.</P><P>     Insulated from the information and incentives communicated by prices, people don't respond to changing values and ecological conditions. Continued high consumption, not conservation, of electricity is encouraged by subsidized power. And greater use of electricity favors running turbines to maximize production with continuing damage to remaining salmon runs.</P><P>     This story of dams and salmon illustrates a principle of political economy. Once subsidies are created, they persist. People view them as entitlements. Major electricity users, especially aluminum companies, invest in politics to keep power subsidies. Our representatives and senators seldom act in a principled way if that raises voters' electric bills to fair market rates.</P><P>     Dams generate not only power but also opportunistic politicians. For example, in 1982, then-representative Al Gore of Tennessee invited William Niskanen, an economist nationally respected for both his intelligence and integrity, to his office. Gore asked for a casual, informal meeting to discuss Niskanen's planned research into the pricing policy of federal power agencies. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was important to Gore, and so he organized a manipulative ploy to protect his constituents' pork - cheap TVA power.  Niskanen arrived to find not the promised casual conversation, but rather TV cameras and other congressmen. Gore staged the meeting as a Star Chamber interrogation for the consumption of home districts.</P><P>     Gore's showmanship paid off. Oregon's Mike Hatfield, a Republican, passed the &quot;Niskanen Amendment.&quot; This act prohibited government officials from studying how market pricing could improve federal power pricing. The subsidies remained unexamined and unchallenged by those best positioned to do so.</P><P>     This tale of political privileges and opportunism does not imply that markets are perfect. Market prices will poorly reflect the value of salmon or of free flowing rivers. But market-driven power production and allocation won't subsidize environmental harm as federal hydropower has done for five decades.  With vested interests behind each dam, the feds radically increased stakes in subsidies. Adjustments are difficult, salmon suffer, and ethics erode.</P><P>     The problems which flow from federal power subsidies exemplify the complementary interests of groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and National Taxpayers Union. Greens, fiscal conservatives, and supporters of reduced government all favor the elimination of power subsidies.</P><P>     The question is, will the new political leaders realize the potential to harmonize economics, ecology, ethics, and growing demands for limited government?</P><P>       While we hope they will act in a principled manner, we should not confuse our hopes with our expectations. Yet, as Al Gore said on page 236 of his book, Earth in the Balance, &quot;a pattern of dysfunctionality need not persist indefinitely, and the key to change is the harsh light of truth.&quot; And when dams break, the truth may flood out.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>WHAT is a hero? In literary epics such as &quot;Gilgamesh,&quot; the &quot;Illiad,&quot; or &quot;Beowulf,&quot; heroes are those who defy pain and death to live out a personal code of unqualified honor. In economists' parlance, heroes risk significant personal costs to help others. Heroism continues today, though it is, as always, in short supply.</P><P>       The familiar hero jumps into an icy river to save a drowning child. Such isolated, impulsive acts are dramatic and admirable, but are not the most important kind of heroism. The more important involves standing against the tide of opinion to do what is right. Such people may resist the power of an abusive government or cultural norms that harm the less fortunate or the environment. Two heroes in this tradition are Arthur Temple and Harry Teasley.</P><P>     Arthur Temple Jr. was born in l920, and for 26 years ran the Temple family's extensive timber empire in east Texas. In l973, he merged Temple Industries with the much larger and highly diversified Time Inc., becoming a major shareholder in Time. Arthur Temple was an entrepreneur who transformed Temple Industries into a major forest products company.</P><P>     But Temple's heroism is only tangentially related to his business success. For many years, Temple's formative years, rural people in southeast Texas attached little importance to environmental values. Since wildlife habitat had no immediate dollar value, it was ignored by the east Texas forest industry. Forest-dependent wildlife were open-access, common-pool resources. With no one to protect them, entire species were decimated by poor forestry and poaching.</P><P>     Temple stood against these pressures for years to enforce stewardship on his lands. His conservation efforts affronted the dominant culture. Arson and threats of violence were commonplace. But Temple persisted and today Temple Inland remains a national leader in supporting and applying wildlife research.</P><P>     Temple is also a civil-rights hero. Six years before &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; he led the integration of schools in his company's town of Diboll, Texas. In the mid-1960s, a group of civil-rights activists was traveling through the South, going into segregated restaurants and staging sit-ins if they were refused service. Temple Industries had built a cafe in Diboll, the Pine Bough, to provide company visitors and residents with a quality restaurant.</P><P>     The manager called Arthur Temple, then company president, saying these activists would soon test the Pine Bough - what should he do? &quot;Serve 'em&quot; replied Temple. Then, realizing this might be difficult for the manager, Temple said he could work the cash register and his wife could wait tables. Temple led by example to overcome the prejudices of his time. With such leadership, the regular staff handled the situation.</P><P>     Our other hero is Harry E. Teasley Jr., CEO of the Coca-Cola Nestle joint enterprise headquartered in Tampa, Fla. Teasley vigorously opposed the construction of a taxpayer-subsidized hotel intended to boost business for Tampa's money-losing, city-owned convention center.</P><P>     Teasley had a principled opposition to this misadventure in civic socialism. He spent $15,000 of his own money on a public opinion survey. The survey, done by a professional polling firm, showed 90 percent of Tampa's voters wanted a referendum on the hotel's bonds. Two-thirds of registered voters opposed publicly subsidized funding. Teasley then purchased an ad in the Tampa Tribune Times explaining the economic and ethical problems with the hotel. Teasley had no financial interest in the hotel or convention business. He was simply a public-spirited citizen with the means, the character, and the intelligence to promote good public policy.</P><P>     Like Arthur Temple, Harry Teasley took the hero's stance. In doing so, he demonstrates the difference between being pro-business and pro-free market. There was strong business support for the hotel - the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce and Tampa Downtown Partnership urged the City Council's support. Before Teasley, there was only weak opposition because people of substance wouldn't take a public position.</P><P>     Like Dr. Stockman in Henrik Ibsen's &quot;Enemy of the People,&quot; Teasley stood up and told the truth. Defying the business community, he kept standing and telling the truth. Unlike Dr. Stockman, Teasley won.</P><P>     Teasley offered a pro-free market position with strong theoretical and ethical legitimacy: Government should not subsidize services that are provided by the market. Since wealth and political power go together, such subsidies become socialism for the well-off. Tampa's convention center was an economic loser, and the hotel could not rescue it. As Ludwig von Mises noted: &quot;Government intervention always breeds economic dislocations that necessitate more Government intervention.&quot;</P><P>       Heroes such as Arthur Temple and Harry Teasley are important to all societies; their behavior exemplifies values we want people to emulate. They defy prevailing opinion, be it racial prejudice, faith in socialism, or poaching. Heroes are role models who make it easier for the less-courageous to act justly. At a time when there is widespread cynicism toward those active in public affairs, we should recognize and honor our heroes. We are going to need more of them.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>THE University of Washington has just suffered a $12 million budget cut. Political pressures within the university are to spread the pain by giving each college and program a proportional cut. With each unit suffering, say, a 2.4 percent reduction, no one has a strong incentive to mobilize to protect their special, provincial interest.</P><P>       Such caving-in minimizes short-run pain but gradually erodes quality. To avoid this erosion, hard choices must be made. It would be ethically and intellectually irresponsible to pretend these choices away and wait for better times, perhaps after the next president is appointed. While there's no unambiguously happy ending, at least we'll have a better reading of people's character as the process unfolds.</P><P>     Our budgetary shortfall is neither transitory nor local. Universities' golden age has passed, but our expectations lag reality. As David Goodstein, vice provost at Caltech noted, universities are on the threshold of &quot;the permanent era of constraint.&quot; Federal and state governments are reducing aid. They have tight budgets and electorates resist further tax increases. After years of tuition growth, some falling enrollments, and the expenses of increasing diversity, many schools cannot maintain current budgets of existing programs. This is most evident in California but these pressures are nationwide.</P><P>     Like other large complex organizations, units within universities are often run with an eye toward the benefits of those in them, not only for their stated purpose. When tough decisions are being made, we should expect the affected faculty and administrators to carefully weigh the expected impact of those decisions on their own well-being. These considerations of self interest often trump both the social value of their programs and the interests of students in general. Given human nature, it will not be otherwise.</P><P>     Hence, when universities face cutbacks, an adverse selection process goes to work. And here's the unhappy result: Those with the sorriest prospects on the outside (or at other universities) have the greatest incentive to keep their present positions. University politics often get especially nasty as projected losers attempt to discredit the university's leadership. An important principle of political economy becomes evident - last guys don't finish nice.</P><P>     A Ph.D. does not grant immunity from the labor market. Unless protected from market forces, by tenure for example, professors are usually paid an amount roughly equal to their value outside. This is why the salaries in medical schools are substantially higher than those in medieval studies, higher in computer science than in classics, higher in economics than in ecology. Some are paid less than their social contribution, and many find this unfair, but this is how the world works.</P><P>     It doesn't require training in economics to understand this process. Those with poor options elsewhere will fight the hardest to maintain their positions. They argue that the pain should be shared equally and programs spared. They find many arguments why their program should be saved and they mobilize pressures to retain their existing budget share. Given the stakes, it would be naive to expect any other behavior.</P><P>     But not all resistance is self-serving. We face the classic elements of tragedy when legitimate values collide and people face competing, inconsistent obligations. Some people in programs slated for elimination are no doubt highly dedicated and competent. Most will sincerely believe that their program is more valuable to the university stakeholders than some others being retained. And in these terribly important cases, there is no clear and objective standard of evaluation.</P><P>     This is not an easy time to be the president of a great university. Cuts cannot be avoided. Because of rigidities and scale requirements, the responsible decision is to cut marginal programs out entirely. The pressures are to share the pain and keep all alive but on short rations. The universities that remain in the top tier will focus their resources on the high-quality programs. The president has the responsibility to take the grand view and maximize quality.</P><P>     Only in Lake Wobegon are all departments and programs above average. Every large first-rate university has some second- or third-rate departments, schools and programs. When crunch time comes, they should go. This is the most intellectually and ethically responsible policy. Good leaders of great universities must select by quality and contribution to excellence. Since we can't have everything, we should resist political pressures and keep the best and most valuable. It requires great character, intelligence and judgment to do this. The demonstration of such qualities is the positive feature of the classic tragedies.</P><P>     William Gerberding, president of UW, was courageous when he announced a cut of faculty and departments. For the long-run future of a great university, Gerberding made the right decision. The question is, will he be able to implement it?</P><P>       When a drought hits and feed gets short, the rancher can choose from two strategies: put all stock on short rations, or as my grandfather would say, &quot;It's time to put wheels under the poor cows and take them to market.&quot; He knew that herd quality would suffer if we didn't cull now. University presidents face the same reality.</P><P>_____________</P><P>  John A.

Baden</P><P>I'M home at the ranch for the holidays, recalling Christmas traditions.</P><P>      Both my family and my wife feed our animals special rations on Christmas morning. My grandmother would bake oatmeal biscuits with lots of meat trimmings for their dog and a warm corn mash for her chickens. Granddad would give the cows and sheep leafy, second-cutting clover and the horses extra oats, even though they wouldn't work that day. My wife, Ramona, and her father would take a toboggan-load of hay to the old buffalo bulls on the Targhee National Forest.</P><P>     The ewes on our Montana ranch, bred to lamb in March, were on maintenance rations: 7 bales of hay for each 100 ewes. As they became heavy with lambs, we fed more and more of ever more nutritious feed. Yet, on Christmas, we'd give them a treat and a preview of good food to come: second-cutting alfalfa and some soybean cake.</P><P>     In financial terms this made no sense, but the sheep loved it and we felt warm. We depended on our animals and they on us. Each Christmas we'd give them more than good husbandry.</P><P>     Urban people can't easily celebrate Christmas by pampering livestock. However, they can still do a good deed for animals, predators and, later, those lower on the food chain, by restoring balance to the system. My proposal even fits with the new mood in Washington, D.C. Here it is.</P><P>     After writing your holiday letters to friends and loved ones, write another to your senators and member of Congress asking them to cut off the federal Animal Damage Control (ADC) program.</P><P>     The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The ADC's program is quite broad. It helps protect corn and sunflowers from blackbirds, airplanes from hawks, geese, and owls, and pasture land from prairie dogs. However, the ADC's largest single mission is livestock protection (or predator control) in Western states. With overhead, its livestock protection costs run $13 million a year.</P><P>     Many of us find the ADC's predator-control program offensive. Not only has ADC exterminated wolves, bears, and mountain lions in many of the contiguous 48 states, it employs barbaric methods. Many people find cyanide poisoning, steel leg traps and aerial hunts offensive. We carried rifles to protect stock from rogue animals, but ADC is indiscriminate, killing problem animals and innocents alike.</P><P>     Even people indifferent to animal welfare should question the value of the ADC. ADC efforts are allocated politically. A series of National Academy of Sciences reports consistently indicate these efforts don't significantly reduce livestock predation. This is again documented by Randal O'Toole in his magazine, Different Drummer.</P><P>     It shouldn't be so expensive to kill animals, but federal laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act all constrain ADC's effectiveness. These laws divert time and money from predator control to environmental-impact reports. We again find the government doing inefficiently something it shouldn't be doing at all.</P><P>     Congress' desire to use predator control as a re-election tool means that funds are politically targeted to favored congressional districts not, for example, spent on non-lethal research. Congress targeted $2.1 million to protect North Dakota sunflowers from blackbirds and $248,000 to protect maple trees from squirrels during 1987-1994. These funds overwhelmingly went to states with congressional representatives on the agricultural subcommittees of the appropriations committees. Nearly 40 percent of the ADC's federal funds accrue to the 27,000 ranchers who graze livestock on public lands. The average subsidy is $550 per year, and far more for those ranchers who have permits for cheap grazing on federal rangelands.</P><P>     Concentrating the ADC's benefits on politically connected people makes little economic sense. Losses to predators or other wildlife are a cost of doing business. We lowered coyote, bear and mountain lion predation by placing guard dogs with our sheep. This was expensive and time intensive but ultimately a good investment.</P><P>     The mere existence of the ADC encourages ranchers and farmers to take fewer private precautions against predator losses. Subsidies short-circuit market signals telling us which areas are best suited for range stock operations. A bounty for coyote pelts - paid by stock growers associations, not by taxpayers who object to the practices - would be significantly cheaper and surely more ethical. Should a committed vegetarian be forced to subsidize this killing?</P><P>       Subsidizing the destruction of animals is offensive on ecological, ethical and economic grounds. It is past time to put ADC away. Do something nice for animals this holiday season by writing Washington, D.C. And be sure to copy Newt.</P><P>_______</P><P> John A.

BADEN </P><P>           CLINTON'S appointments of two strong environmentalists to the posts of secretary of the interior and administrator of EPA have alarmed many business leaders. But the choices of Bruce Babbitt and Carol Browner for these key environmental positions accurately reflect the &quot;greening of America.&quot; They reconfirm the practical necessity for business to act in environmentally sensitive ways.</P><P>       Clinton and Gore's environmental moves signify a definitive break with the tradition of resource development. While there may be a more kind and gentle future for America's bears and bunnies, the businesses upon which our prosperity depends can expect more stringent environmental standards.</P><P>       An important new mission for business is to demonstrate how this greening of America can coexist with increasing efficiency and productivity.</P><P>     This challenge is especially critical to the Northwest. Here in America's  &quot;ecotopia&quot; the conflicts between economy and ecology are pronounced. The economies of the Northwest developed when culture and institutions were oriented toward resource exploitation. Our history is largely a story of damming, logging, mining and ranching. Yet more than any other region, the Northwest is home of the environmentally conscious.</P><P>     With our mix of resource-based industries, changing the environmental behavior of business is neither costless nor smooth. Environmentalists have a vital stake in a successful transition, for if our businesses are not able to adapt to the new standards, we will lose the standard of living upon which our willingness and ability to pay for environmental quality depends.</P><P>     Economist Don Coursey has pointed out that in the United States and other  developed nations, when the income of a state or community rises by 10 percent, its willingness to pay for environmental quality rises by 25 percent. And if a state's income falls 10 percent, this willingness to pay drops by 25 percent. On the basis of this comparative data, we can expect relatively prosperous regions to place greater emphasis on the health of the environment.</P><P>     How can we preserve the environment while continuing the economic progress that fosters environmental quality? One important key lies in preparing tomorrow's business leaders to be environmental managers. Harry E. Teasley, president and CEO of Coca-Cola/Nestle International has noted &quot;After 20 years of interviewing MBAs, I have concluded that most are well trained in the functional areas of finance, accounting and  marketing. These same students, however, have only a superficial or topical understanding of the relationship of business with the environment, the market economy, and public policy.&quot;</P><P>       The University of Washington addresses this problem with a new program to train future decision-makers attending the School of Business. The Environmental Management (EM) Program for MBA students, was established by people who anticipated that the environment would be a high priority on the national agenda and who understand the link between prosperity, environmental concern, and the ability to effectively address this concern.</P><P>     Major universities scattered throughout the United States are developing environmental MBA programs. What makes the University of Washington's effort unique is its emphasis upon market incentives and entrepreneurial innovations.</P><P>        As Dean Leventhal of the Business School notes, &quot;The environmental courses in most business schools are often taught by people who identify with the corporate guilt/social responsibility/command-and-control schools of thought. While we fully consider regulatory approaches to environmental management, our EM Program stresses property rights and market incentives as keys to harmonizing business and the environment.&quot;</P><P>       According to Professor Jonathan Karpoff, Director of the EM Program, the curriculum is built on three intellectual perspectives:</P><P>       --  The &quot;tragedy of the commons,&quot; made famous by ecologist Garrett Hardin, applies to many of today's environmental problems, such as atmospheric pollution;</P><P>     --  The prosperity that comes from successful, productive businesses fosters the achievement of environmental goals;</P><P>     --  Successful environmental policy must include not only regulation, but also market-oriented incentive-based approaches, such as the use of tradeable permits to curb pollution.</P><P>     Sue Mecklenburg, associate director of the EM Program, explains that it &quot;is designed to teach students how to use the current knowledge of environmental concerns to make better business decisions for both their company and the world. And this July, a week-long seminar at the University of Washington will give today's business executives an overview of environmental management principles.</P><P>     Vice president-elect Gore's book, Earth in the Balance, previews the new political climate under which businesses must operate. Fortunately, some politicians are beginning to understand environmental economics; specifically that environmental concern and the ability to effectively address that concern are dependent upon prosperity.</P><P> ____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           First of a series of articles on the Forest Service and the economics of the timber industry.</P><P>  IN the fifth grade I started a conservation club for my school. To me, the U.S. Forest Service epitomized conservation and stewardship. Rangers maintained trails, practiced ecology, and found lost hikers while Smokey the Bear admonished us to put out our campfires and appreciate the outdoors.</P><P>     But today we hear that behind the popular symbols is an agency that suffers predictable bureaucratic and political pathologies. We learn that the Forest Service, once a symbol of good government, actually fosters waste and environmental destruction.</P><P>     The Forest Service was founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1905. He initially promised that after a &quot;modest&quot; investment by Congress, the forests would pay for themselves. That has never been true because Forest Service decisions have always been biased by political pressures and budgeting. The deceptions have multiplied to the point that a group of disgruntled employees have set up a watchdog group, the Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics (AFSEEE). Its members critique and seek reform of Forest Service policies.</P><P>     The thrust of their, criticism, and that of others, is this: 109 of 122 of the National Forests lose money on their timber sale programs. In doing so they sacrifice the environment and non-timber values of the land. Alaska's Tongass National Forest exemplifies these problems.</P><P>     The Tongass is the largest National Forest, encompassing 16.9 million, acres. It is best known for its temperate old-growth rain forest. This ecosystem has a diverse understory of plants and brush, which provides habitat for bears, owls and wolves, as well as a variety of landmarks including Admiralty Island National Monument.</P><P>     Through massive subsidies, the Tongass is a large supplier of pulp wood and saw timber. While stumpage in the Northwest sells for hundreds of dollars per thousand board feet, in the Tongass it brings under $10 per thousand. Yet the costs of simply administering the timber sales and building the roads is about $56 per thousand. Absent the subsidy, private companies could not harvest such timber. But with the Forest Service footing the bulk of the bill, they do.</P><P>     In the 1950s the Forest Service signed two 50-year contracts to provide logs from the Tongass for two local mills. These contracts oblige the Forest Service to provide highly subsidized timber, up to 300 million board/feet per year, solely to keep the two mills in business. This is regardless of cost, market conditions or the ability of the Tongass to regenerate the timber. So far, over eight billion board feet of timber has been cut and sold for a loss.</P><P>     Under the contracts, the mills are also able to request &quot;emergency rate redeterminations&quot; of contract prices if the market price of milled lumber is inadequate to ensure  profitability. Thus, the mills are assured of a profit. The Tongass returned over $15 million dollars to the mills in 1991 as a refund for &quot;overpayment&quot; in previous years.</P><P>     And, of course, as environmentalists point out, the Forest Service ignores many of logging's cost. Habitat destroyed. Streams and spawning beds silted up by runoff. Sublime forests clearcut. This harms both wildlife and local economies. Healing may take decades.</P><P>     Recently, the Forest Service asked some of its biologists to report on such impacts in the Tongass. The biologists concluded that numerous species would be displaced unless logging were scaled back. But the biologists' supervisors saw a threat to budgets dependent upon timber harvests. They suppressed the report. This is the bureaucratic logic of the former Soviet Union - and the resultant problems are similar.</P><P>     The well-intentioned people of AFSEEE have not been able to change the Forest Service. I have known many people, including some of my best students, who have gone on to work for the Forest Service. Yet little changes. Why do basically good people do bad things?</P><P>       The answer is that with bad incentives, good intentions will not suffice. And the &quot;Forest Soviet's&quot; bureaucratic imperatives continually filter out threatening information. Norman Maclean, author of A River Runs Through It, describes these responses in his last book, Young Men and Fire, telling of Forest Service cover-ups and obfuscation in the deaths of 12 Smokejumpers in a 1949 forest fire.</P><P>     This same process inhibits evolutionary responses to our increasing knowledge of forest ecology and America's changing tastes and values. To prevent such episodes, fundamental reform is required. Personnel changes are not enough. Newcomers will face the same political pressures and antiquated structures. The goals of ecological sensitivity and economic efficiency have yet to be achieved by government bureaucracy.</P><P>     Without proper incentives, reform will fail. There is hope. It lies with alternatives based upon new ways to use property rights and market incentives. With them, we can harmonize economical timber production with environmental goals.</P><P>_______________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           Second in a series of articles on the Forest Service and the economics of the timber industry.</P><P>  BROCK Evans, vice president and chief lobbyist for the National Audubon Society, recently spoke at a University of Washington Environmental Management Seminar. In response to a question about reforming the Forest Service, he cataloged many destructive, wasteful and insensitive practices. Below-cost timber sales were high on his list of government boondoggles. We agree on these failings.</P><P>     His cure was familiar too: replace the &quot;bad&quot; people in the Forest Service with new, &quot;good&quot; people; and instill the Forest Service with a new corporate culture that respects environmental values, placing them ahead of logging and exploitation. Here our opinions diverge.</P><P>     I believe there are few bad people in the Forest Service, certainly no more than in any large government organization. What dooms the Forest Service are its bad budgetary incentives.</P><P>     As Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, put it, &quot;It's the budget that energizes the Forest Service.&quot; And the Forest Services' budgeting process is fundamentally perverse. It provides incentives to generate below-cost timber sales and to discount the value of recreation, wildlife habitat and environmental amenities.</P><P>     In the private sector, business income must cover expenditures. But the Forest Service does not run like that - and it cannot go bankrupt. An obscure 1930 law called the Knutson-Vandenburg Act is important to the budgeting process. Under it, the Forest Service is allowed to keep the revenue from its timber sales while timber sale costs are funded by Congressional appropriation.</P><P>     In 1930 it cost the Forest Service 50 cents per thousand board feet to hold a timber sale. So the Forest Service wrote a rule specifying that 50 cents be returned to the Treasury for every thousand board feet. The 50-cents rule still applies - but today the average sale costs over $50 per thousand board feet.</P><P>     So while the taxpayer pays a timber sale's costs (overhead, planning, road construction, etc.), the Forest Service keeps the bulk of the proceeds. There is virtually no direct connection between income and expense. And if the Forest Service is the budget maximizer its chief suggests, the incentive is to maximize timber sale volume, not net value, and therefore receipts. In this way the Forest Service's budget will rise once when Congress appropriates sale funds and then again when sale receipts are received.</P><P>     As a result, according to forest economist Randal O'Toole, 90 percent of our national forests lose money on their timber-sale programs. This costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually.</P><P>     There is another reason why so many sales occur: There are 122 National Forests in 40 states. The Treasury is required to pay 25 percent of the proceeds of each timber sale to local communities. Congressmen put political pressure on the Forest Service to hold sales in their districts, seeking to funnel dollars back home. Tellingly, Puerto Rico (with no vote in Congress) has the only national forest without a timber-sale program.</P><P>     Congress often passes Forest Service appropriation bills specifying harvest levels, often above even what the Forest Service recommends. These timber sales are pork barrel projects. Over time this creates communities dependent upon Forest Service welfare. As people developed stakes in this system, meaningful reform became increasingly difficult.</P><P>     We can see why the Forest Service hosts so many below-cost sales. They provide its life blood, money, as well as a pipeline for Congressional pork. Not that all Forest Service personnel are willing accomplices in a grand scheme to defraud the taxpayer. Why are &quot;good&quot; managers so often captured and co-opted by this budgeting process? Below-cost timber sales provide funding to support the Forest Service's other work, like habitat management.</P><P>     But the result is that the taxpayer gets nothing for something, subsidizing clearcuts that are seldom environmentally friendly. Al Gore states in his book Earth in the Balance, &quot;As the world's leading exemplar of free-market economics, the U.S. has a special obligation to discover effective ways of using the power of market forces to help save the environment.&quot; Market approaches to Forest Service problems can illuminate reform. We can recognize the advantages of private sector timber management. It strives for efficiency. Private firms harvest only timber that can pay its way out of the woods. Concurrently, we recognize the need to develop the environmental sensitivity of private firms.</P><P>     If the Forest Service is to salvage its reputation, it must move toward economic responsibility. The elimination of incentives to hold below-cost sales is a good first step. Make the Forest Service fund timber sales only out of net timber sale receipts. No more incentives to lose money, and no incidental environmental harm in the bargain. Only good people and good incentives can fix the Forest Service.</P><P>_____________</P><P> John A.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P><H1>Recreation user fees would level the playing field</H1></P><P>February 2, 1993</P><P>JOHN A. BADEN</P><P>           MANY recreationalists bristle at the prospect of recreation fees on our national forests. Why should we pay to hike on &quot;our&quot; land? They are outraged, however, when they encounter clear-cuts near timberline on these same lands. But if they could choose between recreation fees and timber cutting, might fees then be accepted as the lesser of two evils?</P><P>        The reason for clear-cuts is, as you might expect, money. The Forest Service budget increases with every timber sale. Specifically, with every board-foot that it sells, the Forest Service generates income from Congress and lumber companies. The more it sells, the bigger its budget. Recreation and aesthetic interests, however, return few dollars to the Forest Service budget. How can they compete with timber when decisions are made by budget-maximizing managers?</P><P>       Congress' answer has been the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. It states that Forest Service management should give equal weight to &quot;outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes.&quot; In practice, it means that creative Forest Service planners suddenly discover that recreation and environmental benefits are produced by logging. For example, new roads into pristine wilderness areas improve access while clear-cuts provide increased &quot;edge&quot; habitat for forest animals. Congressional multiple-use mandates are thus trumped by budgetary incentives.</P><P>     So multiple use fails because budgetary pressures for logging and grazing need not compete with revenue from recreation. Recreation fees can level the playing field and guarantee that non-timber values are considered. Revenues from biking, hiking, and camping in the national forests can provide monetary incentives for land managers to consider non-timber values. If they do not consider such values, they will sacrifice income. And as timber shows, income speaks.</P><P>     The Forest Service estimates that the market value of national forest recreation is over $5 billion per year. A more modest estimate by forest economist Randal O'Toole, using a recreation fee average of only $3 per day, is $1 billion per year. Even so, O'Toole estimates that such recreation fees would outweigh timber receipts on 80 percent of the national forests. So recreation can compete. With fees, eight of ten national forests, those ill-suited for commercial timber production, would see little timber cutting. And even on the truly productive forests, cutting would likely be more sensitive as managers sought to maintain some recreation income.</P><P>     Fees would come from day permits and annual passes. Enforcement would occur by making permits visible, either on vehicles or a ski-lift type tag. Similar methods work well with fishing licenses, in national forest campgrounds, and in Washington State Sno-Parks.</P><P>     Equity is a concern. But if the poor were asked which free goods and services they would most like, would hiking and camping make the top ten? When considered relative to outdoor equipment and transportation costs, fees fade to insignificance.</P><P>     But the benefits of such fees would be substantial. Timber cutting on our national forests should occur only when timber values exceed those values lost to logging. Fees would help ensure this result. Much less would be cut, and that which was cut would likely be more sensitive to aesthetic and recreation values. We would also have a rational means for evaluating recreation - timber trade-offs.</P><P>     This would also change the incentives faced by private forest managers. When our national forests give away recreation, private managers cannot compete. But when national forests charge fees, private land may open up to recreation, also for a fee. Private landowners, who currently can only profit from timber sales, would have an alternative source of revenue and increased reasons to act with sensitivity toward the land.</P><P>     Such private sector incentives are important because much private land has non-timber value. Recreation fees encourage landowners to recognize such value and preserve their lands. And by reducing the cut from marginal timber sites on our national forests, we will foster more careful management of private commercial forests, most of which are biologically better suited for timber production.</P><P>     Recreation on public lands is similar to timbering or livestock grazing in that each use affects other opportunities. There is a cost measured in other uses foregone. This &quot;opportunity cost&quot; of using the national forests for recreation is often some foregone logging or grazing. Without recreation fees, it is no contest. Logging and grazing revenues win. With fees, logging will face the opportunity costs of lost recreation income.</P><P>     While the Forest Service has a multiple-use mandate, it faces a dominant-use incentive. True multiple use implies multiple incentives. Recreation fees will help to level the playing field and protect our national forests for the uses we most value.</P><P>_____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THERE is much talk today about &quot;reinventing government.&quot; The goal is to both improve outcomes and save dollars. The Forest Service is an excellent candidate for such reforms.  </P><P>      The Forest Service's creators are credited with high ideals, but America's sylvan socialism has suffered the liabilities of socialism elsewhere. The Forest Service was created because of an expectation of timber famine. Since then, the Forest Service has predicted five timber famines (which have yet to materialize) and used these threats to expand its prominence, power and funding.</P><P>     And while it is true that there is a scarcity of undisturbed ecosystems, there is no scarcity of wood fiber. There are three reasons why. First, the U.S. began with a huge inventory of mature timber for harvest at low cost. Second, the private sector manages productive timber sites well. Third, we've had great technical innovation. When dealing with commodities in a market economy, scarcity has yet to win a race against creativity.</P><P>     In sum, the Forest Service is not, and has never been, essential to a secure timber supply. It was a well-intended but misguided response to both real and imagined problems.</P><P>     Forest Service reform can serve two purposes: to increase the ecological sensitivity with which the land is treated and to increase the efficiency with which the forests are managed. Forest Service atrocities have been documented in detail: streams silted up, giant sequoias leveled, habitat destroyed, billions of dollars wasted. Years of reform attempts have had no great effect. The Forest Service's size and the bureaucratic imperative of budgetary growth have thwarted attempts to induce fiscal or environmental responsibility.</P><P>     We want our most productive national forests to be as efficient as private commercial forests while respecting environmental values. To achieve these ends we suggest nothing radical. Rather, to reinvent those national forests best suited to commercial timber, we should carefully and with environmental sensitivity sell them to the highest bidders over a 20-year period. Here's how.</P><P>     Our national forests fall into three categories: productive commercial forests, inherently unproductive forests on high, dry, and cold sites, and those forests which, depending upon technology and timber prices, fall somewhere in between.</P><P>     Trees like to grow where it is warm, wet and low. These are the most productive forests, suitable for commercial timber. Few of our 122 national forests, perhaps one-third at most, have these features. The Forest Service runs them essentially as commercial forests. They are roaded. They have been logged and are on harvest rotations. They are distinguished from private forests largely by inefficiency and the political influence on management. These lands are candidates for sale.</P><P>     Incentives to produce timber efficiently and cheaply are far stronger in the private sector than in the government sector. And deed restrictions can ensure that the environmental values of these lands are better protected than on either traditional private forests or the national forests.</P><P>     For example, riparian areas can be protected by buffer zones. Conservation easements can provide recreation areas. Restrictive covenants can protect against commercial development. Ecologically critical areas, such as elk calving grounds, can also be protected through deed restrictions.</P><P>     Companies like Champion International might manage such lands. Such firms know how to grow trees efficiently and effectively. Firms like Champion also have experience managing land for both recreation and timber. In Western Washington, they manage lands to increase deer habitat. This has resulted in both healthy deer herds and profitable timber. The lands are also managed for recreationalists who pay modest fees for access.</P><P>     Private ownership is no panacea. There is no one perfect system and no costless solution. We seek arrangements in which individuals have incentives to act in the public interest. The system we propose fosters recreation and aesthetic uses of the land and efficient timber production.</P><P>     And importantly, the taxpayer will no longer be forced to pay for poor Forest Service management practices. The financial responsibility would be with taxpaying timber companies while opportunities for political meddling and pork-barrel politics are reduced. Such conjunctions of sound economics and ecological stewardship can be a basis for &quot;reinventing government.&quot;</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE Shoshone National Forest near Dubois, Wyo., is an important part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. But the forest has maintained a money-losing logging program. In any rational system, the ecological, recreation, watershed and wildlife values would easily trump logging in the Shoshone.</P><P>       Even the purely economic cost of logging the Shoshone exceed the benefits. In 1991, for example, the Forest Service lost $557,000 on the Shoshone while selling 13,000,000 board feet of timber. If we include road and other associated costs, some of which the Forest Service ignores entirely, the losses go up to $1,857,000. Since timber likes to grow where it's warm, wet and low, and the Shoshone is high, dry and cold, these losses cannot be corrected by more efficient management. Rather, fundamental reform is in order. A recent event inspires such reform.</P><P>       Stephen Gordon ranches near the Shoshone and grazes cattle on its lands. He recently sent the Forest Service a $100,000 check as a down payment for rights to a timber sale in the Shoshone's Brent Creek drainage. But with rights to the timber he would keep it standing, not cut it. He pledged an additional $200,000 and agreed to replenish his federal grazing permits in favor of wildlife. Further, to benefit wildlife habitat, he offered to donate a conservation easement on his ranch to the government. All this if only the Forest Service would agree to forgo a money-losing sale.</P><P>     Both the Wyoming Fish and Game Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service urged the Forest Service not to cut the drainage, saying that it is a critical migration corridor for elk and important to the Yellowstone grizzly population.</P><P>     But the Forest Service returned Gordon's check. It did not offer an economic rationale for rejecting his offer. Nor did it dispute that the area was critical wildlife habitat. District Ranger Brent Larson replied that Gordon proposed &quot;creation of a de facto wilderness area. We can't do that.&quot; The Forest Service saw their multiple-use mission as requiring that they provide logs to local mills even when other values are much higher.</P><P>     The Forest Service budget is increased when it interprets multiple use as a mandate to lose money and sacrifice habitat. It has become a parasitic bureaucracy. Its arcane budgeting and decision-making process are governed by a political calculus that dominates economic and ecological standards.</P><P>     Can we imagine new institutional arrangements that are sensitive to changing values and open to scientific findings? Could we design an organization that would responsibly weigh the costs and benefits of alternative actions? Can we accommodate offers like Gordon's?</P><P>       When dealing with political economy, we should separate hopes from expectations. With this cautionary note, I propose that we build upon our centuries of common-law experience and create a Shoshone Biodiversity Trust. Like a museum, nonprofit hospital or private college, the trust would be run by a board of trustees, respected and knowledgeable volunteers who accept fiduciary responsibility. The trust's sole purpose would be to manage the former national forest land, land that did not support a viable timber industry but was logged at a loss due to political pressures.</P><P>     Environmental scientists and local, regional and national leaders could comprise the board. The trust would be granted a charter by Congress and would have to act within the confines of this charter, obeying previously established wilderness designations and protecting proscribed riparian areas. Beyond that, it would be free to set its own course.</P><P>     Each forest endowment board would run solely on its own revenues. No more federal handouts. Each would have access to a full array of income-generating mechanisms: grazing permits, recreation fees, gifts and even timber sales where they made economic and ecological sense. The board would return 25 percent of revenue from recreation or commodities to counties and local communities, just as the Forest Service now does.</P><P>       The remainder could be used in any way that furthered the trust's mission. It could study wildlife populations, maintain trails, buy more land or buy winter range for wildlife. If this experiment is successful it may be replicated on other forests. Some would likely promote intensive recreation uses, such as mountain biking, while others might focus on primitive recreation and wilderness areas.</P><P>     Entrepreneurship exists in the nonprofit as well as the for-profit world, The Nature Conservancy and the North American Elk Foundation are highly successful examples. These organizations creatively respond to new interests and understandings. A Shoshone Biodiversity Trust can follow their lead. With such trusts we can better preserve shared values, allowing each forest to fulfill its mission and maintain its ecological endowment.</P><P>_______________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IN every language the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; bears a crust of derision.</P><P> This is no accident, for bureaucratic incentives invariably produce problems. Bureaucracies tend to replace the goals that justified their creation with actions that protect their budgets. The good news is that we can harness this fatal propensity in a way that will improve government and reduce its costs. While our plan won't do it all, here is a beginning.</P><P>     President Clinton's appeal for mutual sacrifice in the form of higher taxes and foregone benefits have been well-received. Our new president is an excellent political salesman. And many Americans are sufficiently responsible to be willing to buy the goods. But if special interests undermine success, citizens will feel betrayed.</P><P>     Here is a decision rule for such budget-cutting: Programs that are both economically wasteful and environmentally destructive will be zeroed out. Logging subsidies and most new Bureau of Reclamation water projects fall in this category. But that is not enough. Cuts must go deeper, to the myriad &quot;demonstration&quot; projects and special initiatives that riddle every appropriations bill.</P><P>     In the abstract, cutting spending is appealing. Most people feel that much of their tax bill is wasted by the government. But specific programs that benefit special interests have strong supporters. In contrast, few taxpayers have an incentive to lobby against specific programs; the portion of their tax bill going to any item other than entitlements is quite small. The average citizen has little incentive to become active while the beneficiaries have strong reasons to fight for their programs.</P><P>       This problem is the classic one of &quot;factions&quot; that so concerned Madison and the founders of our nation. The temptation of politicians to concentrate benefits and disperse costs has been the ruin of democracy through the ages. As we became a society based upon transfer payments, government was transformed from an agency of order to an engine of plunder.</P><P>     So in addition to dealing honestly with entitlements, how can we cut major chunks from the federal budget? The accumulated programs that have led to our crisis develop strong and stable constituencies. Such programs are best headed off in their infancy. One way is to create a government agency that draws funding solely from successful attempts to eliminate and pare back both existing and newly proposed government programs; let's consider a predatory bureaucracy.</P><P>     The Bureau of Reclamation proposed rebuilding the Teton Dam, a structure that failed when first filled in 1976. This dam had damaging ecological consequences and the economic costs far outweighed the economic benefits. Yet interests, such as those who expected to benefit from subsidized irrigation, lobbied for it.</P><P>     A predatory agency would marshal its resources against this project, employing ecologists, economists, and local residents who like the river as it is. They would advertise these costs to Congress. If the dam were cut, our predatory bureaucracy would receive 1 percent of the project's estimated costs and the Bureau of Reclamation's operating budget would decrease by the same 1 percent. The predatory bureaucracy would thus thrive only if it were successful at eliminating programs, and the offending department, in this case the Bureau of Reclamation, would be punished not only by losing this project, but by losing an additional portion of its budget.</P><P>     This system would provide incentives for government to police itself against waste and pork barrel projects, both by the predator and the prey, as projects are weeded out in anticipation of attack by the predator agency. Such a department could be established with a single two-year appropriation. After the first two years, it would exist solely upon funds gleaned from cut programs. Its size would vary just as predator numbers follow the size of prey populations.</P><P>     The proposal is not without its drawbacks. I find the creation of another bureaucracy somewhat offensive but this is a problem of political economy, not political theology where sin is well-defined. It is also possible that some worthwhile projects might be killed. But the real question is whether the benefits outweigh the costs. And on this score, it is likely to be quite successful.</P><P>     The fundamental logic behind this proposal is that bureaucracies are driven by their budgets. Just as corporations are driven to seek profits, government agencies seek to maximize their budget. They normally do this by pleasing a special-interest clientele. Our proposal would utilize that insight by creating an agency which, to increase its budget, would cannibalize the unsound proposals of other bureaucracies. In doing so it would foster the public interest rather than special interests.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

This provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was passed in 1958. It bans any additive in any detectable levels in processed food if the additive has been shown to cause cancer in humans or laboratory animals.</P><P>       The law seems to make sense. Who wants a cancer-causing substance added to their food? But its broadly stated mandate does not reflect today's scientific knowledge and our growing awareness of health risks.</P><P>     The Delaney Clause is subject to a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council. NRDC charged, accurately, that the EPA was failing to enforce the Delaney Clause. It was, because EPA realized that it was an unworkable law that does more to threaten our nation's health than help it. However, a California judge ordered EPA to follow the law.</P><P>     The EPA's response to the decision was twofold: It began to list the chemicals that would be banned if it were forced to follow the letter of the law and it asked Congress to amend the law to reflect current scientific understanding.</P><P>     The scientific problems are many. Dr. Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley helped pioneer our modern techniques of testing substances for cancer effects. He is now among the methods' chief critics. He cites two concerns.</P><P>     The first has to do with the testing method of feeding populations of animals the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of a chemical, the dose just below that which causes death. After exposure the animals are examined for cancerous growths.</P><P>     The problem is that the &quot;dose-response&quot; curve is unlikely to be linear, that is, continuous high exposures are likely to be more dangerous than long-term low exposures. A substance's ability to cause cancer at 50 or 5000 times the average daily intake level may tell us nothing about its effect upon cancer risk at smaller, more likely doses. As a government scientific panel announced in the Federal Register, &quot;the implicit assumptions underlying extrapolations from the MTD . . . do not appear to be valid.&quot;</P><P>       The second problem is transferring lab results on mice to human populations. Mice and rats are more closely related to one another than to humans. However, one will often test negative while the other will test positive for the same chemical.</P><P>     Dr. Ames also points out that it is not only man-made substances that cause cancer. Using the same disputed techniques, he found a variety of other naturally occurring chemicals, present in substances from peanut butter to broccoli, that also cause cancer in test animals.</P><P>     In contrast to what was believed when Delaney was passed, experts today believe that, aside from workers who are exposed to massive doses, not more than 1-3 percent of cancer cases can be attributed to man-made chemicals. The vast majority are due to genetics and lifestyle choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption, or fatty foods.</P><P>     Of course, to those who campaign for public health, 3 percent is still too much. But they lose sight of the fact that relative, not absolute, risk is the important measure. Most chemicals are present for a reason. They help to control pests and bacteria. They lengthen shelf life. All act in ways that reduce the price of food and often the real danger associated with eating it. The result of strict enforcement of Delaney would likely be greater scarcity of some foods, price increases, and increased likelihood of contamination.</P><P>     The environment might also suffer as more harmful substances are used. In Wisconsin, for example, farmers would likely switch to copper- or tin-based compounds to protect their potato crops from blight. Ultimately, this practice would poison their soils with the accumulation of heavy metals.</P><P>     So by banning pesticides, we may increase other risks, shifting dangers elsewhere. But we cannot eliminate all risks, only choose intelligently among them. This requires a careful analysis of relative risks, not legislation where emotions trump science.</P><P>     EPA's suggestion to relax Delaney is likely to face a tough battle in Congress. Few senators and representatives want to be portrayed as voting for cancer. Cancer is complex, emotional, and scary. And certainly we should seek to lower cancer risks when reasonable. But it is relative risks, what happens on the margins, that matter. To promote a safe and affordable food supply, lets be alert to environmental hyperbole and posturing while respecting medical science and the economics of risk reduction. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

BADEN</P><P>           WHEN considering the proposed &quot;Ancient Forest Summit&quot; or &quot;Timber Summit&quot; (word choice is significant), we should carefully segregate our hopes from our expectations. Yet I'm hopeful that the summit will increase understanding and improve policy. Here's why.</P><P>       Twenty years ago my colleagues and I at Montana State University advocated market incentives and property rights as environmental tools. Few considered this a viable option. Environmentalists and journalists considered us &quot;the wild bunch of Montana.&quot; We were the academic analogs of gunslingers and cowboys.</P><P>     But today this emphasis on incentives is becoming mainstream. Many environmental leaders who once considered pollution sin against nature (and as such immune from economic analysis) now favor market incentives to control it. However, the concept of private property rights has not gained this acceptance. In fact, property rights are under siege. The April summit could be decisive in this struggle of ideas.</P><P>     Environmental regulations, including the Endangered Species Act, often threaten property rights. They constrain land-use options, reducing income and land value. Few owners are indifferent to this outcome - especially when they are not compensated for their lost opportunities. Here in the Northwest with our high timber values and spotted owl controversies, the situation is especially dramatic.</P><P>     The problem with the spotted owl is primarily one of scale. It is not just a golf course or a shopping mall that is being challenged by an endangered species. If we were to protect the 900 or so owl circles in Washington, 1.5 million acres of land would be restricted from logging. Clearly, owl circles dramatically threaten the property rights of many landowners. This impact is significant. As an estimate, enough lumber to build 3.5 million homes would be withheld.</P><P>     America's founders understood the importance of secure property rights. They saw how people in other times and other lands used the government to transfer wealth. To help preclude this they gave us the Fifth Amendment's clause, &quot;. . .  nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation  . . .&quot; They designed our laws and regulations to encourage productive, rather than predatory, activities.</P><P>     Environmentalists sometimes favor regulations that strip value from property. Taking seems cheaper than buying. It isn't. Actions have unintended consequences. When property rights are threatened, behavior changes. People lose incentives to be good stewards of their land. They have incentives to &quot;cut out and get out.&quot; This process is evident on the timber lands of Western Washington, Oregon and California; people fearing land-use regulations understandably act before they lose opportunities to do so.</P><P>     Friends often tell me, &quot;We can't afford to pay for the environments we must save.&quot; But if voters lack the taste and understanding to pass bonds to buy lands for environmental preservation, are we to impose our tastes and &quot;take&quot; land by regulation? Ethically, can we impose our values upon others, even for a &quot;good&quot; cause? When should individual choice and freedom be sacrificed to environmental ends? The answers are seldom obvious.</P><P>     Some who testify at the summit are likely to justify uncompensated takings with environmental appeals. Before accepting such views, I suggest we consider ecologist Garrett Hardin's question: &quot;And then what?&quot; Much of what follows from threats of takings can be anticipated - e.g., cutting timber before it's &quot;taken&quot; by regulation. The &quot;Shoot, shovel, and shut-up&quot; approach to endangered species is another reaction to these threats of takings.</P><P>     I hope the summit will explain how we can move toward a harmony of environmental protection and private property rights. Secure property rights are essential to liberty, they foster prosperity, and promote environmental health. These values are interdependent.</P><P>     Rather than increase the threat of regulation, environmentalists at the summit should help private landowners realize the ecological values of their lands. Conservation easements, endowment funds for endangered species, and recreation user fees are all based upon property rights. We have a host of mechanisms that allow and encourage individuals to express their environmental concern with economic means. The summit can identify, publicize and promote them.</P><P>     I suggest that while our hopes for the summit are bountiful, our expectations should be spare. Political management has been with us for many years and people are accustomed to it. In the late 1800's, the Progressive Era reformers identified serious problems with America's environment. Unfortunately, their diagnosis of causes was flawed. Their reforms promoted bureaucratic, command-and-control resource management. The results were often disastrous.</P><P>     Nearly a century later a new group of &quot;progressives&quot; is again addressing these problems. We can expect better solutions only if President Clinton and others understand the possibilities and the limits of both property rights and bureaucratic approaches. As we await the summit, please keep your hopes and expectations in separate baskets.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE RECENT forest conference in Portland was, as expected, both well-attended and highly publicized. The scene, however, was more impressive than was the substance. Virtually nothing was resolved.</P><P>       Unfortunately, this is a predictable consequence of political decision-making. And the conference's politicking and posturing overshadowed that week's true environmental milestone: the inaugural sale of pollution rights by the Chicago Board of Trade.</P><P>     Economists had long awaited this event. It initiated an efficient strategy to reduce pollution from powerplants and factories.</P><P>     The theory is straightforward: Government sets an acceptable overall emissions level for a pollutant, in this case the sulfur dioxide emitted by electrical utilities and factories. It then creates tradable permits and gets out of the way to let the market process produce the best way to achieve the reductions.</P><P>     From 1995 onward, industrial plants must have an allowance to emit sulfur dioxide. The government grants pollution allowances to plants based upon their emissions history. For example, those which emitted an average of 100 tons over the past four years were given grandfathered permits for 75 tons in 1995. (The amount drops to 50 tons in the year 2000.) Each grandfathered permit was subtracted from the national emissions limit. The remainder were then auctioned to the highest bidder by the Chicago Board of Trade.</P><P>     This system has highly positive environmental and economic implications. First, it encourages utilities to find the most efficient way to comply with the law. They may either buy permits at auction or find money-saving ways to cut emissions. A highly successful plant may be able to cut emissions for less than the going price of an emissions permit. It can then cut pollution further, selling or retiring its extra permits.</P><P>     The result is a market which provides incentives for innovative pollution-control techniques. The emitters with the lowest cost of control will reduce their emissions the most. Those who find ways to emit less save money, just what our environmentally conscious nation increasingly desires.</P><P>     The early results seem promising. Illinois Power Company expects to save at least $250 million over the next 20 years by buying permits as opposed to building a new scrubber. But this is not an increase in pollution. Rather, it is a transfer, for a utility somewhere must now emit less. So Illinois ratepayers save money, the nation moves toward its emissions goals, and the government raises revenues by selling permits.</P><P>     In future years the total number of permits offered, and hence the amount of pollution, will be reduced. Illinois Power will continually reassess its emissions costs and control strategies. It may even build a new scrubber. But the expectation is that, when faced with options and competitive pricing of permits, companies will find innovative, and less expensive, ways to reduce their own emissions. So we all get a cleaner environment at lower cost.</P><P>     And since anybody can bid on permits, the system also enables those who most value clean air to enter the market. At least one environmental group, National Healthy Air Exchange, bids on permits, hoping to buy and &quot;retire&quot; them.</P><P>     Northeast Utilities donated 10,000 tons of its 140,000-ton annual allowance to the American Lung Association. Eastern coal miners may buy some to package with their &quot;dirty,&quot; or high-sulfur, coal, and hence save their jobs.</P><P>     These are just some of the possibilities created by tradable permits. Environmental and business entrepreneurs will surely find more. This process unleashes the innovation and creativity which make markets such successful institutions.</P><P>     This sale also illustrates another advantage of market-based environmental solutions: The sale was not the lead story on the evening news. Market solutions promote adjustment and compromise without political grandstanding and public recriminations.</P><P>     In an honest market, there is no angling for a favorable exemption from clean-air laws, no political payoffs for special treatment. The market solves the social problem of distribution efficiently, at low cost and with minimum fuss.</P><P>     As President Clinton grapples with conflicts over old-growth forests, he should learn from the example offered by the Chicago Board of Trade. Markets can be harnessed to help the environment, perhaps through a national biodiversity trust fund which would buy habitat and development rights to important ecosystems.</P><P>     Our president may be the best political salesman in history. Surely if the Chicago Board of Trade can get people to buy pollution, President Clinton can devise ways to sell the spotted owl's recovery. </P><P>_____________</P><P>John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE president and Hillary Rodham Clinton are selling the outlines of their health-care program to the nation. We have been told to expect many good things from it. Universal access, coverage of pre-existing conditions and expanded basic care would benefit many people. But it is likely that fully implementing a nationalized health-care plan will cost between $50 and $100 billion per year.</P><P>       Expanding access and coverage conflicts with the desire to trim the nation's health-care bill. But the president feels pressure to &quot;do something&quot; about costs of health care. The pharmaceutical industry is an obvious and tempting target.</P><P>     The drug industry is vulnerable to attack for several reasons. It has been consistently profitable, with returns as much as double those of the rest of manufacturing. Most prescription drug cost are paid directly by patients, making price increases immediately apparent. And the patent protection provided to new drugs creates an effective temporary monopoly, at least to the extent that a drug's properties are not duplicated by other drugs on the market.</P><P>     All of this makes drug companies an easy target for government intervention: Some people claim we need price controls to protect the consumer. And what consumer would not like drugs to be cheaper? (Even though prescription drugs account for only a nickel of every health-care dollar, and thus have only a small impact on overall health-care costs.) But more importantly, there are several good arguments as to why price controls would hurt, not help, consumers.</P><P>     Consumers care about more than just low prices. In the drug market especially, they are served by innovative new products with greater healing properties. That is the trade-off: prices versus innovation. We could have a constrained drug market with low prices and protracted negotiations between companies and the federal government over prices that may be charged for new drugs. But most people would prefer an innovative market with many new, and presumably more helpful, drugs.</P><P>     It is the profits on new, successful drugs that prompt the intensive research and development to find the next generation of miracle cures and therapies. New drugs are expensive to develop, costing an average of $231 million each in 1987. Of these, only three in 10 break even.</P><P>     So a successful drug must pay for its own research, as well as the research on the unsuccessful ones on which the company also risked money. In addition to the high emotions of illness, it is this risk and expense that make the drug industry so special. And the high risk explains why the government awards 14-year patents on new drugs. This gives the makers time to recoup their tremendous development expenditures before their research is copied and generic alternatives are offered.</P><P>     Price controls would take away the monopoly advantages of patent protection and undermine the incentives for research that patents were designed to provide. As an academic report on Medicaid and Medicare drug price controls not-so-succinctly put it, the revenue decline to drug companies resulting from price controls &quot;can be expected to negatively influence the expected returns on new drugs and to decrease the cash flow available to undertake R&amp;D.&quot;</P><P>        Price control enthusiasts will argue that it will be possible to hold down prices, but not so low that it undermines research. But this faith in the ability of regulators to control the market is not supported by our experience with regulation and price controls elsewhere. Medicaid and Medicare efforts to control the price of drugs and services caused cost-shifting to unregulated health-care payers. But industrywide price controls will prevent such shifting, leading to shortages and black markets.</P><P>     There were similar results during the Nixon-era price controls of 1971-74, as regulations and regulators multiplied while trying in vain to keep pace with the market's ability to circumvent price controls.</P><P>       As with the rest of the health-care program, we have only been told about the benefits of price controls on drugs. What is hidden are the harder-to-quantify but still real constraints upon innovation and new drug development.</P><P>       If we do not understand the logic driving the system we are likely to take well-intended actions that have perverse consequences. Unless we are sensitive to the importance of incentives to innovation, we can be sure that some important drugs will not be developed or introduced because of drug-price controls.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IT is clear from the argument of protectionists in Congress that many are pessimistic about the future of U.S. manufacturing. But recent events suggest prudent optimism, if not unconstrained joy.</P><P> While not all good things go together, some do. Economic understanding can help us find such unions.</P><P>     Environmental leaders show this improved understanding of economics. They are becoming aware that prosperity and environmental quality are complements, not competitors. The anti-business, anti-market, pro-regulatory rhetoric that marked the environmental movement in the 1970s and '80s is being replaced with an acceptance of markets and an appreciation of the advantages of decentralized decision-making.</P><P>       Only a few years ago, many environmental leaders held up the centralized and socialized economies of Eastern Europe as environmentally superior to the market economies of the West. After all, some had constitutional guarantees of environmental quality.</P><P>     But after the revolutions of 1989, the truth seeped out. Chernobyl was only the most graphic example. Even the most committed collectivists had to admit that the systems they championed were economically inefficient, environmentally destructive and thoroughly corrupting.</P><P>     Further, there is increased understanding that only with international trade can nations and regions realize their comparative advantages and increase prosperity through efficiency. This is especially true of poor nations: They have the most to gain from free-trade. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is such a step toward Mexican prosperity. The argument that NAFTA will harm Mexico's environment discounts an important fact. That is, as poor nations become wealthy their health and environmental standards rise. This holds across time and cultures: richer is cleaner, safer and more environmentally sensitive.</P><P>     Looking across the Mexican border, we simply cannot expect Third World nations to have the standards of first world nations. They have different priorities: food, shelter, clothing. We see horrifying examples of environmental health and safety violations. What would be truly extraordinary would be the absence of this difference. In my judgment, if NAFTA is passed, both the Mexican and U.S. economies will become more productive and Mexican environmental standards will rise toward ours. NAFTA will ultimately &quot;level&quot; both the environmental and wage playing fields with Mexico.</P><P>     And most importantly, American manufacturers are moving up the learning curve in efficiently dealing with environmental regulations. The Amoco Corporation recently conducted a major research project, cosponsored by EPA, at their Yorktown refinery. It was a thorough effort to investigate the costs and effectiveness of current pollution-control structures.</P><P>     The costs of pollution control are significant. That is why we see battles in Congress every time there is an attempt to raise environmental standards. A green world costs money. Our government should do its best to minimize these costs, but the Yorktown project shows that this is not the case.</P><P>       Yorktown was the first systematic attempt to assess all refinery emissions: air, water, soil - and to put a price tag on their control. Historically, EPA has monitored emissions only from selected points, like smoke stacks and containment pools. The Yorktown project found that these are not necessarily the areas which should be controlled. For example, large emissions came from the loading dock, a place EPA has never before checked.</P><P>     The bottom line: Amoco could achieve greater pollution reduction for about $11 million than it is getting for the $41 million in controls specified by EPA. When pollution control is inexpensive, we want a lot of it. When we must give up a lot to get it, we want less. Environmentalists are learning to favor efficient control because in the end it will mean less pollution.</P><P>     This &quot;second battle of Yorktown&quot; has revolutionary potential. It clearly demonstrates that the regulatory command-and-control approach employed to control industrial pollution is seriously flawed. Political incentives make government management costly and inefficient. Agencies should simply set goals and monitor results rather than specify process. The Yorktown Project shows that this is likely to save money and result in lower pollution levels - just as economics predicts.</P><P>     Although it would take a replication of the Yorktown work at many sites to obtain good estimates of potential national savings, the findings of Yorktown seem typical of manufacturing in general. In other words, American manufacturing has potential of meeting high environmental standards at a very substantial discount from today's costs.</P><P>       The lesson here is that while much of American industry can do well in the global marketplace, current government regulations are obsolete. If we are truly concerned about international competitiveness and losing jobs to low-cost foreign competitors, we should seek efficiency wherever possible - even in our environmental regulations. Fortunately, it seems we can do this without sacrificing our health and environmental standards. Amoco and EPA have shown us a beginning. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

BADEN</P><P>            THE debate over old-growth forests pits preservationists against those depending on this timber for their livelihood. With each side committed to different uses of nature, conflict seems inevitable, for not all good things go together.</P><P>       This conflict is heightened by public ownership and political control. Special-interest groups are special precisely because they focus on their narrow interests, ignoring other costs and foregone opportunities to use or appreciate the land. If we are to resolve the old-growth conflict, we need to give people incentives to consider the preferences and tastes of others.</P><P>     Instead of continuing the failed, special-interest-dominated political management of old growth in national forests, consider what would happen if we gave the old growth to various environmental groups, e.g., the Sierra Club and Wilderness Society. This radical proposal would remove the forests from governmental politics and present the new land managers with strong incentives to preserve the values of old growth at the lowest possible cost.</P><P>     Let's consider such a transfer to be a real possibility.</P><P> Transferring ownership of old-growth areas to nonprofit corporations safeguards natural beauty and species diversity while offering opportunities for appropriate economic or recreational use. Unlike rangers and supervisors in the National Forests, private managers can balance these competing goods uninhibited by federal bureaucracies. Nonprofit managers will reap more of the benefits of good policies and bear more of the consequences of bad choices than do federal bureaucrats.</P><P>     If private owners damage a beautiful area by allowing destructive economic activities they will lose the aesthetic appeal of their land and the potential revenues from donors or recreational users. But if they choose to leave valuable natural resources untouched they must accept the loss of revenue that entails. Smoky's helpers are insulated from both losses.</P><P>     Many economic and recreational activities have little or no long-term environmental impact. Environmentally sensitive owners can choose these activities and generate revenue even as they regard nature. The Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary illustrates how private management follows these principles to harmonize conflicts among economic and ecological values.</P><P>     Rainey, a 26,800-acre marsh found near Intracoastal City, La., is owned by the Audubon Society and run for the benefit of the species it protects. What distinguishes Rainey from federal sanctuaries is the harmonious coexistence among wildlife, oil- and gas-drilling operations, and cattle grazing. Why does this work? Private management and sound science insulate managers from political processes that cause mischief on federal lands.</P><P>     Although oil wells and cattle are not usually associated with wildlife sanctuaries, at Rainey their presence makes sense. Royalties from oil and grazing fees from cattle provide Audubon revenue for operations, land acquisitions or improvements in existing land holdings.</P><P>     Drilling and grazing complement wildlife habitat on the preserve for two reasons. First, Rainey's managers seek to minimize environmental damage through restrictions on drilling during nesting seasons. Using careful timing, grazing, a notorious threat to wildlife on public lands, is an ecological tool. Second, those who wish to graze or drill have incentives to offer environmental sensitivity as well as high bids. In Rainey we see ecological entrepreneurship in action. Let's foster such innovations in the old growth of the national forests.</P><P>     Private, nonprofit land ownership avoids widespread subsidies to unprofitable logging, mining, and grazing. It is these subsidies that have created the West's most painful ecological disasters. Private ownership readily adapts to different times and places with innovative management techniques. For example, Rainey uses controlled burning to encourage growth of three-cornered grass that (snow) geese relish - a technique long disfavored on government lands. Finally, private ownership reduces the influence of perverse incentives leading to bureaucratic budgets, political vote buying, and time and money wasted on inconclusive political and legal battles.</P><P>     A lasting solution to the old-growth dilemma will require more than good intentions, lofty rhetoric, and admonitions for mutual respect. It will require shifting the management of environmental resources from public bureaucrats to private, often nonprofit, decision-makers. Political management inevitably makes policy the captive of special interests and science subject to politics. It gives bureaucracies license to mismanage, waste, and serve their perverse institutional goals.</P><P>     As a modest experiment, let's transfer 20 percent of the federal old growth to the environmental groups. They are far more likely than bureaucrats and politicians to find ways to make good things like prosperity and environmental quality go together.</P><P>___________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           EACH June, at the end of the academic year, I head back to FREE's office in Bozeman, Mont., and spend the summer on a nearby ranch. I cannot imagine a better &quot;commute&quot; than between Seattle and the northern reaches of the Yellowstone ecosystem. On these drives I always recall John Steinbeck's suggestion that Montana would be heaven if it only had an ocean. And I wonder how we can preserve these values.</P><P>       A hint comes from the recent Forbes magazine featuring Bill Gates. I respect Gates, not for his billions, but for his innovation and entrepreneurship. He has created value through a mix of intelligence, inspiration and force of will.</P><P>     Our environment needs such an entrepreneur, a person who can discover a new paradigm for recognizing those values, like biodiversity, which are outside today's market. But all too often there is no good link between our environmental values and large, bureaucratic institutions. Multimillion-dollar environmental groups lobby Congress for more laws while corporations lobby to resist.</P><P>     The losers in this environmental policy arena often end up in court in an effort to win what was lost in Congress. Environmental laws and backup bureaucracies slog along with unsatisfactory results. The options are discouraging.</P><P>     We need more innovation from small and quick organizations with site-specific information, and local as well as global concern. We need creative institutions whose leaders find ways to reach environmental values economically and economic values environmentally. Responsible liberty is a requisite to such success.</P><P>     Government can only do so much. It can change the rules of the game to the benefit of this group or that, but as the timber industry has learned, tides can quickly change. Since we can only rent - never buy - politicians, no battle is won, only prolonged. And government seldom creates. It seldom finds ways to make the pie larger, only different ways to cut it - often with a huge kerf in the form of overhead and inefficiency.</P><P>     From society's perspective, successful entrepreneurs are the</P><P> chefs who create new and better dishes from ingredients and combinations not previously seen or realized. They provide the closest thing we have to a free lunch, and they respond quickly to changing tastes and preferences.</P><P>     A small number of environmental entrepreneurs have long been with us. The Boone and Crockett Club, led by Teddy Roosevelt, was founded in 1887 by America's first conservationists.</P><P>     On my way to Montana I will pass near the club's recently established Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch. The ranch's mission is to find ways in which wildlife and ranching can peacefully and productively coexist. It is to be a profitable ranch and a wildlife research center.</P><P>     If it is successful, and so far it seems to be, the ranch will be a model for others. By encouraging species to which many ranchers are hostile, and by succeeding, it can aid ecological balance throughout the West. Wolf reintroduction, for example, is unlikely to succeed if ranchers cannot manage their impact. My wife and I know from experience on our ranch how difficult predators can be. The Roosevelt Ranch may show ranchers how predators may be accommodated with minimal loss of livestock. If so, their presence surely would enhance the West.</P><P>     Closer to Seattle, The Village Conservancy is seeking new ways to insert environmentally sensitive housing into natural environments without diminishing those environments.</P><P>     A nonprofit group, the Conservancy seeks to bring landowners together to create low-impact communities in which individuals will have only minimal land for their homes while jointly owning surrounding acreage, which would be managed for aesthetic and conservation values. Such a trial project by The Village Conservancy for the North Fork Valley of Issaquah Creek was authorized recently by the King County Council.</P><P>     Governmental authorization of innovative land use is unusual and commendable. Such action implies intelligence and political courage.</P><P>     Environmental entrepreneurs produce social value by identifying new opportunities and motivating action. In this way, voluntary grass-roots cooperation fosters our environmental goals. The small associations envisioned by The Village Conservancy must, if they are to function effectively, be created by mutual consent and mutual interest. They are unlikely to be the solution for everyone.</P><P>     But with new options, like those envisioned by The Village Conservancy, the more likely we are to harmonize liberty, prosperity, and ecology.</P><P>     Whether it be integrating an old way of life with more recent environmental concerns, as on the Roosevelt Ranch, or creating new communities and associations centered around environment conservation with The Village Conservancy, environmental entrepreneurship shows its value.</P><P>___________ </P><P> John A.

Twice in August we had snow at 6,500 feet. Our ranch is between Bozeman and Big Sky, Mont. Normal rainfall is just under 20 inches per year.</P><P> This year we had 14.5 inches in July. Hay wouldn't cure and the barley is still in the field. &quot;Where is global warming when we need it?&quot; was a common question, repeated over the summer as a series of visitors joined up in the Big Sky country.</P><P>     Despite this, our annual migration back to FREE's summer office was wonderfully rewarding. We worked hard, played hard and got the mix just right. FREE hosted a week-long seminar in environmental economics for academics and another, co-sponsored by the Environmental Management program at UW's Business School, for federal judges.</P><P>     We held several shorter programs for business leaders and environmental writers. A summer highlight was our annual &quot;seminar on wheels,&quot; a 407-mile bike trip from Yellowstone to Glacier national parks. (Economists call our team the FREE riders.) This was a seven-day exercise in stoic epicurism. We twice ground our way up the Continental Divide, Marias and Flesher passes, but as a result could indulge our appetites with impunity. Ah, the leisure of the theory class.</P><P>     Aside from the writers, few of our guests specialize in environmental matters. Most accepted conventional environmental perspectives and were surprised that I do not. &quot;How can you care about environmental quality and yet reject the `green' view?&quot; was a recurrent question, and &quot;Are you optimistic about Gore?&quot; another. Here are my answers.</P><P>     I believe that our vice president exemplifies the new public policy elite. He is sensitive, especially about the environment, ambitious, and confident of his superior knowledge of the way things really ought to be. When he ran for president in the spring of 1987, he saw global warming as a key campaign issue. His book, &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; deals with this issue. Gore's treatment of global warming illustrates the process and problems of his brand of environmentalism.</P><P>     &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot; was on the New York Times bestseller list for 22 weeks. Why is this book so attractive to the new policy elite? And why do they ignore arguments that contradict Gore's apocalyptic assertion? Given the recurrent and predictable failures of bureaucratic, command-and-control environmental management, why do Gore and his followers neglect an environmentalism based upon property rights and the market process? Here's my hypothesis.</P><P>     Gore and the new elite specialize in abstract symbols, not material things. They don't get dirty or do heavy lifting. They don't experience the daily reality checks so familiar to most Americans, especially to people who sign payroll checks. The defining characteristics of Gore's peer group include intelligence and a dedication to politics. They seem confident in their ability to know what is good for other people - and quite willing to employ state coercion to enforce its realization. That is how they get things done.</P><P>     Global warming gives them justification to control other people's lives. From their standpoint, global warming is a special kind of environmental issue, for it has a huge political benefit. It gives policy-makers a &quot;legitimate&quot; reason to constrain our liberty to act - e.g., by denying us safe, private vehicles. They want us to believe that the specter of global warming is so severe, the projected consequences so bad, that radical action is necessary. If global warming is both certain and dire, they can justify regulations to prevent this calamity. This is why Gore and others feel compelled to stifle debate and declare the issue decided. As they portray it, global warming gives rulers license to expand their rule.</P><P>     This summer I worked on FREE's upcoming book with the Pacific Research Institute of San Francisco, &quot;Balancing the Earth's Economy and Ecology.&quot; The contributors are a distinguished lot, and they deal with the philosophic and scientific issues of &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot; Some argue that severe global warming is unlikely. And even if some global warming occurs, some consequences will surely be beneficial. On balance, we can't tell.</P><P>     But whether the subject is global warming or deforestation, environmental problems are complex and highly emotional. Good data and clear thinking are required to deal with them. As Gore says in &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; &quot;. . . to exclude inconvenient facts from the calculation of what is good and what is bad is a form of dishonesty&quot; (p. 188). Sensitive and sound environmental understanding is too important for truth to be gored by a collectivist ideology and a quest for governmental control.</P><P>     This is a theme of my Winter Quarter course, &quot;Business and the Environment: the Political Economy of Environmental Policy&quot; (BA 590). Although it's a Business School offering, students from all over the university take it, as do a few townspeople.</P><P>     Some of my lectures become columns. I invite you to follow my Wednesday columns. I welcome your suggestions of topics. The quality of our environment is important enough to merit our most careful and honest consideration.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           DEFENDERS of Wildlife is a national environmental group devoted to the protection of wildlife and the restoration of habitat. For years, Defenders strongly advocated the regulatory approach to species protection. But they now realize the limitations of regulations, particularly when dealing with private landowners. This October, they published a collection of essays titled &quot;Building Economic Incentives into the Endangered Species Act.&quot; The collection features incentive-based approaches to species preservation.</P><P>       Dayton Hyde has also learned the importance of incentives - negative incentives. Hyde is a rancher, conservation writer, and the founder of Operation Stronghold, a private wildlife-conservation group. He created a lake and new wildlife habitat on his ranch, attracting a variety of species including bald eagles. For his efforts, state and federal agencies increasingly regulated his operation.</P><P>     For a time, the Forest Service actually restricted him from entering his property by truck, claiming he might disturb the eagles.</P><P>     Dayton Hyde's experience is all too common. Under the current Endangered Species Act, as well as other laws, landowners frequently improve or protect habitat, then face land-use restrictions imposed by government agencies (commonly the EPA or Fish and Wildlife Service). These restrictions often have perverse ecological and ethical consequences.</P><P>     First, they often impede efforts to protect threatened species and critical habitats. Second, they constitute uncompensated &quot;takings,&quot; a form of political plunder.</P><P>     The Endangered Species Act has failed to encourage species and habitat protection because it employs the wrong kind of incentives. Landowners with threatened species on their property may face restrictions that diminish the value of the property and reduce their income from ranching, farming and similar activities. The Act's negative incentives do not enlist the talents and resources of private landowners. Instead, they often discourage cooperation and innovation.</P><P>     The Fifth Amendment was designed to protect citizens from government takings. Its framers understood the harm caused by negative incentives. But today their wisdom is ignored. Landowners know that designated species are likely to impose significant financial costs and restrict their use of the land. Anticipating restrictions, they may accelerate the destruction of habitat.</P><P>     Norman Hutson Jr., of Fort Lewis, Wash., reluctantly clear-cut his tree farm in anticipation of restrictions to protect the spotted owl. Other landowners may covertly disobey regulations or eliminate species and habitat to preclude losses.</P><P>     In the United States, 50 percent of endangered species dwell almost exclusively on private lands. Given the Endangered Species Act's dismal record on private lands, a new approach is needed. With the Act facing renewal in 1994, there is a tremendous opportunity to erect positive incentives with the creation of Biodiversity Trust Funds.</P><P>     The trust funds would purchase conservation easements, much as the North American Elk Foundation, Trout Unlimited, and Ducks Unlimited have done. The trust funds would pay landowners to pursue conservation on their property and could copy Defenders of Wildlife's policy of paying landowners a bounty when an endangered species breeds on their land. Another possibility, noted by Vice President Jim Kraft of Plum Creek Timber and professor Bruce Lippke of the University of Washington, is to use long-term federal bonds to accelerate purchase and retirement of critical habitats.</P><P>     The forces that control land use are largely economic. With this in mind, trust funds have a significant advantage over the current reliance on legal penalties. By buying land and easements or paying bounties, trust funds create positive financial rewards for saving species and habitats. At the very least, landowners who already favor environmental improvements on their land (and many do) are no longer punished for their efforts. The Dayton Hyde dilemma is avoided.  Landowners who are good stewards are rewarded or compensated for creating wetlands, preserving old-growth trees, or encouraging wolves to breed on their lands.</P><P>     In the environmental area as elsewhere, rewards work much better than penalties. They foster innovation and entrepreneurship in environmental protection. With rewards, ranchers might reserve some lands from grazing to improve wildlife habitat, then charge recreationalists and hunters user fees. Commercial forest owners could lengthen rotation times of harvest and selectively log their older trees. Whatever specific approach is taken, owners would have financial incentives to nurture environmental health. Rewards also make compliance and progress easy to monitor because landowners advertise their environmental improvements.</P><P>     Penalties, like fines or imprisonment, are often less effective. They make monitoring difficult because they encourage landowners to covertly evade the law, accelerating logging or eliminating species before costly regulations are enacted or enforced. Penalties also encourage some landowners to abandon commercial or recreational projects, even if these projects could have been undertaken in environmentally sound ways. Private caution becomes society's loss.</P><P>     Incentives are a major factor in shaping individual behavior. Reform of the Endangered Species Act offers an important opportunity to encourage species and habitat protection, not discourage it. By linking personal gain with environmental health and by using cooperation rather than fines, imprisonment, and &quot;takings,&quot; a reformed Environmental Species Act can harmonize ecology, individual creativity and initiative, and prosperity.</P><P>_______________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>            I HAVE long held a vision of what a good society would include. Its most important elements are liberty, environmental quality and communities of people who value both. But only certain institutional arrangements foster these ends. History is unlikely to show that yesterday's election moved us toward these goals.</P><P>       But elections do cause thoughtful people to carefully separate their hopes from their expectations. We hope that people will weigh the public interest more heavily than their narrow self interest. However, elections usually teach us to expect concentrated interests to prevail and government to grow.</P><P>     Organized interests solidify their gains by creating institutions and agencies. With these in place, even modest reforms become difficult to enact. We see this in the protracted efforts to increase the price of grazing federal lands. For grazing on our family's Montana ranch we charge more than $10 per cow and calf per month. On federal land near ours, permit holders such as Metropolitan Life Insurance pay $1.85 for their Forest Service and BLM grass.</P><P>     This is a predictable consequence of political allocation. We would surely be far better off if the grazing rights recognized the value of wildlife habitat and were freely exchangeable on the open market. But today's political incentives work against such rational outcomes. This is just one example of a program that violates reasonable standards of economic efficiency, ecological sensitivity and social equity.</P><P>     America's founders understood that when governments control large sectors of an economy, governance becomes an exercise in relatively peaceful, although involuntary, wealth transfers. Stealth and duplicity are great assets in this game. It often takes great skill and dedication to discover these transfers.</P><P>     But the benefits of reform are widely diffused. No individual has an economic incentive to advocate reform as strongly as the beneficiaries do to preserve existing institutions. Large permit holders such as Metropolitan Life have more to gain from their subsidies than any single one of us will gain by fighting them. Today, only the congenital do-gooder has incentives to expose the waste and inequities of political mischief. I propose a modest reform: Let's create a Predatory Bureaucracy.</P><P>     The logic is simple and straightforward. It is part of the convergence developing between ecological and economic theory. Essentially, the predatory bureau would receive a small percentage of any budgetary proposal offered by an agency. Here's an outline of the process I initially envisioned.</P><P>     For most of us the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; carries a crust of derision. Rigidity, inflexibility, insensitivity and persistence are their defining characteristics. However good our intentions in creating an agency, its budgetary imperatives ultimately lead it to stray from these goals. Over the long haul, bureaucracies are usually run for the convenience of its leaders and the clientele on whom they depend for political support. For those of us wanting reform, our design problem is to link this persistent tendency with the public interest. The predatory bureaucracy does so.</P><P>     We can learn a lot from a relatively successful example. The U.S. Post Office is closely and consistently monitored and faces increasing competition from Federal Express, fax, etc. Despite our complaining, the Post Office actually does quite well because it faces the kind of feedback we expect in the market. What can we do about agencies that do not have these checks on their performance? Here is where our &quot;predatory bureau&quot; can help advance the public interest.</P><P>     A predatory bureaucracy survives only by preying upon other bureaucracies' budgets. Like coyotes to rabbits and wolves to elk, it will eliminate many vulnerable programs.</P><P>     The basic idea is simple enough to write into a state initiative. We should create an agency whose income will only come preying upon the specific program budgets of other agencies. Suppose an agency proposes a new program, or seeks to continue an obsolete one. Our predatory agency may challenge this proposal. It will use the press, interest groups and other political avenues.</P><P>     Unlike most of us, this agency has a vital interest in defeating a wasteful idea because (unlike most agencies) it only gets funding from its successes. If the other agency's proposal loses, it receives 1 percent of the defeated agency's budget proposal. And the defeated agency loses that 1 percent and gets a proportional amount taken from its operating budget.</P><P>     After an initial two-years' funding, this agency will cost taxpayers nothing. Its income comes only from other agencies. Because all agencies will begin to act more wisely, on pain of being attacked by our predator, enormous amounts of tax money will be saved due to weak programs not being proposed.</P><P>     Incorporating a predatory bureaucracy into government may do more than elections to control government waste. It's a way to harmonize the public interest with the self-interest of experts in the political process. Let's consider this idea while waiting for next November.</P><P>_________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>PEOPLE who believe in the power of government to do good probably found it outrageous that the U.S. Senate squandered weeks debating higher grazing fees, a financially trivial issue. The Western Senators' filibuster diverted the Senate from critically important issues like NAFTA and health care. But this posturing is a predictable consequence of political management of the Western range.</P><P>       Current policies encourage overgrazing, discourage range improvements, inhibit innovation and sharply restrict allowable uses on the 315 million acres of public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service. But below-cost grazing fees are not the primary source of ecological problems. The sources are rigid bureaucracies and insecure property rights.</P><P>     When looking at grazing fee &quot;subsidies,&quot; most commentators ignore an important fact: Aside from unanticipated inflation, the value of the &quot;subsidy&quot; has largely been incorporated into the sales price of private ranches with grazing privileges on public range. The BLM and Forest Service permits are attached to a &quot;base unit&quot; property (i.e., a private ranch). The ranch's sales price captures the value of cheap public grazing that comes with it.</P><P>     It is as if a car came with a sticker entitling the owner to 20 cent a gallon gas. The car with the sticker would sell for more than one without because it includes a valuable subsidy. Similarly, subsidies increase the value of a ranch possessing federal grazing permits.</P><P>     Ranchers who received the original fee subsidy in 1934 died with a one-time windfall gain. But many present owners have already paid for the subsidy through higher prices when they bought ranches with public grazing permits. Most present owners can afford higher fees, but ethically, this is irrelevant.  While we should adjust fees for inflation, it seems unfair to impose a penalty on present owners just because the original owners received an unjust, unearned financial gain.</P><P>     Dr. Karl Hess Jr., a range ecologist, expert on Western lands and author of &quot;Visions Upon the Land,&quot; notes that higher fees are unlikely to improve ecological conditions and reduce overgrazing on the public range. If we want improvement, we need to change existing institutional arrangements, not simply fiddle with prices.</P><P>     Ecological and social problems are caused by regulations that encourage poor management practices - grazing too many cows and sheep, underinvesting in range improvements and maintenance and failing to replace domestic stock with more valuable wildlife. As noted above, poor management persists for two reasons: bureaucracy and imperfectly transferable property rights. Better management will follow secure, well-defined, and transferable property rights for those who use the public range, be they a private ranch or the Nature Conservancy Trust.</P><P>    I suggest a modest reform. Give those with privileges to graze on public land the opportunity to buy a grazing right at a price incorporating the future value of the &quot;subsidized&quot; fee. Economists call this price the capitalized value of the fee. Logically, it would be similar to converting an apartment to a condominium. Future rents of the apartment are capitalized into the sale price of the condominium.</P><P>     With this reform, ranchers would have legal property rights to the public forage. They could exchange those rights among themselves or sell them to those with other interests, e.g., ecological diversity, wildlife habitat for hunters, or stream-side preservation. These interests are growing and new ones will surely develop.</P><P>     Incorporating the subsidy into the permit's price avoids penalizing owners who &quot;purchased&quot; a subsidy when they bought their private land and should reduce their opposition to reform. Everyone is better off because current owners retain access to the public range and taxpayers no longer subsidize management. There are also new incentives for innovation.</P><P>     At present, the permit is only for grazing domestic livestock, even if the land has greater value for wildlife or recreation. BLM policy dictates that grazing privileges must be used. If not used, they are sold to others. Thus, when organizations acquire public range privileges and try to retire them from grazing, the privileges are stripped away. Last April, this happened to the Nature Conservancy in Mercer vs. BLM. If grazing rights were freely transferable, diverse uses would flourish, reflecting emerging environmental values.</P><P>     A legal property right to forage on public lands would also discourage overgrazing and encourage range improvements. Ranchers could rest overused lands without fear of regulatory reprisal. Moreover, if ranchers knew they would benefit from range improvements, they are more likely to replant native grasses and forbs that have been destroyed by a century of overgrazing. Cooperating with others, some would also manage for wildlife.</P><P>     Environmentalists and those seeking efficient government can join to promote institutional reforms that recognize new ecological understandings and changing tastes. When we allocate via politics, special interests and financial waste will prevail. Property rights and voluntary arrangements are far more responsive - and often more responsible. </P><P>------------------------------------------------------------------- </P><P>John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IT is easy to be an enthusiastic supporter of recycling, especially in Seattle. Recycling requires little effort from consumers and appears to eliminate waste and alleviate pressures on the environment. Recycling is an easy choice for those who believe it will always save money and resources. They have little problem equating it with conservation and making it a litmus test for green values.</P><P>       But recycling is not always a wise idea. Like many good things it entails tradeoffs, tradeoffs that make its environmental effects ambiguous and dependent on local circumstances. Recycling consumes valuable labor, capital, time and urban space. It imposes environmental and economic costs through transportation, sorting, processing and remanufacturing and sometimes these costs outweigh the gains of reusing a resource. Without knowledge of the tradeoffs, a knowledge usually communicated through prices, it is difficult to make responsible decisions.</P><P>      Lynn Scarlett of the Reason Foundation is someone who has studied the tradeoffs inherent to recycling. She analyzed seven of the best curbside recycling programs in the United States and found that the net cost was $110 per ton after subtracting an average salvage value of $35 per ton. These were the best cases. The average net cost for curbside recycling is about $150 to $200 per ton. Much of the gap between costs and value is a deadweight loss, a needless waste of resources.</P><P>      However, Scarlett's results should not be taken to indicate that all recycling is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. Some early losses in recycling can be investments in experiments that may ultimately pay off. The problem is that it is difficult to determine whether recycling a specific object, such as plastic soft drink bottles (Polyethylene Terephthalate, or P.E.T.), makes environmental sense. Like so many things in life, it depends.</P><P>      One of the things on which it depends is our position on the recycling learning curve (i.e., how much we know about recycling an object). When producing any good, the first units are often quite expensive. For example, computing power used to be very expensive. The first computer, ENIAC, cost the U.S. government $3 million and delivered less computing power than a modern calculator. Today, the same computing power is available for roughly $30. This is the learning curve at its best - producing vastly better products at much lower prices. Though less dramatic, the same logic applies to recycling; the longer we recycle, the more efficient and effective we become.</P><P>      Now this rule only applies when recycling programs generate incentives to innovate and learn. Plans that do not, like Germany's &quot;green dot&quot; program, are extremely wasteful. The German system mandates that firms must recycle a certain percentage of their products. Like many government plans, it makes recycling a burden rather than an opportunity and thereby discourages innovation. We can expect far better results from recycling efforts designed by producers and supported by consumers.</P><P>      There are some attractive recycled products coming onto the market as firms ascend the learning curve. Patagonia, for example, has recently introduced a new Synchilla fleece. This fabric is 80 percent recycled fiber made from (P.E.T.) soda-pop bottles and 20 percent virgin polyester. It is slightly more expensive than the fabric it replaced and is not quite as soft. Nevertheless, people love the fleece and the idea behind it. Wholesalers have already sold out their fall stocks.</P><P>      BMW presents another example with the planned introduction of the first 100 percent recyclable car and auto-recycling facility. Both firms are using profits from sales of existing products to subsidize the development of recyclable products. In doing so they are pushing the market up the recycling learning curve.</P><P>      Efforts to recycle among firms producing luxury or high-end products offer an interesting dilemma. Although &quot;Beamers&quot; are often derided as yuppie toys and Patagonia satirized as &quot;Patagucci,&quot; the customers and stockholders of these firms are subsidizing movement up the learning curve. Their efforts to commercialize recycling provide a significant public good.</P><P>      As the technology pioneered by &quot;luxury&quot; firms advances and less-workable ideas are filtered out, the cost of producing recycled products decrease. (Today, P.E.T. is actually less expensive than virgin material for carpet fiber). This encourages wider use of recycled material. Firms serving larger markets, like WalMart and Costco, will ultimately feature recycled products as the most successful processes are refined.</P><P>      Recycling can be environmentally harmful and economically wasteful. Unfortunately, these problems are most likely when politics intervenes and obscures the existence of tradeoffs. Politics can push recycling too hard by mandating trendy but harmful and inefficient programs, like recycled content mandates. These approaches stifle innovation and creativity. Although the market is by no means perfect, when prices approximate full costs, it provides the best path toward socially and environmentally responsible products.</P><P>________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>            AT a conference last October, I listened to a speech by Gregory Benford, a respected biophysicist and acclaimed writer of science fiction. He noted that the 19th century had been dominated scientifically and culturally by chemistry, the 20th by physics, and predicted the 21st would be dominated by biology.</P><P>       Professor Benford is undoubtedly correct that the coming &quot;Biological Century&quot; promises staggering benefits, benefits likely to rival those wrought by chemistry and physics. But there will also be resistance. Before we can judge how to react to biological developments and their opponents, it may be helpful to consider some relevant facts.</P><P>      One important point is that biotechnology has already produced many useful innovations. For example, bioengineered human insulin has reduced the discomfort and inconveniences of diabetes. Drought- and disease-resistant crops have dramatically improved yields worldwide and reduced the need for fertilizers, pesticides and cropland. Perhaps most impressive of all, the ambitious Human Genome Project is already increasing our knowledge of genetics and revealing the causes of many inheritable diseases.</P><P>      Consider one potentially beneficial innovation: synthetic bovine somatotropin (BST), a replica of the hormone that stimulates lactation in cows. Synthetic BST supplements cows' natural hormones, increasing milk production by an average of 9 pounds per cow per day. It is environmentally beneficial because it increases the amount of milk that can be produced from a given amount of grains and grasses. But such wonders are costly. Monsanto, a leading pharmaceutical company, spent an estimated $300 to $500 million developing BST during the 1980s.</P><P>      BST has undergone extensive safety testing. In 1985, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that its use poses no danger to humans or cows. The FDA found that milk from cows treated with BST is virtually indistinguishable from other cows' milk. It has the same proteins, nutrients and concentrations of BST as milk from untreated cows. The National Institutes of Health, American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health Organization have also found BST to be completely safe for humans.</P><P>      In spite of the financial and research investments made to ensure BST's effectiveness and safety, certain groups have strongly opposed its introduction. The opposition has three sources: genuine fears that modified organisms may be harmful to humans or the environment; political entrepreneurs who seek to benefit by creating a crisis atmosphere, and special interests whose political privileges are threatened by its introduction.</P><P>      Such opportunistic opposition to innovation has great risks. It can increase the already significant costs of developing products like BST, slowing their rate of introduction and denying people their benefits.</P><P>      Apprehension regarding BST is understandable and I, too, urge caution. But after years of study and research, little, if any, danger is likely. Bioengineered organisms have caused no harm to people or the environment even after dozens of field tests and the escape of millions of microbes from laboratories. The National Academy of Sciences, Ecological Society of America and most DNA biologists agree that biotechnology poses minimal risks if properly monitored. BST is no exception.</P><P>      The opposition voiced by political entrepreneurs and special interests is less principled. As demonstrated by the Alar scare (not a biotech product), these groups are quite willing to purposely mislead the public through incorrect science and media hype.</P><P>      Jeremy Rifkin is perhaps the most prominent political entrepreneur in the realm of biotechnology. Rifkin has made a career from fear-mongering - authoring numerous anti-technological books and running his &quot;nonprofit&quot; Foundation for Economic Trends. Ignoring scientific evidence and preying on the public's lack of information, he has implied that BST and other biotech products are unhealthy or unnatural. By creating public opposition, he increases the pressure on legislators and regulators to institute policies that slow biotechnological innovation.</P><P>      The conflict over BST is a harbinger of things to come. If selfishly motivated individuals are allowed to manipulate public opinion and the regulatory process without being accountable for the accuracy of their facts, we will seriously curtail the development of biotechnology. This would be an enormous tragedy because the benefits it promises are immense and within reach.</P><P>      The century of biology is neither guaranteed nor automatic. If it is to blossom we must ensure that regulatory decisions follow sound science and the interests of the citizenry, not the machinations of special interests. The alternative will leave all of us poorer. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

BADEN</P><P> I'M BACK HOME in Montana for the Christmas break. It's zero degrees at daybreak, no wind, clear day. It's great to be on the ranch, but there is something I miss. This morning brought it back.</P><P>       In this holiday season when we show understanding toward others, it helps to know people who spend their lives living in the rural spaces of the country. Most of us who spend our time in cities cannot know about the rural way of life or understand those who identify with the Wise Use movement. Coming back to Montana always helps me understand why people want to protect the life they have here.</P><P>       This morning was like a morning 23 years ago: Daylight breaking, just below zero, no wind, off to work, a great day in the making. I'd like to share the best part.</P><P>       Up Taylor Fork of the West Gallatin River, about 15 miles from Yellowstone Park, I heard a beautiful and moving sound. This morning it came back in my mind. It's still beautiful, and it still moves me.</P><P>       It's quiet at dawn, at zero degrees, at 7,000 feet - no background noise. Any sound captures attention. And I hear this deep, rhythmic, resonant, powerful call. It told me, &quot;Let's go. It's cold out, but we aren't very cold yet and soon we'll both be warm.&quot; If the sun stays out and the wind stays down I'll shed my jacket by noon and work in long johns and a shirt until lunch. I'll enjoy the food and the rest. I'll need the recharge.</P><P>       I wish I could write sounds, for my story is better if you hear this. This sound is compelling, and its message is passing. This and other sounds of the West remind people of better times.</P><P>       The sound starts deep, regular and rhythmic. It's loud but muffled. We can't see its source, yet we know what it is - but today it's a bit different. What's happened?</P><P>        A faller's saw wouldn't start, and he's standing on the tracks of a D 7 Cat with his chain saw over the exhaust. They're warming up together. His saw will start; the Cat's wake-up purr will shift to a good working growl, changing with load and slope.</P><P>       We were good at doing solid work, making logs from trees and getting them to a mill where they were converted to products people wanted. Although few on the crew thought of it this way, we were part of the international economy. Our work in the woods was economic coordination spontaneously at work. Here are the details we experienced and enjoyed.</P><P>       Cutters put standing trees on the ground without hanging the falling trees on others. They stuck the nail of the tape on the butt of what would become the first log. They walked the tree, limbing it on the way, then bucked it to log length, two or three logs per tree. Skidders jumped off their Cats, set chokers on two to six logs, swung back into the Cat and hit the winch.</P><P>       The mainline of the rigging tightened, and the chokers came taut. Maneuvering the Cat to avoid hang-ups on stumps, the skidder headed for the landing. He'd unhook the chokers and deck the logs, then spin the Cat and go for another turn. Football linebackers and collegiate wrestlers are well-suited to this work.</P><P>       It was great! I miss it still. And I didn't need a workout before going to work.</P><P>       We worked together and with nature. The faller and Cat skinner warming engines together, falling and bucking were with an eye toward choker setting and skidding; otherwise the snow would soon hide the logs. The work, the action, the coordination, the clear and unambiguous value of what we produced, I liked it a lot. Occasionally, when looking for something else in the ranch's shop, I find artifacts of those years.</P><P>       The story of that morning 23 years ago illustrates parts of the Wise Use philosophy so many critics ignore: strength, skill, trust, teamwork producing real products with obvious value. Neglecting these values in the interest of promoting a &quot;new West,&quot; all green and sensitive but absent grease and guts, isn't fully honest.</P><P>       As lattes replace logging boots, arrogance often overrides empathy. There are good people out there who identify with Wise Use. They have different and competing visions for the West's future. I thought of them this holiday season.</P><P>       I respect the best of these people just as I respect the best of my academic colleagues. I can't forget them even though I work more with symbols than with metal and drink wine rather than whiskey. The world they envision is no more. Like the open range, it can't be preserved in its old form. I'd like to help smooth the transition to a sustainable economy that respects liberty and recognizes the culture of our recent past.</P><P>       This is the holiday season that stresses good will to all. I hope we will have enough good will to realize that there are values of the old that would benefit the new Northwest. Perhaps we can build new communities with shared values of liberty and environmental quality. This is my goal for the new year. You are welcome to join me. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

And many environmentalists are gloating.</P><P>      They are using the grizzly, the wolf and the salmon - symbolically some of America's most important creatures - together with one of the most obscure, the northern spotted owl, to hold development hostage.</P><P>      But if pushed to its ultimate extreme, the Endangered Species Act could so disrupt economies that pressure to amend it - or challenge it on constitutional grounds - will become irresistible.</P><P>      Environmentalists do a good job of explaining the prime rule of ecology: Everything is tied to everything else. We can never do just one thing; everything in an ecosystem is linked. This is why &quot;indicator species&quot; that measure the quality of habitat, such as the spotted owl, are important. A threat to them indicates the system is awry.</P><P>      However, we are also learning that such interdependence applies equally to political and economic systems: There, too, it is impossible to do only one thing. We take one action and see unintended consequences.</P><P>      Those of us who value the endangered wolf, grizzly or owl's habitat should ask the same question for any actions taken under the Endangered Species Act - especially when that law begins to affect private-property rights.</P><P>      The political process inevitably links economics and ecology. People's ecological concern is directly related to their security and prosperity. Since economic as well as ecological systems are highly dynamic, proposed changes are likely to bring unintended mischief. We are seeing this unfold with the spotted owl.</P><P>      The reaction from the timber industry and many Northwest politicians to preserving a habitat of 11.3 million acres was vitriolic. At a rally in May, Washington Gov. Booth Gardner told 3,000 loggers and their families: &quot;The latest designation of habitat is unnecessary, unacceptable and inconsistent with the law, and we can't allow it.&quot;</P><P>      On the same day, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer barred the U.S. Forest Service from selling any more timber in northern-spotted-owl habitat until it finished writing rules to ensure the bird's survival.</P><P>      If there is any certainty in the spotted-owl saga, it is that the government will not voluntarily compensate private landowners for their losses in helping to save the owl. Like the spotted owl, property rights are threatened, if not endangered.</P><P>      The critical habitat plan for preserving the spotted owl has many unintended consequences. Some of these, like the loss of timber-related jobs, are obvious. Others are less apparent. Among these hidden consequences is the impact on management incentives of property owners.</P><P>      There is no doubt that the Endangered Species Act applies to private lands. Under Fish and Wildlife Service regulations, private landowners are prohibited from &quot;taking&quot; or &quot;harming&quot; listed species. There is nothing in the act that speaks to the taking or harming of private-property rights, but there is such a provision in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</P><P>      The spotted-owl controversy is the tip of the iceberg of conflict between endangered-species protection and private-property rights. The Fish and Wildlife Service also is on the verge of listing the Columbia River sockeye salmon as endangered.</P><P>      The sockeye is only the first of many anadromous fish runs being studied by the agency. The potential impact for private rights in land and water could make the spotted-owl regulations seem insignificant.</P><P>      The Endangered Species Act specifically states that economic factors are not to play a role in the decision to list a species as threatened or endangered.</P><P>       Many biologists even questioned the appropriateness of placing two economists on the recovery task force for the spotted owl. Once a recovery plan is written, the only incentive for public and private land managers to follow the plan is the threat of a lawsuit if they do not.</P><P>      A far better solution would be to use economic incentives to help protect endangered species. One approach would create a Biodiversity Trust Fund, derived from a fixed percentage of the revenues from public land activities - such as logging, mining, grazing and recreation - that impinge on wildlife habitat.</P><P>      If these resources were sold at fair market value, and 10 percent were paid to the fund, between $500 million and $1 billion per year would be available to protect critical wildlife habitat.</P><P>      A Biodiversity Fund board of trustees, consisting of respected scientists with specialties in fields such as evolutionary biology and restoration ecology, could be nominated by the National Academy of Sciences to allocate this money.</P><P>       They could buy conservation easements in the areas where disturbances might harm listed species.

In the end, protection would be possible for a wider number of species without all the political and legal turmoil that now surrounds the Endangered Species Act.</P><P>      And the Endangered Species Act might no longer be endangered.</P><P>________________</P><P> John Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE), with offices in Bozeman, Mont., and Seattle. </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

BADEN</P><P>           THE Montana chapter of Defenders of Wildlife has announced a new program to encourage wolf re-introduction. This is noteworthy because it seeks to do so with the help of ranchers, until now some of the wolves' staunchest  opponents. This approach could hold the key to fostering the recovery of  endangered species nationwide and have implications for the Northwest's debate  over the spotted owl.</P><P>  While the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires species preservation, it does little to address the means of such preservation. The Defenders of Wildlife  program pledges to pay $5000 to any landowner in the Northern Rockies who has wild wolves successfully reproduce on their private land.</P><P>     &quot;Our fondest dream is to give away a lot of money,&quot; says Hank Fischer of Defenders of Wildlife. The wolf program will supplement the ESA and its  mandates, utilizing the power of economic incentives, which until now have  worked against the wolf.</P><P>     There are many reasons why the carrot of economic incentives may be more  effective than the stick of the ESA. It turns opponents of preserving specific  species into proponents by offering to pay for their assistance. Hundreds of  individuals will now seek ways to directly improve wolf habitat instead of being indifferent at best, hostile and destructive at worst. Individuals who are being paid to harbor wolves are unlikely to sue over land-use restrictions. And it is a first step toward recognizing the real economic importance of endangered species.</P><P>     While conservationists argue that species are &quot;priceless,&quot; that does not change the reality and incentives facing those who are most directly affected by recovery efforts. The decision to foster species recovery is ecological, but the impacts are economic and political. Those impacts must be addressed before successful recovery can take place.</P><P>     The prime rule of ecology - that everything in an ecosystem is linked - explains why &quot;indicator species&quot; that measure the quality of habitat (such as the spotted owl) are important. A threat to them indicates the system is awry.</P><P>     Such interdependence is also found in political and economic systems. There, too, it is impossible to do only one thing. We take one action and see unintended consequences as the spontaneous order adjusts. Mandates that seem simple from Washington, D.C., have unexpected consequences when implemented in the West.</P><P>     Under the current system, no federal agency has an incentive to consider  economic efficiency. Once a recovery plan is written, the only incentive for  public and private land managers to follow the plan is the threat of a lawsuit, the stick, if they do not. The Defenders of Wildlife have tried to change that by offering the carrot.</P><P>     Since 1987, the Defenders of Wildlife have run a program that compensated ranchers for cattle killed by wolves. It has paid over $12,000 to 10 Montana ranchers who have lost cattle. However, this program, while reducing the risk to ranchers, gave them little incentive to actually facilitate wolf re-introduction. Indeed, many still believe that the associated hassle is not worth the benefits of wolf re-introduction.</P><P>     Ranchers risk losing control of their property when a wolf pack chooses their land as its territory. The long arm of the federal Endangered Species Act could force them to alter long-established land-use practices if they threatened the viability of a resurgent wolf population. An endangered species takes precedence over private property rights. Not only could ranchers lose control over their property, but they risked their cattle as well. Even if they would be compensated for predator loss, was it worth the hassle?</P><P>       This is the central problem of the Endangered Species Act: It imposes the costs of species survival not widely upon those who like the animals, but narrowly upon those who own the habitat. This is the preservationists version of the NIMBY problem: Many people like wolves, but Not In My Barn Yard. Just as few people wish to live next to a waste incinerator, few ranchers with horses and other livestock want the worries of wolf predation.</P><P>     This is where the Defenders of Wildlife has entered. By pledging to pay ranchers who have wolf dens on their lands, they have changed the entire incentive structure. Now if a rancher has habitat that attracts a pack of wolves, he has incentives to encourage their success. Instead of seeking to hide the wolves presence - &quot;shoot, shovel and shut-up&quot; - he would inform scientists and wildlife officials so that he might be compensated. Instead of discouraging continued habitation through various, possibly illegal, means, he might choose to improve habitat to ensure future payments. More could be spent studying growing populations and less spent turning ecologists into law-enforcement officers.</P><P>     No longer will those who have the most reason to oppose wolves be charged  with their upkeep. The costs would be spread among those who most strongly  desire healthy wolf populations. It is likely that this will result in more rapid population expansion, to the benefit of both those who love wolves and those who harbor them.</P><P>     The issue of wolves in Montana can teach us much about our own debates over the spotted owl. The Defenders of Wildlife have shown us how the right incentives can change landowners from victims to supporters of endangered species.</P><IMG SRC="/free/Images/wolf.gif" WIDTH=358 HEIGHT=263><P>__________________</P><P> John A.

NAFTA would create the world's largest free-trade zone, encompassing over 360 million people and $6.2 trillion worth of goods and services a year.</P><P>     The potential benefits are substantial. One recent economic analysis by the Institute for International Economics calculated that NAFTA's adoption would result in a net increase of about 175,000 jobs in the U.S. by 1995. The pact would also benefit Mexico</P><P> by further opening the wealthy U.S. market to their goods, creating jobs and prosperity. And Mexico would benefit as a trade agreement creates new opportunities for direct foreign investment and energizes its rapidly modernizing economy.</P><P>     However, all is not rosy for the future of NAFTA. While both President Bush and Governor Clinton claim to support free trade, both are subject to election-year pressures. This has produced protectionist benefits for brewers, state-owned industries, auto producers, and bankers, among others. Environmentalists and traditional protectionists, &quot;Baptists and Bootleggers&quot; as their unholy alliance is called, have formed a powerful voice against NAFTA and gained a hearing with both Congress and trade negotiators.</P><P>     Earlier this month the House of Representatives voted 362 to 0 in favor of a nonbinding resolution that calls for the trade accord to not jeopardize American health, safety, and environmental standards. Worries abound that Mexico will become a &quot;pollution haven,&quot; spawning a multitude of dirty industries and encouraging U.S. companies to migrate to Mexico to avoid tough domestic environmental laws. However, the best available information suggests that NAFTA will foster both environmental safeguards and progress.</P><P>     The Bush administration states that any trade agreement must &quot;maintain the right to prohibit the entry of goods that do not meet U.S. health, safety, pesticide, food and drug and environmental regulations.&quot; The qualifications are (1) such regulations must apply equally to domestic and foreign producers (and therefore not constitute an unfair barrier to trade), and (2) they must have a scientific basis. A trilateral commission composed of trade experts, scientists, and environmentalists is being formed to hear challenges to the environmental rules of trading partners.</P><P>     Much concern about the creation of &quot;pollution havens&quot; centers on Mexico and its lax enforcement of environmental laws. However, the World Bank finds little evidence that companies are willing to move manufacturing plants simply to avoid environmental regulations, as environmental costs form a small percentage of total costs. And it is likely that the increased foreign investment brought by free trade will bring with it advanced pollution control technologies. U.S. multinationals often hold foreign plants and subsidiaries to U.S. environmental standards.</P><P>     Historically, Mexico's environment has been far dirtier than accepted U.S. standards. But that is changing because environmental knowledge, sensitivity, and managerial ability all increase with rising per capita income. These good things go together.</P><P>     For Mexican President Salinas, environmental protection holds a high priority. He has privatized many inefficient and polluting state-owned industries, requiring them to meet tougher environmental standards to which they were not subject as state-owned companies. He has increased his environmental agency's budget from $4.3 million to $88.4 million in five years. Mexico has started to work with the U.S. EPA to clean up the highly polluted maquiladoras assembly plants and the rapidly growing &quot;sister cities&quot; of the border region. The two countries are planning to spend about $1 billion here over the next three years.</P><P>     These steps will go a significant way toward protecting human health and the environment in Mexico. And it is important to note that the best way for the U.S. to ensure that Mexico continues this environmental progress is to support NAFTA.</P><P>     This is because a free-trade agreement brings increased national prosperity - and it is prosperity that fuels demand for higher standards of environmental quality. Rich nations have cleaner environments than do poor nations. Recent research by Professor Donald Coursey of Washington University in St. Louis shows that across time and across countries per capita spending on the environment rises directly with income. Protected land acreage also rises with income, implying that more forest preserves and parks will be created as Mexico grows richer.</P><P>     Delegates at June's Earth Summit in Rio noted that poverty is the chief threat to both the environment and human health. EPA Administrator William Reilly writes about NAFTA that &quot;As the Mexican economy grows, so will its devotion to environmental protection and its ability to pay the costs of environmental stewardship.&quot; The lesson is that environmental quality and economic prosperity are strongly and positively linked. As a free country grows and rises out of subsistence living it becomes more, not less, environmentally friendly.</P><P>     By increasing incomes and promoting economic growth in Mexico through a North American Free-Trade Agreement, the U.S. can increase Mexico's environmental awareness and ability to effectively steward its environmental resources. That is a relationship that should appeal to both environmentalists and free-traders alike.</P><P>______________</P><P> John Baden is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) and teaches in the Environmental Management Program in the School of Business at the University of Washington.

BADEN</P><P>           JAMES Watt, Ronald Reagan's first Secretary of the Interior, was an environmental paradox. To environmentalists, he personified an obsolete view of nature, a view seeing only commercial value in natural resources. But for the Greens, Watt was a useful icon of rapacious industrial exploitation. As such, he deserves much of the credit for the rise of professional environmentalism. He was the enemy that united their followers. He fueled massive fund-raising campaigns to thwart the Reagan Administration's policy directives.</P><P>       As an unapologetic voice for industry, Vice President Dan Quayle is a pale incarnation of James Watt. Quayle, who runs the White House Council on Competitiveness, is the focal point of environmental groups for his deregulatory fervor and pro-business attitude; he supported efforts to allow logging in the Northwest's old-growth forests while dismissing concerns about the spotted owl. His message: the environment costs jobs.</P><P>       The Council's goal is to boost the economy by reducing the burdens of environmental regulations. For example, they proposed reclassifying hazardous waste, allowing the least toxic types to be buried at low cost in municipal landfills. But, independent of the merits of this proposal, it was withdrawn because of election-year environmental sensitivities.</P><P>       Environmental groups strongly favor Democratic vice presidential candidate  Al Gore over Quayle.</P><P>     Sen. Gore has been an environmental advocate for many years and has recently published &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; a personal treatise describing his eco-philosophy and prescriptions for change. He advertises his compassion and commitment to environmental issues and speaks constantly of &quot;the dangerous dilemma that our civilization now faces,&quot; and how he has renewed his commitment to ecology.</P><P>     And Gore's prescriptions are radical. One example from his book is &quot;the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine over, say, a 25-year period.&quot; This is a worrisome proposal because Gore considers only the benefits of this idea and not the concurrent costs. He fails to ask the question that good ecologists must ask when confronting a proposed change, &quot;And then what?&quot; What are the likely direct and indirect consequences of his proposals, such as an increased number of power plants to power the presumed electric cars?</P><P>        When considering the greenhouse effect, Gore asserts that skeptics' theories &quot;should not be given equal weight,&quot; because such consideration, &quot;undermines the effort to build a solid base of public support for the difficult actions we must soon take.&quot; He ignores a recent Greenpeace poll showing that nearly half of the atmospheric scientists polled agreed that we have experienced no warming due to the Greenhouse effect, and that another quarter or so don't feel sufficiently informed to take a position.</P><P>     Most disturbingly, Gore wants an elite to make decisions for a public he seems not to trust. His conscious rejection of open scientific debate and blind advocacy for governmental policies that will drastically affect every American are the marks of zealotry, not understanding.</P><P>     People who &quot;know&quot; the truth often seek coercive government action to enforce their visions. As America's founders so well understood, this approach is seldom the answer to our problems. Gore's unswerving, and uncritical, environmental ideology deserves the same skepticism as Dan Quayle's single-minded and shortsighted protection of business interests.</P><P>       Gore is right, however, when he sees a false dichotomy between jobs and the environment. We can have a clean environment and economic progress. In the long run they are mutually dependent. That is something which Vice President Quayle does not seem to acknowledge.</P><P>     But creating institutions that foster these real benefits is not easy. Converting rhetoric into reality is tough.</P><P>     Both Gore and Quayle could learn that the solutions to environmental problems lie with the cooperation of responsible decision-makers. Solutions must involve knowledge of actions affecting the environment, identification of those decision-makers who influence such actions, and creation of incentives for those decision-makers to act responsibly. The key step is the creation of new legal and economic arrangements that employ property rights and market incentives to achieve environmental ends. This is the environmental leadership America needs.</P><P>     Several environmental groups, such as The Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund, understand and apply this logic. Neither vice presidential contender, talking in absolutes about the apocalypse, whether it be environmental or economic, has yet articulated this understanding. Each promotes his own brand of environmental demagoguery.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE election of Governor Clinton and Senator Gore alerts us to a new environmental movement. They claim to be seeking innovative and efficient ways to achieve environmental goals. For the past 20 years such an alternative approach has been developed. It may at last receive the attention in Washington that it has earned in universities and think tanks.</P><P>       It is called the New Resource Economics (the NRE). It is based upon incentives and voluntary action. It recognizes the role property rights and markets play in coordinating and rationing valuable resources.</P><P>     But other than professional analysts and economists, few people understand the logic or applications. Much of the writing has been scholarly and highly specialized, read only by graduate students under duress. Through this and future columns, I will attempt to bridge this gap between academia and the concerned citizen.</P><P>     Most people in the Northwest are familiar with the battles over timber, spotted owls, and salmon. Traditional lawmaking and regulatory schemes have yet to find productive, mutually acceptable solutions. But there is another way, a win-win approach. It can lead to more environmentally sensitive management. The focus is upon how information and incentives affect decision-makers. There is explicit recognition that differing institutional arrangements generate different incentives and therefore different management decisions.</P><P>     Our natural resources are managed by a variety of legal and economic institutions, including markets, private companies, nonprofit corporations and government. Each has different but predictable benefits and flaws. Markets can only work when we can establish clear and transferable property rights and do so at a low cost. Nonprofits have problems motivating and monitoring their staffs and volunteers. Governmental agencies suffer from bureaucratic inefficiency and often turn into captives of special interests and engines of plunder. When advocating environmental reforms we should recognize that no institutional form is perfect, and consider the information and incentives of each in terms of the goals.</P><P>     This care is required because good intentions are not enough. The forces of self-interest are relentless. Over the long run, if environmental reform is to be successful, our institutions must direct this individual self-interest to environmental quality.</P><P>     Last summer's revelations about political pressures on U.S. Forest Service and Park Service regional leaders are compelling testimonies to the importance of this focus. When our resource and environmental agencies are dependent upon politics, their leaders face incentives to yield to political pressures. When existing incentives remain constant, merely changing agency personnel to those more &quot;committed&quot; will not solve the problem. Only changing the institutions will produce lasting changes.</P><P>     Many of our existing institutions work against environmental stewardship. When decision-makers are insulated from the costs of their actions, or denied access to the benefits, problems follow.</P><P> For example, when individuals are not rewarded for preserving habitat, it is under-produced. When pollution is &quot;free,&quot; it is overproduced.</P><P>     Take the case of the Forest Service. Because it gets money from logging, not recreation, it is no surprise that it zealously promotes logging and road-building. A way to make the Forest Service more responsive to the public is to collect user fees from hikers, bikers, and campers. In a majority of National Forests, recreation could easily generate more net dollars than timber. And in areas where logging continues to be profitable, forest managers would face incentives to reduce its visual and environmental impact to retain their recreation income. In such ways, institutions can be arranged to make economic progress and environmental quality complementary.</P><P>       Private property and markets can be used to foster these mutually beneficial agreements and accommodations. For example, limited oil drilling allowed on the Rainey Preserve, an Audubon-owned migratory bird sanctuary in Louisiana, is an example of this. Oil companies compete to drill and produce in environmentally sensitive ways and Audubon gets royalties with which they expand sanctuaries. In a few more years the wells will be played out but the sanctuary will remain.</P><P>     Contrast this with oil exploration on government lands. Audubon raises money to fight such development. The NRE enables us to see why: By seeking to protect bird habitat on federal lands, Audubon signals environmental concern and generates income. However, it pays none of the opportunity costs of not exploiting that land.</P><P>     Good institutional arrangements, like Audubon's ownership of Rainey, make decision-makers responsible for both costs and benefits of an action, lessen political confrontation, and foster cooperation. Markets and property rights help weigh trade-offs. Because of political pressures, this is exceedingly difficult in government institutions.</P><P>     No institution is perfect, and a mix is required. But private property rights, incentives, voluntary action and entrepreneurial creativity are under-appreciated tools for the environmentalist. They foster the economic progress that encourages environmental concern and the capacity to act upon that concern. These are the features of this new approach that make it attractive to environmental economists and policy analysts. The question is whether the Clinton/Gore administration will demonstrate the political skills required to deliver the outcomes they claim to seek.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           AS PRESIDENT-ELECT Clinton and Vice President-elect Gore look toward Jan. 20, they must confront the problem of reconciling their environmental rhetoric with economic reality. Much is promised: Al Gore's environmental commitment is unprecedented for a vice president and adds to pent-up pressures to address environmental concerns.</P><P>       But this pressure comes during a flat economy and, thanks to Ross Perot, a heightened concern for our ballooning federal debt. These problems will seriously constrain the available options. As forest economist Randal O'Toole said, &quot;the federal deficit has become the nation's No. 1 environmental threat.&quot;</P><P>        We see a resolution in Senator Gore's book &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot; He links fiscal prudence with environmental concern when he proposes that &quot;the first and most obvious changes involve the elimination of those public expenditures . . . that encourage and subsidize environmentally destructive economic activity.&quot; His position merits the support of both the National Taxpayers Union and Greenpeace. This opportunity was missed by the self-professed &quot;fiscally conservative&quot; administrations of the past 12 years.</P><P>     But if the new administration is to successfully advance such reforms, it must have a strong and consistent messenger to forcefully articulate this vision.</P><P>     Fortunately, one exists. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is an unused treasure. Created in 1970 by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), it was to be the ecological equivalent of the Council of Economic Advisers, &quot;to make and furnish . . . recommendations with respect to matters of (environmental) policy.&quot; But it never exercised a strong voice, and under the Reagan administration its funding was drastically cut. Rather than employing the CEQ as an instrument to advance reforms, the Reagan and Bush administrations simply shunted off, defunded and ignored it.</P><P>     The CEQ is required by law to publish an annual environmental-quality report. This volume can be used to show innovative ways to address environmental problems. Many such opportunities exist.</P><P>     For example, west of the 100th meridian, the federal government owns 50 percent of the land. These lands and waters are prime candidates for such reform. The growing field of environmental history documents the century plus of abuse which has plagued these lands as they were exploited by one constituency after another. The policies of government agencies were consistently rigged to benefit special interests. Heralded reforms only changed the channels of political control; they did not pull the plug.</P><P>     Today the West suffers from the bureaucratic residual of the well-intentioned Progressive Era reforms of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Under the Progressive Era's model, modern science and technology were to advance the public interest. Federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service (1896) and the Bureau of Reclamation (1902) were created to provide omniscient, benevolent and far-sighted management.</P><P>     But they didn't. In reality, these agencies led to a century of government mismanagement and special-interest plums. Here, as in Eastern Europe, socialized management has failed to meet high environmental or economic standards while eroding ethics of those who work in or deal with the agencies.</P><P>     This is shown in virtually every government land-management agency: In the Northern and Central Rockies, Forest Regions 1 and 2, every forest lost money in fiscal year 1991, while the Forest Service promoted, through creative accounting and outright subsidies, clear-cutting on lands that would not be logged without government help.</P><P>       The Bureau of Land Management short-changes wildlife and encourages overgrazing while charging far below market rates for livestock. The Mining Law of 1872 allows firms to acquire minerals with no royalties, and then claim the land for nominal sums. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers subsidize the damming of free-flowing rivers to the benefit of a few politically powerful irrigation interests.</P><P>     Politics distorts National Park Service management of sensitive ecosystems and leads to massive disturbances of supposedly protected areas. These are the predictable consequences of political management.</P><P>     All of these abuses are ecologically and economically wasteful. They continue, of course, because the interests who benefit from these arrangements fight to maintain their favored status. They see their way of life threatened by reforms.</P><P>     They are not paranoid. It is threatened, and should be. Most of these government programs are disguised welfare. But in the mountains and on the plains as elsewhere, welfare generates dependency, not wealth. A program's existence should not guarantee its continuance.</P><P>     Perception of our fiscal crisis can drive these overdue reforms. By making users of federal lands, including recreation users, pay their own way, we can address both budgetary and ecological concerns. Hard-nosed analysis must be applied to other government programs as well. For example, government-subsidized coastal flood insurance, in addition to being a subsidy for wealthy home builders and buyers, increases seaside development in ecologically sensitive areas.</P><P>     In this world of scarcity we should always combine environmental concern with economic awareness. The Council on Environmental Quality can articulate these visions. Just as the Council of Economic Advisers has at times provided a strong voice for innovative economic policy prescriptions, the CEQ can provide a strong platform for environmental reform. If the environmental promises of our new administration are to be honored, they must harmonize the environment with economic forces. The CEQ can explain and advertise the appropriate reforms.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           KILLING WOLVES is a dramatic and highly controversial wildlife management practice. Alaska has recently proposed this as a way to boost caribou, moose, and deer populations for tourists and hunters.</P><P> But many people find gunning wolves from airplanes offensive and are outraged.</P><P>     The logic underlying the killing seems clear, but the issues are complex. Wolves do kill caribou, elk and moose - especially their young. Reducing wolf populations should increase the numbers of these ungulates, but by how much? There are bitter disputes among scientists over the size of predator impact upon prey populations.</P><P>     According to Dr. Fred Wagner, Director of the Ecology Center at Utah State University, wildlife managers see three options:</P><P>       --  First, with no controls, predators and prey will reach a long-run equilibrium with low numbers of both.</P><P>     --  A second option - elimination of predators - allows herds to rise dramatically in the short term, but in the long run small populations result from degraded habitat.</P><P>     --  The third way is to moderately decrease predator numbers, providing a sustainable rise in ungulate populations. Alaska seems to follow this third, moderate control option, thereby enhancing big-game hunting.</P><P>     But the link between predator and prey is questioned by some scientists. They contend that herbivore numbers are primarily determined by habitat, that predators play only a marginal role in determining numbers of caribou, moose and elk. Only renewed habitat, such as that created by fire, can significantly increase populations. And regardless, they say, accurately determining the &quot;optimal&quot; wolf populations is hard to achieve.</P><P>     What precedents do we have for wolf-control programs?</P><P>       Yellowstone Park is a prime, if discouraging example. Wolves were deliberately eliminated from the Yellowstone ecosystem decades ago. Like most well-intentioned interventions in ecological and economic systems, the results have been different and more severe than anticipated.</P><P>     Elk populations in the Park have erupted, causing massive over-grazing and the prospect of mass starvation during severe Rocky Mountain winters. Whole plant and animal species have been decimated, drastically changing the park's ecology. What will be the results in the delicate Arctic tundra?</P><P>       Wolf controls have been tried in Alaska but without great success; bears, not wolves, were found to be taking the largest share of ungulates. So wolf numbers may, or may not, significantly impact prey numbers in Alaska.</P><P>     And as Dr. Kenneth Raedeke, a wildlife specialist at the University of Washington observes, &quot;having a brown bear control program, even in Alaska, is not (politically) acceptable.&quot; This gets to the heart of the matter: the nature of political decision-making. The decision to control wolf populations was made on the basis of political power, not science, economic efficiency or environmental sensitivity. Wolves, apparently, are thought to be politically acceptable targets while bears are not.</P><P>     In Alaska, Gov. Walter Hickel and special-interest groups such as the Alaska Outdoor Council, a coalition of outfitters, hunters</P><P> and bush pilots, have used the levers of political control over natural resources to their advantage, regardless of ecological effects. They want to make it easier for hunters to kill moose and caribou by increasing their populations, even though, as the director of Alaska Division of Wildlife Conservation admits, &quot;there are no real shortages of big-game animals in Alaska.&quot; This is the predictable result of bureaucratic management in a political environment.</P><P>     As public-choice economics teaches, more than ecological concerns are being sacrificed to special interests.</P><P>     The consequences, while clear for the wolves, may be equally bleak for Alaska's reputation for its important tourist economy. The state has already received &quot;hundred of letters&quot; protesting the plan. Last week, the National Parks and Conservation Association canceled its 75th anniversary board meeting scheduled for Anchorage. A decline in tourism may match the decrease in wolf population.</P><P>     By responding to a small, vocal constituency, Alaska's government may have damaged a far broader, but less-well-organized and focused group. This decision once again illustrates the pitfalls of political-bureaucratic natural resource management, where special interests can run the decision-making apparatus to their benefit while ignoring the costs imposed on many.</P><P>     The Alaskan wolf example demonstrates that sound environmentalism must recognize the dangers of political management. In a greener political economy, environmental management should be guided by science and constrained by economic realities. We can learn from Alaska. </P>

BADEN</P><P>           IS RANCHING on the federal range an environmentally destructive anachronism? Many environmentalists seem to think so. Less than 30,000 ranchers graze cattle on 350 million acres of federal lands, an area twice the size of Texas. Environmentalists hope the public lands will be, as the bumper sticker intones, &quot;Cattle Free by '93.&quot;</P><P>         Grazing has also been the target of budget reformers; grazing programs subsidize what environmental writer Edward Abbey called &quot;welfare cowboys.&quot; These programs cost taxpayers about $50 million a year. Some permit holders, however, have found public lands to be quite profitable.</P><P>     A recent report by the Department of the Interior highlights one case in which a California public utility subleased its public grazing privileges to ranchers. It charged subleases 315 percent more per animal unit month than it paid to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for the grazing permits. The bottom line: The public loses money to permit holders' benefit.</P><P>     Ranchers are politically powerful and have successfully headed off attempts at fee reform. Last September, for example, a modest fee increase approved by the House was subsequently negotiated away by the Senate. Today grazing rates remain at about one-quarter of the average of private lands in the same region.</P><P>     The answer seems to be raising grazing fees to the market level. Ethically and economically, it is not that simple.</P><P>     BLM grazing privileges were assigned to ranchers under the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. Preference was given to nearby landowners. Over time, grazing privileges have become linked to these &quot;base properties,&quot; with leases being routinely renewed. Today the permits are virtually owned by the base property holders, though technically given as &quot;privileges&quot; by the BLM.</P><P>     This &quot;ownership&quot; has been ratified in a number of ways. The value of the grazing permits is taxed by the Internal Revenue Service when a ranch is inherited. Permits are also accepted by FDIC-insured banks as collateral for loans. And they are routinely transferred to new owners by the BLM when a base property is sold. Over time, the value of these &quot;rights&quot; has been incorporated into the value of associated private ranch lands.</P><P>     Consider this analogy: Two cars are auctioned. They are identical in every way except that one carries a sticker entitling it to half-price gasoline for the life of the automobile. Surely the cheaper gasoline does not come free; the discount on gas will produce higher bids for the car. Gas or grass, it works the same. A ranch sold with federal grazing permits is worth more than one without permits. An economist would say that the value of access to cheap grass becomes capitalized into the ranch's value.</P><P>     So those who have received a subsidy are those who got the initial windfall and sold out for a higher price. Many ranchers who own the base properties today have paid for their subsidy, which makes it no subsidy at all. As the director of the BLM wrote, &quot;The point is that we simply do not know who is `unduly' benefiting or if they are benefiting at all.&quot;</P><P>       Simply raising grazing fees is unfair to the ranchers who have paid for cheap government-land grazing through the value capitalized into their ranch's purchase price. So how else can we reform the federal grazing lands?</P><P>       A free market in permits can help end government subsidies in a just way. Grazing permits could be offered to the current ranchers for the value of future grazing fees. The permits could then be freely exchanged.</P><P>     The federal government would stop subsidizing management of the land but would still own it and set environmental standards; for example, by requiring protection of riparian areas as a condition of holding permits.</P><P>     Environmentalists have long pointed out that there are many valuable uses for federal lands, among them recreation and wildlife habitat. The current system's &quot;use it or lose it&quot; requirements effectively prevent shifts from cattle to other uses. A permit holder cannot save winter range for elk and other wildlife because even if the grazing fees are paid, the permits may be revoked and &quot;unused&quot; forage reallocated to another ranch.</P><P>     A transferable permit system would encourage diverse uses. Grazing would continue, but land would surely be dedicated to esthetics and biodiversity by groups like the North American Elk Foundation or the Nature Conservancy.</P><P>     There are several benefits of owned and transferable permits. For example, with more secure access, permit holders would have incentives to invest in and improve the public lands. Property rights encourage diversity and provide incentives for stewardship. This change will benefit our range land and the people who care about its diverse values.</P><P> _______________</P><P> John A.

programs. This is now a thing of the past, mostly crowded out
by sexy sitcoms and steamy soaps, the likes of which as a rule
used to air later at night.
<P>
How much has the family hour changed since it was dominated by
such series as <I>Little House on the Prairie</I> and <I>The Cosby
Show</I>? In September and October of 1995, the Media Research
Center examined four weeks of 8-to-9-p.m. programming to determine
how much of it was, in fact, suitable for the entire family. We
found that very little of it was.
<P>
Among the study's findings:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Vulgar language,
usually unheard even late in prime time a few years back, is now
constant in the 8 p.m. hour. In 117 hours of programming, 72 curse
words were used. &quot;Ass&quot; (29 uses) &quot;bitch&quot; (13)
and &quot;bastard&quot; (10) were the most popular.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  NBC was by far the
most vulgar of the networks. It had 1.26 obscenities for every
hour of &quot;Family Hour&quot; programming, more than double
the ratio of any other network. NBC's worst offenders were <I>Mad
About You</I>, with seven curse words, and <I>JAG</I>, with six.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Sexual material that
formerly was restricted to the 9-to-11 slot has migrated to the
&quot;Family Hour,&quot; where premarital sex is not only common
-- outnumbering portrayals of sex within marriage by a 8-to-1
ratio -- but almost always condoned. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Fox had the most
sexual treatments per hour of any network (0.88), though all four
major networks were closely bunched in this category.
<P>
The networks' attempt to appeal to young adults has left children
(and their parents) underserved. The study's first recommendation
is a short-term, partial solution to this problem: one network
should counter the adult trend by offering family-oriented programming
between 8 and 9 throughout the week. 
<P>
In the long term, however, the goal should be for all networks
to voluntarily provide the viewing public with the across-the-board
haven it once counted on, and to broadcast in the first hour of
prime time only shows that parents and children can watch together.

<a name="dole">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Before the Economic Club of Detroit</FONT> on Tuesday Bob Dole
said Bill Clinton is a liberal bent on raising taxes. ABC's World
News Tonight on Tuesday (September 24) didn't mention the speech. 
<P>
On the CBS Evening News, Phil Jones charged that supporting a
tax cut means Dole is no longer concerned about the deficit.
Jones also worried that criticizing Clinton isn't the right
strategy. 
<P>
<DD>Jones reported: "The former Senator argued that voters have a
choice between two different visions of government."
<BR><DD>Dole: "He wants families to pinch their pennies so government can
spend more money. I've got a new idea. I want the government for
a change to pinch its pennies so the families will not have to
pinch theirs."
<BR><DD>Jones: "The ex-deficit hawk returned to the centerpiece of his
campaign, a 15 percent tax cut."
<BR><DD>Dole: "I know the critics say you can't do this, you can't cut
taxes and balance the budget. What they're really saying is that
they cannot do it."
<BR><DD>Jones: "Campaign aides claim they have private polls showing
President Clinton vulnerable on the tax issue. That's the reason
for this attack. But between now and election day the Republican
nominee has to do more than criticize. He's got to sell the Dole
plan."
<P>
After showing some of the same tax soundbites from Dole, on
NBC Nightly News David Bloom ran a clip of a new Clinton ad which
criticizes Dole's Senate record, emphasizing Dole's length of
service. Bloom then charged:
<BR><DD>"So now Dole who's complained about Clinton's campaign of fear is
taking a similar tack."
<BR><DD>Dole: "Secrets, secrets. Remember the FBI files that went to the
White House."
<BR><DD>Bloom: "With the election just six weeks away, calling Bill
Clinton a liberal might soon look tame. David Bloom, NBC News, Detroit."
<P>
<a name="hillary">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) "FDIC Report Says Mrs. Clinton's Work Was Used to
Deceive,"</FONT> declared the front page Washington Post headline on
Tuesday. The news was also played above the fold in The
Washington Times. But neither the Monday or Tuesday night ABC,
CBS or NBC evening shows mentioned the development. 
<P>
Post reporter Susan Schmidt's lead: "Hillary Rodham Clinton
drafted a real estate document that was used by an Arkansas S&L
to 'deceive' federal regulators in 1996 and pay more than $300,000
in questioned commissions to one of her law firm's well-connected
clients, a federal inspector general concluded yesterday. The
strongly worded report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
inspector general found evidence that Clinton and her former law
partner Webster Hubbell were involved in dealings on behalf of
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan that they have told federal
investigators under oath they cannot recall."
<P>
<a name="donaldson">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3) An expert media observer</FONT> who had up close, insider
access to how the media covered Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election
campaign says reporters are going a lot easier on Clinton this
year. The expert: Sam Donaldson. With Brit Hume out ill last
week, Donaldson returned to the campaign trail for the first time
since Reagan's years. And things have changed, USA Today's Peter
Johnson reported Monday (September 23):
<BR><DD>"Have the boys on the bus lost the fire in their bellies, the
one that fueled their cries of 'Mr. President! Mr. President!'
during President Reagan's years in office? ABC's Sam Donaldson
isn't saying, exactly, but suspects something's going on. Except
for CBS' Rita Braver, 'I have heard no reporter trying to ask the
President any question,' Donaldson said Friday....
<BR><DD>"What's this, Sam? Reporters going easy on Clinton? 'You're not
going to get me in a fight with these guys. They're my friends,'
said Donaldson, who covered the White House from 1977 to 1989.
'But there seems to a change in attitude or a different attitude
toward covering the President.'"
<P>
A USA Today reporter agrees. In his "Politics" column on
Monday, Richard Benedetto wrote:
<BR><DD>"As President Clinton's re-election campaign rolled through
six states in four days last week, it did so virtually unimpeded
by a White House press corps known for setting up roadblocks now
and then....He was left free to make a string of feel-good
speeches that won great play in the media and gave the desired
impression that the Clinton campaign is on a roll....
<BR><DD>"In 1992, a tough White House press corps rightly kept
President Bush's feet to the fire on domestic issues he would
rather have downplayed. But the 1996 crew appears less aggressive
with Clinton."
<P>We're bringing them to our side, one reporter at a time.

<H3>Three items today:</H3>
<P>   
<OL>
<LI> <a href="#dole">Bob Dole</a> is losing. What's to blame? The fact that he's failed
to nail down his conservative base? No, ABC says -- surprise,
surprise -- that he's moved "too far to the right."
<li> A <a href="#reporter">White House reporter</a> for the New York Times will soon marry
a former Clinton Press Secretary turned liberal commentator.
<li> <a href="#gumbel">Bryant Gumbel</a> urges prayer for children because of the welfare
reform bill. 
<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="dole"></a>
<h3>1) </h3><dd>It could be argued that Bob Dole is losing because he
lacks conservative passion, that conservatives don't trust that
he'll follow through on his conservative promises. But that's not
a view ABC took Monday night. On the September 23 World News
Tonight reporter Dean Reynolds explored why Dole is behind in
Michigan's 8th congressional district, the Lansing area. In 1992
the networks didn't blame conservatives for Bush's impending loss
until October. This year ABC made an early start.
<dd>
    Reynolds found people happy with the economy and cynical
about the political process. Reynolds explained: "The same
cynicism that may deflect attacks on Clinton, seems to work
directly against Bob Dole with many voters here calling his 15
percent tax cut idea a political gimmick."
<dd>
    Following a soundbite from a teacher who asserted that you
can't cut taxes without increasing the deficit and who then
denounced Newt Gingrich, Reynolds relayed: "Many of the voters we
spoke with blamed Gingrich for last year's government shut down,
for a mean-spirited attitude generally, and for attempts to trim
Medicare specifically."
<dd>
    Reynolds then aired a soundbite from Ron Bell, a man on golf
course: "I think that anybody that came out as strong as Mr.
Gingrich did when he first came out regarding Medicare was
committing political suicide and I think the Republican Party
took too long before they tried to quiet him down."
<dd>Reynolds: "And Ron Bell is a life-long Republican."
<dd>    Interviewer, off camera: "Your party. Did it move too far to
the right?"
<dd>    Bell: "Yes, far too far to the right."
<dd>    Reynolds: "That may explain why Dole is having trouble
winning over women voters."
<dd>    Woman in restaurant: "I am a Republican and I'm having some
troubles with the platform because I'm pro-choice."
<dd>    2nd woman in restaurant: "I think abortion is not a political
issue. It has no business in politics."
<dd>    Reynolds: "And where there is support for Dole, it often
sounds lukewarm."
<dd>    3rd woman in restaurant: "I will support Dole and most
probably vote for him, but it would have been nice if we had a
different candidate.
<dd>
    Reynolds concluded his story: "Across Michigan's 8th
district, from the city streets to the fields of corn, the Dole
campaign is struggling, trailing and has six weeks to catch up."
<dd>
    So busy portraying Dole as "too far to the right," Reynolds
failed to consider that maybe voters don't believe his tax cut
promise because Dole has a long record of raising taxes over
conservative objections. Reynolds also failed to look at how
Reagan and Bush managed to win with a pro-life message.
<p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>2) </h3><dd>Monday's Washington Post "Reliable Source" column
revealed that "Former White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers,
35, and New York Times White House reporter Todd Purdum, 36, are
engaged after dating seriously for about a year." Myers is now
the liberal co-host of CNBC's Equal Time.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="gumbel"></a>

<H3> 1)</H3><DD>Ronald Reagan left office more than seven years ago,
but he's still fodder for liberal TV script writers. At the
beginning of Wednesday night's Rockford Files movie special on
CBS, "Jim Rockford" (a private investigator played by James
Garner, for those of you who missed the 1970s), arrives at a
birthday party for the father of a former girlfriend he hasn't
seen for 15 years. 
<DD>
Upon seeing Rockford, the father says to him: "I was glad to
hear Megan say that you might show. Hey, I bet the Reagan years
were good to you, huh? S&L investigations, defense contractor
fraud."
<DD>
Rockford responded: "Matter of fact."

<a name="Dole"> </a>
<H3>2)</H3><DD>A few hours earlier Wednesday night (September 18) Dan
Rather opened the CBS Evening News: "Bob Dole unloads his
strongest attack yet blaming President Clinton personally and
directly for rising drug crime."
<DD>
He then began the show with this assessment of the themes of
each candidate that put Clinton in a more positive light: 
<DD>
"Bob Dole and Bill Clinton targeted each other today, on
each other's turf. In California Dole gave star billing to
President Clinton in a new attack blaming both the President and
Hollywood for what he says is a lax attitude on drug abuse.
President Clinton's theme today was let's protect the
environment, parks and public lands together. He used the Grand
Canyon as his backdrop to declare almost two million acres of
Utah off limits to developers."
<DD>
Reporter Phil Jones reported on Dole and included some doubt
about the effectiveness of Dole's anti-drug slogan and concluded
by noting that "only eleven percent blame the Clinton
administration for the [drug] problem." Rita Braver then
reported on Clinton move "to stake his claim as the
environmental President." But Braver didn't include any
consideration of how Clinton's move was an anti-property rights
land grab. ABC and NBC at least aired soundbites from upset Utah
Senator Orrin Hatch, but CBS aired no dissenting voice. 
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<a name="CIA"></a>
<H3>3)</H3><DD>Thursday night's (September 19) InterNight on MSNBC
looked at the San Jose Mercury News story that the CIA 
coordinated cocaine sales in Los Angeles in the 1980s through a
Nicaraguan to pay for the Contras. The guests: the reporter
(Gary Webb), Jesse Jackson, a lawyer for a drug dealer,
Washington talk show host Joe Madison and his buddy, the wacky
as always Dick Gregory. The premise of course is that if the CIA
hadn't provided the drugs the residents of South Central would
not have become addicted to crack.
<DD>Here are a few of host Ed Gordon's less than probing
questions:
<DD>
    -- To Jesse Jackson: "Does it bother you that indeed, and I
think this is where you're going, the hypocrisy that might be
that those who backed the Contras at that time and said it was
for freedom fighters and the like would indeed turn their back
on this country's problems?"
<DD>
    -- To Dick Gregory: "Dick, I know that this is nothing new
to you in the sense of trying to keep people alert to what may
be going on across this country as relates to the government,
but as you compare it to things you've seen and heard in the
past where does this fall?"
<DD>
    -- To Joe Madison: "As Dick was saying, a conspiratorial
thing, something that is genocidal that many African-Americans
whisper and talk about that, or was it simply an economic
situation that they thought this was a quick way to make money
to send to the Contras?"

<H3>4)</H3><DD>Study, from the front page of the September MediaNomics 
published by the MRC's Free Market Project:
<DD><B>Tax Cuts Concern Reporters, Medicare Increases Do Not Deficit Chicken Hawks</B>
<DD>"At the Republican convention, Bob Dole pledged to cut income
taxes by 15 percent, balance the budget, and leave Social
Security and Medicare untouched. Tough-minded reporters believed
none of it and shared their skepticism with a national
television audience," writes the Weekly Standard's David Frum in
the September 9 issue of that magazine.
<DD>But then, according to Frum, "Two weeks later, the Democrats met
in convention and, to put it simply, lied through their teeth
about their plans for Medicare. They accused Republicans, in Al
Gore's words, of wanting to `give health insurance rip-off
artists a license to change Medicare, to let this program for
our seniors wither on the vine. That's why they want to replace
Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.' Those remarks are
blatantly untrue, both about the Republican plans and about
Clinton's own. And the media said...nothing."
<DD>Is Frum correct? Are reporters more skeptical of Bob Dole's tax
rhetoric than of Bill Clinton's Medicare rhetoric? Media
Research Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about
either tax cuts or Medicare on ABC's World News Tonight, CBS
Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's World Today during the
month of August. The MRC's findings: While network journalists
were ardent deficit hawks when reporting on tax cuts, they lost
their deficit-cutting zeal when Democrats denounced Republican
Medicare plans.
<DD>There were a total of 24 stories during the month that
questioned whether Bob Dole could both cut taxes and balance the
budget. Only two stories questioned whether Bill Clinton could
erase the deficit while not advancing Medicare reforms in his
second term.
<DD>The reaction to the unveiling of Dole's tax plan was the same
across the networks. "Since Dole would leave Social Security,
Medicare, and defense untouched," reported CBS News
correspondent Phil Jones, "it's still unclear what would be cut
in order to pay for his tax cut." According to CNN's Gene
Randall, "Bob Dole has produced an economic plan that is getting
mixed reviews even from Republicans. The bipartisan Concord
Coalition on Sunday warned against election-year tax-cut
Santas."
<DD>NBC's Mike Jensen offered that "most analysts say it's not good
economics. Bob Dole says about a fourth of the tax cuts would be
paid for by an expanding economy, but the rest would have to
come from spending cuts, and those haven't been spelled out
yet." Over at ABC, correspondent John Cochran claimed that "if
critics say Dole's tax plan would lead to budget deficits of the
size of those dating back to the Reagan era, then his campaign
simply isn't going to worry about it for now."
<DD>
But what about Bill Clinton and Medicare? Economics columnist
Robert Samuelson, in the September 4 Washington Post, pointed
out that in the upcoming years "the only way to avoid (or
minimize) much higher taxes, the [Congressional Budget Office]
said, would be a mix of an older retirement age, reduced
benefits and a shift of Medicare toward managed care. On
Medicare, the Republicans proposed precisely such a
shift...Clinton's demolition of this effort confounds the CBO's
sensible advice."
<DD>
Only two network reporters questioned whether leaving Medicare
alone could be compatible with balanced budgets. "A generation
of baby boomers begins retiring within a decade," ABC's Jerry
King pointed out. "So, the bad news is, unless the politicians
find a way to cut entitlement spending, today's deficit
reductions will be impossible to sustain." ABC's Jeff Greenfield
reported that "with the huge baby boomer generation retiring in
about 15 years, those entitlement programs could take every
single dollar of the budget."
<DD>
King and Greenfield were the only reporters concerned about how
to "pay for" automatic Medicare spending increases. If Bill
Clinton won't reform Medicare in his next term, why aren't
reporters asking him which taxes he will raise?

<h2><a name="quote">QUOTE OF THE DAY</a></h2><p>

<i>"They listened to those reports of the people turning down the
dials when negative responses were made in San Diego. He did it
on the high road. He said this was to be a campaign of ideas, not
insults, no personal attacks. And I think a final thought, Dan.
This was a convention that was well-planned and well-thought out.
They had their themes and they hit the mark every day. And the
President hit the mark tonight."<p>
 -- CBS reporter Ed Bradley,
after Clinton's speech.</i><p>

<h2><a name="nasty">"Nasty</a> Little Scandal" Prompts Some New Clinton Scrutiny;
 Dick Morris Story Mars Pro-Clinton Euphoria<p></h2></center>

    The networks generally praised Bill Clinton's acceptance
speech last night, but earlier in the evening coverage
concentrated on the resignation of Clinton campaign strategist
Dick Morris after revelations of a relationship with a
prostitute. The Morris news forced some networks to discuss
issues suppressed the first three nights: Clinton's character and
whether Morris pushed him artificially to the right.<p>

    "Two of the best and brightest of their political generation,
both baby boomers," marveled Tom Brokaw of Clinton and Gore.
ABC's Sam Donaldson offered: "Clinton always gives a great
speech, and this was another one of them. But the record shows
that the next day he may give a different speech, change his
mind." <p>

    -- CBS and NBC evening shows led with Morris, but ABC's Peter
Jennings seemed annoyed that he had to even mention the
allegations. "Here in Chicago," Jennings began World News
Tonight, "the President has been fine tuning, as they say, the
speech he will be giving to this convention and to the country
tonight. And he has a lot to be pleased about. A very upbeat
convention. A very successful train trip here with rising poll
numbers to accompany it. And a very important set of statistics
about the economy today, which he will certainly point to as
evidence that the country should re-elect him. And then along
comes a nasty little scandal to take the edge off the good news
at least for one day." <p>

    -- Questions about liberal influences on Clinton. Tom Brokaw,
on NBC Nightly News, asked Tim Russert "Does this open the door
then...to some of the President's old friends, who are more left
of center than right of center?" Dan Rather to Ted Kennedy in
prime time: "Bob Dole said today with Morris gone President
Clinton has only around him now liberal aides, and that's going
to hurt him?"<p>

    --  Character issue raised on CNN and NBC, which were the
only networks to detail the Morris story. On the 7pm ET Inside
Politics, Judy Woodruff inquired of Vernon Jordan: "Does it say
anything about the President's judgment that he would turn again
and again over 20 years to a man like Dick Morris with the sort
of personal problems that he allegedly has?" As prime time began,
only CNN's Bernie Kalb and NBC's Lisa Myers noted the Star
reported Morris used a Clinton campaign hotel room and that he
allowed the woman to listen in on phone calls with Clinton.<p>

    -- The rank hypocrisy of Al Gore's speech Wednesday night
went unmentioned Thursday morning and evening. Gore said his
sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his anti-tobacco
crusade, but in 1988 he boasted of growing and selling tobacco.
The only exception came on CNN's Crossfire which showed the 1988
clip of Gore.<p>

<center><h2><a name="ted">The</a> Orator of "Robert Bork's America" Goes Negative Again 
Ted Kennedy's Hit Speech Goes Uncriticized</center></h2><p>

    Reporters continued to miss the hypocrisy of Clinton's
proclamation of an "ideas, not insults" campaign when matched
with the attack-dog rhetoric of podium speakers. Last night, Ted
Kennedy used the exact same literary device that two weeks ago
fueled media criticism of Republican Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison. <p>

    Said Kennedy of the GOP platform: "It is the radical wish
list of the education-cutting, environmental-trashing,
Medicare-slashing, choice-denying, tolerance-repudiating,
gay-bashing, Social Security-threatening, assault-rifle-coddling,
government-closing, tax loophole-granting....minimum
wage-opposing Republican majority that dominated the delegations
in San Diego" <p>

    -- NBC's Lisa Myers asked Hutchison in San Diego: "Do you
think you went too far?" On PBS, Tom Brokaw said last night:
"Senator Edward M. Kennedy, still in full voice after all these
years in the United States Senate. The proud champion of the
liberal cause, addressing this convention hall once again as he
does every four years."<p>

    -- On CNN,Bernard Shaw asserted: "Sixteen years ago in New
York's Madison Square Garden, Sen. Edward Kennedy rallied the
Democratic Party. Tonight, he has done it again in Chicago." Ken
Bode added: "You need a partisan speech, one that puts it to the
other party. You get it at any convention. Ted Kennedy does it as
well as anybody could do it. Elder statesman of the party.
Eloquent."<p>

   -- CNN's Bill Schneider found code words: "What they're trying
to do is take advantage of Dole's age and portray him as sort of
out of it. He's kind of irrelevant. He's kind of a dupe. That the
ideas are the sinister ideas of Newt Gingrich, and even Jack Kemp
with his supply-side ideas." But that attack theme drew no
criticism.<p>

    -- Later, CNN's Judy Woodruff interviewed Kennedy: "Do you
really believe that the Republicans are as dangerous, that Bob
Dole is as dangerous, as you described in your remarks?" Bernard
Shaw queried: "You had a who's who of names tonight: Pat
Buchanan, Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, Rush Limbaugh, Ralph Reed,
Pat Robertson. What were you driving at?"<p>

    -- On CBS, where Bob Schieffer asked Sen. Hutchison in San
Diego how she felt being "Attack Dog Hutchison," Dan Rather
interviewed Kennedy last night but failed to ask him about the
speech or its tone.<p>


<center><h2><a name="convention">Convention</a>-Inspired Ratherisms</center></h2><p>

    Special events often inspire the folksy aphorisms known as
Ratherisms: <p>

    This is your classic case of two pounds of politics in a
one-pound bag. This hall is only a third the size of the Houston
Astrodome, where the last Republican convention was held." -- 
Dan Rather, leading off Republican coverage, August 12.<p>

    -- "She's expected to hit President Clinton rhetorically with
everything short of a tire tube." -- Rather on Kay Bailey
Hutchison, August 13 convention coverage.<p>

    -- "It looks like California's Governor Pete Wilson is out of
the doghouse. You know from his view he's been put so far back in
the doghouse they had to FedEx him daylight." -- Rather during
August 14 Republican convention coverage. <p>

    -- "The Vice President of the United States, Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee, age 48, is about to give an address in which he is
widely expected to hit Republicans with everything short of a
window weight." -- During August 28 Democratic convention.<p>

    -- "The consensus in the hall is that Albert Gore has scored
with what Harry Caray, the famous Chicago baseball announcer,
might call a home run ball." -- Rather during CBS Democratic
convention coverage, August 28. <p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Dick Morris, Family Man</h3>

    Just a day before the Dick Morris prostitute story broke, USA
Today ran a profile. Susan Page's front page piece Wednesday
included this line: "He is a small man and a dapper dresser,
openly devoted to his no-nonsense wife."<p>


<h3>Moderate Liberalism</h3><p>

    Wednesday's New York Times insisted the Democratic Party
defined centrism, but the story listed some very liberal views.
The Democratic "platform takes a middle ground between the
unfettered capitalism and government-enforced morality es- poused
by Republicans and the welfare-state economics and Aquarian
values that once formed Democrats' image," reported David
Rosenbaum.<p>

    Four paragraphs later Rosenbaum summarized the "middle
ground" policies: "The Democrats call for government-paid
abortions for poor women, full civil rights for homosexuals, a
strong commitment to public schools, gun control, tobacco
regulations, a continuation of affirmative action programs and a
greater emphasis on environmental protection than on the
development of resources."<p>


<h3>Welfare Worries</h3><p>

    Clinton's promise to "fix" welfare reform didn't prompt
questions about his backing down on a promise. Instead, reporters
pressed from the left. On CBS last night Ed Bradley cornered U.S.
Rep. Ron Dellums: "I know you saw it not as welfare reform but
more as a budget cut. What does he have to do to fix it?" And,
"The President is expected to say tonight that he's going to
propose a $3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is
that enough?"<p>

<center><h2><a name="ignoring">Networks Forget 1988 Tobacco-Growing Boast 
Ignoring Al Gore's Inaccuracy, Nastiness</a></h2></center><p>

    The networks delivered praise for Al Gore's speech last
night, ignoring his factual inaccuracies and failing to note how
he had boasted of growing tobacco as recently as 1988, four years
after the death of his sister from lung cancer. After Gore's
talk, in which he explained that his sister's death motivated his
anti-tobacco views, the networks did talk to tobacco-state
delegates. NBC's David Bloom spoke to a Tennessee delegate who
"does not agree with this demonization of this industry."<p>

    "Well, Dan, in a word it was a barnburner," gushed Bob
Schieffer on CBS last night. Though Gore said Republicans wish to
allow "more poison in our air and drinking water," Schieffer
didn't find him nasty: "This was an old-fashioned poli- tical
speech, the kind of speech that politicians used to give before
politics turned so nasty with all those commercials on
television." Though Peter Jennings noted the "attack dog" role of
a VP, no one  mentioned how Gore falsely accused the GOP of
"cutting" Medicare, of wanting it to "wither on the vine," or his
claim of 100,000 new cops on the street. Last Sunday
Scripps-Howard pegged the number at 12,000.<p>

    The New York Times reported July 3 that in 1988, Al Gore told
an audience of tobacco farmers: "Throughout most of my life, I
raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own hands, all of
my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed
it. I've dug in it. I've sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've
shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped it and
sold it." No network mentioned this boast, but ABC, NBC and CNN
did suggest hypocrisy. Jennings noted that "tobacco companies are
here in Chicago wining and dining the hierarchy of the Democratic
Party." NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled that "the Gore family were
tobacco farmers." On CNN, Judy Woodruff suggested that Gore "was
responding to what was said in San Diego," where his tobacco
roots were highlighted.<p>

    -- Clinton's week of new spending promises hasn't generated
a flurry of questions about how his plans will be paid for, but
Dole's tax cut plan led to concern in San Diego about its impact
on the deficit. One exception: Early in prime time last night
CNN's Charles Bierbauer reviewed Clinton's spending plans and
noted "Republicans say that is the road back to big government."<p>

    -- In stark contrast to San Diego, the networks failed to
describe Tuesday speeches as harsh or mean attacks. The morning
shows didn't raise the idea in interviews with Democratic guests.<p>


    -- The power of unions within the Democratic Party finally
gets highlighted as ABC's World News Tonight and CNN in prime
time examine their role. See page 3. But for CBS the problem
isn't union influence moving the party left, but how President
Clinton is too conservative for the rank and file. <p>

<center><h2><a name="no">More Raves for Jackson & Cuomo, Citations of GOP "Sniping"
No Snarling Partisan Negativity in Chicago?</p></center></h2></a>

    Wednesday marked Day Two of ignoring negativity from the
podium in Chicago:<p>

    -- On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings argued: "There
was a rather personal attack on President Clinton by Mr. Dole."
In the ABC clip, Dole said: "Tonight they'll bash Republicans.
Tomorrow night the President will sound to everybody 'If you're
for it, I'm for it. If Bob Dole's for it, I'm for it. If Jesse
Helms is for it, I'm for it. Whoever is for it, I'm for it, and
that's why you should re-elect me, because I don't have any
philosophy, I don't have any beliefs, I don't have any
commitments." Sounds a lot like network complaints about welfare
reform.<p>

    Jim Wooten raved over Jackson and Cuomo: "For a quick moment,
deja vu...That old-fashioned voice, full-throated, fierce,
raising the rafters worth of Chicago conventions...This was a
glimpse of conventions past, when liberals were still the lions
of the party and rhetoric roared....And the delegates, most of
them much more liberal than their convention projects of their
party, celebrated this little touch of yesterday." Wooten said
Hillary "answered Republican sniping at her book on raising
children."<p>

    -- CBS Evening News correspondent Bob Schieffer echoed
Wooten: "During the Republican convention, the Doles disparaged
Mrs. Clinton's book It Takes A Village, saying instead it takes a
family to properly raise a child."<p>

    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw called Jesse Jackson "The father who
began on the outside looking in, the fiery liberal voice of
protest and change...The old lion still has his roar."
The Wednesday morning shows took the same approach to negativity:<p>

    -- CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart suggested: "Mrs.
Clinton, you know, has been the target of a lot of attacks by the
Republican Party. She decided not to answer them, although she
did say it takes a village."<p>

    -- On NBC's Today, Jim Miklaszewski proclaimed: "This was the
night for the liberals. Jesse Jackson electrified the delegates,
exhorting them not to abandon Democratic liberal traditions."
Bryant Gumbel asked: "Would it be fair to say she wasn't as
strident, as hard-edged last night as usual?" Miklaszewski
dissented from the media's party line: "If you listen closely, I
thought she was just as hard-edged as ever."<p>

    -- ABC's Good Morning America co-host Charles Gibson
explained: "Mrs. Clinton expressed the core idea of the evening,
that government ought to be a proactive positive force, that idea
given forceful voice by two liberal icons who opposed President
Clinton's signing of welfare reform...the First Lady relied not
on her legal experience -- there would be no harsh edges on this
night -- but on her experience as a mother to push for new
legislation."<p>

    ABC interviewed Leon Panetta, and NBC interviewed the First
Lady, but asked no questions about negativity. Two weeks ago, the
morning shows all decried "bashing":<p>

   -- CBS This Morning co-host Jane Robelot reported August 14:
"It was unofficially Bash Bill Night last night in San
Diego...Speaker after Republican speaker went after the man with
a vengeance, including the keynoter, Susan Molinari."<p>

   -- "Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack
dog last night, using her keynote address to attack the
President," Bryant Gumbel led off NBC's Today.<p>

    -- Good Morning America anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted:
"Some of the harshest words were from Kay Bailey Hutchison, who
tried to paint the President as a tax-and-spend liberal." Charles
Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not
want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President
Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits."<p>


<center><h2><a name="where">Broder</a> Sounds A Rare Skeptical Note on Clinton, Welfare Fixer
Where Are Welfare Questions from the Right?</center></h2><p>

    Clinton officials assured conventioneers that he will "fix"
welfare reform after the election. That prompted The Washington
Post's David Broder, on CNN Tuesday night, to explain that
Democrats will be "the slickest sales people in the country" if
they cast Clinton as welfare's savior: "That's as logical as
saying that the guy who fumbled the ball on the two-yard line
ought to be put back in because he's the one who might carry it
through the next time." The networks have yet to suggest that his
welfare fix assurance might mean he really hasn't moved right on
the issue. Instead, liberal questions on welfare reform continued
on Wednesday night: <p>

    -- CBS reporter Ed Bradley asked Rep. John Lewis: "It's going
to be difficult, given the positions he's taken, particularly on
welfare, to get some people out?"<p>

    -- CNN's Gene Randall inquired of NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume:
"Do you think the President's signature on the welfare rights
bill will do him any harm politically in the African-American
community?"<p>

   -- On CNN Bob Franken asked Sen. Daniel Moynihan: "You of
course are very angry about the President signing the  welfare
legislation. But you haven't talked about it here. Why?" She
followed up: "Can the President, as many people suggest, fix the
welfare legislation in a second term?"<p>

    -- At the top of Tuesday's Nightline on the plight of
Chicago's poor, Ted Koppel warned: "They live literally in the
shadow of the convention in Chicago, but with their benefits now
in doubt, many feel betrayed by the President and the Democrats,
and look forward only to uncertainty."<p>



<center><h2><a name="labor">Labor's</a> Political Intolerance, Mob Ties Surface on TV
ABC, CNN Touch on Unions' Peculiar Politics</center></h2><p>

    While the labor unions have yet to receive the sort of Darth
Vader treatment reserved for Republican interest groups like the
Christian Coalition or the NRA, some reporters have presented
critical looks at the exercise of union power.<p>

    -- Last night, CNN became the first network to address the
issue of the unions' political intolerance, taking dues money
from Republican union members to elect Democrats. Reporter Wolf
Blitzer asked AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney: "Many of your members
are Republicans. How do you explain to them that you're using, in
effect, their dues to help elect Democrats?"<p>

    -- CNN campaign finance reporter Brooks Jackson delivered a
story last night on the unions' political campaign in which he
observed: "So Bill Clinton says the era of big government is
over? Not at the Democratic convention, where unionized
government workers are suiting up for battle against
Republicans."<p>

    -- On Tuesday's World News Tonight, ABC's Brian Ross
reported: "In the world of big money and Democratic politics on
public display this week in Chicago, this man holds a special
place. His name is Arthur Coia, who despite being president of a
labor union the FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia,
the Laborers International has become one of the Democrats' top
money people, raising millions and gaining him special access to
the Clinton White House....In the last two years, the Clinton
administration has gone all out to court Coia and his union money
with invitations to the White House and an appearance by the
First Lady at a big union conference."<p>

    Ross added detail: "In an abrupt change of plans that raised
questions about whether the union's money to the Democrats had
bought it some kind of sweetheart deal, prosecutors dropped the
allegations and instead quietly negotiated a deal with Coia that
let him keep his job and put him in charge of cleaning up the
union."<p>


<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Base Bias</h3><p>

    CBS Evening News is taking two different approaches to the
passionate poles that create each party's base. The day before
the Republican convention, CBS reporter John Roberts suggested
"hard-line anti-abortionists" controlled the Republican Party:
"Delegates are pursuing their own agendas and forcing party
leaders, including Dole, to fall into line behind them...so far
he rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots." <p>

    But on last night's broadcast, reporter Harry Smith's piece
on unions didn't talk about ideologically extreme unions pushing
around the party, but how Bill Clinton has failed to be liberal
enough for them:<p>

    "It still takes steel to make America's cars. It still takes
labor to get a Democrat elected President. But talk to the union
rank and file, and you'll find that their enthusiasm is less than
red hot.... We talked with United Auto Workers in Dearborn,
Michigan this week. Their biggest gripe: Bill Clinton's support
of the North American Free Trade Agreement...Organized labor will
invest millions of dollars to get Bill Clinton elected this fall.
These dues-paying members wonder if they are still getting their
money's worth."<p>


<h3>Poor Ann</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw didn't ask about harsh negativity during a Tuesday
night interview with former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, who
"delivered that rollicking keynote speech against George Bush not
so long ago." Brokaw asked about strong women: "You paid the
price to some degree. You lost the governorship of Texas because
this country still is a little bit schizoid, isn't it, about the
role of women in American politics?" <p>


<h3>Brokaw: Right is Wrong</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw was hit Tuesday with an anti-GOP comment he made
in San Diego. Freelance newsman Marc Morano showed him a quote,
cited in Media Reality Check '96, in which Brokaw asked rape
victim Jan Licence after her speech: "Do you think this is a
party that is dominated by men and this convention is dominated
by men as well...Do you think before tonight they thought very
much about what happens in America with rape?" <p>

    Brokaw read the quote, admitted "I did ask her that, which I
think is a fair question," then walked away. Earlier, Morano
asked why GOP delegates distrusted the media but Democrats don't.
Brokaw asserted that it's just because conservatives don't like
change: "I think a lot of reporters in fact, come from working
class, activist backgrounds. But I don't think that it really
colors the way that they report things and the conservatives
generally stand for the status quo and news is about change."<p>


<h3>Here's My Room Key!</h3><p>

    Great publicity isn't the only thing Bill Clinton picked up
on his train trip. Reporting on crowd reaction to Clinton's stop
at Michigan State University, NBC Nightly News on Wednesday found
one very giving student. Answering what she could give the
President, she yelled, "I'll give him my room key!" <p>


<h3>Used to Double Standard</h3><p>

    Reporters complained about the lack of hard news in San
Diego, but aren't doing so in Chicago. Radio host Don Imus asked
CBS's Bob Schieffer Wednesday morning why. Talk Daily reported
his response: "I guess we kind of got used to it."<p>

<a name="quote">QUOTE</a> OF THE DAY<p>

<i>"This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that
applause, the way you've been treated here, the way people have
been reacting to you, kind of make it all go away?" <p>
-- NBC's Maria Shriver in an exclusive interview with Hillary Clinton
after her August 27 speech </i>><p>

<center><h2><a name="networks">Networks</a> Concede It was a Liberal Night, But...
Hillary Asked to Respond to "Bitter Attacks"<p></center></h2>

    On Tuesday night the networks declared that speakers Mario
Cuomo, Jesse Jackson, and Hillary Clinton were liberals, but
instead of castigating Cuomo and Jackson for their negative
speeches, as they did with speakers in San Diego, they praised
their eloquence.  Like Monday night,
the Democrats again escaped any scrutiny of their intolerance on
abortion as the three broadcast networks each aired stories on
the disastrous impact of welfare reform.<p>

    -- Hillary portrayed as the victim of unwarranted Republican
attacks and given plenty of opportunities to fire back. Just
after she left the podium, NBC's Maria Shriver asked her nine
softball questions. See quote of the day below. For instance,
"You are credited with really redefining the role of First Lady
and for doing that, you've taken a lot of heat, a lot of
criticism. As you look back, do you wished you'd redefined it a
little less?" On CBS, Bob Schieffer asked her: "Weren't you a
little offended when he [Bob Dole] made the reference he did [to
your book]?" CNN's Wolf Blitzer inquired of her: "What goes
through your mind when you hear some of these bitter attacks
against you?"<p>

    -- The three big speakers were tagged liberal by all but CBS.
Peter Jennings called Cuomo and Jackson the "senior liberals in
the party," and ABC's Jeff Greenfield described Hillary Clinton's
speech as "liberalism lite." Tom Brokaw referred to Cuomo's
"traditional liberal litany." CNN's Bill Schneider noted Hillary
Clinton's "liberal policy agenda." Whitewater was mentioned twice
by NBC last night; CNN's Judy Woodruff mentioned it Monday night.<p>

    -- The wealth of Democratic delegates and the quota system
that selected them have gone unmentioned in prime time so far. A
graphic on last night's NBC Nightly News reported 35 percent earn
over $100,000. In San Diego, 38 percent fell in that category,
prompting CBS, CNN and NBC to ask if the GOP delegates were out
of touch. Some reporters have noted that Democrats are split
50-50 male-female, but none has wondered if the quota system
might contradict party rhetoric about opposing quotas.<p>

    -- Abortion, the focus of the networks in San Diego, has been
blown aside in Chicago. Kate Michelman, head of the National
Abortion Rights Action League and a supporter of partial birth
abortion, addressed the convention. But her early evening speech
failed to spur any talk about extremism. The Democrats at the
last minute also allowed pro-life Rep. Tony Hall to speak, but
that action didn't generate any media interest in why the
Democrats felt compelled to make the move. Abortion came up only
on CNN, but before prime time, as Judy Woodruff interviewed
former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey on the 7pm ET Inside
Politics.<p>

    -- Welfare reform reported from the viewpoint of potential
victims on ABC, CBS and NBC without any voices in favor of the
new law. <p>



<center><h2><a name="Kay">Slashing</a> Attacks on GOP Never Scorned As Negative
Reporters Swoon Over Cuomo, Jackson</center></h2><p>

    On Tuesday night in San Diego, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and
Rep. Susan Molinari made jokey remarks about President Clinton
and were tagged as "attack dogs." Last night, Jesse Jackson
declared: "President Clinton has been our first line of defense
against the Newt Gingrich contract, America's right-wing assault
on our elderly, our students, and our civil rights." Mario Cuomo
announced: "The Republicans are the real threat. They are the
real threat to our women. They are the real threat to our
children. They are the real threat to clean air, clean water, and
the rich landscape of America...in the end, Bill Clinton spells
hope and Republicans spell disaster." Did the media see "slashing
partisan attacks"? Hardly. Note each network's contrast: <p>

    -- CNN's Ken Bode oozed: "Convention rhetoric has not been
much better than it was tonight, particularly with Jesse Jackson.
And of course, no one's going to forget for some time the First
Lady's speech, which was also terrific."  Farai Chideya gushed:
"Jesse Jackson's speech was extraordinary in its sense of hope,
purpose, and vision." Bob Franken asked Andrew Cuomo: "It was
quite a scene watching as they listened to the speech. You really
are a fan of his speaking style. It's amazing, isn't it?"
In San Diego, CNN's Judy Woodruff declared: "Well, they said it
was going to be a Clinton-bashing night at the Republican
convention, Bernie, and I think that is just what we heard from
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison." Bernard Shaw replied: "And the
bashing will continue when the keynote speaker, Susan Molinari,
steps up there."<p>

    -- Last night, ABC's Peter Jennings asserted: "Just a little
earlier this evening going out of their way, the Democrats were,
to show they embrace the differences among them or between them,
they put forward to speak two of the senior liberals in the party
who did more than anything else on this day to energize this
crowd."<p>
    In San Diego, Jennings began: "Expect tonight to see very
much the attacks on President Clinton ratcheted up to a much
greater degree than they have been so far." Sam Donaldson added:
"Tonight, as you say, Peter, they are expecting red
meat...Tonight they want to hear President Clinton bashed." <p>

    -- Last night, Dan Rather suggested on CBS: "Mrs. Clinton
received a ringing defense during what was clearly the most
stirring speech of the convention so far." Bob Schieffer added:
"The man who made that speech was Jesse Jackson, who can make a
speech when he sets his mind to it. But his biggest applause line
came when he said that Democrats must set up a line of defense to
protect the old and the young from the Republican assault, and
then he said, and to set up a line of defense against their
vicious attacks on the First Lady. The place just went wild when
he said that."<p>
    In San Diego, Rather said Hutchison "is expected to hit
President Clinton rhetorically with everything short of a tire
tube." Schieffer asked the Senator: "I must say it's Attack Dog
Hutchison tonight. How do you feel in this new role?" <p>

    -- Last night, Tom Brokaw noted: "The old lion has not lost
its roar. There are very few speakers left in America who can
switch on a hall like Jesse Jackson. He has done it so many times
in the past. He began tonight in more muted tones, but of course,it's almost irresistible for him, and it grows out of a very deep
passion." Tim Russert added: "The crowd is letting loose a little
bit because the passion and the philosophy of Jesse Jackson is
something they very much ascribe to, and by him bridging the gap
and endorsing Bill Clinton so wholeheartedly, it's a plus for
Bill Clinton."<p>
    In San Diego, Brokaw told NBC viewers: "The party knows
better than anyone else it has to lower the threshhold of
perceived meanness on the part of the country." Russert
underlined the point: "Key words: mean-spirited and extremist.
They want to avoid those labels...I think the speech by Senator
Hutchison is dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be
interpreted by some people as mean."<p>



<center><h2><a name="most">"Most Economists"</a> Blame Spending, Not Tax Cuts for Deficit
New Survey Proves Dole Tax Cut News Wrong</center></h2><p>
    A just released survey of 700 economists found that "52
percent blame the growth of the federal deficit in the 1980s on
increased government spending more than on the Reagan tax cut,"
which was blamed by 48 percent. The fact that economists are
about evenly split contradicts many recent media reports.<p>

    "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the
budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan," announced
reporter David Bloom on the August 5 NBC Nightly News. Colleague
Mike Jensen insisted a few minutes later that "most analysts say
it's not good economics."<p>

    The next morning a headline over a Washington Post news story
declared: "Economists Question Dole's Plan." The headline over a
Boston Globe news story asserted: "Economists Cool to Dole's
Tax-Cut Plan: Candidate Speaks of Growth, but Analysts See No Big
Payoff."  <p>

    The poll of 700 members of the American Economics Association
discovered that 81 percent agreed that the Reagan tax cuts
increased economic growth. A plurality of 42 percent "want to see
the next Congress put a high priority on both restraining
government spending and cutting taxes," matching the Dole-Kemp
promise.<p>

    William Adams, a public administration professor at George
Washington University, directed the poll conducted August 19-21.
Though reported in this week's Weekly Standard and in Tuesday's
Washington Times, none of the above-mentioned outlets have yet
bothered to revise their claims.<p>


<center><h2><a name="voices">Voices</a> In Favor of Welfare Reform Vetoed by Networks
Welfare-State Television Sells the Liberal Line</center></h2><p>

    All three networks featured stories last night critical of
the new welfare reform law:<p>

    -- On NBC Nightly News, Tom Brokaw presented his view: "There
are serious questions about what happens to these people after
they're taken off the welfare rolls. Andrea Mitchell went to
Indiana to look at the conflict between fixing the system and
doing the right thing by people." Mitchell featured no welfare
reform proponents, just social workers, Jesse Jackson, and
impending victims: "Kimberly Gilbert will get benefits for two
years. After that, she's cut off, whether or not she finds a job.
That deadline is near for Charla Milton. Unable to find work, she
is terrified."<p>

    -- On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings suggested:
"Maybe if he is reelected, Mr. Clinton will do something to
reverse himself on welfare reform. Many of these delegates hope
so." Reporter Erin Hayes asked where the jobs would come from to
support welfare recipients: "An Urban League study found in
Chicago there are six times as many people who need work as there
are entry-level jobs available." Hayes aired no voices favoring
welfare reform, and concluded: "There is another concern as well:
the young children. When their mothers are made to go to work,
who will take care of them? Right now, no one really has an
answer. With so much still uncertain about welfare reform, it is
no wonder there is fear out there."<p>

    -- On the CBS Evening News, reporter Harry Smith also ignored
taxpayers and focused on victims: "We talked to four welfare moms
from across Chicago. They feel like they are this year's
political target...President Clinton seemed deaf to protests last
week when he signed the new welfare cuts into law. Cuts many
Americans support, but cuts these women think go too far." Smith
concluded: "Neighborhoods like Cabrini-Green have more than their
share of misery. Folks around here think misery is only going to
grow. Their long faith in the Democratic Party has been shaken,
and the actions of President Clinton confirm their fear that the
poor just do not count."<p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</center></h2><p>

<h3>Jack E. White Hot</h3><p>

    Time's Jack E. White exemplified the media's left-wing anger
against welfare reform in the September 2 issue: "Did anyone else
find it unnerving that only days before Bill Clinton signed a
welfare-reform law that will plunge more than a million children
into official poverty, he marked his 50th birthday with glitzy
celebrations in New York City that added $10 million to his
party's bulging campaign war chest? Shades of Marie Antoinette,
Newt Gingrich, and Jesse Helms." White complained: "As Jesse
Jackson has repeatedly and unavailingly pointed out, it makes
little sense to elect a Democrat if he governs like a
conservative Republican."<p>


<h3>Harshly Negative Attack</h3><p>

    In the same issue, Time columnist Margaret Carlson lit into 
the marriage of Bob and Elizabeth Dole: "Any time the Doles play
the family-values card, they are betting that divorce and
remarriage wipe the slate clean and stop the questions -- that
suddenly leaving your marriage and asking for an `emergency
divorce,' as Dole did from his first wife (when his daughter was
17), is morally equivalent if not superior to sticking out the
pain in your marriage and keeping a family together, as the
Clintons did...Now being divorced gives you a political pass, and
staying married gets you an inquisition."<p>


<h3>No Liberal Bias</h3><p>

    CBS News reporter Bob Schieffer told freelance newsman Marc
Morano in Chicago on Tuesday that the media don't tilt left: "I
think the media pretty well reflect American society. You know,
it's like when we had a draft army. You'd find one example of
everything there."<p>


<h3>Bayh vs. Molinari</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw put GOP keynoter Susan Molinari on the defensive
when he interviewed her two weeks ago on the NBC Nightly News,
but last night he took a more deferential approach in
interviewing Democratic keynote speaker Gov. Evan Bayh.
Molinari faced seven straight questions about abortion and women:
"So they look at the platform. It's pretty rigid in its language
on abortion. Then people like Susan Molinari and Jack Kemp and
Bob Dole say don't pay attention to the platform, pay attention
to what we do."<p>

    Brokaw also pressed Bayh from the left, but only made him
answer one hostile question: "If there is a debate in the party
at the moment, it is about welfare reform. A lot of Democrats, in
Congress especially, think we have gone too far, too fast, that a
lot of children, more than a million, could be put below the
poverty line." <p>

    Unlike with Molinari, Brokaw played up Bayh's rising star
status: "When you walk out tonight to deliver that keynote
speech, all over this hall and in the television booths and in
the print section, people are going to be saying `Evan Bayh,
future candidate for President of the United States. This is a
big moment for him.' You can't completely erase that from your
thinking?"<p>


<h3>Calling J.C. Watts</h3><p>

    Two weeks ago, ABC, CBS, and NBC carried none of Rep. J.C.
Watts' speech, which occurred during their live 10pm ET hour,
though GOP delegates loved it. Last night, ABC ran excerpts of
the pre-10pm ET addresses of Jesse Jackson and Mario Cuomo (and
on Nightline). CBS showed some Jackson clips.<p>

August 26 interview</i><p> 

<center><h2><a name="Another">Another</a> Day of Questions from the Left
Liberal Delegates, But Party's Too Conservative</center></h2><p>

    Viewers of last night's network coverage could have learned
how Democratic delegates are outside the mainstream, but they
heard nothing about controversies like abortion, as the networks
again worried Clinton had gone too far right.<p>

    -- CBS and CNN attempted to make Hillary Clinton the martyr
of harsh San Diego attacks and ask her welfare questions from the
left. <p>

    -- Network reporters worried that the party has become too
conservative as they grilled Democrats for not opposing the
welfare reform bill. <p>

    -- ABC, CNN and PBS mentioned the liberal nature of the
delegates at least once, but not NBC or CBS in prime time. "We
know from our survey that these delgates are far to the left of
the mainstream just as the Republicans were to the right of the
mainstream," ABC's Sam Donaldson declared last night. Unions also
got brief attention. Tom Brokaw referred to "a very unusually
high representation of labor down on the floor" and on CBS Dan
Rather also noted the labor angle.<p>

    -- Three networks mentioned tobacco funding of the
convention, but none noted the hypocrisy of Democrats taking
money from an industry they rail against. On CNN in prime time
Bill Schneider explained that the NRA and tobacco lobby are the
"least popular" special interests "and those are the two that the
Democrats are going to try to showcase as linked to the
Republican Party." On World News Tonight yesterday ABC's intrepid
Brian Ross cited a brunch cruise for delegates "put on by the
Brown and Williamson tobacco company" and how "Philip Morris has
the most extensive operation with the same group of back room
operatives who ran things in San Diego." NBC's Tom Brokaw
referred to a tobacco-sponsored event where delegates wore "Keep
the FDA off the farm" buttons. <p>

    -- Only two reporters questioned the authenticity of
Democratic claims to moderation. During the PBS-NBC joint
broadcast, Lisa Myers asked a delegate: "You have a President who
talks like a Republican, you have a platform that is so centrist
that some critics say it's a con job. Is this essentially,
though, a liberal party?" CNN's Judy Woodruff asked Bob Kerrey if
Clinton will go left after the election.<p>

    After scant attention Sunday, Democratic suppression of
abortion debate fell completely off TV screens.<P255D> In all of
Monday's prime time coverage no reporter or anchor raised the
topic, though Bob Casey, the pro-life former Governor of
Pennsylvania, gave a speech at another Chicago location on the
party's intolerance. <p>

<center><h2><a name="poor">CNN, CBS Ask First Lady About Harsh GOP Attacks, Welfare:
Poor Hillary, Wondering If It's Worth It</a></center></h2><p>

   In 1992, then-PBS anchor Judy Woodruff gave a soft convention
interview to Hillary Clinton in July, but blistered Barbara Bush
in August in Houston with a welter of accusatory questions about
the inappropriateness of Bush campaign tactics. On last night's
Inside Politics on CNN, Woodruff devoted her interview to
eliciting Hillary Clinton's responses to Republican attacks:<p>

    -- "Let me take you back to San Diego. Bob Dole said it
doesn't take a village, a collective, the state, which he said
has made mistakes in raising children, it takes a family. Is this
something that is going to become a major issue in this fall
campaign?"<p>

    -- "Also in San Diego, former president George Bush told the
delegates he `worked hard,' I'm quoting here, `to uphold the
dignity and the honor of the presidency, to treat it with
respect. And then he added, quote, `it breaks his heart, when the
White House is demeaned, the presidency diminished.' Does that
hurt coming from your immediate predecessor?"<p>

    -- "He then went on, Mrs. Clinton, he made a point of saying
that his wife, Mrs. Bush, quote, `unquestionably upheld the honor
of the White House.' Is that an insult to you?"<p>

    -- When Mrs. Clinton failed to answer sharply enough,
Woodruff insisted: "But he was clearly drawing a contrast
there...you're not hurt?"<p>

    Stories of Mrs. Clinton's rough-house approach to politics,
such as her reported role in firing and lodging criminal
accusations against seven workers of the White House Travel
Office, did not prevent CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart
from also presenting the First Lady as the beleaguered martyr of
unfortunate Republican attacks: <p>

    -- "In the San Diego Republican convention, you were the
subject of much conversation, and I think the target, I think
many would say, of some very serious attacks."<p>
 "Do you ever, seriously, in the White
House, when all the doors are closed, do you ever say `Is this
worth it'?"<p>

    Diaz-Balart also asked the First Lady two welfare questions
from the left: <p>

    -- "One thing you care very deeply about is children, and
even your supporters that work for children's rights have
criticized President Clinton's decision to okay the welfare
reform bill. What were your conversations with him when he was in
that period of really making a determination?"<p>

    -- "What would you say to the people in the Children's
Defense Fund [the liberal group she used to chair] who have
criticized it? What is your response to them?"<p>

    Woodruff also peppered the First Lady with welfare reform
questions, all six of them from the left. Here are three, another
is the quote of the day.<p>

    -- "Your close friend, Marian Wright Edelman of the
Children's Defense Fund, said the President's signing and this is
a quote, 'makes a mockery of his pledge not to hurt children,'
she said, 'it will leave a moral blot on his presidency and the
country that will never be forgotten.'"<p>

    -- "But if the bill is so flawed, why sign it? Why not work
to fix it, and sign it later?"<p>

    -- "Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again
just now, said that much of the time she kept her disagreements
with the President to herself in private, but there were times
that she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there
ever come a time with you, and if not welfare reform, then what?" <p>


<center><h2><a name="networks">Democrats and Clinton Have Gone Too Far to the Right?
Networks Worry Democrats Not Liberal Enough</a></center></h2><p>

    Last night network correspondents worried how wise it has
been for Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party to have moved to
the right and, in so doing, abandoned their liberal princples.
Tom Brokaw placed the party, which fought Republican efforts to
slow the rate of growth of government, to the right of center.<p>

    -- During PBS-NBC coverage, Margaret Warner asked Andrew
Kohut of the Pew Research Center: "Does the President pay any
political price for turning his back on traditional liberalism,
that is, among enthusiasm among traditional Democrats?"<p>

    -- Later during NBC's solo time, Tom Brokaw interviewed VP Al
Gore and then observed to NBC's Tim Russert: "The Vice President
was saying no no no, this is not forced on us by the Republicans,
we really always had this kind of thing in mind in the first
place. But since 1994 they have slid across the political
spectrum to really right of center. And they've got a guy by the
name of Dick Morris who's advising them on a daily basis how to
be more pragmatic."<p>

    -- On CBS, Dan Rather asked Jesse Jackson: "Bill Clinton's
been running pretty hard to the right, so far that some Democrats
now call him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?" <p>

    -- Talking to Tom Hayden, Ed Bradley of CBS wondered:
"Senator Hayden, there are people who say the Democratic Party
has become very pragmatic in an effort to win this election,
they've given up their principles. Your response to that?" <p>


<center><h2><a name="For">For</a> Second Day, Focus is on Evils of Welfare Reform
"Slightly Terrified" of New Democrat Promises</h2></center><p>

    Just as on Sunday, last night the networks repeatedly pressed
Democrats from the left on Bill Clinton's signing of the welfare
reform bill. A PBS reporter wondered if it meant the dismantling
of the "safety net that took so long to put together."<p>

    -- CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Illinois Senator Carol
Moseley-Braun: "How does it feel, tell us, you voted against the
welfare reform bill, you're now obviously very supportive of the
President, tell us do you feel that he sort of betrayed some of
those values that you expressed. How can you go forward now and
support him after his decision to sign that welfare reform bill
into law?"<p>

    -- HHS Secretary Donna Shalala got it from the left during
PBS-NBC coverage as Tom Brokaw inquired: "If you were a poor
single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many
resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the
right things, but there aren't many jobs for people who have real
skills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the next
two years?"<p>

    -- Earlier in the evening, Elizabeth Farnesworth of PBS
grilled White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes: "We're
looking tonight at this whole question of who the Democrats are.
Did the President turn his back on fundamental Democratic
principles when he signed the welfare bill?" She also forwarded a
liberal argument: "Does it worry you that the welfare, signing
the welfare bill is unraveling the safety net that took so long
to put together?"<p>

    -- ABC's Jeff Greenfield highlighted bewilderment in network
ranks about the acceptance of Clinton's retreat from liberalism
on the issue. Interviewing Congressman Charles Rangel, he asked:
"Congressman it used to be said that when the Democrats make a
firing squad they form a circle, they love to rebel against an
incumbent President, and you have the welfare bill and the move
to the center. You're from one of the most liberal cities in the
country, why is the dog not barking in the night? Why are you
staying with the President given that discontent?" <p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></h2></center><p>

<h3>Harsh or Enthusiastic?</h3><p>

    Bill Clinton and Bob Dole attacked each other on Sunday, but
for CBS This Morning, only Bob Dole was harsh. Sandra Hughes
reported Monday: "Dole's big moment yesterday came when he
stormed Chicago, and launch-ed a harsh attack against the man of
the hour there, Bill Clinton." <p>

    But a few minutes earlier Bill Plante reviewed Clinton's
train trip, admiringly noting that "at each whistle stop Mr.
Clinton threw himself enthusiastically into campaign mode,
leaning deep into every crowd and lacing his remarks with
partisan fire." <p>

    So are the Democratic candidates avoiding harsh personal
attacks? On Good Morning America co-host Charlie Gibson asked
Senator Christopher Dodd: "You said the other day that `I got the
word out,' that I don't want to hear personal attacks against the
Republicans at this convention. Yesterday on his train trip the
President accused Republicans of blackmail to get their budget.
Al Gore, yesterday, accused the Republicans of ignorance and
audacity, talked about the two-headed monster of Dole and
Gingrich. Dick Gephardt, the leader of the House, of the
Democrats, talked about Republican extremism, said they're
radicals. Talk about getting the word out?"<p>


<h3>Gumbel's Gripe</h3><p>

    Monday Bryant Gumbel couldn't stop from taking one more shot
at Republicans for an image he helped create. Interviewing
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley on Today, he queried: "The
Republicans, as you know, took a lot of criticism for the
scripting of their convention and for presenting an image that
was contrary to their platform. How do you figure this convention
is going to be different?"<p>
<h3>Ignoring Casey's Case</h3><p>

    Former Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey, banned from the
Democratic convention podium for the second party gathering in a
row, gave an impassioned pro-life speech yesterday at Chicago's
Fischer Center. Despite a reported heavy media presence at his
speech (which he wanted to make at the convention), none of the
networks aired the Casey speech story on last night's evening
news shows. <p>

    In his new book Fighting For Life, Casey remembered the 1992
platform hearings: "There were many Democrats, I said, who
opposed our party's embrace of the radical pro-abortion lobby.
Often it seemed the Democratic National Committee had become
little more than an auxiliary of NARAL -- the National Abortion
Rights Action League."<p>

    On Monday's Nightline, ABC's Chris Bury gave Casey 15 seconds
of fame: "The Democrats in Chicago, like the Republicans in San
Diego, have tried to script any spontaneity right out of the
program. Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, whose strong
anti-abortion views defy the party's position, had to find
cameras outside the convention hall."<p>


<h3>At Hillary's Side</h3><p>

    As a CBS camera panned the United Center last night it came
upon a man standing beside Hillary Rodham Clinton. Dan Rather
identified him: "The gentleman in the dark suit to the right of
the frame, who was just framed out, Les Moonves of CBS. And the
chant takes up `four more years.' The lady, the First Lady from
Chicago with the smashing smile, is age 48. She and President
Clinton have been married for 20 years." Moonves's job with CBS?
President of the entertainment division.<p>

<i>"You said this morning that the party's message will focus on the
needs and cares of the people. Now, how do you reconcile that
with a President who has just signed a quote 'welfare reform
bill' which by general agreement is going to put a lot of poor
children on the street?"<p>
-- Dan Rather to Chris Dodd during an
interview on the August 25 CBS Evening News</i><p>


<center><h2><a name="Weekend">Weekend</a> Shows Fail to Apply GOP Level of Scrutiny
Democrats Not Portrayed as Intolerant, Extreme</h2></center><p>

    Unlike Republicans two Sundays ago, Democrats yesterday did
not come under assault from the networks over their intolerance
on abortion. While the subject was raised a few times, the
networks spent more time raising liberal criticisms of the
welfare reform bill President Clinton just signed. Findings from
weekend coverage:<p>

    -- Democrats faced about one-third as many questions about
abortion and the exclusion of dissenting speakers. Two weeks ago,
the Sunday morning shows asked 27 questions about the GOP split
on abortion and the failure to allow Gov. Pete Wilson to speak.
Interviewers asked only 10 questions yesterday, perhaps because
unlike inviting pro-choice Wilson and pro-life Bay Buchanan weeks
before, pro-life Democrats like Gov. Bob Casey were not booked,
despite Casey's Friday Wall Street Journal op-ed attacking the
"intolerance" of a "gag rule party." CNN's Late Edition asked
only two questions, compared to 11 posed to the GOP; NBC's Meet
the Press asked six questions, compared to nine for the GOP.
ABC's This Week with David Brinkley had two questions instead of
four, and CBS's Face the Nation offered zero abortion questions,
compared to three in San Diego.<p>
 
    -- No mention of corporate contributions to the Democratic
convention, not even of the hypocrisy of accepting funds from
tobacco companies while Clinton attacks them with rhetoric and
new regulations. Two weeks ago on Meet the Press, David Broder
twice asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour about the hypocrisy of
accepting corporate money for the convention while promising
campaign finance reform. On the Friday, August 23 World News
Tonight, however, ABC's Brian Ross did do a story on the top ten
corporate contributors to the DNC, including "a labor union under
federal investigation for its ties to the mafia."<p>

    -- No questions were posed about how unions have taken over
the Democratic Party. A Washington Post survey of Democratic
delegates found 34 percent belong to a union. Friday's Wall
Street Journal noted that "more than 400 delegates -- roughly one
in ten -- will be members of the National Education Association."
But that failed to generate questions about who controls the
party. <p>

    Only 21 percent of GOP delegates said they were part of the
religious right, but in San Diego CBS worried about their having
too much influence. On Sunday August 11, Face the Nation guests
got five ominous questions. "There are a number of Republicans
who are very uncomfortable with what they feel is the power, the
control that the conservative religious right has. Are you
concerned about that?" CBS reporter Phil Jones asked Texas
Governor George W. Bush.<p>

    -- Democrats called too conservative, charged from the left
with going too far on welfare reform.



<center><h2><a name="Just">Just</a> as in San Diego, Networks Attack from the Left
Network Stars Line Up for Welfare Status Quo</center></h2><p>

    The networks came at Republicans from the left on abortion in
San Diego, and on Sunday they also came at Democrats from the
left. By concentrating on liberal complaints about welfare
reform, reporters helped Bill Clinton's effort to portray himself
as a centrist. Dan Rather wondered if the party had gone "too far
to the right?"<p>

    -- Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal set the tone of liberal
anger on Saturday night's CNN Capital Gang: "Jesse Jackson and a
few others will complain and I think a majority of the delegates
here privately agree with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan that
supporters of this bill, quote, 'will take this disgrace to their
graves,' end quote. They know Bill Clinton put his own political
interests ahead of the well being of little children." <p>

    --  Meet the Press moderator Tim Russert demanded of DNC
General Chairman Chris Dodd: "It's an issue of morality to many
people, and how can you defend a President who basically said to
the Congressional Democrats: Listen, that's your view, but I'm
doing this, because -- was it politically expedient?"<p>

    -- Talking with Democratic strategist James Carville later in
the show, Russert reminded viewers that he once toiled for former
New York Governor Mario Cuomo: "But the Democratic Party for
sixty years, James Carville, fought for a minimum guarantee
payment to poor children and Bill Clinton undid that. Don't you
have to draw the line someplace and say 'I'm a Democrat and this
is what I stand for'?"<p>

    -- On yesterday's Face the Nation, CBS reporter Rita Braver
asked Chicago Mayor Richard Daley: "The party looks a lot more
united right now. But we have a sense that there are some
underlying divisions and particularly this week with the
President signing a welfare bill that a lot of people think is
going to put children into poverty. And I guess the question is
that in a city like this, aren't you scared about what is going
to happen? Aren't you afraid you are going to have a lot of
hungry children?"<p>

    -- Minutes later while interviewing Indiana Governor Evan
Bayh, Braver pictured the Democrats as being too conservative: "I
just wondered what you think is the really big difference between
the Democrats and Republicans in this election? What would make
people go Democrat when it seems like the Democrats are moving so
close to Republican positions?"<p>

    --  Last night Dan Rather joined the chorus, inquiring of
Braver on the CBS Evening News: "Rita, how worried are the
Democrats about protests from some here that the party is running
too far to the right, particularly on welfare reform?"  <p>

<center><h2><a name="Benchmarks">Benchmarks for the Week to Come:</a>
A Look Back at San Diego</center></h2><p>

    Before the networks begin their prime time coverage in
Chicago, here's a brief summary of how they covered the
Republican convention in San Diego. <p>

    -- Labeling. Republican delegates, speakers, and candidates
were described as conservative more than three times as often as
moderate, but reporters also used more extreme labels than
moderate labels. The networks employed 46 conservative labels
(including 16 references to extreme conservatism) to only 13
moderate labels.<p>

    -- Agenda of Questions. Reporters posed more than seven times
as many questions from the liberal agenda as they did from a
conservative agenda: 51 questions from the left, compared to only
six questions from the right.<p>

    -- Controversies. Reporters referred to the Republican
Party's split on the abortion issue, including Gov. Pete Wilson's
"disinvitation" to speak, on 55 occasions in prime time. In 1992,
the Democrats' spiking of Gov. Bob Casey surfaced only six times
(once on NBC, five times on CNN). ABC and CBS never acknowledged
the Casey flap.<p>


<center><h2><a name="Sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Unpopular Koppel</h3><p>

Most people think Ted Koppel was wrong to leave the Republican
convention early, a Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll found. On
yesterday's Fox News Sunday, host Tony Snow reported that when
asked if Koppel was "justified in leaving," 52 percent said no,
31 percent responded yes and 16 percent were undecided. On
Tuesday of the GOP gathering, Koppel announced Nightline would
leave because "this convention is more infomercial than a news
event." <p>


<h3>Moderate" Democrats?</h3><p>

"Return to Chicago: This Time, the Democrats Embrace Moderation"
declared the headline on the front of the Sunday Washington
Post's convention section. Four pages later the Post headline
over a story on a survey of delegates read: "Delegates Leaning
More Liberal Than Their Leader or the Rank and File." Indeed, 82
percent favor affirmative action, 65 percent are against a
balanced budget amendment, 72 percent oppose "reducing spending
on social programs," but 65 percent want less defense spending.<p>


<h3>Hillary the Revolutionary</h3><p>

Sam Donaldson identified Hillary Clinton's problem on yesterday's
This Week with David Brinkley: "I think much of the opposition to
Hillary Rodham Clinton is the fact that she is a strong-willed
woman doing things in a man's arena, and we men don't seem to
like that." <p>
After George Will pointed out that politics is the arena of many
women, from Margaret Thatcher to Indira Gandhi, Cokie Roberts
retorted that she's been an "agent of change" and "it's very
difficult for the world to accept people who have been
revolutionaries."<p>

    <h2><center>Three items today:<p></center></h2>

1) The Republican Party has been "captured by the extremists" and
"Don't you get mad" when the First Lady is criticized, just two
of Dan Rather's statements and questions to Bill Clinton for 60
Minutes on Sunday night.<p>
2) For a former Washington Post reporter the Republican
convention reminded her of slaughtered Indians and of Reagan's
mean policies.<p>
3) Just about everyone in Hollywood showed up at or served as
host for President Clinton's 50th birthday bash Sunday night. One
major celebrity shouted that "Dole sucks!"<p>

 1) Sunday afternoon Dan Rather interviewed President Clinton
for that night's 60 Minutes. Dan Rather started out by asking:
"Some of your staff members, not by name, have been saying, 'yes
the President thinks Bob Dole is a nice person and has been a
pretty good leader in some ways, but, say they, he's been
captured by the extremists in the Republican Party, the radical
part of the Republican Party, including Newt Gingrich. Is that
what you think?"<p>

    Rather showed Clinton video of criticisms from Bob Dole and
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison at the Republican convention. Almost
apologetic, Rather noted, "You said your hope is it can be fought
out on the issues, but one more thing from the convention, then
I'll give you a chance to respond to it. As you must know,
whether you watched the convention or not, the Republicans fired
a number of shots at the First Lady. Some samples. Former
President Bush said, quote, 'Mrs. Bush upheld the honor of the
White House, and did it with class and style and caring and
love.'....I don't know of anyone in the convention who didn't
take that as a difference of the present First Lady and the
former First Lady."<p>
    
    After Clinton responded, Rather implored: "Don't you get mad,
Mr. President, when this sort of thing happens?"<p>

     2) And before you forget the media's animosity toward the
Republican convention, here's a portion of a commentary piece in
Friday's USA Today by Jill Nelson, a former Washington Post
reporter: <p>
    "I found it hard not to cringe. I was embarrassed by the
specter of everyone's favorite black man, Colin Powell, lecturing
us on why he became a Republican and referring to a  divine
providence that gave us this land.' Tell that to the Native
Americans who were slaughtered in the name of 'divine
providence.' I felt manipulated, not moved, by Nancy Reagan's
tribute to her Ronnie as some sort of caring everyman,
considering that under Reagan the rich got richer, the national
debt skyrocketed, and working Americans were left holding the
bag."<p>

    3 ) Sunday night the Democratic Party held a series of
birthday parties in New York City and around the country for
President Clinton. The Washington Post's Lloyd Grove reported
Monday that in addition to emcee Whoopi Goldberg that attending
celebrities included Tony Bennett, Carly Simon, Jon Bon Jovi,
Aretha Franklin, and James Earl Jones. <p>

    Monday's New York Post added these names to the celebrity
list: Leslie Nielsen, Tim Conway, Ted Danson and Mary
Steenburgen. The New York Post's Cindy Adams reported: "The party
was beamed around the country by satellite so other celebs could
get a chance to host a shindig of their very own: In L.A.,
Nicolas Cage and his wife, Patricia Arquette, played host. In San
Francisco it was Michael Keaton, who has never, ever done
anything political before. In Baltimore, it was Valerie Harper;
in Boston, Judy Collins; in Nashville, L.L. Cool J; in Denver,
C.C. Wayans...."<p>
 
    The Washington Post's Grove relayed that at one of the NYC
bashes, "Comedian and morning television host Rosie O'Donnell
entertained the crowd by shouting, 'Dole sucks!'"<p>

    A very inclusionary and tolerant message. -- Brent Baker.<p>

<center><h2>Quote of the Day</h2><p></center>

<i>"Just how tightly scripted is this convention? Well, a Russian 
television reporter said today that this is as tightly controlled 
as anything the Communist Party ever put on, Tom." <p>
-- Reporter 
David Bloom from the convention floor to anchor Tom Brokaw, 
August 14 NBC Nightly News.</i><p>
<center><h2><a name="finally">Finally Find a Republican They Like, But Still Attack 
Rest Elizabeth Dole: "Masterful"</h2></center><p>

It took until the third night, but Wednesday evening the networks 
finally found a Republican they could respect: Elizabeth Dole. 
However, they still spent yesterday morning and evening 
disparaging speakers who had criticized President Clinton and 
questioning the credibility of Jack Kemp for changing his 
position on affirmative action and immigration.<p>

"Absolutely powerful performance," gushed Dan Rather after 
Elizabeth Dole finished her reflections on Bob Doles life. "It 
was masterful," agreed Tim Russert on NBC where Tom Brokaw 
explained: "In the language of this summer, ladies and gentlemen, 
that was a gold medal performance." ABCs Peter Jennings 
pronounced it "an unquestionably brilliant piece of stagecraft by 
Mrs. Dole."<p>

Yesterday, network viewers also heard:<p>

Jack Kemp has "damaged his credibility" by altering his positions 
on affirmative action and immigration. Lesley Stahl asked if he's 
selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?" ABC suggested it 
fights the very image that hes built for himself as an 
independent thinker." Kemp adjusted two views, all of Clintons 
are usually in constant motion. Will networks focus on that in 
Chicago? <p>

Networks come to Clintons defense and say Tuesday night speakers 
went too far in their harsh criticism of Clinton. CBS insisted 
Susan Molinari went after Clinton "with a vengeance" and Good 
Morning America's Elizabeth Vargas claimed "some of the harshest 
words were from Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison." Bryant 
Gumbel wondered if anyone is "seeing any evidence" of tolerance 
from Republicans. And NBCs Maria Shriver asked "how ugly" 
Republicans will make the fall campaign. <p>

Reporters may like Elizabeth Dole, but they still hold a grudge 
against Marilyn Quayle. ABCs Michel McQueen recalled the 
"strident tone" of her 1992 convention address as NBCs Tom 
Brokaw also charged last night that Mrs. Quayle was "too 
strident." <p>

<center><h2><a name="gop">GOP</a> Criticized for Attacking Clinton*s "Eating Habits";
Decrying "Bash Bill Night"</h2></center><p>
Journalistic sensitivity to any attacks on Bill Clinton quickly came through loud and clear Wednesday morning and night. "GOP Unleashes An Attack On Clinton Over Character and His Economic Policies," charged The New York Times.<p>

"Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack dog last night, using her keynote address to attack the President," Bryant Gumbel began Wednesday's Today.<p>

NBC*s morning crew stuck to the Democratic line in their questions. Gumbel asked Tim Russert: "There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it or quite the contrary?"<p>

Today's Katie Couric inquired of Republican Charles Black: "Chris Dodd of the DNC says this is a huge con game. That the way you're portraying the party as this moderate inclusive party just doesn't gibe with say, the platform, and some of the attitudes of members of the GOP. How do you address that?" Couric asked Pat Buchanan: "Your speech at the 1992 Republican convention, where you talked about a religious war, was considered by many to be very polarizing, a real turn-off, self-righteous, superior, exclusionary. Do you regret giving this speech?"<p>

CBS This Morning co-host Jane Robelot declared: "It was unofficially Bash Bill Night last night in San Diego...Speaker after Republican speaker went after the man with a vengeance, including the keynoter, Susan Molinari."<p>

Over on Good Morning America, news anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted: "Some of the harshest words were from Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who tried to paint the President as a tax and spend liberal." GMA co-host Charles Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits." ABC's Vargas didn't shy away from stereotyping: "But in addition to a gender gap, Republicans have had problems attacting minorities, a party that has traditionally been home to the angry white man."<p>

Last night NBC*s Lisa Myers demanded of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: "Some of the focus groups which had watched your speech...voters found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the degree to which you attacked the President. In retrospect do you think you went too far?"<p>

Calling conservatives "extremists" has been a Democratic mantra for two years, but NBC*s Maria Shriver asked Dole California campaign chairman Ken Khachigian: "You said coming out of this campaign, Clinton is going to have 80 days of hell, that we are going to take Clinton down in California, that we are going to take him down hard. How ugly is this going to get?" No uglier than the media in San Diego.<p>

<center><h2><a name="clinton">Will</a> Clinton Be Held to the Same Standard in Chicago?</h2>
<h3>Jack Kemp, the Political "Acrobat"</h3></center><p>

The choice of Jack Kemp as Dole's running mate prompted the media to point out Kemp's "independent thinking," his differences with Dole on issues like affirmative action and immigration. Now that Kemp has modified those two views to reflect the party's platform, the media are accusing him of abandoning principle.<p>

While reporters portray President Clinton's flip-flops on every issue as "moving to the center," they don't see moves from Dole and Kemp in quite the same light. On Wednesday's CBS Evening News, anchor Dan Rather quipped: "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration. Isn't that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to 
attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?" Questioning Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, in prime time last night CBS's Lesley Stahl asked: "Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?"<p>

Interviewing Dan Quayle, NBC's Maria Shriver kept up the same line: "Let's talk about Jack Kemp [for] a minute. Today he reversed his position on immigration. Now in favor of expelling children of illegal immigrants from schools. How much does that damage his credibility?"<p>

On World News Tonight ABC's Jackie Judd asserted that "The quarterback became the acrobat today. Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions." She then looked at his affirmative action change, noting "that left at least one delegate here feeling abandoned." She concluded: "Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he's built for himself as an independent thinker."<p>

<center><h2><a name="cheese">Want</a> Some Cheese With Your Whine? </h2>
<h3>Koppel Cops Out of San Diego</h3></center>

Ted Koppel is angry. As quoted by Martha Moore in the August 14 USA Today, he complained that convention planners always exert as much control over coverage as possible, but this year, "`I think the politicians are ahead,'" says ABC's Ted Koppel, who took his Nightline show back to Washington today, two days early. `They have more control over what we put on the air this week than they have ever had before.'"<p>

Just how successful have planners been? According to USA Today ABC filled a bit over half of their broadcast on Monday, 34 minutes out of an hour, with actual convention proceedings. On Tuesday, ABC aired even less of the convention, 26 out of 66 minutes broadcast. ABC filled the rest with interviews, analysis and ads.<p>

Koppel sounded like a restless child in his Tuesday Nightline announcement: "This convention is more of an infomercial than a news event. Nothing surprising has happened, nothing surprising is anticipated. Frankly, we expect the Democratic convention in Chicago to be much of the same. Indeed the only reason we were planning to originate these Nightline broadcasts from Chicago in another couple of week was a sense of fairness. And then it occurred to us that perhaps we should learn from our experience. There was a time when the national political conventions were news events of such complexity that they required the presence of thousands of journalists , but not this year. If anything important happens we will certainly have an adequate staff here to cover it and we will send an equivalent unit to Chicago. But we don*t all have to be here so most of us from Nightline are going home tomorrow."<p>

Such is the sad state of American journalism: Koppel's Nightline broadcast five stories about Tonya Harding in 1994, many more about O.J. Simpson, but will only turn in two on the 1996 Republican convention."<p>

Reporters couldn't help but praise Elizabeth Dole, but Marilyn Quayle 
still hasn't lived down the media's feminist fury over her 1992 convention 
speech. On Tuesday night, ABC's Michel McQueen said: "I ran into Marilyn 
Quayle today, who gave a speech in 1992 that was kind of a 'peel the 
paint off the walls' speech that was described later on as contributing 
to a rather strident tone of the '92 convention. She told me she was 
shocked by the way it was received afterwards."<p>

After Dan Quayle's speech last night, NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled: "Marilyn 
Quayle, who spoke at the convention four years ago, and many people 
thought that her speech was too strident, talking about the place 
of women, critical of the feminist movement in this country at the 
time."<p>



<center><h2><a name="rapping">Rapping</a> Reagan's Film</h2></center>
<p>
Remember Bill Clinton's "Man From Hope" video during the 1992 Democratic convention? The sugary-sweet film was shown on all the networks and was widely praised for adding insight into Bill Clinton. But the Republican*s equally sweet video of President Ronald Reagan on Tuesday night touched off a round of media carping as to the video*s value as news.
<p>
As James Bennet reported in Wednesday*s New York Times, Jeff Zucker, Executive Producer of NBC coverage, said: "Let me say if I had to do it again, I would really give that a second thought...I*m not as convinced, Monday morning quarterbacking myself, that it was as newsworthy as I thought going in."
<p>
CBS officials clucked about their decision to pass over the video, hoping for more of a movie of the week flavor. "Lane Venardos, a CBS vice president, sounded equally comfortable with his decision to ignore the film almost completely. "We decided on news value alone not to run it," he said. "There was not one scintilla of new information." Mr. Venardos said convention planners had promised the video would include "new pictures of the former President, never-before-seen post-Alzheimer's-onset pictures."
<p>
<h3>Clinton: Fiscal Conservative</h3>
<p>
In the August 19 edition, Newsweek's six-million-dollar "anonymous" author, Joe Klein, declared the GOP faithful "entered their convention on a mild, quasi-delusional wave of enthusiasm. The rest of us will be forgiven for yawning: the Dole tax cut stands, to all but hard-core taxophobes, as a transparent and rather pathetic bit of politics. He wants to cut $548 billion over six years? And balance the budget? Does anyone actually believe this? The trouble is, after all the deficit reduction of the past few years, there isn*t much non-incendiary matter left on the federal level to cut."
<p>
Time's George Church sneered: "Getting people not to think might be helpful, particularly since some of Dole's numbers do not seem to add up." Church concluded: "A case could be made that the candidate who best represents the fiscally conservative, moderate Republican tradition is, believe it or not, Bill Clinton."
<p>
<h3>Candace Capitalizes</h3>
<p>
On Wednesday's Today, NBC's Jamie Gangel did a feature on  Candace Gingrich which painted a very unsympathetic portrait of the lesbian*s half-brother Newt: "Gingrich went on to call Candace a sinner. He's also compared homosexuality to alcoholism and is against legislation that would protect gays from being fired because of their sexual orientation." 
<p>
Gangel said to Candace: "You're being very polite about the fact that your brother says terrible things about homosexuals....He doesn't return your phone calls. He doesn't answer your faxes. He doesn't respond to his own sister. That's okay with you?"
<p>
Gangel never attempted to understand how the Speaker might feel: that Candace has capitalized on her half-brother's fame (complete with a guest star appearance on Friends by making him look insensitive, and that replying to any call or fax might lead to another batch of negative publicity.
Gangel simply claimed: "Candace says she is not trying to hurt her brother. She just wants equal rights and hopes people will learn to accept gay relationships."
<p>
<h3>Kemp's flip flops.</h3>
<p>
	When Bob Dole announced his choice of Jack Kemp as his running mate, the media quickly pointed out Kemp's "independent thinking," his differences with Dole on issues like affirmative action and immigration. Now that Kemp has modified his views to reflect those of the party platform, the media is accusing him of flip-flopping.
<p>
	On CNN's coverage of the convention, political analyst Ken Bode was quick to attack Kemp: "Today Jack Kemp did a double back dive ten degree of difficulty on the issues of immigration and affirmative action." Questioning Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, CBS' Lesley Stahl asked: "Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole."
<p>
	While reporters consider President Clinton's flip-flops "moving to the center," they don*t see moves from Dole and Kemp in quite the same light. On the August 14 CBS Evening News, anchor Dan Rather quipped: "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration. Isn*t that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?" Interviewing Dan Quayle, NBC's Maria Shriver kept up the same line: "Let's talk about Jack Kemp [for] a minute. Today he reversed his position on immigration. Now in favor of expelling children of illegal immigrants from schools. How much does that damage his credibility."
<p>
	The questions were no different on the floor of the convention. On the August 14 World News Tonight, ABC's Jackie Judd got her angle from a liberal California delegate, claiming Kemp had "abandoned" that wing of the party. She started her story: "The quarterback became the acrobat today. Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions to get in line with Bob Dole." It's not so unusual for a vice-presidential candidate to accommodate the views of the presidential candidate, but Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he*s built for himself as an independent thinker."

</h2></center>
<h3>Speaking of Infomercials...</h3>
<p>
As network stars grumble about the tightly scripted "infomercial" the GOP convention has become, perhaps they should remember the infomercial-like tone some reporters employed to promote the Clinton-Gore ticket at their New York City convention in 1992:
ABC*s Jim Wooten introduced the convention on July 13, 1992: "That*s the ticket. Not a liberal in sight and that*s the picture Clinton wants the convention to leave with the country. Democrats happily moving from their liberal past to their centrist future...So Clinton and his moderates have captured the Democratic Party for the moment."
<p>
In the next morning's New York Times, reporter David Rosenbaum echoed ABC: "The views that dominated the party for so long, what was proudly called liberal, are hardly in evidence in Madison Square Garden this week...Mr. Mondale, who in 1984 was the last down-the-line liberal to win the Democratic presidential nomination and who lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan in November, said he was resigned to the change."
<p>
On the evening of July 14, 1992 Dan Rather announced: "Delegates approved the Clinton-Gore center-of-the-road Democratic Party platform, trying to move the party closer to the voters around the malls in America*s suburbs."
<p>
CBS This Morning reporter Bill Plante touted Clinton's momentum: "Everything seems to be going Clinton's way. They couldn't be happier here. They say that the candidate*s numbers are improving every day. They have their moderate platform. And things are just generally where they would want them to be."
<p>
Peter Jennings claimed on July 15, 1992: "He's become a little more disciplined, Bill Clinton, but you know he loves a crowd. And he has, don*t want to get carried away here, but he has the kind of hands people respond to."
<p>
From the floor of the convention NBC's Maria Shriver merely tried to get Elizabeth Glaser to repeat her nasty attack on Ronald Reagan: "You place responsibility for the death of your daughter [from AIDS] squarely at the feet of the Reagan administration. Do you believe they are responsible for that?"
<p>
Before savaging Barbara Bush in August, then-PBS anchor Judy Woodruff asked Hillary Clinton: "The Clinton campaign has been saying that this is a week that they were trying to tell the American people more about who Bill Clinton really is...What is it that you think the American people should know about your husband that they may not know or may not understand?"<p>

<center><h2><a name="women">Women</a> Naturally Scared by Republican Policies</h2> 
<h3>Morning Lectures on Tolerance</h3> </center><p>
 
Supposed GOP intolerance and how Republican policies scare women  
dominated interviews on Tuesday's Today and Good Morning  
America.<p> 
 
Talking to Susan Molinari, Christine Todd Whittman and  Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, GMA's Charlie Gibson laid out why women are  
turned off by Republicans: "It was the Republican Party that did  
take the lead on ending federal welfare payments as they have  
been traditionally paid over the last 50 to 60 years and the  
prime beneficiaries of that are women. It is the Republican Party  
that took the lead on reducing the rate of growth in Medicare and  
Medicaid. It is the Republican Party now that is trying to make  
an issue of denying education and benefits to the children of  
illegal immigrants. It is the Republican Party that has rejected  
in the last week or so, tolerance language on abortion in the  
platform."<p> 
 
Then he asked: "There was an attempt by some in the platform  
hearings to get language included in the platform that simply  
asked for toleration of dissenting views particularly on  
abortion. It was language that Bob Dole wanted in the platform.  
The party rejected him, it rejected your views, all three of you  
in this, is this a tolerant party, do you feel comfortable in it  
with its position on tolerance?"<p> 
 
Quizzing Colin Powell on Today, Katie Couric queried: "Does the  
party platform trouble you? Does the fact that that some of these  
governors opted not to speak because they were told they could  
not discuss their views on abortion, do all those things make you  
basically doubt that this is a big tent here?"<p> 
 
Tom Brokaw wondered: "Gen. Powell, the difference between having  
a position in your heart and campaigning on something as Jack  
Kemp now is going to be forced to do, is going to say to a lot of  
black Americans and a lot of people who feel that they are denied  
full access to the privilege of being a citizen in this country,  
`thats just utter hypocrisy. What is there in this platform or  
in this party tonight that says to the rest of the African- 
Americans out there, come on in, theres a place for you?"<p> 

<center><h2><a name="reporters">Reporters</a> Stick to "Extremist" Labels on Republicans  
</h2> 
<h3>Media Echoes of Clinton Consultants</h3></center> <p>
 
Using the description extreme to tar the Republican party did  
not begin in the convention aisles of San Diego, but in the  
sullen liberal reaction to the Republicans electoral sweep in  
1994. Clinton consultant Dick Morris advised his White House  
clients to tag their opponents as extremist while at the same  
time stealing many of their positions. The media echoed the  
Morris strategy. MediaWatch analysts used the Nexis news data  
retrieval system to search for the word extreme within 25 words  
of "Republican" or "Democrat" in the three news magazines (Time,  
Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report) and USA Today from  
January 1, 1993 to May 31, 1996. <p> 
 
Analysts discovered reporters did not use many extremist labels  
in 1993 and 1994  41  but 26 of those were applied to  
Republicans, compared to ten mentions of dual extremes and only  
five for the Democrats who ruled both ends of Pennsylvania  
Avenue. Liberal moves to insure abortion on demand, gays in the  
military, nationalized health care, and massive tax increases  
werent beyond the media pale.  <p> 
 
But in the first 17 months of GOP control, Republicans were  
described as "extreme" in 123 stories, while only 15 found  
"extremes" on both sides. Just two mentioned "extreme" Democrats.  
In total, these six print outlets employed 149 extreme labels for  
Republicans to just seven for the Democrats.<p> 
 
USA Todays Richard Benedetto exemplified reporting on Republican  
extremism on June 16, 1995: "Democrats are trying to keep a stiff  
upper lip as they continue to oppose `extreme GOP cuts." Many of  
these were attributed to Democrats, but more than 20 came  
directly from reporters, such as Gloria Borgers March 11, 1996  
U.S. News suggestion that "taking on Buchananism would be good  
for Gingrich. Recall that until Buchanan surged, Gingrich was  
Washingtons resident extremist."<p> 
 
U.S. News & World Report reporter Kenneth Walsh claimed on March  
25, 1996: "Clintons feuds with some allies will make it harder  
to label him a liberal extremist, George Bush in 1988 caricatured  
Michael Dukakis." On October 27, 1995, Walsh happily noted:  
"President Clinton, playing Horatius at the bridge against the  
Republican hordes, is finally winning some favorable reviews.  
Democrats are rallying to his side as he defends the poor and  
elderly against GOP `extremism."<p> 
 
The "extreme" pattern also occurred in television coverage of the  
1996 presidential primaries. MediaWatch analysts studied the  
application of labels in primary stories from a week before the  
New Hampshire primary (February 13) to the South Carolina primary  
(March 2). Republicans and their supporters were labeled on 73  
occasions  45 of those extreme labels, almost all applied to  
Pat Buchanan. On February 25, 1996, CBS weekend anchor John  
Roberts asked consultant Joe Klein: "Some call Buchanan an  
extremist. Others call him American as apple pie. What is this  
fellows appeal?" Answered Klein: "He is both. He is an extremist  
and as American as apple pie." Using the same research parameters  
for a similar three-week period during the 1992 Democratic  
primaries, featuring ultraliberals like Tom Harkin and Jerry  
Brown, reporters used no extremist labels and only four  
applications of "liberal," all in the first two days of the study  
period.<p> 
 
In 1995, the networks introduced GOP presidential candidates by  
noting their "extremism." In 40 network stories introducing  
potential Republican challengers to Clinton, network reporters  
used 54 labels, 49 of which were "conservative" or more extreme.  
In fact, 19 labels, or 35 percent of the total, were labels such  
as "right," "far right," "hard right," "hard-line," "extremist,"  
'Republican fringe," and "ultraconservative fringe." On the  
February 24, 1995 CBS Evening News, reporter Linda Douglass  
alleged: "For years, critics have called [Sen. Phil] Gramm an  
extremist. But he argues these days his ideas are in the  
mainstream." In 27 stories introducing the Democratic candidates  
in 1991, none ever used an extreme term like "far left" or  
"ultraliberal."<p> 

<center><h2><a name="bryant">Bryant</a> Gumbel Scolds Delegates for Lack of Inclusion
But NBC Calls GOP-TV Unfair</h2></center> 

To keep "out what officials call the biased liberal media, NBCs 
Bob Faw reported Tuesday morning the RNC launched GOP-TV to 
provide complete convention coverage. Faw asserted: "What GOP TV 
calls unfiltered, doesnt even begin to pay lip service to 
balance or fairness." NBC should know.<p> 

Heres how Bryant Gumbel opened the Tuesday Today: "Good morning. 
Retired general Colin Powell, a new recruit to the GOP cause, 
addressed the delegates in San Diego last night, drawing cheers 
with accounts of why he became a Republican and why hell vote 
for Bob Dole. But although his speech was generally well-
received, the reception was restrained, and there were boos 
whenever Powell steered away from the right. Though they booed 
and also heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of 
inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We can 
expect more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996."
Guess which network scares journalists? Faw reported that 
"Jonathan Alter of Newsweek thinks GOP TV has started something 
deceptive and unwholesome." Alter explained: "It is political 
propaganda, masquarading as news, and thats a problem."<p>

Political propaganda masquerading as news? Sounds like Bryant 
Gumbel.<p>

<center><h2>Republican Officials Grilled by Network Reporters
A <a name="Tax">Tax</a> on Credibility</h2></center>

The credibility of Bob Doles tax cut proposal arose as a topic 
for skeptical questions Tuesday night.<p> 

On PBS, referring to a Concord Coalition official, Margaret 
	Warner inquired of Dole economist John Taylor: "Does Martha 
Phillips have a point that its hard to credibly make the case 
that you can both cut taxes and balance the budget?"<p>

NBCs Maria Shriver asked New Jersey Governor Christie Todd 
Whitman: "Bill Clinton has said that Bob Doles proposal for the 
economy would end up crippling the economy, balloon the deficit. 
Why is he wrong?"<p>

Early in the evening, Tom Brokaw demanded of Virginias George 
Allen: "Governor, are you not at all concerned about what happens 
to the federal deficit, which is a major, major concern for most 
of the delegates at this convention, based on the polling that 
weve done, if Bob Dole is able to put into effect his 15 percent 
tax cut?"<p>

And: "But if you say to your constituents in the state of 
Virginia, Listen, were going to cut it by 15 percent, taxes, but 
I cant touch 60 percent of the budget that were dealing with 
here, and thats the reality thats facing Bob Dole because of 
Medicare and defense spending and other things, do you think that 
we can get home-free here in seven years and balance the 
budget?"<p> 

<center><h2><a name="Hutchison">Hutchison</a> Speech Tagged "Dangerous" by NBC: Republicans Pummeled from the Left </h2></center>

"Tonight they're ready to take on the Clinton record and try to convince 
a lot of undecided voters that this party is more inclusive than its 
reputation," Peter Jennings announced at the start of ABC's convention 
coverage Tuesday night. But the networks wouldn't let the Republicans 
succeed. NBC Nightly News on Tuesday night devoted its "In 
Depth" segment to "a major problem for the GOP, the gender gap, moderate 
women feeling left out."<p>

A few hours later NBC's Tim Russert relayed as accurate the Democratic 
analysis of the address by Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. He 
charged: "Key words: Mean-spirited and extremist. They want to avoid 
those labels. They have thus far after two days and that's why you're 
not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime time tonight. I think the 
speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is dangerous, Tom, because she 
uses words that could be interpreted by some people as mean."<p>

Before the speech, Dan Rather offered a classic Ratherism: "Senator 
Kay Bailey Hutchison has now come out to the podium. She's expected 
to hit President Clinton, rhetorically, with everything short of a 
tire tube." But for the second night in a row Republicans were 
bombarded with questions and analysis that portrayed them as extreme 
and intolerant of anything outside their "rigid" views.<p>

The networks peppered the Republicans with questions from the liberal agenda. 
While the majority of questions dwelled on poll numbers and tactical gambits, 
interviews in the first two nights of prime-time network coverage 
featured 35 questions and statements from the left, to only four from 
the right. The evening newscasts contained eight liberal questions 
to zero conservative inquiries. One observation from the right last 
night: CNN's Judy Woodruff noting that "as a pro-life delegate said 
to me this morning..'I was interested in what Colin Powell had to 
say last night but I'm wondering when we're going to hear from a pro-liife 
point of view at the podium?'" For liberal questions, see pages 2 
and 3. <p>

Coverage focused on gender gap and intolerance on abortion as 
reporters suggested it's rational for women to not back the GOP. 

<center><h2><a name="Speechless">Speechless</a> Networks</h2></center>

In their "coverage" of the convention last night, none of the 
three broadcast networks gave any live airtime to prime time 
speeches by Reps. John Kasich and J.C. Watts and Gov. Christie 
Whitman. While ABC and CBS did show Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchisons 
speech in its entirety, NBC aired less than 2.5 minutes of it. 
While Hutchison was still speaking, NBC cut to Tim Russert, who 
gave the Democratic "rapid response" to it  even before it was 
over.<p>

Russert quoted the Democrats press release: "Once again the 
Republicans have showed the face of Bob Dole and Newt Gingrichs 
Republican Party through Sen. Hutchisons speech. It is nasty, 
gratuitous attacks against the President of the United States and 
mean-spirited." According to Russert, Hutchison gave the 
Democrats "what they wanted in order to respond in this way. 
Viewers just had to take his word for it.<p>

<h3>Summary or Pillory?</h3>

Tuesdays New York Times "convention summary" trashed the GOP 
platform: "The one adopted yesterday is extremely conservative, 
careening to the right on social issues like immigration, 
welfare, and homosexual rights, and omitting the word 'tolerance 
in an unbending abortion plank that fueled weeks of bitter 
intraparty debate."<p>

<h3>Two CBS Spins on Powell</h3>

Monday night Dan Rather said: "General Colin Powell was generally 
applauded by most of the delegates. There was a point, however, 
when he was clearly booed by many of the delegates in this hall. 
It wasnt just a case of scattered boos when Colin Powell said `I 
support a womans right to choose on abortion, and `Im a 
supporter of affirmative action. Thats the point when the boos 
came."<p>

On Tuesdays CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart delivered 
a different take: "General Colin Powell was the four-star hero of 
the evening, moving the crowd to numerous standing ovations and 
even cheers for his most controversial comments."<p>

<h3>Attention Bill Paxon</h3>

Keynote speaker Susan Molinari isnt married? During Tuesdays 
World News Tonight anchor Peter Jennings posed this question to 
an ABC reporter: "I want to go down to the floor for a moment to 
ask a fairly important question of Michel McQueen. Susan 
Molinari: single, white professional woman is going to be up 
there. You could argue that shes going to look out of place in 
some respects at this convention, couldnt you?" A few minutes 
later Jennings admitted he had `goofed.'<p>

<h3>A Bit of Media Intolerance?</h3>

As three MRC employees were leaving the Horton Grand Hotel in San 
Diego on Tuesday, they were approached by a woman wearing a 
Dateline NBC hat, traveling with three credentialed NBC 
cameramen. She inquired if their `Team Clinton' T-shirts were 
pro-Clinton, to which one MRC employee replied, "No, you have to 
read the whole thing." After she read the `pro-Clinton press 
corps' caption on the shirt featuring a drawing of three TV 
anchors, she quipped, "Oh, theyre anti-media. I guess the term 
`extremist still fits, huh?"<p>

<center><h2>Republicans Called Unconcerned About <a name="rape">Rape</a> Victims:
Another Round of Media Intolerance</h2></center>

Prime time and the evening news shows again emphasized how the 
Republican Party is shutting out pro-choicers and on how women 
are turned off by the party's stands. See page one for a tally on 
the agenda of questions.<p>

Keynoter Susan Molinari got grilled from the left by Tom 
	Brokaw on NBC Nightly News: After asking about how women can 
relate to a platform  that's "pretty rigid in its language on 
abortion," he posed this question: "In the convention hall itself 
tonight, as you try to reach out to American women across all 
spectrums of American life, you have here a delegates [sic] by a 
factor of two to one, white males, many of whom are making more 
than $100,000 a year. Doesnt that make it difficult for a lot of 
American women to identify with...."<p>

Just after rape victim Jan Licence's speech on victims rights 
last night, NBC's Maria Shriver seemed baffled: "But why [speak 
out] at a Republican convention? So many people have said that 
they dont think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is 
supportive of womens issues. Why make this stand here?" Tom 
Brokaw interviewed Licence later and asked: "Do you think -- this 
is a party that is dominated by men and this convention is 
dominated by men as well...Do you think before tonight they 
thought very much about what happens in America with rape?"<p>

ABC's Peter Jennings endorsed the "rights" spin of women who 
oppose the GOP's abortion plank: "Polls commissioned by the 
Republican party show they have lost nearly ten percent of women 
since they have voted the Republican majority into the 104th 
Congress in 1994. The right to abortion has never been an over-
whelming issue for women at election time. But this fight within 
the Republican party has many Republican women questioning how 
far this party is willing to go to limit their rights."<p>

Michel McQueen of ABC found the Democratic quota system to be 
better: "When you go to the Democratic convention in Chicago in 
two weeks youll see that half the delegates on the floor are 
women. And thats a powerful message when half the voters are 
women. But dramatically its also true that women have not 
responded well to a message that at times been considered too 
harsh, too mean."<p>

<i>"Ronald Reagan will still have to learn how 
history will judge his time in office -- the deficits, the  
Iran-Contra affair. But for the members of this party, there is  
no more beloved figure." <p>
-- NBC's Tom Brokaw after Nancy Reagan's  
address which followed a video tribute to former President  
Reagan, August 12 NBC News convention coverage. </i><p>

<CENTER><H3>Networks Obsess Over Abortion</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
Monday's coverage of the Republican convention was a near carbon  
copy of the themes emphasized over the weekend. Viewers of Monday's  
morning shows heard repeated questions about why the Republicans excluded  
pro-choice voices. On the evening shows and in prime time coverage  
they heard references to the GOP's harsh, and extreme platform.  
Several reporters used retired General Colin Powell's speech as a  
foil to contrast his themes against the media-promoted image of the  
1992 convention. 
<P> 
Looking at the bright side of the Jack Kemp pick, on Today 
Monday morning NBC's Tim Russert argued it might prevent the  
GOP from employing a certain strategy: "This may be an enormous  
public service. If Jack Kemp's presence on the Republican ticket  
neutralizes the race issue, if the race card is not played in 1996  
because of Jack Kemp, he will have achieved more than any national  
figure in a long time. In 1988, the Willie Horton ad. Jack Kemp has  
said that was just absurd."

A Scary, Harsh, Extreme and Radical Republican Platform  
Not Even Counting Abortion. 
<P> 
On CBS Lesley Stahl declared without supporting information: "On  
the platform, women find that extreme. It's turning them off." 
Dan Rather asked Jack Kemp if he agreed that the platform is "harsh,  
extreme, even radical."  
<P> 
Exclusion of Pro-Choicers the Number One Concern of Reporters. Today's Katie  
Couric posed seven questions about abortion, even demanding that Dole's  
daughter Robin explain her abortion views. She asked Senator Kay  
Bailey Hutchison: "Do you still believe you can call the Republican  
Party an inclusive party?" See page 3.

<P> 
Conventioneers Battered with Abortion Questions All Day 
<P> 
The networks stayed on message in harping on Republican exclusion  
of pro-abortion podium speakers. Just after noon Pacific time  
CNN's Charles Bierbauer asked Congressman Sam Brownback of  
Kansas: "But haven't some of those who might feel that abortion  
rights defensible, haven't they been excluded?" Candy Crowley  
asked pro-abortion Sen. Arlen Specter: "Do you think there is  
ever going to be room on the Republican ticket for someone like  
you?" 
<P> 
On NBC's Today on Monday, Katie Couric posed at least seven  
abortion questions.  To Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: "You know a  
lot has been made of the Republican Party being a very inclusive  
party, one that can embrace the views of various people. Given  
the way the platform has worked out vis a vis abortion, and the  
fact that some of these Republican governors are not speaking  
because they felt, as if they were being censored. Do you still  
believe you can call the Republican Party an inclusive party?" 
<p> 
During the 1992 convention, Couric only asked Clinton's mother  
Virginia Kelley puff questions: "I also read in the many things  
that have been written about your son and his childhood that he  
used to walk to church alone with a Bible under his arm.' But  
Couric felt compelled yesterday to ask Dole's daughter Robin:  
"You all don't agree on all things political. I know you differ  
with him in terms of his views on abortion. Do you have  
discussions? Do you talk about it, talk it out, exchange views?" 
<P> 
But CNN exemplified an ironic new twist: excluding or downplaying  
conservatives wasn't censorship, but cleverly manipulative stage  
management. Reporter Frank Sesno declared Monday afternoon: "The  
placement of the various speakers at this convention is very  
purposeful and during this session, during this afternoon, some  
of the more hard line conservative speakers, such as Sam  
Brownback, were placed. We're not going to hear that rough edge  
tonight in prime time. Sesno's tone grew sharper: "The keynote  
speech will be delivered by a woman by the name of Susan  
Molinari. She is someone who is here with a very deliberate aim,  
and that is to take a belt sander to some of the sharper edges of  
the Republican Party." 
<P> 
ABC's Peter Jennings told Monday's San Diego Union Tribune:  
"Whenever a political party goes out of its way to restrain,  
isolate, or box in other voices , and both parties do it , then  
you almost invariably attract the attention of journalists." But  
Jennings ignored the Democrats' spiking of Bob Casey in 1992.  
Whether he lives up to his own statements this year will be  
tested in two weeks in Chicago.  

<CENTER><H2><a name="buchanan">Buchanan</a> "Destroyed" Bush </H2></CENTER> 
<P> 
<DD>  
Following Colin Powell's speech, reporters quickly pointed out the difference between this convention and  
the "divisive" Houston convention in 1992.   
<DD>  
Andrea Mitchell declared on MSNBC: "There's a real interesting contrast here because Pat Buchanan set  
the tone for the Houston convention four years ago with the same prime time starring role on the first night  
of the convention and that of course was the speech that many people feel destroyed George Bush's chance  
of winning re-election because it set a very narrow, exclusive and mean-spirited tone and tonight we had  
the contrast of Colin Powell."  
<DD>  
On Monday's Good Morning America, host Charles Gibson couldn't let the issue die: "It is this convention  
that is going to be harmonious. The Republicans are determined that there will be no repeat of Houston  
1992, which many saw as a harsh and divisive convention." While never mentioning that raising taxes  
could have cost Bush the election, ABC's John Cochran opined on World News Tonight: "The one thing  
that Bush did not have to tell Dole is that at all cost Dole should try to prevent a re-run of that bitter  
divisive convention four years ago in Houston, that so badly damaged Bush's chances for re-election. Dole  
knows that only too well."

<P> 
With the GOP showcasing the inoffensive lineup of former  
Presidents Ford and Bush as well as retired General Colin Powell,  
the networks made sure viewers learned that the Republican  
platform still upheld the party's ideological hard line. 
<P> 
NBC's David Bloom announced an amalgam of antis on Monday's  
Nightly News: "But not a word today from Bob Dole about the tough  
anti-immigration, anti-affirmative action, anti-abortion platform  
adopted this afternoon at the convention hall." Later in the  
show, NBC's Lisa Myers ended a story: "One Dole strategist has a  
different standard [of convention success]. He said he'll  
consider this convention a hit if the viewers end the week  
thinking Republicans aren't quite as scary as they thought." 
<P> 
"Even some Republicans describe the current platform as quote,  
harsh, extreme, even radical. Do you see it that way?" Dan Rather  
asked Jack Kemp on Monday's CBS Evening News.  
<P> 
During prime time, CBS reporter Lesley Stahl added: "The whole  
purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program, is to  
diminish the image of this party as extreme because that's what's  
turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the  
convention, the Republican convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was  
yelling, his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin  
Powell, he will appeal to civility. On the platform, women find  
that extreme. It's turning them off." 






<CENTER><H2><a name="gutless">Gutless</a> Moderates?</H2></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
In the August 19 Newsweek, Senior Editor Jonathan Alter gave pro- 
abortion Republicans his recipe for political success. In a piece  
titled "The Passion Gap," he wrote: "Pro-choice Republicans  
insist it's their party, too. But the high-minded moderates are  
too polite to take on the hard-charging right. Until they do, the  
GOP may never truly win over the country." 
<P> 
The crux of Alter's wisdom? Attack your most loyal voting block:  
"This is now the fifth nominating convention in which the GOP has  
applied an anti-abortion litmus test. Ronald Reagan signed an  
abortion-rights law as Governor of California, then changed his  
position in time for his presidential campaigns. George Bush was  
such a supporter of family planning as a congressman that he was  
called 'Rubbers,' but by the 1980s had flip-flopped. Bob Dole is  
pro-life but has gone back and forth so many times on platform  
language and planks that he has raised basic questions about his  
leadership. If he can't stand up to a Phyllis Schlafly, how would  
he handle a Saddam Hussein?" 
<P> 
Alter closed by holding up the Democratic Party, the same party  
that shut Governor Bob Casey out of its  1992 convention for his  
pro-life views, as an example of the big-tent the GOP should  
emulate: "The only real way to change the Republican Party is  
for...a pro-choice candidate to run for President in  
2000....Sometime soon a compelling moderate Republican will take  
a leaf from the successes of centrist Democrats and enter a few  
primaries. Then we'll find out if the Republicans can finally  
pitch that big tent they like to talk about."

<P> 
<P> 
Two reporters cheered Colin Powell's denunciation of corporate  
welfare last night, but they failed to mention which party tried  
to reduce it or how NBC is a recipient. 
On MSNBC, correspondent Andrea Mitchell never reflected on the  
hard choice her own network made when NBC decided to make money  
in prime time by joining up with PBS for convention coverage:  
"One of the things that I thought was interesting about Colin  
Powell's speech is that he did talk about the hard choices and he  
said, 'Listen friends, let me put it to you. We're going to have  
to give up corporate welfare as well and that entitlements are  
the real issue.'" 
<P> 
PBS anchor Charlayne Hunter-Gault said to Gary Bauer after Powell  
left the podium: "You heard the reaction in the room at the  
conclusion of the speech. You also heard Mark [Shields] say that  
when he talked about corporate welfare and welfare for the  
wealthy there was a deafening silence in the room. How do you  
think this crowd is really receiving this message." 
<P> 
The House Republicans tried to eliminate the Commerce Department,  
a fact not raised by either reporter.

Jonathan Alter's Conventional Wisdom Watch in the August 19

deficits, too."

<CENTER><H3>Tax Plan Declared Failed Reaganomics</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
The offering of tax cuts is universally seen as good politics,  
but that doesn't mean reporters won't try to make them unpopular.  
Bob Dole's new tax cut proposal and selection of Jack Kemp as his  
running mate may be making headway in the polls, but journalits  
are trying to put on the brakes. For reporters all tax cuts are  
bad.     
<P> 
Brand new CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart declared  
Monday: "It will be interesting to see if Bob Dole, who'd been  
skeptical of supply-siders like Jack Kemp in the past, can sell  
this to the American people without being perceived as a  
hypocrite." Other reporters assumed that supply-side economics is  
a failed doctrine and that tax cuts will "balloon" the deficit as  
they allegedly did in the Reagan years: 
<P> 
Just before noon Pacific time on Monday, CNN's Bob Franken asked  
George Shultz on the convention floor: "I wanted to talk to you  
about the fact that you worked with Republican Bob Dole on his  
economic plank. Were you pleased that there were tax cuts in  
there, and do you worry about the budget deficit ballooning as a  
result?" 
<P> 
On Inside Washington just before Dole released his plan, Newsweek  
Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas declared: "There are millions  
of quotes from Bob Dole all through the '80s saying, Look, you  
can't just cut taxes and expect the economy to do much better.  
Now he's screeched around, 180 degrees, and he's sounding like a  
pie-in-the-sky, Reaganomics professor. It's, it doesn't suit his  
character and he's giving up some high ground. Now Bill Clinton  
looks like the responsible guy." 
<P> 
Headline in the August 5 USA Today: "Dole's Tax Plan Could  
Backfire, Experts Say: Deficits, interest rates could rise."  
NBC reporter David Bloom quickly declared on the August 5,  
Nightly News: "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did  
worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan."  
Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" minutes later: "They  
say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as they did  
during the Reagan years, debt that would have to be paid off by  
future generations....Most analysts say it's not good economics." 
<P> 
Minutes after Dole's tax cut address that day, U.S. News & World  
Report Senior Writer Susan Dentzer suggested on CNN that the  
people didn't care about fiscal realities: "I think it's going to  
sell very well among those who, for one thing, think that  
government is taxing them too heavily and don't have a  
calculator, don't particularly care about the details of federal  
fiscal policy and don't particularly want to add up the  
dimensions of the problem or stare into the future that we know  
we face." 
<P> 
<P> 
Newsweek reporter Howard Fineman stressed in the August 12 issue  
that Dole "risks his most cherished asset: his credibility...Now  
he's embracing supply-side economics, years after it came (and  
went) in GOP circles. So late in his career , so late in his  
campaign , it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag that  
the annual deficit on his watch , and that he's a champion of  
fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole." 
<P>

Monday's Investor's Business Daily pointed out: "Just turn to  
page 369 of the 'Economic Report of the President'...A table  
shows that receipts from individual income taxes rose to $446  
billion in fiscal '89, President Reagan's last budget, from $286  
billion in fiscal '81, the year Reagan began to slash personal  
rates. That's a 56 percent gain. Annualized, tax receipts grew  
faster than the period's average 4 percent inflation. The problem  
was clearly NOT a fall in revenues. It was the other side of the  
ledger: Spending grew even faster. Look at the 'total outlays''  
column in the same table. Spending rose to $1.143 trillion in '89  
from $678 billion in '81. That's a 69 percent gain. It's no  
surprise that Clinton, a professional politician, would brush  
over such inconvenient facts. Media figures who claim to have no  
hidden agendas, on the other hand, have no excuse."  
<P>
<P> 
<CENTER><H3><a name="inside">On Inside</a> Washington:</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
Evan Thomas, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief: "I think 
this is really disappointing. 
<P> And more advice from the left from Thomas: "Maybe pandering  
works,  
but the polls don't show that. The polls, I think, even Dole's  
own  
polls show that most people reject this tax cut because they  
don't  
believe it. They got conned in the 1980s by Reagan, they got a  
tax cut, 
but they still got a, it didn't do what he predicted it would do 
to the economy. They're in a highly cynical mode, I don't think 
they believe his pandering. In fact, if you ask the question, 'Do 
you approve a tax cut if it would increase the deficit?' only 11 
percent of the country, according to one reputable poll, went 
for it, so I think it's lose-lose." 

<CENTER><H2><a name="millionaire">Millionaire</a> Anchors Tag GOP Delegates As Out of Touch with Middle America</h2></center>
<P> 
<P> 
Early in Monday's PBS/NBC coverage, Tom Brokaw asked: "The big question, of course, what is the  
Republican Party these days?...Well on the floor of this convention hall, they are overwhelmingly white  
and male, male by a factor of about two to one...The largest single income group, more than 38 percent of  
the people here earn more than $100,000 a year." Some additional examples from Monday of how the  
networks created an image for viewers of an out of touch elite gathered in San Diego: 
<P> 
Ed Bradley on the CBS Evening News last night: "For the most part they are white, male, and they are  
older than the average American. They are also more conservative than the average American. They are  
also wealthier , about a third of the delegates earn more than $100,000 a year." 
<P> 
Dan Rather in prime time: "Delegates in this convention have been selected, inspected, detected,  
categorized by the press, the pols, the pros, and the pollsters. We know they're mostly male,  
overwhelmingly white, mostly well to the right politically, and almost one in five of these delegates is a  
millionaire." 
<P> 
CNN's Judy Woodruff to Susan Molinari: "We look at the statistics of how many women delegates. What?  
43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of the delegates are women this year. What sort of signal does that  
send to the country, you think? 
<P> 
Woodruff again last night: "We talked to Jack Kemp a little while ago and asked him about, among other  
things, the fact that not only not just the language in the platform , only three percent of these delegates are  
African American. Only 36 percent of these delegates are women. This is not a convention that is  
necessarily representative even of the broader Republican Party, the people who vote Republican, much  
less the electorate overall." 
<P> 
So, will these reporters apply equal treatment to the unreprersentative Democrats gathering in Chicago in a  
few days?  <p>

Below is the full text of today's four-page Media Reality Check
'96 newsletter on network coverage of the Republican convention.
It's being distributed today in San Diego.

<h3> Quote of the Day:</h3>
"Governor, looking at this platform writing the last week, what
in the world is good in there for a moderate Republican or an
independent voter in this country?" -- CBS correspondent Phil
Jones to Texas Governor George W. Bush, August 11 Face the
Nation.
<p>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<p>
<h3> Front Page story, Monday, August 12, 1996:</h3>
<p>
<h3>Call GOPers Mean, Intolerant & Hard Line
Media's Unwelcome Greeting</h3>
<p>
Republicans and conservatives came under media assault in the
days  and hours before they assembled at the San Diego Convention
Center. The intolerance of conservatives, their hard line stance
on abortion  and mean-spirited nature were the dominant themes of
weekend coverage  on the networks. Though VP nominee Jack Kemp
largely escaped condemnation,  network analysts used praise of
him as an opportunity to impugn conservatives overall.
<p>
<h3>Inside today's edition:</h3>
<p>
Mean-spirited and hateful  Republicans. CBS, CNN and ABC all
refer to "mean-spirited" conservatives. The Wall Street Journal's
Al Hunt tagged the  platform as "mean-spirited." CNN's Bill
Schneider charged that "they're  supposed to be haters" as "most
conservatives these days," such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
"come across as mean." CNN's Judy Woodruff  said that at least
Kemp does not like the idea of "yanking money away  from welfare
mothers with small children." See page 2.
<p>
Intolerant Republicans Bar Wilson from Speaking. On four Sunday
network mornings shows
Republicans were pounded with 22 questions about why pro-choice
Governors Pete  Wilson and Bill Weld were not going to be allowed
to speak. That's  a dramatic contrast to what happened in 1992
when the networks virtually ignored the Democratic Party decision
to bar pro-life Governor Bill Casey from speaking to their
convention. Wilson apeared on ABC, but  the network didn't
interview Casey in 1992. See page 3.
<p>
"Rogue Elephants" Take Over GOP and Spell Sure Defeat. Using
labels to paint delegates as extremists, CBS aired several
stories about the ominous takeover of the Republican Party by, in
Dan Rather's words, "the hard right." CBS reporter Linda Douglass
worried that if Bob Dole appears to be "under the thumb of
religious conservatives" he'll go down to defeat. See page 4.

<h3> Page Two story, Monday, August 12:</h3>
<p>  
<h3>GOP Called "Mean" & Conservatives Dubbed "Haters"
TV Analysts Turn Nasty</h3>
<p>
A  "mean-spirited" and "divisive" convention attended by "haters"
is how some network reporters and analysts, especially CNN s Bill
Schneider, have described the Republican convention and
conservatives over the past few days. Often, the comment came in
backhanded insults in stories praising Jack Kemp s tolerance.
Here, in date order, are some specific examples:
<p>
CBS s Russ Mitchell. On Friday s CBS This Morning, co-host Russ
Mitchell asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour: "Now the 1992
convention was called, even by some Republicans, divisive and
mean-spirited. How will this convention be different?"
<p>
CNN's Bill Schneider. Hours later on Inside Politics Bill
Schneider, CNN s polling analyst, praised Jack Kemp by impugning
conservatives: "He is a rare combination a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They re
supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked a minute ago about the
frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp is buoyant, he s
effusive, he s inclusive of everybody in the country, not just in
the Republican Party. He puts a different face on that ticket."
<p>
ABC s Cokie Roberts. Then on Friday night's World News Tonight
Cokie Roberts also insulted Republicans while calling Kemp a good
choice: "He s very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive,
reaching out to minorities, to women, being for immigration, for
affirmative action. And I think that s very important for this
particular convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen
somewhat dour, and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with
a big smile on his face saying you all come, and I m going to cut
your taxes while I m at it is not a bad thing for the
Republicans."
<p>
CNN s Al Hunt. On the August 10 Capital Gang Saturday night Al
Hunt, Executive Washington Editor of The Wall Street Journal,
disparaged the platform while praising the Kemp pick: "But, you
know, privately the Democrats know that this is an enlightened
choice, whatever Chris Dodd may say publicly. Jack Kemp is gonna
not only excite this convention, but he cuts across regional,
racial and generational lines, across all of America, and I think
that he and his incredibly attractive family are going to add
lustre and intellectual firepower. Now there are some risks. He
has a few flaky views, the gold standard for one, and more
important, Jack Kemp is a can-do optimist who cares about all
people and that s going to put him at odds with a platform that
is protectionist, mean-spirited, anti-immigration, insensitive to
racial minorities."
<p>
CNN s Judy Woodruff: During live coverage Saturday of the VP
announcement in  Russell, Kansas,  Judy Woodruff declared: "On
welfare, up through the last few years, he s advocated more
moderate policies than those that were passed this month by the
Republican-controlled Congress. Jack Kemp does not like the idea
of taking money yanking money way from welfare mothers with small
children."
<p>  
CNNs Schneider. On Saturday s Inside Politics Schneider again
impugned conservatives as he praised Jack Kemp s tolerance: "Kemp
also has a rare combination of qualities. He s a nice
conservative. There haven t been too many of those since Ronald
Reagan. Most conservatives these days come across as mean [video
of Newt Gingrich] or intolerant [video of Pat Buchanan]. Kemp is
tolerant and inclusive. He has an excellent relationship with
minorities. He showed real courage two years ago when he came out
against Proposition 187, the punitive anti-illegal immigration
measure in California. Kemp is not a hater." 
<p>
So most conservatives are? Sounds like a bit of mean-spirited
name calling on behalf of the media.

<h3>Page 3 story, Monday, August 12, 1996</h3>
<p>  
<h3>Networks That Ignored Casey Dive Into GOP Controversy
The Fascinating Wilson Flap</h3>
<p>  
ABC's Cokie Roberts asked Dole adviser Donald Rumsfeld on This
Week with David Brinkley yesterday: "We just heard Jim Wooten
talking about [California Gov.] Pete Wilson not talking at this
convention. Governor Weld is also not talking at this  
convention. Republicans for years have been talking about the
Democrats not allowing [then-Pennsylvania Gov.] Bob Casey to talk
at their last convention. What s different here?" What s
different is that the lack of speaking assignments for Weld and
Wilson are spurring major media interest. 
<p>
Just during the Sunday morning interview shows, the networks
asked 22 questions about exclusion of pro-abortion Republicans.
During the entire Democratic convention week in 1992, Casey s
predicament drew absolutely no mention from Cokie s network, nor
any attention from CBS; NBC aired just one interview with Gov.
Casey, as did CNN, which added four other mentions of the
underplayed controversy  in prime time. Yesterday, 11 questions
about the GOP s  exclusion of moderates were posed on CNN s Late
Edition, compared to five on NBC s Meet the Press, four on ABC s
This Week, and two on CBS's Face the Nation.
<p>
If pro-choice forces cannot prevail, then why even hold a
convention asked one morning show host last week. Today co-host
Matt Lauer asked Gov. Wilson on  August 8: "You said a second ago
that the majority of Republicans across the country are on your
side on this issue, but the majority of people who ll attend this
convention are not. Why then even hold the convention if it
doesn't express or represent the views of the majority of people
in the party?"
<p>

<h3> Page Three, Monday, August 12, 1996</h3>
<p>  
<h3>Sixty TV Stories on the GOP to One for the Democrats
Abortion Plank Imbalance</h3>
<p>  
As the surf arrives on San Diego s beaches, once again the
national media are hanging ten on their favorite convention
story: Republican fratricide over the platform s abortion
plank. Since April 30, when Governors Weld, Wilson, Whitman, and
Pataki declared their intention to challenge the platform s
traditional pro-life plank, the networks have focused like a
laser beam on the story, while ignoring any debate within the
Democratic party:
<p>
>From April 30 to August 9, the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS, and
NBC) have favored the Republican side of the story by 60 to 1.
They  aired 30 full stories on the evening newscasts, to only one
ABC World News Tonight story on the Democratic abortion debate on
June 12. The network morning shows have aired another 30 full
stories or interview segments on the GOP abortion debate, to
nothing on the Democrats. (That doesn t include five anchor
briefs on the evening shows and 34 anchor briefs on the morning
shows.)
<p>
CNN's evening newscast The World Today aired seven full stories
and ten anchor briefs on the GOP pro-life plank, to only one
anchor brief on the Democrats. CNN s Inside Politics was
intensely interested in the story, with 38 full stories or
interview segments on the GOP to two segments on the Democrats.
<p>
Perhaps the dramatic imbalance of stories will change when the
Democrats hold their platform hearings? Wrong. The Democrats
already held their platform hearings (on July 10 and 11, then
concluding on August 5) with absolutely no notice from ABC, CBS,
or NBC. You also couldn't read about them in Time, Newsweek, or
U.S. News & World Report. Even daily newspapers such as the Los
Angeles Times and USA Today, with hundreds of pages of newsprint
to fill every week, spiked the story.
<p>
Judd, June 12: "An ABC News survey shows that a third of
Democrats oppose all or most abortions, but centrists and
liberals have no intention of surrendering any ground." Judd
dismissed the threat of pro-lifers actually leaving the party:
"The issue of abortion has not splintered the Democratic party
because those who couldn t live with the party's position
bolted years ago." She concluded: "So given their reluctance to
publicly fight with the party mainstream, abortion opponents will
probably be seen, but not heard at their party's convention this
summer."

<h3> Page Four, Monday August 12, 1996, page 4</h3>
<p>
<h3>Networks Worry About Ominous Party Takeover by Christians
"Rogue Elephants" No More</h3>
<p>
Colin Powell and Susan Molinari are set to deliver major speeches
to the Republican convention, but network news reporters over the
weekend portrayed the Republican Party as a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Christian Right, painting that as an ominous
development. 
<p>
On Friday, August 9, Dan Rather introduced a CBS Evening News
piece by asserting: "For many self-described Christian
conservatives and other members of what is generally known as the
hard right of the Republican Party, they ve been pretty much
having their way at the San Diego convention, and the Jack Kemp
news late today was one more cause for celebration. But there
could be pitfalls ahead for the party, as we hear now from Linda
Douglass."
<p>
Douglass began: "It already has been a triumphant week for
religious conservatives, led by the Christian Coalition. Then
came word of another victory, the prospect of Jack Kemp as Bob
Dole's running mate." Following a soundbite from Ralph Reed, she
continued: "The Christian Coalition has gotten what it wanted
here, even forcing Dole to back down from his offer of tolerance
to supporters of abortion rights. Religious conservatives say
they now hold the key to a Dole victory in November."
<p>
After a soundbite from the Christian Coalition s Ralph Reed,
Douglass continued: "But veterans of past Republican presidential
campaigns warn Dole runs the risk of appearing to be under the
thumb of religious conservatives. Some analysts believe Gerald
Ford was hurt in 1976 by giving in to a conservative faction.
Doug Bailey, who advised Ford then, said Dole must be careful." 
The same night on PBS s Washington Week in Review host Ken Bode
claimed that "it turns out that this platform committee that met
is a far more conservative group of delegates, than we've
seen even in Republican conventions of the past."
<p>
On Sunday s Face the Nation, CBS correspondent Phil Jones seemed
obsessed with the topic. Jones asked Governor George Bush, "There
are a number of Republicans who are very uncomfortable with what
they feel is the power, the control that the conservative
Religious Right has. Are you concerned about that?" Jones also
accused Pat Robertson of swallowing the Republican Party: "A lot
of moderate Republicans have watched what s going on here in the
last week in the writing of the platform, and they say you
people, you, Pat Robertson and your wing of the Republican party,
Christian conservatives, have taken over."
<p>
"Delegates are pursuing their own agendas and forcing party
leaders, including Dole, to fall into line behind them," warned
Dan Rather on last night s CBS Evening News. Taking a look at the
Texas delegation, reporter John Roberts found that "so far the
rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots: winning the
platform battle over abortion and heavily influencing Bob Dole s
choice for Vice President." 
<p>
Employing some extremist labeling, Roberts said that "hardline
anti-abortionists" tried to keep Texas Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison from becoming a delegate. But in the end, Roberts
assured viewers, the conservatives really won't win: "This
exercise in gaining political influence may turn out to be just
that: an exercise. Bob Dole says he has not yet read the party
platform and even if he does he says he will not feel bound by
it. And it could be a case for the Texas delegation of
winning the battle but losing the war. Their views against
abortion are in contrast with the majority of Americans who
support a woman s right to choose. That could turn out to be a
contentious issue come November."

<h2>***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</center></h2><p>

<center><h3>    One item today: <p></center></h3>
A Media Reality Check '96 fax report released Wednesday 
afternoon. Back on June 22, 1992 CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn 
announced: "Making headlines this morning: Bill Clinton comes up with a 
plan for the economy. Tax the rich, cut the deficit, and help just about 
everyone else." That's not quite how reporters have greeted Bob Dole's tax 
cut plan. In this report we compared and contrasted how media outlets which
have tried to discredit Dole's proposal were the very same outlets which
praised Clinton's economic and health plans.<p>
    The following is the text of the report put together by Tim Graham with 
the assistance of Tim Lamer and the rest of our crew in Alexandria: <p>

<center><h3>The Voodoo Gap: The Media's Partisan Economics</center></h3><p>

<i>SAN DIEGO, CA</i> -- Bob Dole's tax cut proposal was quickly denigrated by 
reporters as the unwelcome return of irresponsible Reaganomics, but the 
outpouring of media skepticism about Dole's tax proposal in no way resembles 
the national media's salesmanlike reaction to Clinton proposals in 1992 and 
1993.<p>

"Raising questions about how Bob Dole's going to cut taxes and balance the 
budget is fair," said MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III. "What's not fair is 
attacking Dole's credibility after you've swallowed Clinton's bizarre fiscal 
estimates whole. After passing on the fantasy of a self-financing Clinton 
health plan and 1,000 descriptions of Medicare `cuts,' the media ought to
think about their own credibility on budget matters before they pretend to be 
nonpartisan skeptics of Dole." Among the outlets with a bad case of partisan 
economics:<p>
 
NBC. Reporter David Bloom quickly declared on the August 5, 1996 Nightly News:  
"Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit and 
many are skeptical of Dole's plan." Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" 
minutes later: "They say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as 
they did during the Reagan years, debt that would have to be paid off by future 
generations....Most analysts say it's not good economics." NBC did not note as 
columnist James Glassman pointed out Tuesday, that according to Clinton's own
Economic Report of the President, tax revenues increased from $601 billion in 
1983 to $991 billion in 1989, but spending rose from $808 billion in 1983 to 
$1.143 trillion in 1989.<p>

Clinton often drew praise. NBC reporter Lisa Myers raved on the February 18, 
1993 Today: "The President deserved great, great credit for having the courage 
to come forward with a plan to deal responsibly with the deficit." NBC's Andrea 
Mitchell worried about his image on the May 2, 1993 Meet the Press: "This is 
the first President in a generation who had the guts to try to do something 
about deficit reduction and take on health care, and somehow he's not selling 
that. He's still being perceived as an old-style Democrat."<p>
 
CBS. Reporter Linda Douglass declared on the July 23, 1996 CBS Evening News: 
"Dole will have to tread carefully as he promotes his tax cut. Each of the 
proposals he's considering would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and 
Dole will have to convince voters that won't drive up the deficit."<p>
 
But on the September 15, 1993 Sunday Morning, Douglass simply passed on 
Clinton's notion of paying for 37 million uninsured Americans' health care -- 
with a cigarette tax: "They have a very elaborate plan to pay for this 
revolution in health care. It doesn't provide for much new in the way of 
taxes, just a sin tax, cigarette tax. They claim the money's going to come 
from savings in spending." The Clinton health proposal was estimated by the 
Congressional Budget Office to cost $784 billion in its first seven years.<p>

U.S. News & World Report. Senior Writer Susan Dentzer was the first to 
condemn Dole's tax cut on CNN just minutes after Dole was finished: "The old 
joke among economists is that an economist who's stuck in a ditch gets out
of it by assuming the existence of a ladder, and there are a fair amount of 
assumptions of existences of ladders in this plan that really, I think, under
intense scrutiny, are not going to bear out." Appearing on Nightline a few 
hours later, she called the Dole plan "a free lunch."<p>
 
Dentzer, on the other hand, applauded Clinton's micromanagement of the 
economy in the March 15, 1993 U.S. News: "Amid a broader economic plan that 
has its share of flaws, Clinton's well-crafted stimulus is a piece worth 
keeping...The sorts of spending the President has picked -- for example on 
education or on long-planned highway projects -- tend to create lots of jobs, 
many which carry high wages and benefits."<p>
 
Newsweek. Reporter Howard Fineman wrote in the latest issue that Dole "risks 
his most cherished asset: his credibility....Now he's embracing supply-side 
economics, years after it came (and went) in GOP circles. So late in his career 
-- so late in the campaign -- it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag 
that the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and that he's a 
champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole."<p>

Fineman had a different idea of who was responsible for the deficit on the 
October 11, 1995 Fox Morning News: "He [Clinton] really doesn't have to put 
numbers on the table. It's the Republicans who have said they're the 
revolutionaries. They're the ones with the responsibility."<p>
 
Time. Washington Bureau Chief Dan Goodgame declared on September 20, 1993: 
"The Clinton plan is surprisingly persuasive in supporting the long-time 
claim of the Clintons and their top health care strategist, Ira Magaziner, 
that [health] reform can be almost entirely from savings, without broad-based 
new taxes and with enough left over to reduce the federal budget deficit." 
But in the January 29, 1996 issue, Goodgame described the 1980s as "when top
tax rates were slashed and the deficit soared, but that's the reason supply-
siders are often described as optimists." <p>

<h2> ***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</h2></center><p>
 <center><h3>One item today:</h3></center><p>
    A Republican Party platform subcommittee passed a plank stating:
"We also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes 
differing views. We view this diversity of views as a source of strength."<p>
    Nonetheless, the very networks which barely touched in 1992 the refusal
of the Democratic Party to allow Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey to make a 
pro-life speech at their convention, pounced on the GOP Tuesday night for 
intolerance.<p>
    --  Here's how Peter Jennings opened the August 6 World News Tonight: 
"Good evening. We begin tonight with what you could certainly call zero 
tolerance. As much as Bob Dole would like to have the nation focus on his
very sweeping tax cutting proposals of yesterday, the men and woman who
will join him at his party's political convention in a few days are once 
again involved in a power struggle about abortion. Today by the time Mr. 
Dole spoke by satellite to his party's delegates, who were already gathered
in San Diego, all notions of tolerance on the subject of abortion had 
disappeared from the party's platform."<p>

    -- On the NBC Nightly News reporter Gwen Ifill's piece ended by showing 
Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld saying in a soundbite: "I don't want to 
drum the pro-lifers out of the party. I just want there to be room for me 
and them within the same description of the party."<p>
    Ifill then concluded: "But there's not enough room for the words abortion 
and tolerance to co-exist in this party's platform. Dole is gambling that 
voters care more about the economy and taxes than they do abortion. But he 
has undercut moderate Republicans at a time when he needs every vote he can 
get. Gwen Ifill, NBC News, San Diego."<p>

     It just shows that it pays to suppress any dissent. When you allow debate
and what reporters consider the wrong side wins they call you intolerant. <p>

<h3>Brokaw Attacks Clinton from Left</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 16, 1996
<p>
One item today: Tom Brokaw challenges President Clinton from
the left in the premiere of "Internight," the 8pm ET interviewshow on the new MSNBC cable network.
<p>
Here are two questions posed by Brokaw in his live July 15 interview:
<p>
    > Brokaw: "Let's talk for a moment about welfare. The
Republicans have a bill that they think you will sign, on the
Hill. It eliminates the federal guarantee of cash assistance for
poor children in this country, a guarantee that we've had in
place since the early 1930s. Are you prepared to have that
happen?"
<p>
    Clinton: "Depends on what else is in the bill."
<p>
    Brokaw: "But you can foresee the possibility that we'll take
away the ultimate safety net of no federal cash assistance to
very poor children?"
<p>
And a couple of segments later:
<p>
    Brokaw: "Mr. President, before we get back to the internet
questions, I wanted to follow up just for a moment on welfare if
I can. If in fact you sign the Republican bill that's likely to
come down from the Hill, all the projections show that that will
push, at least short term, more than a million youngsters in this
country below the poverty line. That's a high risk for youngsters
in this country who are already in peril."
<p>
Another network, another pile of bias to document. -- Brent

<h3>Chancellor Reality Check</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 14, 1996
<p>
One item in this MRC Alert: 
<p>
> John Chancellor is being praised for his fairness, but a reviewof his commentaries show he used his position to promote liberalideas and attack conservatives.
<p>
As you may know, NBC News veteran John Chancellor passed away
at age 68 on Friday evening. From 1970 to 1982 he anchored the
NBC Nightly News, then provided commentary through 1993. During
the Johnson Administration he presided over the Voice of America.
His passing has generated a series of tributes to his
fairness and impartiality from his media colleagues. On the July
13 NBC Nightly News, for instance, anchor Brian Williams
observed: "He was a role model for all who care about truth,
justice and fairness. John Chancellor died last night of cancer,
two days short of his 69th birthday. He helped define what TV
news should be."
<p>
Let's take a look at the views expressed in some of his
Nightly News commentaries in the late 1980s and early 1990s:
<p>
    -- April 17, 1990: "The overall tax burden for Americans,
federal, state, and local, is actually quite low....The fact is
Americans could pay more taxes and the country wouldn't go down
the tube. Taxpayers don't believe this because they are being
conned by the politicians...The truth is that the United States
needs higher taxes and can afford them. Some political leaders
are now starting to say that, but until more say it, the country
will remain in trouble."
<p>
    -- August 21, 1991, on the Soviet Union: "It's short of soap,
so there are lice in hospitals. It's short of pantyhose, so
women's legs go bare. It's short snowsuits, so babies stay home
in winter....The problem isn't communism; nobody even talked
about communism this week. The problem is shortages." 
<p>
    -- March 12, 1992: "Greenpeace, the public interest
organization, believes that the Iraqi death toll, civilian and
military, before and after the war, may be as high as 198,000.
Allied military dead are counted in the low hundreds. The
disparity is huge and somewhat embarrassing. And that's
commentary for this evening, Tom." 
<p>
    -- Election night, 1992, looking back at the Republican
convention: "I think that the convention -- and certainly all the
polling data indicates this -- offended a lot of women, offended a lot of people in the country who thought it was too religious
and too hard-edged." 
<p>
    -- February 16, 1993: "There is no mystery in how [the
deficit] can be brought down...the U.S. simply has to choose from
a menu of unpalatable options that include deeper cuts in defense
spending, tougher controls on medical services, higher taxes on
federal pensions, and a broad-based tax on energy or consumption,
preferably both. We know how to do this. Impose measures already
commonplace in other industrialized countries. The weapons are
there. It's the will to use them that's the problem."
<p>
    -- April 30, 1992, after the Los Angeles riots: "It's not a
big surprise that the jury in suburban Simi Valley sided with the
white policemen. Just as it's no surprise that the blacks in
downtown Los Angeles rioted and people died....Politicians have
fanned these flames with code words about `welfare queens,'
`equal opportunity,' and `quotas.' Language designed to turn
whites against blacks. With two-party politics that favored the
rich and hurt everyone else."
<p>
    -- November 20, 1990: "Some say Ronald Reagan won the Cold
War by spending so much on defense that the Kremlin went bankrupt
trying to keep up. That won't wash. During Reagan's presidency
the United States itself became a bankrupt country."
<p>
    -- November 7, 1990: "The fact is that most government
spending cannot be cut. The way out of the mess is for the
government to raise some money through taxes and at last that's
being done. And there's encouraging news in the returns from
yesterday's elections. Six states from Massachusetts to
California rejected measures designed to limit taxation. Can it
be that the great tax revolt of the 1980s is coming to an end? If
true, maybe the country can get on with the business of balancing
its books in a sensible and logical way." 
<p>
    -- June 20, 1989: "Thousands may have been gunned down in
Beijing, but what about the millions of American kids whose lives
are being ruined by an enormous failure of the country's
educational system...We can and we should agonize about the dead
students in Beijing, but we've got a much bigger problem here at
home."
<p>
    -- Finally, here's the July 1990 MediaWatch newsbite on
Chancellor's 1990 book. He's no fan of Ronald Reagan:
<p>
Once anchor of NBC Nightly News, John Chancellor now offers his
opinions thrice weekly. His commentaries have recently been
distilled into a book on what's wrong with America, Peril and
Promise.
<p>
So what's wrong? The deficit, which he attributed to a Reagan
recipe of "big tax cuts, big increases in defense spending, and a
hair curling recession." Pardoned from blame: congressional mismanagement. And though federal revenues went up swiftly in the
'80s, Chancellor remembered only that "cuts in taxes and domestic
spending resulted in the first redistribution of income in favor
of the affluent since the 1920s and a reduction of the federal
government's obligation to the poor." Another Reagan error was
the Grenada liberation which Chancellor called "a sham triumph,"
a "tragicomedy," which "might not have been necessary."
<p>
Chancellor harped on America's faults for 130 pages, but
dedicated fewer than 40 pages to suggesting solutions. He called
his remedies to America's woes neither conservative nor liberal,
yet higher taxes remained the pillar of his plan. Another major
objective: mobilization of a national corps of volunteers because
"The poor and disadvantaged need help, especially after the
cutbacks in social services during the Reagan years."
<p>
I'll be sending another e-mail late tonight with some more
recent bias from Sam Donaldson and coverage of Dole and the
NAACP. -- Brent Baker

<h3>More Hate Radio; Dole Fuels "Racial Divides"</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 12, 1996 
<p>
Four items today:
<ul>
<li>A Time magazine reporter attributes the First Lady's problems
not to any wrongdoing but to the fact that "Mrs. Clinton has
changed the role of First Lady."
<li>Eleanor Clift charges that the evil "right-wing mafia" are
fueling "hate radio."
<li>Newsweek's Joe Klein finds a bright spot in the public's lack
of concern over controversies dogging the Clintons: It may lead
to the end of such distracting scandal-mongering. 
<li>NBC portrays Bob Dole's lack of appearance at the NAACP
convention as "an insult to African-American voters" which "may
reinforce...racial divides along party lines."
<p>
> 1) This quote was picked up by MRC analyst Gene Eliasen fromthe June 28 Washington Week in Review. Time magazine Washingtonreporter Michael Duffy thinks the First Lady is surrounded bycontroversy because she's doing so much more: "I also think thatMrs. Clinton has changed the role of First Lady so much, youknow, by getting so involved and so active and paid such a highprice for it."
<p>
> 2) Appearing on CNN's Larry King Live on Monday July 1,
Eleanor Clift offered this explanation as to who is to blame for 
the Gary Aldrich book: "One thing we haven't really mentioned is
the people who are surrounding Mr. Aldrich and in fact they are
members of what I would call the right-wing mafia. I mean they
were there for Paula Jones and they are fueling a lot of what we
hear on hate radio." MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens found thatquote.
<p>
> 3) MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught this conclusion to
Newsweek Senior Editor Joe Klein's July 8 piece on filegate: "But
if Clinton does survive this pounding, it may mean the revulsion
against the `-gate' phenomenon -- 20 years of ever-diminishing
scandals -- is now more intense than the disgust caused by any
individual charge. If so, it would be the President's most
memorable public service." 
<p>
    Funny how he didn't feel that way until the scandals hit a
Democratic President.
<p>
    > 4) After summarizing Bill Clinton's attack on Dole over the
assault weapons ban, on the July 10 NBC Nightly News reporter Jim
Miklaszewski proceeded to review the controversy over Bob Dole
not addressing the NAACP convention. Here's the last two-thirds
of his Wednesday night story as transcribed by MRC intern Jessica Anderson:
<p>
Miklaszewski: "No doubt this was a Clinton crowd. That comes as
no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to speak to the
convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he was already
committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball game. To those
at this convention that was quite a stretch and an insult to
African-American voters."
<p>
[Woman at NAACP convention: "When you want to be President of the
United States of America, you cannot afford to write any American
off."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "Back in Washington, Dole's Democratic critics had
a field day."
<p>
[Rep. John Conyers, Jr., (D) Michigan: "He's saying, 'I don't
care about the black vote in November,' and I think that the
black vote in November will not care about him."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "That already appears to be the case. The latest
NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton has a lock on the
African-American vote; only five percent would vote for Bob Dole.
[On-screen visual shows Clinton with 87 percent and Dole with
five percent, plus or minus seven percentage points.] But even
Colin Powell believes that Dole should have made an appearance."
<p>
[Gen. Colin Powell (Ret.): "I wish he didn't have a scheduling
conflict. I think it would have been useful for him to present
his views to the NAACP."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "It would have been a tough crowd."
<p>
[Anonymous man: "I think he made the right move he didn't come
because perhaps he might get booed."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "Nevertheless, by not showing up here, Bob Dole may
reinforce those racial divides along party lines and fuel the
anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential campaign
Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC
News, Charlotte."
<p>
So, when Bill Clinton fails to address a Christian Coalition
convention that's an insult to all Christians? -- Brent Baker

<h3>Taxes vs. Cuts; Carlson Hypocrisy; NBC's Victims</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 11, 1996
<p>
<b>Four items today:</b>
<ul>
<li>Some real bias in Katie Couric's interview with Bob Dole that
got lost in the publicity over smoking. She sees tax cuts and
budget balancing as contradictory.
<li>Time magazine's Margaret Carlson blasts her industry for
publicizing the Gary Aldrich book, but a bit of hypocrisy comes
through when you look at an article she wrote in 1985.
<li>NBC Nightly News discovers and cries over a new class of
"victims" -- those who don't get paid for overtime.
<li>Asked to rate the media's bias from right to left on a scale
of 0 to ten, Eleanor Clift puts the media right in the middle.
</ul>
> 1) The now famous Today exchange about smoking took place
in part two of a three part interview. On the first day, July 1,
Katie Couric displayed the conventional media wisdom about tax
cuts and balancing the budget: you can have one but not the
other. Here are her challenges to Bob Dole as he tries to explain
how he'll achieve both:<br>
    -- "So you don't support across the board tax cuts?"<br>
    -- "What's more important to you, tax cuts or balancing the
budget, if you had to choose?"<br>
    -- "If you had to pick one?"
<p>
     > 2) Margaret Carlson opened her July 15 Time column on
attention to the Gary Aldrich book by charging that "the press
has caught Mad Lie disease, marked by a loss of appetite for the
truth and projectile regurgitation of anything fed to it." In her
last paragraph, she wrote: "There was a time when by common
agreement a book like Aldrich's would die for lack of oxygen. Now
the mainstream media strive to get every sensational rumor 'in
play.'"
<p>    
Well, as MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham reminded me,
let's flip through Carlson's clip book. The July 1989 MediaWatch
quoted this paragraph from Carlson's November 1985 article in
Esquire magazine previewing the 1988 Republican contenders:
<p>
"What one does in Washington behind closed doors generally
stays out of the paper. But the persistent rumor that one of the
potential 1988 presidential candidates has a homosexual past is
testing the unacknowledged code of silence among reporters."
<p>
   > 3) On Tuesday night (July 9), the day the Senate passed a
minimum wage increase bill, Tom Brokaw announced that "the Labor
Department has discovered that millions of American workers are
being shortchanged on another front: overtime. They're working it, but they're not getting the dividend." As transcribed by MRC
intern Jessica Anderson, here are some excerpts from the story
that should have generated little sympathy from those with
salaried jobs.
<p>   
Reporter Mike Jensen began by talking with Becky Perkins who
"raises two children and works long hours as a parole officer in
Texas." She explained: "There's no way you can leave at 5:00. I
mean, you're staying there 'til six, seven, eight, doing just
paperwork alone, not to mention going out into the field to make
home visits."
<p>   
But, Jensen reported, "In spite of the long hours, the state
refused to pay Becky overtime, but the U.S. Labor Department
investigated. It said money was owed, that Becky had been
shortchanged....Workers like Becky are gypped out of an estimated
$20 billion a year in unpaid overtime. The worst offenders?
Construction companies, garment factories, toy makers, auto
repair shops, and food stores. Hundreds of thousands of victims
and very few complaints, says attorney Joan Keyok" [spelling
approximated].
<p>    
Following a soundbite from her, Jensen returned to the
"victim" theme: "Many of the victims are minimum wage workers
afraid of being fired, or immigrants who don't know their rights,
or older workers concerned about downsizing. They never see the
time and a half pay that's legally theirs."
<p>
    > 4) On a 0-10 scale of media bias from right wing to left
wing bias where does Eleanor Clift place the media? Here's her
answer from McLaughlin Group last weekend: "The press is right in
the middle. It's a five. The bias is for bad news."
<p>
    Another sign of progress: Not even a committed liberal like
Clift dares to say anymore that the media are biased to the
right. -- Brent Baker

    Greppi reported: "Rather said that for 'men of a certain age'a common topic is prostate cancer. 'I grant you, this may not
have been a proper question,' Rather told reporters.
Nevertheless, the newsman asked the dictator, whose 37 years in
power ranks second only to Jordan's King Hussein: 'Prostate OK?'
<p>
    'OK,' replied Castro, who turns 70 in August."

<center><h2>Kudos: Sesno Challenges Rivlin, Daschle</h2>
</center>
<p>
Many in the media have accepted, and passed on as fact, the Democrats' party line that Republicans were out to cut and even destroy Medicare. CNN's Frank Sesno, on the December 17 Late Edition, set the record straight.
<p>
He first interviewed President Clinton's budget director, Alice Rivlin. Sesno confronted Rivlin with the facts: "Take Medicare, for example. You said, the President, rather, yesterday said, `They would let Medicare wither on the vine into a second class citizen.' Now, you don't really believe that the Republicans are going to let Medicare wither on the vine? They're not talking about that. And as you well know, and as they say as many times as they are able, even with their cuts in the rate of growth of the program, it still grows into an ever larger piece of the pie."
<p>
When Rivlin balked at such an analysis, Sesno remained adamant. "In the interest of truth in advertising here, do you really believe that the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate want to destroy Medicare?" he asked. "Isn't this part of the Mediscare debate that your critics accuse you of engaging in?"
<p>
After Rivlin, Sesno interviewed Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (along with GOP Senator Trent Lott). He pointed out to Daschle that "in the health care reform debate, of not very long ago, of which you were a part, there was a great deal of talk that expenses had to be controlled. You had something called global budgeting. I mean you were going to hold everybody down. So why is it unfair to do that in the case of Medicare?"
<p>
Later, when Senator Daschle called the Republican plan to slow Medicare's growth "the biggest cuts in the history of Medicare. Biggest by far. Three times more than has ever been proposed." Sesno corrected him: "Biggest cuts in the rate of growth of Medicare, not absolute cuts."
<p>
Kudos to Sesno for giving Democratic rhetoric the same scrutiny reporters usually reserve for Republicans.

<Title>Issue Review: Federal Funding of Public Broadcasting</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Issue Review: Federal Funding of Public Broadcasting</h2>
<p>
<h3>Donations Rise as Funding Threatened</h3>
</center>
<p>
At this time last year, leaders of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), Public Television (PTV), and National Public Radio (NPR) were calling their viewers and listeners stingy. Not in so many words, of course, but that was in effect their argument when they warned that they would not be able to make up any cut in or elimination of public broadcasting's federal subsidy.
Conservatives, looking at history, argued that when taxes were cut (as Republicans planned), people gave more to organizations they support, including public broadcasting, and that if people truly liked public broadcasting, they would not let it die.
<p>
<b>Who was right?</b><br>
Looking at the results of last year's public broadcasting pledge drives, as reported in the Public Broadcasting Report, it looks like conservatives were correct. Even without a tax cut, merely the threat of cutting public broadcasting's subsidy spurred massive increases in private donations early in the year. Later, when it was clear that the federal subsidy would be kept, donations began to level off.
<p>
Conservatives, in making their arguments, were standing on strong historical ground. During the 1980s, when tax rates were cut, individual donations to public television, for example, increased every year. In fiscal year 1980 there were 2.6 million members of PTV who gave an average contribution of $29.96 for a total of almost $78 million. By fiscal year 1989 the number of members had doubled (to 5.2 million) and the average contribution had increased steadily (to $50.38), giving public television a total of $262 million from individual members. In fiscal year 1991, after the Bush tax increase, the number of individual public television members dropped to 5.07 million.
<p>
Last year, when Republicans in Congress threatened to eliminate or substantially cut public broadcasting's federal subsidy, donations skyrocketed. The first bit of good news came in February. KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, California announced that it had set a record for on-air fundraising by a public radio station in its February 6-14 winter subscription drive. According to the Public Broadcasting Report (PBR), the station "raised $1.09 million from 14,314 new and renewing subscribers," a 26 percent increase over the previous year. General manager Ruth Seymour told PBR that the debate over federal funding spurred the massive increase: "I think our audience understands that we are committed to the effort to keep public radio noncommercial."
<p>
Then public television stations began to note a striking increase in donations. PBR told its readers on March 24 that "PTV stations across the country reported very successful spring pledge drives." The Arkansas Educational Television Network, for example surpassed its $350,000 goal despite reducing the time spent in pledge breaks by ten percent. KRMA-TV in Denver and WETA-TV in Washington, D.C. had record-breaking drives, with KRMA reporting a 13 percent increase over 1994 totals and WETA garnering almost $1 million from 12,600 pledges, 62 percent of which were from new members. KCET in Los Angeles finished its spring pledge drive with $1.68 million, exceeding its March, 1994 drive, which lasted three days longer, by $205,127.
<p>
Nationwide, PBR reported, the number of pledges for March were "12.9 percent above March 1994 returns" and the total dollars pledged were up 15.3 percent. Public radio had similar success. According to PBR, "on average, stations did 15-40 percent better during this drive than they did during last year's campaign." The public radio stations that did "only" 15-20 percent better than the previous year were "those who stopped once they reached their goals."
<p>
The momentum was sustained through the summer. PBR reported on August 25 that "indications are that the August PTV pledge drive will be another hit in a year of overwhelmingly successful campaigns that many have attributed to publicity involving projected federal budget cuts." The number of pledges had increased a dramatic 18 percent over the previous August and pledge dollars were up 16 percent.
<p>
By December, though, when it had become clear that Republicans were not going to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting, or even cut it substantially, pledge growth slowed. The December pledge drive, according to PBR, collected seven percent more than the December 1994 pledge drive, a healthy increase, but not at the level of the astronomical increases of March and August.
<p>
The moral of the story: Viewers value public broadcasting enough to increase their donations when federal funding is threatened. But when it's clear the government will pay for it, they don't feel the need to pay as much.
<p>
This should reassure public broadcasting executives. During last year's debate, they didn't express much confidence in their supporters. CPB Chairman Henry Cauthen predicted that if federal funding were foregone, 87 public television stations would have to be closed down. (He didn't point out, of course that this would still give PBS more television stations than ABC, CBS, or NBC.)
Public Broadcasting Service president Ervin S. Duggan told TV Guide: "I don't think public TV could survive and maintain its mandate without federal funding. Survival would come at a cost of becoming commercial. We'd be driven by ratings, not quality."
<p>
As the debate continued Duggan became so convinced that individuals wouldn't ante up support for a privatized PBS that he began to speak in harsh tones about the future of the network, comparing privatized television to prostitution. He worried that "commercialized public television is likely to resemble, for all the world, Thomas Hardy's ruined maid: `no longer pure and simple, brazenly working the streets in her new commercial finery, doing whatever necessary to survive.'"
<p>
The evidence suggests Cauthen and Duggan were wrong. When federal funding decreases, private funding increases. If members of Congress really want to strengthen public broadcasting, then they should wean it from the federal government and cut taxes.

<h3>Lamenting Layoffs, Ignoring Job Rise</h3>
</center>
<p>
The current wave of layoffs at several large companies seems to confirm in many reporters' minds their view of how the business world works: Corporate America racks up record profits for wealthy shareholders while laying off millions of workers.
<p>
That's how the networks have reported the layoffs. But with a little digging these reporters could have found that corporate profits are not unusually high, that shareholders are not just rich people, and that more jobs are being created than destroyed.
<p>
Anchor John Roberts set the tone of the layoff coverage on the December 26 CBS Evening News: "The market has been hitting one record high after another. But as Economics Correspondent Ray Brady reports, many workers have paid a heavy price." Brady then interviewed "ex-Wall Streeter" Michael Thomas, who told viewers what he seemed to think was shocking: "Executives are running companies exclusively for their stockholders."
<p>
This focus on the interests of stockholders, Brady explained, has meant layoffs at such established companies as 3M and AT&T, which caused their stock prices to jump. "Who pays the price for this stock market prosperity?" Brady asked. "Come to any job center, where laid off middle managers scramble desperately for work. Corporate America announced more than 41,000 layoffs last month alone, up 45 percent over the same month a year ago."
<p>
Martha Teichner, Brady's colleague at CBS, joined the chorus on the January 7 Sunday Morning. "For all of 1995, the figure was nearly 450,000, but, hey, that's the good news. In 1993 it was 615,000," Teichner reported. "Here's a statistic for our leaner and meaner times. Since 1980, Fortune 500 companies, America's biggest and most profitable corporations, announced layoffs of more than eight million people. That's like laying off the entire population of New York City."
<p>
Over at NBC, on the January 4 Nightly News, Mike Jensen agreed. After saying that some companies had to downsize in order to survive, he said, "Some companies simply decided to make more money by firing people. Corporate profits totalled about $400 billion last year, up 25 percent. What all those companies did was obliterate one of the keystones of the American Dream, the security of a job for life. They created anxiety for everyone, even those who didn't get fired."
<p>
But just how high are corporate profits? According to the January 4 Investor's Business Daily, which quoted a study by the Employment Policy Foundation, corporate "profits have dropped from an average of 12 percent of national output in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s to about 9 percent currently -- a decline of about 25 percent in profits' share of total output."
<p>
About those supposedly greedy stockholders, the newspaper pointed out that they may not be who viewers were led to believe they were: "With more than half of all Americans now owning stocks through retirement, mutual, and individual shareholder accounts, it is the average American who benefits most from corporate profits -- not some fat cat on Wall Street."
<p>
And here's a statistic for Teichner: "Little noticed among the repeated headlines of Fortune 500 firms cutting jobs are the literally thousands of small and medium-sized firms that are adding new workers at a frenetic pace. Since the start of 1994, more than five million new jobs have been created in the U.S. economy -- more than enough to sop up all the new entrants in the work force."
<p>
Reporters seem to think the entire business world begins and ends with the Fortune 500. Until they start looking at the entire economy, they won't be able to tell the entire story.

<P>
<CENTER><H3>A Flat Tax Fact Sheet</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Virtually every Republican presidential candidate has endorsed some version of 
the flat tax, as has the Kemp Tax Reform Commission. This support is mirrored 
by public opinion, with polls showing anywhere between one-half and two-thirds 
of taxpayers prefer the flat tax over the current system. Needless to say, with 
all this attention, it comes as no surprise that many in the media have begun 
writing about and describing this revolutionary proposal. Unfortunately, this 
new-found publicity has been accompanied by frequent errors. In order to 
maintain accuracy, reporters should avoid these two most common mistakes:
<P>
Mistake #1: Many reporters write that the flat tax contains a huge loophole for 
the rich because they have trouble understanding how income is taxed under a 
flat tax. This error shows up in several ways. Some report that dividend and 
interest income is tax free. Others write that only labor income is taxed.
<P>
Reality: The source of these common mistakes is that the most well-known 
versions of the flat tax collect taxes on capital income at the source. Under 
the Armey- Shelby flat tax, for instance, a corporation must pay tax on behalf 
of shareholders before the income is distributed in the form of dividends. This 
approach, which reduces administrative costs and ensures greater compliance, 
makes a dividend check similar to a worker's paycheck in that both are 
after-tax payments. The same is true for interest income. Under the flat tax, 
businesses and financial institutions pay tax on interest payments they make, 
so there is no need to collect the tax a second time at the individual level. 
Once again, the motive for taking this approach is simplicity and compliance.
<P>
Message: Reporters can argue that the tax should be collected at the individual 
level. They can even argue that the income should be subjected to two or more 
layers of tax. Honesty demands, however, that they acknowledge that all income 
is taxed with a flat tax, but only taxed once, and that tax is collected in the 
least costly fashion possible.
<P>
Mistake #2: The flat tax will increase the deficit and/or boost taxes on the 
middle class. Many news reports assume that a flat tax will require a tax rate 
of 21 percent or more to offset reductions in excessive tax rates on the rich. 
Even with the generous personal allowance, this tax rate would adversely affect 
the middle class. Failure to levy a rate that high, on the other hand, would 
cause larger deficits.
<P>
Reality: With a 17 percent rate, the Armey-Shelby flat tax explicitly is 
designed to reduce the amount of money the government collects. As a result, 
even without making any assumptions about faster economic growth expanding the 
tax base (the supply-side effect), it is possible for all income classes to 
enjoy a lower tax burden. With regards to the deficit, the plan imposes strict 
new limits on government spending. Enforced by automatic spending control 
mechanisms, this ensures that the deficit will not climb. The key principle is 
that the flat tax is accompanied by spending savings to keep the overall 
package deficit-neutral.
<P>
Message: Conclusions that the middle class is harmed are based on analysis of a 
revenue-neutral tax proposal which does not exist. Reporters can condemn the 
proposal for reducing the amount of money the government collects, and they can 
write that the growth of government would have to be significantly slowed to 
keep the plan deficit neutral as sponsors propose, but it is inaccurate to 
assert that the middle class will pay more or that the deficit will increase.
<P>
With help from biased sources such as the Clinton Treasury Department and the 
union-funded Citizens for Tax Justice, many reporters have unwittingly (we 
hope) made one of these mistakes. Some, like Al Hunt of  The Wall Street 
Journal and Ann Reilly Dowd of Money, have made both mistakes in the same 
article. Fair and accurate reporting depends on the public receiving 
information in a straight- forward fashion. Avoiding these two mistakes will 
help ensure the upcoming tax debate is marked by legitimate policy issues 
rather than distorted media messages.

<h3>Reporters Crash, Viewers Burned</h3>
</center>
<p>
Just when you think reporters couldn't get any more hostile to industry, they do. Consider two mid-January television reports on ABC's Good Morning America and NBC Nightly News. Both stories contain mistakes which often plague reports about automobile safety, and both ignored the trade-offs safety regulations inevitably require. 
<p>
At issue were federal standards for rear guards on tractor trailers. These "U"-shaped metal rods are specifically intended to keep cars that hit the rear of a truck from riding under it. The regulatory standard for the guards has been set at 30 inches from the ground for the past fifty years, although the voluntary industry standard has been 22 inches for several years. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) merely codified this standard with the cooperation of the trucking industry.
<p>
That's the news part. But reporters portrayed this issue as a grand conflict, with industry as a hostile force and supposedly-impartial "consumer advocates" as society's protectors. The question for reporters was how to criticize industry without panning the government in a situation where both agreed. Here's how they answered it:
<p>
Neither report mentioned that industry was already producing 22-inch guards. ABC's Lisa Stark, on the January 19 Good Morning America, reported that "under the new standard, rear guards...must be lowered to 22 inches above the ground. They're now at 30 inches." Tom Brokaw stated in his introduction to the January 17 NBC Nightly News segment, "The government is about to take an action that should save lives." Robert Hager was more explicit in the NBC segment, saying that the government will require new tractor trailers "to be made with big rods on the back, bigger than any currently in use."
Neither report pointed out that most tractor trailers already have the 22-inch guards -- voluntarily.
<p>
Hager employed questionable data. "Nearly 700 [people] a year die in [ride-under] accidents," he declared. But both NHTSA and the trucking industry put the number of deaths at 60 each year. (ABC's Lisa Stark used the NHTSA figure.)
<p>
Both reports projected skepticism of the new standard -- but not of the government -- as insufficiently stringent without offering evidence. In Stark's report, Gerald Donaldson of Citizens for Reliable & Safe Highways (CRASH) stated that the new rule "was not selected on the basis of what would really be a big contribution to improving public safety... [but] on the basis of what the trucking industry would buy into."
<p>
The ubiquitous Joan Claybrook, representing CRASH in Hager's report, said, "We don't think this rule makes significant enough changes....Very few people are going to be protected under this standard." Hager didn't ask Claybrook why, if she was so concerned, she never acted on the rear guard issue when she was head of NHTSA from 1977-1981.
<p>
Neither report was skeptical of these supposedly objective "consumer advocates." The media look at funding only when it comes to industry associations or conservative advocates. That's why we hear about "tobacco-funded groups," but not "trial-lawyer-funded groups." The fact that a group is funded by parties who have a stake in certain outcomes does not necessarily mean that what they say is incorrect. Still, it would have been interesting if the reporters had asked who funds CRASH; they would have discovered that CRASH is substantially funded by the railroad industry.
<p>
Regulations intended to increase safety by decreasing one risk often backfire by creating new risks. For example, the risk of keeping the rear guard at 22 inches means that some small cars could still slip under the truck. But making the rear guard lower means that trucks could get caught on railroad grade crossings or have difficulty maneuvering around rail yards and ports, causing different kinds of accidents. ABC touched on this issue dismissively; NBC only mentioned the dollar cost of the changes.
<p>
When it comes to government regulation of safety, even the most skeptical reporters become true believers. Too eager to criticize industry, and too receptive to "consumer groups" which invariably advocate more government regulation, reporters often believe that we can have more safety at no cost. But overlooking the trade-offs involved in government regulation does not help anyone, and could, in fact, be deadly. Who pays this price? The very people reporters are trying to inform: consumers.

<p>
<h3>A Bumpy Road for the Flat Tax</h3>
</center>
<p>
The newest rage on the political scene is the flat tax. It has propelled the presidential candidacy of Republican Steve Forbes, causing most of the other GOP candidates to formulate a version of their own. The flat tax is a simple tax system with complex arguments both for it and against it. Covering such an issue is, therefore, a difficult task. To be fair and balanced, reporters at the very least must present the best arguments for it and against it. But so far, the best arguments for the flat tax have rarely made the news.
<p>
Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the flat-tax stories on network evening news shows (ABC World News Tonight, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening News) and in national news magazines (Newsweek, Time, U.S. News & World Report) during the month of January. There were 16 stories which presented arguments for or against the flat tax. (There were more about the Forbes campaign generally.) In those 16 stories, arguments against the flat tax were presented 51 times, while arguments in favor of the flat tax were presented only 24 times.
<p>
Double Taxation. The argument against the flat tax most often presented -- 24 times in the 16 stories -- was that it would not tax interest income or investment income, and thus overly benefit the wealthy. For example, ABC's Dean Reynolds, on the January 29 World News Tonight, said the Forbes flat tax would mean "no taxes on inherited wealth or stock portfolios." Newsweek's Marc Levinson and Rich Thomas contended that "investment income would be tax-free." According to Peter Jennings, on the January 15 World News Tonight, "There would be no capital gains tax, no tax on interest earned at the bank, or for money you've made through investments. A millionaire living solely on dividends or inherited money wouldn't have to pay any tax."
<p>
Only twice did a reporter point out that such a millionaire, under a flat tax, would in fact be taxed. Flat-tax proponents argue that investment income would indeed be taxed, but only at the corporate or bank level. As the Heritage Foundation's Dan Mitchell wrote in the January MediaNomics, under the flat tax "a corporation must pay tax on behalf of shareholders before the income is distributed in the form of dividends." Flat-tax proponents argue that, as in the case of withholding, savers and investors currently get less money because it has already been taxed, but still must pay an additional income tax on the money. Only Newsweek's Allan Sloan, in an anti-flat tax article, pointed out that currently "some [income], like corporate dividends, is in effect taxed twice."
<p>
Mortgage Interest. The next most common argument against the flat tax was that the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction would hurt the middle class. Reporters cited such arguments 13 times in the 16 stories. According to the January 15 U.S. News & World Report, "Homeowners could see home values drop if mortgage interest payments and property taxes were no longer deductible." On the January 15 World News Tonight, Peter Jennings weighed in on the issue by only mentioning one side: "President Clinton believes that middle class homeowners will see the value of their homes go down if there is no mortgage deduction."
<p>
Reporters mentioned counterarguments to such claims only three times. For instance, Bob Schieffer, on the January 20 CBS Evening News, said, "Forbes counters those arguments by saying the deduction won't be needed because homeowners will pay less in taxes, which will cause the economy to grow, which will cause interest rates overall to go down." No reporter mentioned that the deduction is actually regressive. John Berthoud of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution pointed out in the January 31 Investor's Business Daily that "80 percent of the break's tax benefits go to those with incomes over $50,000."
<p>
Federal Deficit. Twelve times reporters cited the claim of flat-tax opponents that the flat tax would greatly increase the federal deficit. NBC's Mike Jensen, on the January 17 Nightly News, claimed that "the biggest loser would be the government. With a 17-percent flat tax, critics say the budget deficit could double." According to Jensen: "For poor and middle class families, critics say the 17 percent flat tax is a cruel hoax, that to avoid big deficits, it would have to be much higher than 17 percent."
<p>
Echoing Jensen, ABC's John Cochran, on the January 19 World News Tonight, said that "Forbes' opponents still say his version of the flat tax won't work, that it would increase the budget deficit at a time when Republicans are trying to eliminate it." U.S. News & World Report agreed: "The Treasury Department estimates that a flat-tax rate would need to be set at 21 percent -- not 17 percent -- to raise the same level of revenues as the current income-tax system does. Without raising this rate, the federal government would see its budget deficit rise, and this would add to Washington's fiscal woes."
<p>
Only half as many times -- six -- did reporters give the counterargument that the flat tax would not increase the federal deficit. Time's Dan Goodgame, for example, wrote that Forbes "assumes that tax cuts, even when financed by federal borrowing, will generate so much economic growth that they will quickly wipe out the deficit." Goodgame, though, dismissed such a belief as a "quasi-theology."
<p>
Noting that Forbes' 17 percent rate might be a revenue-loser for the government, some reporters wondered how Forbes would make up the shortfall. Newsweek's Allen Sloan asked: "How will he fill the gap? With economic growth and spending cuts. Details? Forbes isn't saying." Time's Goodgame criticized Forbes because he "declines to specify spending he would cut." It's true that Forbes has not been specific about spending cuts. But then reporters rarely give such reprimands to politicians who oppose slowing entitlement growth, but decline to specify how much taxes will then have to increase. Why the double standard for Forbes?
<p>
Charitable Contributions. Twice reporters mentioned the argument that a flat tax would hurt charities by removing the deduction for charitable contributions. According to ABC's Peter Jennings, on the January 15 World News Tonight, "Charities worry about how generous folks will be if their contribution is no longer deductible." The January 15 U.S. News & World Report similarly warned that "charities could lose donations if contributions were no longer deductible."
<p>
No reporter mentioned the counterargument that charities would not be hurt by a flat tax. John Berthoud's Investor's Business Daily article points out that "of $117 billion donated [to charities] in 1991, $56 billion came from non-itemizers. Of the $61 billion that was deducted, 54 percent came from Americans in low-to-moderate tax brackets. Thus, three of four dollars given to charity don't lead to a substantial tax benefit." Berthoud further noted that "top marginal tax rates dropped from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988, thus robbing the deduction of more than half its value. And the deduction for non-itemizers was eliminated in 1986. Yet charitable contributions rose" at a record pace.
<p>
Flat Tax Favorables. Only two arguments in favor of the flat tax -- its simplicity and its closing of loopholes -- were reported thoroughly. Seven times reporters made the case that the flat tax would make the tax code simpler. CBS's Bob Schieffer, on the January 20 CBS Evening News, pointed out "the simplicity of the plan. No accountants needed to tell you what you owe. No long forms to fill out." Six times reporters pointed out that the flat tax would close loopholes for special interests. Joe Klein, for instance, on the January 21 CBS Evening News, said: "[Forbes'] is a anti-Washington campaign, and that's how he sells the flat tax. He says, `I'll eliminate a whole lobbying industry, the industry that gets tax loopholes for special interests.' And that's the advantage of the flat tax."
<p>
But those were the exceptions. Most of the time arguments against the flat tax were presented without arguments in its favor meriting a mention. At times reporters, such as Newsweek's Allan Sloan, didn't try to hide their fondness for the politics of envy: "Taxing investment income at both the corporate and personal levels, as it's taxed now, may not be sound economics. But it's reasonably sound social policy, considering that most investment income flows to upper-income people." Sloan didn't mention that many investments, such as those in pension funds and mutual funds, are made by the middle class. 
<p>
At other times the opposition to the flat tax became absurd. NBC's Mike Jensen managed to find a middle class couple who claimed that the $3,146 tax cut they would get under the Forbes plan "is really not going to change our lives."
For such a simple policy, the arguments over the flat tax are quite complicated. Still, reporters should not bring up the arguments of flat-tax opponents unless they're willing to give flat-tax supporters a chance to respond.

<Title>Network Assumes Private Money Is Corrupt, Ignores Conservative Argument</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Network Assumes Private Money Is Corrupt, Ignores Conservative Argument</h2>
<p>
<h3>ABC's Missing Campaign Reform Idea</h3>
</center>
<p>
Is there too much money in politics? That question is a rhetorical one for much of the media. They simply assume that there is. So far this campaign season, network newscasts have reported numerous times about the costs of running a presidential campaign and the alleged problems this raises for candidates. Because reporters assume private money hurts politics, they report on every reform option except the one conservatives champion -- raising (or eliminating) the limits on individual donations to candidates.
<p>
Case in point: ABC News. On January 17 and 18 ABC's World News Tonight devoted a total of five stories to the role of money in the presidential campaign, under the title "The Greenback Primary." These stories followed a January 15 Nightline broadcast about campaign-finance reform. The assumption in all of these stories was that money has -- as Peter Jennings put it -- a "corrosive effect" on the political process.
<p>
Various correspondents contributed to the World News Tonight series. Jim Wooten pointed out that front-loaded primaries meant candidates have to raise a lot of money early. "None of the Republicans except Senator Dole has actually reached his fundraising goal," Wooten reported. "He's ahead. There could be a connection." John Donvan illustrated the elaborate means candidates must employ to raise enough money to compete. Bill Blakemore noted the rise of "soft money," such as contributions to political parties and independ-ent expenditures. According to Blakemore: "It's how corporations and unions can snub the law that forbids them to give to presidential campaigns."
<p>
While many of these stories were informative, none questioned the common wisdom that too much money is the problem with the current campaign finance system. None cited the mainstream conservative argument, made by law professor Bradley Smith in a Cato Institute study, that more money would improve politics. Smith wrote: "Considering the importance of elections to any democratic society, it is hard to believe that the expenditure of less than $10 per voter for all local, state, and national campaigns constitutes a crisis requiring government regulation and limitations on spending."
<p>
Ignoring this argument led to biased coverage of possible reforms. On the January 15 Nightline, Jeff Greenfield reported, "We'll be hearing a torrent of words about campaign-finance reform this year, but every proposal for change raises some big questions. Complete public financing? Well, skeptical voters might see that as just another taxpayer rip-off. Force television stations to provide free air time? Who would qualify and who wouldn't? Say to multi-millionaires they can't spend as much as they want on their own campaigns? No, the Supreme Court says that would be unconstitutional."
<p>
While Greenfield skillfully raised objections to all the reform ideas he cited, he didn't mention "every proposal for change." David Frum, in the January 15 Weekly Standard, suggested one proposal conservatives have long advocated -- "a sharp increase in the maximum permissible personal donation." Frum argued that "if [candidates] could raise their money in bigger chunks, they could spend much less time at the task" and that "once large donations could be made directly to the candidate -- which every candidate prefers -- the evil of unaccountable and undisclosed soft money would tend to wither away."
<p>
Reporters are correct to sense that something is wrong with the campaign-finance system. And the liberal view that private money always corrupts political campaigns should be reported fairly. But journalists shouldn't assume liberals are right and report liberal reform plans as if they were the only ones being proposed.

<title>Reporters Don't Challenge Politicians on Anti-Green Subsidies</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Easy on Government Pollution</h2>
</center>
<p>
When the media report on the environment, which will no doubt be a big issue in the upcoming presidential campaign, they almost always employ the same formula. Private industry is portrayed as the cause of all environmental problems; government is portrayed as the protector of the public. This formula ignores one big cause of environ- mental problems -- federal agriculture subsidies, which not only hurt taxpayers and consumers, but also finance environmental destruction.
<p>
Example: recent coverage of the Clinton Administration's proposal to try to restore parts of the Florida Everglades. Most reporters accepted at face value the Clinton plan, which would increase the tax on sugar by a penny per pound to pay for a $1.5 billion program that includes the federal government buying and restoring land in the Everglades.
<p>
According to CBS This Morning's Jane Robelot, on February 20, "The Clinton Administration has announced ambitious plans to save the Everglades from further ecological destruction by raising the tax on sugar." Correspondent Art Rascon continued: "It's the largest infusion of federal dollars ever proposed for the Everglades, making it one of the biggest ecological restoration projects ever."
<p>
Newsweek's Miami correspondent Peter Katel, in the March 4 issue, added that "Clinton's plan is the high-water mark of reform. Senator Majority Leader Bob Dole and Florida's two senators have a more modest plan to spend $200 million of taxpayer funds -- not sugar  money -- to buy some of the sugarcane land for water-restoration projects." Mike Clary of the Los Angeles Times wrote on February 20 that "the administration's seven-year plan to save one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States is as ambitious and comprehensive as any environmental project of recent years, environmentalists say."
<p>
And according to ABC's Barry Serafin, on the February 19 World News Tonight, "Administration officials say the [sugar] industry, which enjoys generous price supports must pay its fair share, a view shared by many in South Florida, who are determined to bring back the state's fabled river of grass."
<p>
Although none of these reporters were wrong, and a few even pointed out the huge federal subsidy sugar gets from high tariffs, none asked why the government shouldn't simply stop subsidizing sugar. The Competitive Enterprise Institute's Jonathan Tolman told MediaNomics that if the government simply "brought down the tariff wall on sugar, it would discourage overfarming of sugar near the Everglades and make land there less expensive, which would make Gore's program to buy the land less expensive." In addition, no reporter brought up another point Tolman makes: "The Clinton tax increase on sugar will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices."
<p>
Only Eric Schmitt of the New York Times, in a February 29 article about price supports, made the connection between the government subsidies and environmental damage. Schmitt pointed out that "under the sugar program...the government sets price supports that maintain domestic sugar prices at twice those on the world market and, according to the General Accounting Office, cost consumers $1.4 billion a year. Strict quotas on cheaper foreign sugar maintain the support price levels, which critics say benefit a small number of wealthy plantation owners and encourage overproduction in environmentally sensitive areas like the Florida Everglades."
<p>
But Schmitt was the exception among national reporters. Most reporters chose to challenge neither Clinton nor Republicans on why they maintain a subsidy that hurts consumers, taxpayers, and the environment.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Report Only One Side of Employment Picture</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Media Lay Off New Jobs Story</h2>
</center>
<p>
Most economists argue that layoffs and a certain amount of job insecurity are part of a healthy, competitive economy. Joseph Schumpeter labeled the process of new technologies replacing workers and new companies displacing established companies "creative destruction." While such a competitive economy isn't always pleasant for those who are temporarily out of work, most economists say it undeniably creates a more prosperous economy for all.
<p>
But most economists are never interviewed by network news reporters. The result is that, for the most part, viewers are told only about the destructiveness of a competitive economy and not job creation. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story about employment on network evening news shows (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's World News, and NBC Nightly News) during January and February. Of the 21 stories, 19 focused on corporate layoffs and downsizing. Only two highlighted parts of the economy where jobs are plentiful. And while there were eleven soundbites from politicians, there was only one soundbite from an economist.
<p>
Tom Brokaw, on the January 29 Nightly News, expressed the typical tone. Introducing a story about "today's frightening job market," he said, "Job security is a thing of the past now and the way of the future is downsizing and layoffs, even for America's biggest companies. It's making for serious anxiety. A recent poll in New York state shows a third of the workers fearful they or someone in their household will lose their job, and soon. And with good reason. Last year there were more than 400,000 announced layoffs across the country, bringing the three-year total to 1.5 million."
<p>
Dan Rather, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, gave a similar diagnosis: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages." According to Rather, "Republican Pat Buchanan has hit a nerve with his rhetoric about this. He is connecting with real anger and fear in the workplace."
<p>
CBS's Wyatt Andrews, on that same broadcast, described "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." NBC's Mike Jensen, on the January 4 Nightly News, declared that "as for the future, American companies are locked on a new course. Layoffs and firings are no longer something they do only in a recession. Instead, they're business as usual."
<p>
AT&T's announcement that it would lay off 40,000 workers prompted many of the gloomy jobs stories. According to CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, on the January 3 World News, "The latest rounds of corporate cutbacks have left many people fearing that they may be the next to be fired. AT&T announced that it was cutting 40,000 jobs." On January 2 Brokaw announced that "if what happened today to 40,000 workers at AT&T is any kind of barometer of what's ahead, it will be another long, anxious year for the American middle class."
<p>
But neither followed up on the AT&T workers. Like almost all of the other reports about the country's job picture, they ignored the parts of the economy which are generating jobs. T.J. Rogers of Cypress Semiconductor, in the March 12 Wall Street Journal, argued that "for the past decade or more, jobs have been migrating to smaller, more nimble, entrepreneurial companies from the Fortune 500 as those companies streamline and lose employment. This trend strengthens our economy, but it has created a short-term fear for their jobs among Americans."
<p>
According to Rogers: "What is not publicized is that my company has already hired some of those [laid-off] AT&T people. And our rival, Cirrus Logic, beat us to the punch in starting up a design center in South Carolina to take advantage of hiring those ex-AT&T engineers. The bad news from big companies gets front-page coverage, but the near-immediate absorption of their skilled workers is rarely discussed."
<p>
Similarly, economics columnist Robert Samuelson noted in the March 13 Washington Post that most laid-off workers find valuable employment elsewhere. "Among rehired workers," Samuelson wrote, "the Labor Department reports as follows: 27 percent got wages at least 20 percent higher than at their previous jobs; 26 percent got wages up to 20 percent higher; 16 percent suffered a pay loss no greater than 20 percent; and 31 percent suffered pay losses of more than 20 percent.
<p>
And American Enterprise Institute economist Herbert Stein pointed out in the March 14 Wall Street Journal that "in 1995, on average, 5.6 percent of the civilian labor force was unemployed. In the previous 20 years the rate had been lower than that in only three years." According to Stein, "The highly publicized layoffs by large corporations were a tiny fraction of the labor force and a small fraction of the number of people who enter or leave employment each year."
<p>
Stein also wrote that "concern with insecurity ought to be evident in real behavior." He noted that people didn't change their smoking or drinking behavior until they became seriously concerned with health or their social behavior until they became seriously concerned about crime. "If people were seriously concerned about their economic condition one might expect them to save more, but they don't." He noted that people are not retiring later, a trend that would be expected if workers felt financially insecure.
<p>
But good business news is rarely news. Only two network news reports focused on the country's enormous job growth. One was by Wyatt Andrews for the February 6 CBS Evening News. Andrews reported that some companies which laid off workers over the past few years have started rehiring. "The era of layoffs in America is not over," Andrews told viewers, "but there is a countertrend going on. In the latest polls, most American managers now admit they fired too many people...and that growth, including the hiring of new workers, is the only way to survive."
<p>
The other was by NBC's Linda Vester on the January 26 Nightly News. "From small machine shops to giant auto plants," Vester reported, "the manufacturing industry is in dire need of the best and the brightest." She said that many manufacturers cannot find enough skilled workers and are even employing headhunters to recruit them. Vester told viewers that "according to one study more than half of America's manufacturers say they're having trouble finding qualified people." She pointed out that people seeking to meet the demand are enrolling at vocational schools. Vester was the only reporter to interview an economist about the country's job picture.
<p>
But Vester was an exception. For most of her colleagues, two things still stand in the way of presenting their viewers with an accurate picture of the economy: The overwhelming preference they have for interviewing politicians instead of economists and their obsession with bad -- and only bad -- business news.

<center><h2>Kudos: Tim Russert</h2>
</center>
<p>
It's not very often that a network journalist talks about the positive effects of business competition and stock market growth for workers and for Main Street America. Usually, only the victims of business competition are presented to viewers and those who gain from the stock market are portrayed as greedy. The unorthodox presidential candidacy of  Republican Pat Buchanan has caused some reporters to challenge such conventional wisdom.
<p>
Case-in-point: NBC's Tim Russert on the March 3 Meet the Press. Russert challenged Buchanan's protectionist trade views by asking the candidate: "Hasn't the [foreign] competition, in fact been good for GM and Ford? Taurus is now the number one car. American cars are better because the American people opted to buy Japanese cars because the quality was better and forced American automobile manufacturers to make their cars better."
<p>
Then Russert pointed out how important the stock market is to workers. "I've talked to a lot of people in large corporations and on Wall Street over the last week," he said, "and they tell me that if your trade policies were put in place and your economic program was put in place, it would be a shock to the stock market, that the market would collapse perhaps as much as 20 percent. And they reminded me of something I'm not even sure you're aware of. Do you know what percent of the stock market is pension money? It's a third. Fifty four million people have fully-funded pensions in this country... And Mr. Buchanan, if that market was rattled by your economic policies, pensioners could lose a half billion dollars and their security is threatened."
<p>
When most reporters challenge candidates' economic policies, they do so from the left. Kudos to Russert for challenging Buchanan from the right.

<title>Guest Editorial, by Bruce Bartlett</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Flat-Tax Flip-Floppers</h2>
</center>
<p>
One of the most remarkable things about the recent rise in popularity of the flat tax is the way leading newspapers and magazines that previously supported the idea have suddenly turned against it. In particular, the New York Times and Washington Post had previously editorialized in favor of the flat tax, but now both oppose the idea.
<p>
For example, in an April 15, 1982 editorial, the Post said, "The ideal income tax would be a flat percentage of all income above an arbitrary threshold of, say, $10,000 per year." It concluded that the flat tax "is the obvious remedy" to the problems of the tax system.
<p>
On June 3, 1982 the Post reiterated its support. "Replacing the [tax] system with a low-rate tax on income -- with few, if any, exclusions allowed -- is an idea that, by promising efficiency, equity and simplicity, appeals to all parts of the political spectrum," it said.
<p>
Fourteen years later, however, the Post is now opposed to what it had earlier supported. On January 19, the Post called the flat tax "a flawed idea, less a serious tax proposal than a slogan in the name of which the advocates claim to be able to accomplish several things at once." It concluded that the flat tax "wouldn't be an improvement." 
<p>
Back in 1982 the New York Times supported the flat tax. In a June 6, 1982 editorial, the Times favored "a flat-rate tax levied on a greatly broadened income base." It even praised Senator Jesse Helms's proposed 12 percent flat-rate tax.
<p>
As recently as 1992 the Times reiterated its support for the flat tax. In a March 27, 1992 editorial the Times explicitly endorsed the Hall-Rabushka plan upon which the Armey and Forbes plans are based. It called the flat tax "a superb idea."
<p>
But like the Post, the Times now opposes a flat tax. In a January 18, 1996 editorial the Times found "a glaring fault" in the flat tax. Like Claude Rains in Casablanca, the Times is now shocked, shocked to discover that the flat tax will benefit the wealthy! It concluded by denouncing the Forbes plan.
<p>
<%-2>Individual reporters have also flip-flopped on the flat tax. For example, <BI>Business Week<D>'s <B>Chris Farrell<D> thought the flat tax was great in a January 9, 1995 column. "If Washington legislators truly want to make a difference, they should...embrace a flat tax," he wrote. The Armey plan "makes sense  -- far more than any other reform being considered. Limiting exemptions and deductions would lower the tax rate by broadening the tax base. And the change would encourage a more efficient allocation of resources."<BI%0>
<p>
But like the Post and the Times, Farrell has suddenly decided that the flat tax is too risky. In a February 19, 1996 column, Farrell said flat-tax advocates are wrong. "Their florid rhetoric vastly overstates the economic gains and deeply understates the risks," he wrote. "The gains could be easily dwarfed by wrenching business and household upheavals as America shifts to a new tax code. Indeed, the transition to a flat tax is fraught with danger -- so much so that the long- term payoff may never come." According to Farrell, the stock market, home prices, and consumer spending all would collapse under a flat tax.
<p>
Such predictions can only be described as total nonsense. As Professor Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University points out, the magnitude of tax changes under a flat tax would be no greater than what we experienced in 1981 and 1986. And the impact on financial markets would be no greater than those experienced many times in the postwar era, when interest rates either rose or fell sharply. Moreover, there is no question that a flat tax will cause the stock market to rise, not fall.
<p>
Unfortunately, the ranks of those who have switched gears on the flat tax include conservatives. As a columnist, Pat Buchanan strongly supported Armey's flat-tax proposal. However, as a presidential candidate, Buchanan opposes it. In a January 27, 1996 article in the New York Times, Buchanan called the flat tax "simplistic" and attacked it for cutting the taxes of the rich. No wonder the Times published it.
<p>
<%-2>Of course, everyone has the right -- indeed, the obligation -- to reconsider their positions when con- fronted with new information. But when major newspapers and prominent writers switch their positions 180 degrees on a major issue, especially within a short period of time, readers are entitled to an explanation. Otherwise, they can only assume that prevailing fashion dictates editorial views, rather than facts and analysis, and that such views aren't worthy of serious consideration.<%0>

<h2><center>New Show Continues Prime Time Tradition of Business Bashing</h2>
<p>
<h3>Fox's Profit Motive</h3></center>
<p>
Profit, a new prime time show on Fox, starts from a unique premise. Far from being the sympathetic hero, Jim Profit, the main character whose voice narrates the show, is a villain. Viewers naturally root against, rather than for, the show's namesake. This is new, different, and daring, and it makes for entertaining television. But in another way, Profit is anything but new. As is so often the case on TV, the villain is a corporate executive. 
Jim Profit, in fact, is a supervillain gone berserk. In the show's premiere  episode, which aired April 8, Profit is shown to be a relentless climber at Gracen & Gracen (G&G), the company where he is a vice president. He uses confidential information to blackmail a decent secretary into sabotaging her equally decent boss, whose job Profit covets. When the secretary later comes to work for Profit, he says: "It's good to see Gail understands the basic nature of business. We adapt or pay the price."
<p>
He uses other ruthless means to weed out those in his way. He frames a female vice president for the blackmail of the secretary, getting her fired. He seduces the wife of another vice president, and then masterminds a plan to make it look like she's sleeping with G&G's CEO. When her husband beats up the CEO (who, by the way, does pick a new mistress every year), he gets fired. And viewers find out that Profit became a vice president in the first place by inducing a heart attack in the vice president above him.
How did profit become so evil? Late in the premiere, viewers learn that as a child Profit was forced by his father to live in a cardboard box and spent all his time watching television through a hole cut out of the box. Profit tracks down his father, kills him, and threatens to frame his stepmother if she turns him in or tries to thwart his business plans.
<p>
The appearance of the show has rekindled a long-running debate about Hollywood's portrayal of business. The experts' conventional wisdom: the greedy scoundrels are getting what they deserve. Graef Crystal, a psychologist and compensation expert, told USA Today that employees "can't take out [their] rage on the CEO -- that person is too powerful. You probably can't even talk to the press for fear of losing your job. But a show that makes you say 'yes, that's exactly what it's like' will hold your attention." 
<p>
Alan Merten, dean of Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, also pinned the blame on the business world. He told USA Today that corporate executives "should look at this trend and realize that whatever their financial motives, their actions aren't playing well in Peoria. The timing of some large layoffs and big [executive] bonus packages has been terrible."
<p>
Perhaps. But Hollywood's business bashing isn't, as Merten suggests, a new trend; it's an institution. The show Dallas was popular long before the current wave of layoffs and in a 1992 Media Research Center study of entertainment programming, businessmen were 43 percent of the criminals, far more than lawyers, politicians, or any other profession. Even, in the past, when there have been positive business characters, such as the business owners on Designing Women, they haven't been positive because of their business. By contrast, there were evil lawyers on L.A. Law, but also lawyers who benefited society because of the work they did.
<p>
A more likely explanation for Hollywood's continued business bashing is that entertainment television writers still hold to an ideology which cannot conceive of business as an honorable calling that serves society by producing goods, services, wealth, and jobs. Profit, to them, seems to be a four-letter word.

<center><h2>Kudos: Time's Branegan and CBS's Brady</h2></center>
<p>
With job insecurity garnering headlines in the U.S. and many demanding that the government "do something" about it, few reporters have looked overseas to see what happens when governments try. Time's Jay Branegan did. According to Branegan, in the April 15 issue, "The rich benefits that have made Europe a sweet place to work have clogged its economic arteries. Call it Eurosclerosis -- the combination of a staggering tax burden and a blanket of regulations that smother new businesses and entrepreneurship."
<p>
Branegan's evidence: "Europe's unemployment rate of 11 percent is twice as high as the U.S.'s, and its job creation chart is a flat line. Over the past three years, the U.S. has created 8.4 million new jobs, Europe none. Significantly, many of those new American jobs pay higher than average wages, and as many as 60 percent are managerial or professional." Branegan also pointed out that high minimum-wage laws in such countries as France mean "many [Frenchmen] aren't working at all. Joblessness among young people, hit hardest by minimum-wage laws, is roughly twice France's overall unemployment rate of nearly 12 percent." Something for reporters to keep in mind as American politicians debate raising the U.S. minimum wage.
<p>
On the March 26 CBS Evening News, correspondent Ray Brady reported on one form of government spending that has largely escaped the budget ax -- corporate welfare. Specifically, Brady looked at federal subsidies for ethanol. According to Brady, "Critics, even those within the U.S. government, say the virtues of ethanol are way overstated. At a time when the government is cutting on social programs, they question why it's still handing out subsidies to the ethanol industry, subsidies that amount to nearly $800 million a year."
<p>
Brady recounted how "ethanol was born of desperation during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, when gasoline prices soared and lines pressed for miles. But now gasoline is plentiful, much cheaper to produce than ethanol. And today, ethanol accounts for just over one percent of all U.S. energy consumption." And while "ethanol does reduce some pollutants, the Congressional Budget Office says it contributes to others, such as ozone pollution."
<p>
Why, then, does the subsidy continue? "Many point to the lobbying of corn growers and generous political donations to both parties by Archer Daniels Midland, the world's largest producer of ethanol, and a major beneficiary of the government's subsidies." According to Brady, the ethanol industry has "racked up $6 billion in subsidies, courtesy of the American taxpayer."
<p>
Kudos to Branegan and Brady for practicing journalism at its best, with Branegan looking at the results of programs politicians are proposing and with Brady questioning programs neither political party wants questioned.

<p>
<h3>Privatized Paupers? No</h3>
</center>
<p>
On March 11 and 12, the CBS Evening News broadcast a two-part "Eye on America" segment by Ray Brady focusing on Social Security privatization. What started out as a compelling case for reform of the soon-to-be bankrupt pension program ended up as a broadside attack against the most promising reform -- privatization.
<p>
First, the background. Social Security now has an unfunded long-term liability of more than $5 trillion -- which exceeds the entire national debt. In 35 years, the system will be financially insolvent. Kaput. As CBS rightly pointed out, in 1950 there were 17 workers for every retired person. Today there are three; by 2030 there will be just two. To keep the system solvent at current benefit levels would require the tax rate to rise from 15 percent to as much as 30 percent. If there were ever a program that needed major reform, it is this one.
<p>
CBS discussed one potential way out of the box: to privatize the system and allow individual workers to place their payroll tax dollars into a personalized account, like an expanded IRA. Under rules established by the government, workers could invest this money in mutual funds and other investments. Brady interviewed Jose Pinera, the former economic minister of Chile, where privatization was adopted some 15 years ago. The results there have been remarkably successful. Chilean workers are now receiving a 13 percent annual rate of return on their Social Security investments.
<p>
Brady then cited a Cato Institute study documenting that in the United States, if a low-income worker were permitted to place his payroll taxes into an IRA, and that worker earned just the average rate of return on stocks and bonds since 1946, that worker would receive a benefit of $1,650 more per month from the IRA than under Social Security. As one of the editors of that study, I can attest that the results were reviewed by well-respected actuaries who found no fault with the methodology.
<p>
Brady, however, launched an attack against privatization by arguing that the Cato study made "dangerously optimistic assumptions." The "dangerously optimistic assumption" was that over the next 50 years investors will yield roughly the same average real rate of return in stocks and bonds as was recorded by financial markets over the past 50 years. No one knows for sure whether the markets will perform better or worse. Still, it is worth noting that over the past several years the stock market has substantially outperformed the average rate of return since 1945.
<p>
Then CBS rolled out objections to the plan, such as claims that the plan only works if "workers work their whole lifetime in a boom stock market." This is patently false. If we had a boom market for the next 50 years, and we privatized Social Security, most American workers would be millionaire pensioners when they retired. But even if workers placed all of their payroll tax into low-risk, low-return bonds, privatization is still a very good deal for workers of all incomes, vis-a-vis a non-privatized system.
<p>
The CBS report saved its heavy artillery for last. Brady said that instead of "making educated guesses about the future, like the proponents of privatization, we took a look at how a Social Security stock plan would have performed using real data from the past." (Note the false inference here, that the Cato Institute study did not "use real data from the past.") "Using an independent firm," CBS reported that a wealthy worker would get $30,000 more under privatization, but a low-income worker would get $13,000 less. Conclusion: privatization is unfair.
<p>
Just how were those numbers derived? Alas, we will never know. After repeated requests for the methodology, CBS has refused to reveal what firm produced them, what actuarial assumptions were used, and any other information about the results. While CBS was quick to attack privatization advocates for using "dangerous assumptions," that charge can't be made against CBS; the company won't tell us what their assumptions were. For all we know, the numbers were simply made up out of thin air.
<p>
Finally, CBS concluded that most Americans oppose Social Security privatization. How should the system be fixed, then? "Cut benefits and raise Social Security taxes." Two problems here. First, virtually every poll over the past ten years shows that raising the payroll tax is by far the least popular "fix" to the Social Security system. Second, raising the tax level and reducing the promised benefit make Social Security an even worse deal than it already is for young workers. Now they would have to pay more in for a lower benefit. What a deal! If we "reformed" Social Security in the way CBS suggests, privatization would be manifoldly more attractive to workers. Was this taken into account when CBS said low-income workers would be worse off under privatization?
<p>
Social Security reform is perhaps the single most important issue to young workers in America. What is needed is a careful, balanced, and reasoned presentation of the options. Too bad Ray Brady and CBS failed to provide it.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</h2>
<p>
<h3>Network Reporting a Slave to Wages</h3>
</center>
<p>
Last month, MediaNomics reported that there were 19 stories about layoffs during the first two months of 1996, but only two stories about job growth. We noted how such a focus on the negative offered a distorted picture of the true nature of a competitive economy, which does destroy some jobs, but always creates more jobs.
<p>
The sister issue to job creation is living standards. A competitive economy would be of little benefit to workers if it caused their standard of living to decrease. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story that focused on wages and incomes on network morning and evening shows during the first three months of 1996. Ten of the 11 stories stressed the alleged wage stagnation of average workers over the last few decades. Only one story pointed out that opportunities have been increasing. No story pointed out that when benefits and payroll taxes are included, workers' total compensation has been steadily increasing.
<p>
A lack of diversity in guest selection kept the morning shows from giving viewers a balanced story. For instance, on the March 12 Today, Bryant Gumbel interviewed only Jared Bernstein of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Introducing the segment, Gumbel pointed out that the U.S. economy has created eight million new jobs over the last three years, adding that "the quantity of jobs is not being questioned, but the quality is."
<p>
Bernstein then said that "wages and compensation have been falling in our labor market since 1979 for most workers. yet in the current economy, profit rates, or corporate profits, are at a 30-year high." Bernstein also claimed that "this is a long-term trend and workers are experiencing falling wages and compensation and even increased turnover. That is, we have less stable employment and the typical American family is really running faster just to stay in place."
<p>
Gumbel's reaction: "OK, so let us accept all of that as fact. Could it be otherwise?" Since Gumbel didn't provide an alternative opinion, viewers had no choice but to accept Bernstein's assertions as fact.
<p>
Other reporters also seemed to assume that accounts of workers' falling wages was a fact. On the February 26 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather concluded that "the fear and anger of some American workers over layoffs and barely rising wages have emerged as a campaign issue." Earlier, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, Rather said: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages."
<p>
On that same broadcast, correspondent Wyatt Andrews portrayed "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." According to NBC's Mike Jensen, on the March 4 Nightly News, "William Young of California is typical -- 50, a victim of downsizing, laid off by Northrup after 29 years in the aerospace industry."
<p>
On the February 25 World News Sunday, ABC's Jeff Greenfield, normally one of the most balanced reporters at the networks, also bought the party line. He reported "something very disturbing behind the record Wall Street numbers and corporate profits." He interviewed a Wall Street economist who said, "This surge in financial markets was really based on an untenable situation of workers taking a real squeeze in living standards to improve corporate profit margins and competitive prowess." Greenfield called this the "dark side of productivity."
<p>
But just how dark is the American wage and income picture? According to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists W. Michael Cox and Beverly J. Fox, writing in a January National Center for Policy Analysis Policy Backgrounder, it's not as bad as many have been led to believe. The problem with most analyses of stagnating wages is they don't look at benefits. Cox and Fox pointed out that "employee benefits have grown from 20 percent of payroll in 1953 to more than 41 percent today." Since benefits aren't taxed, they argue, employees have sought benefit increases. Increasing payroll taxes have also taken a bite out of wages.
<p>
Cox and Fox also maintain that looking at stagnating household income, as Bernstein apparently was, is misleading. "Today's households are nearly 15 percent smaller than they were in the 1970s -- so household income is spread over fewer people," they report. "The median family income statistics for yesterday's Brady Bunch cannot be accurately compared with those of today's Murphy Brown." Overall, Cox and Fox demonstrate that "per capita real personal income increased an average of 1.4 percent a year" from 1974 through 1993. Unfortunately neither they nor like-minded economists were interviewed by network reporters.
<p>
Only NBC's Jim Avila, on the March 4 Nightly News, gave any hint that the job and wage picture for American workers was not completely bleak. Though he didn't point out that total compensation has been increasing for American workers over the last few decades, he did look at small businesses creating jobs and noted that "many of the new jobs being created provide good salaries, full benefits, and something some of the old jobs did not provide -- a piece of the action. Often small companies offer new employees stock options and other incentives." According to Avila, "The workplace has changed, perhaps forever. The job security of the past replaced by uncertainty and, more often than you might think, also replaced by new opportunity." But, of course, Avila was the exception.

<title>Reporters Ignore Past Prices, Government Burden</title>

<center><h2>Reporters Ignore Past Prices, Government Burden</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Networks Pump Up Gas-Price Story</center></h3>
<p>
Given how closely tuned the media antennae are to the political world, it's no surprise that the recent bump in gasoline prices was big news. Politicians in both parties tried to make political hay out of the price increase. Few reporters questioned their rhetoric by pointing out that gas prices, by historical standards, are not high and that they would be even lower if it weren't for taxes and regulations.
<p>
CBS saw a capitalist conspiracy behind the price hike. Dan Rather sounded the alarm on the April 30 CBS Evening News: "It's the question every American driver is asking with every trip to the pump. Why is the price of gasoline going up and up and up? Is it the free market at work, the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or possibly even something more sinister?"
<p>
CBS economics correspondent Ray Brady suspected the latter. After an industry soundbite defending the price hikes, Brady reported that "critics say those high pump prices come from gouging, [that] the industry deliberately let supplies drop." Brady also blamed Americans for "driving longer distances to work in popular gas guzzlers. And speeding; no more 55-mile-an-hour federal speed limit."
<p>
Curiously, in the very next story, CBS didn't hint at conspiracy when Clinton moved to keep beef prices high. According to Rather, "President Clinton is giving some election-year help to America's ranchers and farmers. The President took action today to try to boost cattle prices, which have fallen to their lowest level in ten years."
<p>
The other networks were a little more calm about the gasoline price hike. ABC's Brian Rooney, on the April 24 World News Tonight, blamed "a combination of unrelated events" for the higher gasoline prices. Rooney pointed out that "crude oil traders were predicting that the United Nations would partially lift the ban on Iraqi oil, which would have put more and cheaper oil on the market. When that didn't happen, the rush to buy from other sources drove the price up." Rooney also informed viewers that the long Northeastern winter contributed to the higher prices.
<p>
Over at NBC, Tom Brokaw said, on the April 30 Nightly News: "We don't have to tell you tonight that gas prices are still stuck at very high levels." Of the government investigation, correspondent Pete Williams said: "Some government economists are skeptical the investigation will turn up anything illegal." He also pinned blame on the weather: "They say prices are up because the severe storm from last winter drove up demand for heating oil, leaving less crude oil for making gasoline."
<p>
Rooney and Williams were correct, as far as they went. But were gas price really "at very high levels"? John Merline, in the May 7 Investor's Business Daily, looked at history for an answer. "After controlling for inflation," he reported, "a gallon of gas today costs 27 percent less than it did in 1949, and 23 percent less than a gallon did as recently as 1985." He pointed out that "even at the high pump prices posted at the end of April, the average national gasoline price is about the same as it was in June of last year."
<p>
Merline spotted the real story, that "today's prices would be lower still were it not for the substantial added cost imposed by government." Neither Brady, Rooney, or Williams mentioned, as Merline did, that "today, the combined federal-state tax is 37 cents a gallon. The federal tax stands at 18 cents a gallon, and the median state tax is 19 cents." 
<p>
"At today's prices," he added, "taxes alone account for more than a quarter of the pump price." Merline also explained that government regulations raise the price of gasoline at least four cents a gallon.
<p>
While Rooney and Williams at least didn't get the story wrong, they still didn't get the full story. Many network news viewers still may not know how much government adds to the price of gasoline.

<p>
What would someone with one foot in the civil rights community and one in the business world think about proposals to raise the minimum wage? Reporter Michael Winsop, in the May 10 New York Times, sought to answer that question. He interviewed Robert Bobbitt, Sr., past president of the board of the Canton, Ohio Urban League and now an owner of four McDonald's franchises in Canton's suburbs.
<p>
Winsop explained that "being the boss changed Mr. Bobbitt's politics. Nearly a decade ago he began voting Republican. The Democrat's current push in Washington to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25 illustrates why." According to Bobbitt, "Before, I would have thought of the minimum wage as a social issue. Then you start working for yourself, and all the risk and responsibilities are on you."
<p>
Winsop told how Bobbitt and another businessman went to see their Congressman. "They explained that 60 percent to 70 percent of their employees were suburban teenagers, many living at home and working to pay for a car and insurance."
<p>
In the May 5 Washington Post, staff writer Steven Pearlstein poked holes in the conventional wisdom about falling wages. Pointing to studies showing falling wages, he wrote that "by measuring only cash wages, the median wage series ignores the fact that employees have been receiving a greater share of their compensation in the form of tax-free fringe benefits." According to Pearlstein, "Most economists now agree that the government's main inflation gauge, the consumer price index, overstates the rise in the cost of living. And because income data are adjusted by the CPI, the effect of overstating inflation is to understate income."
<p>
Kudos to Winsop and Pearlstein for showing underreported sides of economic stories.

<center><h3>Easy Money for Trial Lawyers</h3></center>

Time Warner's Money magazine claims to be a publication for serious investors. 
But lately Money seems to be fronting for an unholy alliance of anti-business 
activist Ralph Nader and a small group of the nation's most predatory trial 
lawyers. While dozens of liberal Democrats joined Republicans last December in 
passing securities litigation reform legislation in the only override of a 
Clinton veto, Money aligned itself with Nader's camp against the popular reform 
bill.
<p>
For years, "strike suit" securities lawyers have reaped lavish incomes 
targeting advanced technology and other growth companies. When stock prices 
drop suddenly, the lawyers typically swoop down and extract multimillion-dollar 
settlements. The system has made it so costly for companies to defend 
themselves against baseless charges that many are forced to settle out of 
court.
<p>
Over the past four years, settlements in such suits have cost investors more 
than $2.5 billion, one third of which -- $825 million -- went straight into the 
pockets of the "strike suit" lawyers.
<p>
The securities bar helped finance Ralph Nader's high-profile campaign against 
the federal legislation to curb abusive securities suits. Then President 
Clinton -- whose career has been largely financed by trial lawyers' largesse -- 
vetoed the legislation.
<p>
Scores of liberal Democrats, including Sen. Edward Kennedy, Democratic National 
Committee Chairman Sen. Chris Dodd, and California Rep. Vic Fazio, joined 
Republicans to override the veto. They found support in much of the media, 
including a Washington Post editorial charging Clinton had "caved to the trial 
lawyers' lobby."
<p>
But Nader, President Clinton, and the trial lawyers had a reliable ally in 
Money magazine. Money's coverage was brazenly one-sided. In four of the five 
monthly editions preceding passage of the bill, managing editor Frank Lalli 
used his column to inveigh against the legislation. Money's fixation is all the 
more notable because Lalli's column is the only opinion piece each month. The 
magazine even ginned up a letter-writing campaign in support of a veto.
During the year of congressional debate on the bill, Money published no 
information about the benefits of the legislation, just Lalli's opinions.
<p>
Month after month, Money's opinion campaign broke the rules of honest advocacy. 
Persistently, the magazine published false or misleading characterizations of 
the reform bill. For instance:
Money falsely charged that the bill would "allow executives to deliberately 
lie." In fact, the bill specifically outlaws executives from making knowingly 
fraudulent statements. The bill does create a limited "safe harbor" for 
good-faith disclosure of forward-looking financial information. A Washington 
Post editorial praised the "safe harbor" for shielding companies "from a style 
of legal assault that is not far from extortion."
<p>
Money wrongly complained that "investors who sue and lose could be forced to 
pay the winner's court costs." The bill does not impose a "loser pays" or "fee 
shifting" provision. Instead it takes a modest step to toughen existing federal 
rules against frivolous claims, whether they are made by the plaintiff or 
defendant.
<p>
Money put things completely backwards in saying "accountants who okay 
fraudulent books will get protection." In fact, the bill gives the Securities 
and Exchange Commission new power to act against accountants, lawyers, and 
others who assist securities fraud.
<p>
The magazine refused to publish letters to the editor in support of the reform 
bill. It is unclear why a publication that professes to be a serious investors' 
magazine allowed only one side's arguments to be heard on an important issue 
for investors. Whatever the motive may be, surely it is not a serious search 
for the truth.
<p>
Securities litigation reform remains a hot political item. Securities lawyers 
are spending millions of dollars on a California ballot initiative that would 
effectively negate the new federal reform law's effect in that state and across 
the nation. Ralph Nader is campaigning ardently for the trial lawyers' 
initiative.
<p>
Those who keep Money magazine in business should take serious stock of its 
editorial policies and practices. Time Warner shareholders and executives -- 
and Money's readers and advertisers -- are in the best position to decide what 
editorial opinions on public policies best reflect their values. But clearly 
everyone is done a disservice when a publication attempts to justify its 
editorial opinion through falsehood and distortion.

<title>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of 
Debate</h2></center>
<center><h3>Minimum Depth on Minimum Wage</h3></center>

One of the key debates currently defining the differences between Republicans 
and Democrats is the argument over efforts to raise the minimum wage. Democrats 
argue that the government can legislate higher pay for those earning the 
minimum wage without harming anyone. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that 
by artificially raising wages, the government will cause employers to lay off 
workers.
<p>
On which side did the media weigh in? Media Research Center analysts reviewed 
all of the minimum wage stories on evening news shows (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC) and 
morning news shows (ABC, CBS, NBC). There were 36 stories and anchor reads 
about the debate. With a few exceptions, the networks took the side of those 
supporting a minimum-wage increase. For example:
Soundbite sources were almost twice as likely to be supporters of the 
minimum-wage increase than opponents. Out of 60 soundbite sources, 39 supported 
the minimum-wage increase, while only 21 were opposed to it. Several stories 
contained soundbites only from Democrats and their allies.
<p>
Bob Schieffer's April 25 CBS Evening News report, for instance, had soundbites 
from Democrats Maxine Waters, Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, and two minimum wage 
workers whom the Democrats had brought to Washington for a news conference. 
"Democrats will keep the pressure up," Schieffer said. "They believe that 
Republicans are taking such a pounding on this they'll eventually allow a 
vote." He didn't tell viewers what Republicans believed.
<p>
This emphasis on supporters of the minimum-wage hike led some reporters to 
accept the Democrats' opinion that the wage could be increased without harming 
workers. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, on the April 17 Nightly News, a 
minimum-wage increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers now 
earning near the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, frozen since 1989." CNN's 
Kathleen Kennedy, on the April 24 The World Tonight, worried that "people 
earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon. Despite political 
pressure from both parties, House Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Dick 
Armey have virtually ruled out scheduling a vote on the minimum-wage increase."
The political horse-race aspect of the debate was emphasized far more than the 
economics of the debate. There were only three soundbites from economists; 
there were 46 soundbites from politicians. The networks were much more 
interested in who would win and lose politically from the debate than what the 
effect would be on the country. According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the April 17 
Nightly News, it was likely that "the most basic wage in this country affecting 
millions of workers and businesses will go up. But, who gets the credit?"
<p>
This weighed heavily on the minds of other reporters, as well. NBC's Jim 
Miklaszewski, on the April 24 Nightly News, predicted that "by digging in their 
heels, Republicans may also be digging themselves into a political hole." And 
ABC's Cokie Roberts, on the April 23 Good Morning America, said: "If the 
Republicans are stuck going along, then they want to get some credit."
Journalists were more interested in interviewing other journalists than in 
interviewing economists. The obsession with political angles reached almost 
comic proportions at times. On the morning shows, where live interviews are 
common, there were five such interviews of journalists about the minimum wage, 
but none with economists.
<p>
ABC's Willow Bay interviewed ABC's Sam Donaldson on a Good Morning America 
Sunday segment. ABC's Charles Gibson interviewed ABC's Cokie Roberts and ABC's 
Tyler Mathison on a Good Morning America segment. NBC's Bryant Gumbel 
interviewed NBC's Tim Russert on a Today segment. And CBS's Harry Smith 
interviewed The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes. None of these shows were 
interested in the insights of economists, however.
<p>
There was more skepticism of Republican motives than Democratic motives. Three 
stories suggested that Republicans opposed raising the minimum wage because 
their business allies opposed it. ABC's Carole Simpson, on the April 28 World 
News Sunday, reported that Republicans "say [a minimum-wage hike] is bad for 
small business." According to Bob Schieffer, on the April 17 CBS Evening News, 
Republicans "know polls show most Americans favor an increase, but many of 
their business allies oppose it." Neither Simpson or Schieffer suggested that 
Republicans may oppose an increase because it would hurt workers.
<p>
No reporter made the analogous charge against Democrats, that they support the 
increase simply because their labor allies support it. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, 
on the April 25 Today, did at least state that there was a principle at stake 
for the GOP: "They can stand their ground on principle on this issue, but lose 
ground in public opinion." He did not explain what that principle was, though.
The one study of the impact of minimum wage increases cited by reporters is one 
most economists disavow. The infamous Card-Krueger study, named after the two 
economists who directed it, was mentioned favorably in two stories. Card and 
Krueger looked at the impact of a minimum-wage increase in New Jersey, compared 
to neighboring Pennsylvania, which hadn't increased its state minimum wage. 
They found that there was no job loss in New Jersey due to the increase. Since 
this is one of the only studies to produce such a finding, it is often cited by 
advocates of increasing the minimum wage.
<p>
ABC's Tyler Mathison mentioned the study on the April 23 Good Morning America. 
NBC's Mike Jensen also mentioned it favorably on the April 26 Nightly News. 
Neither of them mentioned the well-publicized problems many economists found 
with the study's methodology. Jensen, in fact, used a soundbite from one of the 
study's chief critics, economist Richard Berman, but didn't mention his 
criticisms of the study. He even employed an Alan Krueger soundbite to refute 
Berman.
<p>
There were exceptions to the biased coverage. ABC's Bob Zelnick, on the April 
24 Good Morning America, pointed out that "if labor costs rise too much, many 
employers might simply fire workers or cut back on new hires." And while 
journalists usually don't bother to interview small-business owners about how 
political policies will affect them, several did interview them about the 
minimum wage. NBC's Tom Brokaw devoted an entire Nightly News segment to the 
concerns of a small business owner "in his own words."
<p>
By far the best interview segment about the minimum wage was Anthony Mason's 
interview of Republican Senator Don Nickles and Democratic Congressman David 
Bonior for the April 22 CBS This Morning. Mason challenged both politicians, 
and in so doing brought up points no other reporter mentioned. For instance, he 
asked Bonior: "After the last increase in the minimum wage, Department of Labor 
statistics show we lost some half a million jobs, I believe. Is this going to 
cost us jobs? Are we making a mistake if we do this now?"
<p>
He also asked Bonior, "Congressman, in the first two years of President 
Clinton's term, when you controlled Congress, this issue was never brought up. 
Why is it on the table suddenly now, when we're running up to an election? You 
had an opportunity to do something and it wasn't done then." Mason was the only 
reporter to look at what happened after past federal minimum-wage hikes and to 
point out that the Democrats didn't increase the minimum wage when they 
controlled Congress.
<p>
But for the most part, coverage of the minimum wage was overwhelmingly devoted 
to superficial political calculations, and even then, biased against those who 
opposed an increase in the minimum wage.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Don't Ask About Tuition Inflation</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<H2><center>Issue Analysis: Networks Don't Ask About Tuition Inflation</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>No Skepticism Toward College Costs</h3></center>
<p>
Imagine that there's a product or a service that has gone up in price by 239 percent over the past fifteen years and whose cost continues to increase well ahead of the rate of inflation. Imagine further that the company that produces the product or service blames consumers for the steep price increases. Would reporters accept such an excuse at face value? The CEO of the company would surely be seen sweating before the cameras of 60 Minutes or getting stern lectures from Nightline's Ted Koppel, right?
<p><b>
Not if the product is a college education.</B><br>
The same reporters who are quick to expect the worst -- and demand government action -- when businesses raise prices show a curious lack of curiosity about the shocking rise in college tuition rates over the past several years. In stories about tuition hikes, reporters almost never question the price increases. And they never, ever, bring up the explanation many conservatives and economists point to: government education subsidies help cause the price hikes.
<p>
The most recent example of this lack of skepticism came when President Clinton proposed a $1,500 tax credit for students in their first two years of college. On June 4, the day Clinton announced his proposal, no network report even hinted that it might cause tuition increases. CBS's Rita Braver, for example, merely said that it was "aimed at attracting all students into post-high school education." Peter Jennings called it "the latest giveaway in presidential politics." (That's what they always call tax cuts.) Jennings did point out in the next story that "college expenses are growing at twice the rate of inflation." But he didn't ask why or suggest that some argue Clinton's proposal would add to the problem.
<p>
This is part of a long pattern in network reporting on higher education. Media Research Center analysts reviewed all 23 stories about higher education financing on the ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC news shows between June 1, 1995 and June 1, 1996. No reporter in any of the stories mentioned the argument that federal aid helps fuel the escalation in tuition costs.
<p>
To be sure, reporters often do point out that tuition costs are increasing dramatically. Many of the stories on higher education focus on families trying to deal with such costs. ABC's Tyler Mathison, on the July 12, 1995 <i>Good Morning America</i>, reported that with costs so high, "it's no wonder more and more American families are borrowing to pay the bills." Many stories are helpful to consumers by pointing out which colleges are the best buys.
<p>
But reporters rarely ask why college costs are rising. And when they do, they accept, without challenge, answers they would never accept from industry. Example: CBS's Susan Spencer, on the May 2, 1996 48 Hours. A college administrator told her that he would like to cut costs, but it might hurt the reputation of his school. "So most colleges aren't even trying to cut tuition," Spencer reported. "People might think the quality of education had been cut as well."
<p>
CBS had a different attitude toward the recent gasoline price increases. Dan Rather wondered: "Is it the free market at work, the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or something more sinister?" The networks have also demanded explanations for price increases of other products, such as gasoline or breakfast cereals. But the ivory tower is above such questioning.
<p>
This omission leads to biased reporting of education policy proposals. CNN's Bobbie Battista, reporting on a speech by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the June 1, 1995 Inside Politics, said: "Mrs. Clinton also tweaked those who benefited from the U.S. education system and now want to cut it...She didn't name names, but presidential candidate Phil Gramm, who wants to abolish the Department of Education, went to college thanks to government-sponsored loans." And in hundreds of stories over the past year, Bill Clinton repeated his claim that cutting federal aid to students was "extreme" without being asked why taxpayers must continue to finance higher education's largesse.
<p>
Only one network reporter even suggested the tuition price increases may not be justified. Former CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith, on March 12, pointed out that "the private sector, in terms of business out there, has done all this cutting over the last ten years or so to become more competitive." He asked consumer reporter Hattie Kauffman: "Are colleges doing that at all?" But even Smith didn't point out the argument that colleges and universities are shielded from such efficiency because of government subsidies.
<p>
Had he read an article by John Hood of the John Locke Foundation, in the May, 1995 issue of Reason, he might have. "Is land for classrooms that much more expensive? Is there a shortage of people becoming professors, bidding up the wages of those currently in colleges and universities? Do books cost more than they used to?" Hood asks. "The short answer is maybe -- but the cost increase in higher education far outpaces increases in any of those expenditures."
<p>
According to Hood, there are so many government subsidies at even private colleges and universities that "tuition and fees have only the murkiest relationship to the costs of providing higher education. The 'costs' themselves are essentially arbitrary." Hood explains that federal aid is given to a student based on how much costs exceed the student's "expected family contribution." Since colleges and universities know the average expected family contribution, they can increase tuitions and make more students eligible for aid. "Families will pay more, but a good portion of the tuition hike will be picked up by the government. Hence, colleges and universities can get more money for providing exactly the same service."
<p>
Proof? Hood looks at history. "During the 1970s, the real-dollar value of government assistance to higher education, adjusted for the number of full-time students, fell slightly. So did real tuition, room, and board charges for both public and private colleges," he claims. "Throughout the 1980s, however, government assistance per full-time student rose significantly (10 percent, not including loans), accompanied by a 27 percent real rise in public college charges and a staggering 50 percent real rise in private college charges." He points out that revenue from Pell grants rose by more than 25 percent between 1985 and 1992 and that state level grants rose by 15 percent. All the while, college administrators were complaining about "cutbacks" in federal aid and using that as an excuse to raise tuition.
<p>
But network reporters don't challenge college administrators about their continuous price increases. Apparently, when it comes to higher education, greed is good, or at least not worthy of criticism.

<title>Editor's Note, by Timothy Lamer</title>

<blockquote>
<h2><center>Editor's Note, by Timothy Lamer</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Press: Fiscal Conservatives?</center></h3>
<p>
"There is a liberal bias [in the media]; it's demonstrable." 
"The old argument that the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore."
Are these quotes from Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey? Or maybe Rush Limbaugh and William Bennett? No, the above quotes are from two members of the "media elite" -- Newsweek Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas and CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg.
<p>
In the face of overwhelming evidence, some journalists are beginning to admit there's a liberal bias in the national media. But many of them ludicrously maintain that the bias only extends to social and cultural issues, not to economic issues, and that most reporters are in fact economic conservatives.
James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly makes this claim in his recent book Breaking the News. He argues that "the supposed liberalism of the elite press is more limited than many people believe. On economic issues -- taxes, welfare, deficit control, trade policy, attitudes toward labor unions -- elite reporters' views have become far more conservative over the last generation, as their incomes have gone up."
<p>
The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne agrees. During a May 29 Brookings Institution panel discussion, he said that "the press mostly has the biases of the educated, some would say over-educated, upper middle class." This, Dionne argued, means there is a  liberal bias in coverage of social issues, but "the issues we're most conservative on are in fact economic issues, just like much of the upper middle class that looks at its tax bill."
<p>
Fallows and Dionne are highly- regarded beltway journalists, and properly so. But on this issue they are terribly mistaken. Their argument lacks one element: proof. Numerous studies conducted by the Media Research Center demonstrate that most economic reporting in the non-business media is solidly liberal. For example:
<p>
Tax cuts. Reporters used to be less biased in tax coverage than they have been recently. It was the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 that ended any semblence of balance on tax issues. When tax cuts were being discussed in December of 1994, all 12 economists interviewed by the networks were against cutting taxes. The message: no matter what politicians say, tax cuts are bad economics. Then this year, when Steve Forbes' flat tax became a hot issue, reporters were more than twice as likely to mention arguments against it than for it. Fifty-one arguments against the flat tax were presented during January on the networks and in national news magazines. Only 24 arguments in favor were presented. Fallows and Dionne must know that "Reaganomics" has become a cuss word among reporters.
<p>
Federal regulations and mandates. Like most liberals, reporters seem to think businesses have money trees in their stockrooms. It rarely occurs to them that companies may have to increase prices, lay off workers, or reduce salaries and benefits in order to comply with regulations and mandates. A recent example is the debate over increasing the minimum wage. During the first four months of 1996, there were 60 sources interviewed for soundbites by the networks. Almost twice as many supported the increase (39) than opposed it (21).
<p>
Some reporters simply accepted the Democrats' logic at face value. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, the increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers" who earn near the minimum wage. CNN's Kathleen Kennedy worried that if the two parties couldn't agree, "people earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon."
<p>
Federal spending and the budget. Reporters seem to favor budget discipline when the issue is cutting taxes. But when spending programs are threatened, anecdotes abound outlining who will allegedly be harmed by fiscal restraint. During the first hundred days of this Congress, 34 network stories asserted that a balanced budget achieved by spending restraint would harm the poor. Only four stories focused on the benefits of a more limited government. And during the two government shutdowns last year, reporters repeatedly intoned about the "critical cuts" (Dan Rather) and "major cutbacks" (Tom Brokaw) in the GOP budget, without mentioning that Republicans planned to spend $267 billion more in 2002 than in 1996. According to CBS's Bob Mc-Namara, the shutdowns were "a hard lesson on what happens when big government goes away."
<p>
Part of the Fallows-Dionne misunderstanding may be in defining economic conservatism. For some reporters the definition is broad enough to include the architect of the Clinton health plan. CNN's Jeff Levine, on the August 30, 1993 Inside Politics, described (I'm not making this up) "the Ira Magaziner people" as "free marketeers."
<p>
If someone who proposed the biggest increase in government power since the New Deal is a "free marketeer," then who isn't? But if the definition includes, at the very least, some skepticism about government's ability to solve society's problems, few in the "media elite" qualify.

<title>After Hyping Worker Anxiety, National Press Ignores Contrary Evidence</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>After Hyping Worker Anxiety, National Press Ignores Contrary Evidence</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Poll: Workers: Happy. Media: Yawn.</center></h3>
<p>
Few mantras have been repeated more often in the media this year than the one about anxious American workers. It's accepted as fact among reporters that American workers are alarmed about their prospects in the new, global economy.
Just ask Dan Rather. As MediaNomics reported earlier this year, he spotted "fear and anger" in the workforce over "layoffs and barely rising wages." According to CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, "The latest rounds of corporate cutbacks have left many people fearing that they may be the next to be fired." 
<p>
Tom Brokaw, introducing a January 29 Nightly News story about "today's frightening job market," announced: "Job security is a thing of the past now and the way of the future is downsizing and layoffs, even for America's biggest companies. It's making for serious anxiety." 
<p>
The print media have been similarlyfocused on gloom. The January 22 U.S. News & World Report cover asked: "Is the American Worker Getting Shafted?" (The magazine's answer: yes.) Newsweek's February 26 cover labeled four executives who had laid off employees as "Corporate Killers," and declared that the "public is scared as hell."
<p>
The New York Times saw fit to print a seven-part series depicting American workplaces as "battlefields" with "millions of casualties." According to the Times, the story of a man who lost a high-paying bank job, was forced to take a job at one-fourth the pay, and then had his family leave him "is no longer extraordinary."
<p><b>
Really?</b><br>
To find out, Inc. magazine tried something different. Rather than repeating emotional anecdotes about companies laying off loyal workers, Inc. commissioned the Gallup Organization to conduct a nationwide poll of workers.
<p>
"Across the board the 34 questions [to the worker survey] prompted upbeat -- sometimes even glowing -- responses," the magazine found. For example: 90 percent of the respondents were not worried about losing their jobs and 75 percent had not had three or more days in the past month when stress caused them to behave badly with their families. (For more survey results, see box.)
<p>
Interestingly, Inc. found that on many questions, workers at smaller companies are happier than those at large firms. The national media may be missing the story of worker happiness because they relentlessly focus on big business. Last summer, Media- Nomics found that in the first six months of 1995, there were 119 network evening news stories on the health of large companies, while only 13 stories focused on the health of those companies not in the Fortune 500.
This is truly a whopper of an omission, since smaller, fast-growing companies ("gazelles") created five million jobs between 1990 and 1994, while other companies lost 800,000.
<p>
The non-business media have not reported Inc.'s findings and have yet to tell the whole story about the true nature of the American workplace. It is a picture of the entire economy -- they aren't telling the whole story.

On May 2, the Clinton administration (and many reporters) busily played up the 
news that the economy had grown at a 2.8 percent rate. ABC's Brit Hume, while 
not downplaying the news, put it in political perspective.
<P>
Hume reported that Clinton economic advisor Laura D'Andrea Tyson called this 
"the second longest peacetime expansion since World War II, not mentioning that 
the longest was during the Reagan years, which the Clinton administration 
prefers to call the decade of greed." Hume pointed out that "she also did not 
mention that the expansion includes the last part of the Bush administration, a 
time Mr. Clinton always claimed was a recession."
<P>
Later that month, NBC's Mike Jensen reported another bit of good economic news. 
The giant companies that had been downsizing, Jensen said, have "finally 
started to rehire."
<P>
Unlike past reports on downsizing, Jensen interviewed a consultant who 
explained that the downsizing wave allowed companies to become more productive 
and profitable. The consultant, John Challenger, told viewers: "These companies 
are able to hire many people because of the downsizing decisions they made over 
the last few years."
<P>
Jensen even mentioned something rarely revealed in the news: "Ninety thousand 
new jobs were added to the nation's workforce every month on average for the 
last year, many of them at small companies." Jensen ended on a negative note, 
though. He said that many of these big companies are still downsizing their 
weaker divisions. "That's the new corporate America. Quick to fire, quick to 
hire, with American workers scrambling to find a job and to keep one." (See 
front page for why that's not the typical plight of workers.)

<title>The Algers: Back to the Future</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>The Algers: Back to the Future</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>CBS show highlights successful owners of growing businesses</h3></center>
<p>
On the evening of June 16, CBS aired a program whose message was mainstream American: that talent, initiative, perseverance, and, usually, religious faith are the formula for business success. For an hour viewers saw an unusual sight: Hollywood celebrities unabashedly touting the virtues of free market successes.
A rerun from the 1950s? Hardly. It was the 48th annual Horatio Alger Awards. From the opening segment, Ray Charles's rendition of "America the Beautiful," Bob Dole and William Bennett couldn't have scripted a more tradition-friendly, role model-dominated hour.
<p>
As always, Algers were presented to persons who, like the award's namesake, have emerged from humble circumstances to make a name for themselves. Each story is magnificent non-fiction that shatters the myth that America is no longer the land of opportunity. 
<p>
This path, as viewers saw, knows neither gender nor color: among this year's honorees were a woman -- Ruth Fertel, founder of the Ruth's Chris Steak House chain -- and two blacks: music entrepreneur Quincy Jones and Joe Dudley, who grew up in a three-room shack as one of eleven children and now runs the Dudley Products cosmetics company.
<p>
In videotaped biographical packages preceding their acceptance of the award, the winners discussed their success and their philosophies of life. By dint of hard work, Herbert Boeckmann wound up running the largest Ford dealership in America. This highly motivated achiever spoke movingly of how his father's charitable deeds had spurred his own efforts toward "help[ing] people help themselves."
<p> 
Qunicy Jones reflected: "I don't think God put us here to have everything go right every minute. That's why He's got those other funny words like 'discipline' and 'adversity.' That's what helps shape your character, and it sounds corny, but it's not corny, it's real."  
<p>
John Pappajohn, the president of Equity Dynamics, reminisced about growing up: "We didn't have much money, but we seemed to get along just fine." And he remarked, "I was recently asked by a young man who suffered adversity, 'What do I have to do in order to be successful?' I said, 'Have a dream, and be willing to pay the price in order to have your dream come true.'" 
<p>
Dennis Washington, who now presides over a business empire which includes construction, railroad, mining, and shipping companies, remembered, "We didn't have a lot of money...but the family was together. That means so much."
Looking back, Washington says, "The early part of your life, you may get [dealt] a bad hand, but, remember, that's a [short] period...and if you can focus on the future by finding something that you like to do, with luck and help from God, you're gonna have a good life." 
<p>
As traditional values-oriented as the Algers were, there was nothing politically partisan about them. (Even a brief appearance by Maya Angelou was non-PC.) The show was co-hosted by actress Markie Post and actor John Ritter, both of whom have been outspokenly pro-Clinton; nonetheless, they effectively articulated what the Algers represent. 
<p>
When Ritter, introducing one honoree -- Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula -- declared, "Values, beliefs, principles. You know, some call those old-fashioned, but to others, they're the surest sign of leadership," it was hard to imagine Charlton Heston doing it any better.
<p>
The Algers were produced for television by actor Don Johnson. Two years ago, on the occasion of the ceremony's first national telecast, Johnson told the Media Research Center that the awards are "based on good, old-fashioned, fundamental tools for success...Let's encourage success. That's what America's about." Again, like Post and Ritter, Johnson is not known as a conservative Republican. <p> 
The Algers will never be standard prime time fare, yet it's hard not to think that there's room for other programs like it. And perhaps some of prime time television's scriptwriters, who so often like to paint businessmen as society's villains, were watching and picking up ideas for inspirational business storylines.

<title>Minimum Scrutiny at the New York Times</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Minimum Scrutiny at the New York Times</h2></center>
<p>
In 1994 Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger released the "New Jersey Study," a research paper which claimed that a hike in the minimum wage would increase employment. The Card-Krueger study received considerable press attention, and very little scrutiny, even though it provided the intellectual argument for the Clinton administration's proposal to increase the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour in February of this year.   
<p>
The New York Times, for example, touted the study and its call for a hike in the minimum wage in several stories. The Times' Louis Uchitelle wrote in the January 12 Business section: "Two Princeton University economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, contend there is little evidence of any job loss at all from increasing the minimum wage." 
<p>
Since the initial reports of the Card-Krueger study, however, the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) has found that the study is based on flawed data. In a March 29 Wall Street Journal column, EPI Executive Director Richard Berman contends that "the Card-Krueger data are worse than flawed -- they are grossly inaccurate." Berman continues: "How do I know? My organization took the time to check the actual payroll records [studied by Card and Krueger]...The payroll records do not match the Card-Krueger data. Only a handful come anywhere close."
<p>
Several newspapers across the country, including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, have published EPI's findings. But despite several attempts by EPI to point out the flaws of the Card-Krueger study to the Times, America's newspaper of record has not yet acknowledged the Institute's findings.
<p>
John Doyle of EPI tells MediaNomics that "it was a real surprise when -- after the study was proven to be based on flawed data, and as a result, worthless -- the New York Times ignored our repeated efforts to publicize the study's flaws. This was not a critique of just another economic study. We pulled the underpinning from the administration's efforts to hike the minimum wage."
Perhaps the Times is just waiting for the right news peg.

<title>Reporters Still Ignoring the Real Tax Record of the 1980s</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Tax and Pretend about Budget Deficit</h2>
</center>
<p>
Here we go again. With Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole pondering a large tax cut proposal, many in the media are telling their viewers and readers that cutting taxes is inimical to balancing the budget.
<p>
"When you talk about a balanced budget and then you talk about big tax cuts, that's smoke and mirrors," argued NBC's Tim Russert, questioning House Speaker Newt Gingrich on the June 2 Meet the Press. "Bob Dole has been searching for a campaign issue that will mark clear-cut differences between himself and Mr. Clinton," stated ABC's Peter Jennings on the June 3 World News Tonight. But with taxes, "has Mr. Dole painted himself into a corner?" A week later, on the June 10 show, Jennings asked Dole in an interview: "Cutting taxes or the budget deficit, how can you do both?"
<p>
That doing both is impossible has been an article of faith for reporters for years. 
<p>
Since the 1980s, especially the late 1980s, reporters have repeatedly blamed budget deficits on tax cuts. In 1989 and 1990 they scolded George Bush for promising not to raise taxes and urged him to change his mind. On July 18, 1989, CBS Evening News reporter Mark Phillips, for instance, referred to "the stubborn budget deficit that most economists say will never be seriously reduced without the new taxes to which the President [Bush] remains opposed." 
<p>
"We cannot simply sidestep what is happening by resorting to old ideologies and new slogans," stated Mortimer Zuckerman in the February 6, 1989 U.S. News & World Report. Asked Zuckerman: "Who wants to read Bush's lips when to do so in the face of gigantic budget deficits means the slow decline of the America we know and believe in?" And correspondent Richard Threlkeld, on the October 16, 1990 CBS Evening News, opined: "So if and when they do sort out that deficit mess it's likely the rich are going to get soaked, at least a little, to make up for the soaking they avoided in the `80s."
<p>
But are tax cuts really such bad policy? Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, points out in the May 27 Washington Times that when tax cut detractors are "asked for evidence that the American people suffered from [President] Reagan's tax cut, they have none to offer except the budget deficit."
<p>
This is a spurious argument, Bartlett maintains. "In fact, the tax cut had nothing whatsoever to do with the increase in federal budget deficits in the 1980s. On average, federal receipts as a share of GDP were higher in the 1980s than in the 1970s -- 19.0 percent of GDP versus 18.5 percent." According to Bart-lett, the deficit increase was caused by massive spending increases, with outlays increasing from 20.6 percent of GDP in the 1970s to 23.1 percent in the 1980s.
<p>
Bartlett demonstrates that real economic growth averaged 3.9 percent per year between 1982 and 1989, more than double the average for the 1990s. He also points out that "real median family income increased by $4,564 between 1982 and 1989, an increase of 12.6 percent, while it has fallen by $2,108, a decline of 5.2 percent in the low deficit 1990s."
<p>
If, as is most likely to be the case, tax cuts become part of the debate in this year's campaign, reporters should at least be skeptical of those who claim that they inevitably lead to higher deficits and other dreary economic outcomes.

<title>Issue Analysis: Are Some Risky Products More Newsworthy Than Others?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Addicted to Tobacco Stories</h2>
</center>
<p>
The following is adapted from a Media Research Center special report, to be released later this summer, about news media coverage of risky products and the companies which make and sell them:
<p>
It is estimated that about 400,000 Americans die each year from smoking-related illnesses.
<p>
It is also estimated that about 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related illnesses. And studies show that fully one-third of Americans (75 million) are overweight.
<p>
Given these statistics, it's reasonable to assume that there are three news stories about dietary fat and the industries that sell products with dietary fat for every four news stories about tobacco and the tobacco industry, right?
<p>
Wrong. Media Research Center analysts counted every evening news story during the first six months of 1996 that had to do with tobacco and every evening news story during the same period that had to do with obesity and dietary fat. (Shows analyzed were ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's The World Today, and NBC Nightly News.) There were 138 stories about tobacco and the tobacco industry, all of which portrayed tobacco as a risky product. There were only 38 stories about dietary fat and obesity which portrayed fat as risky to consumers, a difference of almost four to one.
<p>
It's hard to escape the conclusion that tobacco has been singled out. Unlike fat, no angle of tobacco or of the tobacco industry went uncovered during the study period. There were reports, for example, about increases in teen smoking. NBC's Brian Williams, introducing a January 25 Nightly News story, told of  "a disturbing report out today on teenage smoking from the Centers for Disease Control. Despite all the pressures to stop, all the attempts to restrict cigarette sales, kids in much of this country are picking up the habit faster than ever." According to NBC's Bob Kur, in the same story, "Teenagers are part of 47 million smokers nationwide whose habit costs the country $50 billion in medical care." Bill Clinton's anti-tobacco photo-ops were also popular news stories. ABC's Peter Jennings, on the May 7 World News Tonight, reported that "President Clinton was in a New Jersey classroom warning that 3,000 teenagers start to smoke every day."
<p>
Another big tobacco story: The political donations of the industry and how those donations allegedly affected politicians' attitudes and actions toward tobacco. This was especially the case when Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole claimed that, for some people, smoking isn't addictive. Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, writing in the July 29 National Review, asserted that in such reports, the assumption usually is "that tobacco companies had given Dole and the Republican Party a lot of money, so he was clearly in league with the devil." According to Sullum, such reports assume the industry buys votes and never consider "the possibility that politicians...might get tobacco money because they support certain policies, rather than the other way around."
<p>
Sullum is right. Linda Douglass, for example, on the June 27 CBS Evening News told viewers that "Dole now is in the uncomfortable position of often siding with the tobacco industry just as cigarette makers are pumping unprecedented sums of money into the Republican Party." On that same night, NBC's Kur, after quoting the Clinton campaign's charge that Dole was toeing the tobacco industry line, pointed out, with a large on-screen graphic, that the industry "gave nearly $3 million in political contributions last year, 85 percent of the money to Republicans." 
<p>
There were also a great many stories about former tobacco industry executives and scientists admitting that they had known all along that nicotine is addictive, and numerous lawsuits against the tobacco industry were deemed of enough national importance to make the evening news.
<p>
In contrast, there were far fewer stories about fat and obesity and the industries which help produce them. Should tobacco really warrant so many more stories than fat? How dangerous is obesity? According to reporters themselves, it is quite dangerous. NBC's Tom Brokaw said, on the April 29 Nightly News, that "obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country. It is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like." CBS's Jacqueline Adams, on the April 9 CBS Evening News, reported that "for years doctors have known that during pregnancy, obesity can cause serious problems like diabetes and bleeding for the mother. But according to two new studies in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association, obesity in the mother can also cause serious problems for the fetus," including birth defects.
<p>
Even one high-fat meal can be dangerous, according to ABC's John McKenzie. On the May 9 World News Tonight, McKenzie told viewers about a study conducted at the University of Maryland in which researchers "found that after a high-fat meal, arteries, when required to handle an increased flow of blood, could expand on average only 50 percent of normal. It means that under conditions of stress and exertion, people who already have constricted arteries may not get enough blood to the heart."
<p>
So why so much more attention to the tobacco industry than to industries that produce fat? There were never any heated stories on the evening news about fast-food advertising enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day kill them. There were no reporters monitoring the political donations of fast-food restaurant chains and their trade associations. There were no stories in which reporters asked food-industry executives if they believed their products to be harmful. And there were no stories pointing out the medical-care costs of obesity.
<p>
Either the network evening news shows spend too much time covering tobacco or not enough covering the dangers of obesity and dietary fat. Either way, one politically incorrect product and industry is being singled out for intensive news coverage while other risky products and the industries which produce them are not.

<title>Kudos: Krulwich and Corporate Layoff Fears</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Kudos: Krulwich and Corporate Layoff Fears</h2>
</center>
<p>
All this year MediaNomics has reported on how the TV networks have overhyped the economic insecurity of American workers. A March study, for instance, showed that there had been 19 stories in the first two months of the year about layoffs, but only two about job growth. The June issue reported on how the media were ignoring an Inc. magazine\Gallup poll showing that most workers are quite secure and happy.
<p>
Finally, some reporters are starting to question the layoff legend. "The fears," said Forest Sawyer, in his introduction to a July 3 World News Tonight story, "are not always supported by the facts." 
<p>
Robert Krulwich, an economics correspondent for ABC News, continued: "Because we read every day about corporate layoffs and corporate downsizing and job anxiety, most of us now believe the world has changed...[but] what we all think is happening is not." According to Krulwich, "We Americans stay at our jobs about as long as we did 20 years ago. If you go back to 1973 to see how many folks had been at the same company for 10 years or more, for the younger group it was 28.8 percent and for the older group it was 45.1 percent. Now let's go forward to 1993, and look at this, the percentages are up, but very slightly. No big change at all."
<p>
He quoted Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University: "And so what this is telling me is that there is basically just about as much job stability now as there was 20 years ago."
<p>
But then Krulwich tried to explain why people seem to feel more insecure now than they did in past decades. "Here's one possible explanation," Krulwich ventured. "Yeah, lots of people left jobs in 1973; lots of people left jobs in 1993. The numbers look the same...[but] there is some evidence that back in the 1970s more people happily quit their jobs for better pay, whereas today more people get fired." According to Krulwich, "Today people may stay at their jobs because they are afraid of losing their health insurance or their benefits, so they are stuck. Back then people maybe stayed on their jobs because they liked them."
<p>
This explanation conflicts, however, with the Inc. poll, which showed that 70 percent think management makes their workplaces great places to work, that 84 percent had opportunities to grow and learn at work, and that almost 70 percent thought they were paid fairly. This is not the picture of an unhappy work force.
<p>
While his diagnosis of worker attitudes may have been suspect, kudos to Krulwich for reporting the facts about job tenure.

<title>Labor Money Is OK</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Labor Money Is OK</h2></center>
<p>
Jackie Judd's report on the June 14 ABC World News Tonight warned of the close-knit nature of the relationships between, as anchor Peter Jennings put it, "politicians and the industries they are supposed to oversee." So far, so good. But their look at the ties of big business overlooked another group: Big Labor. 
<p>
Jennings introduced Judd's report: "Many politicians still like to wine and dine and travel on somebody else's tab." Judd focused on Democratic Senator Ernest Hollings, Republican Senator Larry Pressler, and House Republican Pat Roberts, who all accepted free travel from industries for which they chair committees. Of Hollings, Judd said: "As Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he took half a dozen trips courtesy of industries his committee oversees." And of Roberts, Judd said: "The American Crop Association hosted him at the swanky Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, and the Dairy Foods Association flew Roberts to Miami for a four day trip."
<p>
Judd's findings were worthy of reporting, but she didn't go far enough. As with most stories about the influence of money in politics, Judd's only looked at business. Labor groups also finance junkets for those in Congress and spend lavishly on campaigns, but viewers were left in the dark about their activities. 
<p>
Judd also didn't ponder why industry finds it necessary to lobby in the first place: often to defend their turf from encroaching government power. What Judd sees as industry's cozy cronyism may be simply a method of survival in a regulatory age.

<title>Just Whom Does Big Business Support?</title>

<center><h2>Just Whom Does Big Business Support?</h2></center>
<p>
Reporters ignore actual donations, label conservatives as industry-backed
A burden of being a free market think tank or activist group in Washington must be knowing that TV network news typically ignores your work. What may be almost as bad is when network reporters cite the work of your free market group, but then sully its credibility by labeling the group "industry-supported."
<p>
It doesn't seem to matter to TV reporters that groups supporting expanded government policies actually receive more funding from corporations than do many of the free market think tanks. Nor does it seem to occur to reporters that some corporations may like, and profit from, big government policies more than from a free market.
<p>
Take CBS' Eric Engberg. On the June 21 CBS Evening News, Engberg reported on the efforts of conservatives in Congress to "defund the left," or stop the federal government from subsidizing the lobbying efforts of liberal advocacy groups. According to Engberg: "Right-leaning advocacy groups would be largely untouched by the legislation because they receive little federal aid and often have deep-pocketed backers in the business world."
<p>
Engberg failed to point out that many of the liberal groups which receive government money in fact have business backers with deeper pockets than those of most conservative groups. According to Stuart Nolan of the Capital Research Center, "Popular opinion incorrectly ties conservatives to big business, while liberals claim the moral high ground by championing 'the little guy.' In truth, however, big business tends to support conservative nonprofits only on legal issues and, to a lesser degree, on regulatory ones. Corporate America tends to fund liberals who specialize in women's, family, minority, and environmental issues."
<p>
According to Nolan's research, Corporate America donates over three times more to left-of-center groups than to right-of-center groups. Examples: AT&T financially supports such liberal groups as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the National Organization for Women (NOW).
<p>
And Times Mirror supports the Children's Defense Fund, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Urban League, and Planned Parenthood. Yet none of these industry supported groups are labeled as such by reporters. 
Conservative groups aren't so lucky. The latest example is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a free market environmental group. While CEI does receive some of its funding from corporations, so do liberal environmental organizations, such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Audubon Society. That didn't stop two CBS reporters from placing only CEI in the same boat as "industry."
<p>
On the May 30 CBS Evening News, reporter Rita Braver (and Bill Plante on the May 31 This Morning), after reviewing President Clinton's objections to revisions of the Clean Water Act, referred to "industry groups and their supporters" before running a soundbite from CEI's Fred Smith. While Braver and Plante should be commended for interviewing Smith, liberal environmentalists who get more money from industry than CEI have escaped such labeling.
<p>
Industry is not a monolith. Some businesses support and prosper from free markets. Others do not and give money to groups which favor government activity in the marketplace. By missing this point, reporters unfairly tilt credibility against the think tanks and advocacy groups which support free markets in favor of those which do not.

<center><h2>Lisa Myers: Ahead of the Pack</h2></center>
<p>
NBC correspondent uncovers angles other Washington reporters miss
For some time now, NBC's Lisa Myers has been one of the most perceptive network news reporters based in Washington. Her beat is politics, but she brings to that calling an economics perspective which even some of the most seasoned business reporters lack.
<p>
Since the beginning of the year, Myers has spent most of her time covering the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill. She has been no knee-jerk partisan of the GOP. Often she challenges Hill leaders for practicing the same kind of old-fashioned politics they had claimed to repudiate in the November elections.
On the March 14 Nightly News, for instance, Myers took House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston to task for directing pork spending into his and other committee members' districts. "Bob Livingston preaches budget cutting with the fervor of a televangelist," Myers reported. "When critics charged that cuts victimized the poor, Livingston argued that the real victims today are taxpayers." 
<p>
But, she said, "he and his committee seem less concerned about reaching into taxpayers' pockets when it comes to their own pork barrel projects." After pointing out the nearly $3 billion Appropriations Committee members had steered to their own districts, Myers said the policy, though started by Democrats, "runs contrary to promises that this Republican Congress would be different."
On the May 23 Nightly News her target was Senatorial junkets. She described one junket in which five senators flew to Bali to visit a bamboo training center. She criticized both Republicans and Democrats, namely Senators Bennett Johnston, Alan Simpson, and self-proclaimed fiscal conservative Arlen Specter. She also detailed the extensive travels of one Congressman, supposedly to learn more about foreign policy issues, even though he sits on the Agriculture and Small Business Committees.
<p>
In contrast to many other political reporters in Washington, Myers also turns a skeptical eye toward many popular government programs. President Bill Clinton's pet program, Americorps, has received extremely favorable coverage from other networks. But Myers, on the February 16 Nightly News, looked at the facts. "Everyone agrees that what these young people are doing is worthwhile," Myers said. "The issue is whether it's a smart use of taxpayers' money. Critics insist it's not, that it's the last gasp of big government liberalism."
<p>
She pointed out that "an environmental project in Alaska costs taxpayers $42,000 per volunteer per year" and also that a grant of "$140,000 [went] to Northeastern University, [but] not a penny went for volunteers." She challenged a bureaucrat who helps run the program, finding that "even a top supervisor described Americorps as a jobs program," which "is not the way the Clinton Administration sold it to Congress."
<p>
On the May 25 Nightly News, Myers examined the federal government's program to subsidize America's sugar growers. According to her, "The sugar secret is hidden in many of your favorite foods: candy, cereal, even canned hams. The sugar growers like it that way. They get billions of dollars; you pay inflated prices and don't even know it, which is one reason the sugar program is one of the sweetest deals around."
<p>
Myers explained that "government price supports and import restrictions combine to drive up the cost of sugar in this country. This year the world price of sugar is 14 cents a pound. But U.S. growers get 22 cents a pound." She pointed out that the total cost to consumers is $1.4 billion a year and that most of the benefits go to large corporate sugar farmers rather than small family farmers.
<p>
On the June 13 Nighty News, Myers proved unafraid to investigate one of the most powerful lobbying forces for big government in America -- the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). "If you think the AARP is some frail group of old people," she reported, "think again. In reality the AARP is one of the most influential voices in [Washington], trusted by 33 million members who are powerful because they vote as a bloc." She pointed out that most AARP money comes not from dues but from selling and endorsing products.
<p>
"However, an NBC News analysis found that while these products and endorsements are good business for the AARP," Myers said, "they are not always good deals for its members." She interviewed experts in such fields as investment banking and health insurance who told viewers that the AARP-sponsored products are usually not the best on the market and are overpriced because of the fee the AARP receives for products sold.
<p>
But it's Myers health care reporting which especially distinguishes her from many of her colleagues. While her beat is politics, and she therefore focuses on political angles, Myers nevertheless consistently brings up important economic facts which other reporters -- even economics reporters -- miss. In the previous Congressional term, for instance, when the Clinton Administration was proposing a sweeping health care program and assuring Americans that it knew how much the program would grow over the years, Myers looked at history and was skeptical.
<p>
On the September 29, 1993 Nightly News, Myers said: "When LBJ proposed [Medicare] he claimed it would cost $8 billion in 1990. The actual cost was $98 billion. Many health experts and economists are already challenging key assumptions of the Clinton plan."
<p>
The only other network reporter to point out the poor track record of government health care estimates, and how the government always underestimates rather than overestimates costs, was CBS's Ray Brady.
<p>
When, last year, the Democrats' favorite health care soundbite was that each American should get the same extravagant medical coverage as members of Congress, Myers kept her eye on the ball. On the June 21, 1994 Nightly News, she asked about such rhetoric: "And who will pay? One way or another, you will." 
<p>
And on this year's hottest health care issue, Medicare reform, Myers has again provided unique insights. The root problem of Medicare, according to Myers, is that "elderly Americans are getting far more in benefits than they ever paid in taxes. Fact: The average man retiring today will have paid about $24,000 in Medicare taxes and will get $85,000 in benefits. For women, who live longer, the difference is even greater: $25,000 in taxes compared with $104,000 in benefits." She is, so far, the only network reporter to point out the large disparities.
<p>
Myers, however, is no ideologue. In 1992 she gave less than charitable coverage to both Republican Presidential candidates, George Bush ("Even judged by the words of his own inaugural address, he comes up short.") and Pat Buchanan ("Pat Buchanan leads with anger."). She also has been critical of Republican plans to cut taxes and reform welfare. 
<p>
She is, above all, fair. She regularly does what good Washington reporters should, but don't usually, do: take skeptical looks at not just "waste," but at the programs government claims to run well, and remember that there are usually economic facts underneath every political story.

<title>Repeating NIH Press Releases</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<h2><center>Repeating NIH Press Releases</center></h2>
<p>
A widely circulated Washington Fax, published and edited by Bradie Metheny, confirms what many suspected: reporters often frame government spending stories along the lines of the press releases of the agencies affected. The fax noted that representatives of and those associated with the National Institutes of Health admit openly they manipulated media coverage to save funding for their agency. 
<p>
"Between May 7 and May 25," the fax reported, "biomedical research was featured in seven network news shows. ABC's Prime Time Live did a story on why funding for seemingly esoteric basic research is key to future advances in medicine. And on PBS, talk show host Charlie Rose interviewed researcher Paul Marks about the implications of the proposed cuts at NIH."
<p>
This same type of "if government doesn't do it who will" mentality was also prevalent in print media. According to the fax: "The New York Times editorial and Op-Ed pages both featured commentaries supporting a strong federal investment in biomedical research and science in general and condemning Republican budget proposals in this area. The Times also had a front-page story May 22 that said basic research was at risk in the battle over balancing the budget."
<p>
How did NIH manage such favorable coverage? "Much of the media activity was due to the efforts of the scientific community to focus attention on the budget cuts threatening NIH," reported the authors of the fax. "The New York Times coverage, for example, was in no small measure due to a lengthy phone call made from Washington state to the Times' board of editors by Jordan Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges."
<p>
The moral of the story: Public relations departments drive the news. Those wanting to cut government spending need to start working the phones.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Report on Victims of Products, Not Litigation</title>

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Networks Report on Victims of Products, Not Litigation</center></h2>
<p>
Reporters Rail Against Legal Reform
<p>
Most observers of the media will agree that if there is one group to which almost all reporters are partial, it's victims. Reporters are eager to cover those who have been injured wrongfully or who have suffered injustices. Such profiles are commonplace in stories about nearly every political issue and often send powerful signals to viewers and readers about which side of an issue deserves sympathy.
<p>
Often this biases stories against free market policies. It is easy, after all, to interview those who get government benefits and who will, at least in the short term, suffer if the benefits are reduced. It's not as easy to interview a young person whose future is being mortgaged to pay for the government programs.
<p>
Current Congressional efforts to reform the U.S. legal system, therefore, present the media with an exceptional opportunity to be balanced. There are clear, identifiable victims on both sides of the tort reform issue. On the anti-reform side are those who have been harmed by a defective product and for whom the courts may be the only redress.
<p>
On the pro-reform side are the small business owners who have been forced to lay off workers or even go out of business because of frivolous lawsuits; as well as small business owners who have caved in to settlement demands in frivolous cases because they could not afford to defend themselves in court.
Despite this clear opportunity, reporters dropped the ball. Media- Nomics analysts reviewed every story about legal reform on each TV network's evening newscast during the first five months of this Congress. While reporters more than adequately covered the plights of those who have had to sue companies because of defective products, they did not interview or focus on a single small business owner or other victims of frivolous lawsuits. Reporters were also completely uninterested in exploring the economic costs of the current legal system.
<p>
Of the 19 legal reform stories that aired, eleven focused on neutral facts about recent Congressional action on legal reform, eight were explicitly critical of such reforms, and no story was critical of the status quo. Six of the eight stories critical of reform described how the status quo helps victims of defective products or medical malpractice. None probed how the status quo may hurt those who are targets of frivolous lawsuits.
<p>
The soundbites were similarly skewed. No business owner, small or large, was interviewed for a soundbite; only two representatives of business associations were interviewed. Five lawyers, by contrast, were interviewed for soundbites, as were four representatives of trial lawyers associations and five representatives of self-described consumer groups. Six stories carried soundbites from victims of defective products; none carried soundbites from victims of frivolous lawsuits. No story featured an interview with an economist, who could have told viewers of the economic benefits of legal reform.
<p>
Bob Faw's May 2 NBC Nightly News story was typical. "62-year-old sheet metal worker Ben Jones was a victim, not just of cancer, but of medical malpractice," Faw reported. "Four years ago doctors at this Fort Worth hospital bungled. Instead of removing Jones' cancerous left lung, they removed his healthy right lung." According to Faw, "The doctors also lied about what they had done and by the time Jones found out, it was too late. He died painfully and unnecessarily."
<p>
Faw interviewed the victim's widow, son, and attorney, plus a member of the American Medical Association (AMA). While the AMA member did point out that much of the money from malpractice awards goes to lawyers, Faw nonetheless concluded by wondering if "efforts to reign in lawyers will end up hurting the Jones'."
<p>
Similarly, on the March 10 CBS Evening News, Art Rascon profiled the case of a Florida boy who because of doctors' mistakes has been in a vegetative state for the past ten years. Because of a Florida law stating that damage awards over $200,000 must be approved by the state legislature, Rascon explained, the boy's family hasn't received any money. "So little Justin still lies in bed," Rascon concluded, "the victim of not only a tragic medical mistake, but of a legal and political system that has yet to resolve the fate of this 11-year-old boy."
<p>
One reporter, ABC's Tim O'Brien, seemed especially hostile to reform. On the March 7 World News Tonight, O'Brien downplayed worries of a litigation explosion and said that "making the loser pay the winner's legal expenses may reduce the number of lawsuits, but most consumer groups insist only the wealthy could sue." O'Brien only interviewed representatives of the Association of Trial Lawyers and of Consumer Action.
<p>
Two days later, on the March 9 World News Tonight, O'Brien again interviewed a narrow range of sources, this time only a representative of Public Citizen, a consumer group backed by trial lawyers. O'Brien and his source, Public Citizen's Joan Claybrook, tried to play down the abuse of punitive damages in product liability lawsuits.
<p>
According to O'Brien most of the large awards which make headlines are later reduced on appeal. "Consumer groups insist the mere threat of punitive damage awards benefits the public," O'Brien said. He never gave the other side: The mere threat of punitive damages also causes many wrongfully accused firms to settle cases because it's cheaper than litigating, even if they win.
<p>
On the March 13 World News Tonight, O'Brien focused on what effect legal reform would have on malpractice lawsuits. His story focused on Willie King, a patient who had the wrong foot amputed by doctors. Viewers heard from King, his attorney, and the president of the Trial Lawyers of America. Said O'Brien: "[King's] lawyer says Congress should be making doctors more accountable for mistakes, not less."
<p>
Missing from O'Brien's story was, for instance, an economist who could have told viewers that large malpractice awards cause everyone's insurance rates to go up. Reporters in general ignored economists who could have informed viewers of the economic benefits which most experts think legal reform would usher in.
No one on either side of the debate would argue that those injured by faulty products shouldn't have the right to seek redress in court; and Faw, Rascon, and O'Brien were not wrong to focus attention on such victims. 
<p>
But legal reform is a complex issue. As with most other political issues, the economic ramifications of legal reform have not been explored by reporters. And anecdotes about victims of defective products and services were not balanced by reports on another set of victims whose stories need to be told: the wrongfully accused small business owners who are often hurt by the current system. Viewers need to know that there are victims on both sides of the legal reform issue if they are to be well-informed.

<Title>Service Jobs Stereotyped by Brady</Title>
</Head>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Service Jobs Stereotyped by Brady</h2>
</center>
<p>
Ray Brady, CBS's economics correspondent, would be a great economics analyst -- if this were the 19th century. For Brady the only good job is manufacturing job. His rhetoric would have you think that service jobs are something akin to slavery, with most of the jobs created since the 1980s being for hamburger flippers. This vastly underestimates the power of the late- 20th century American economy to create good service jobs.
<p>
On the July 7 CBS Evening News, Brady reported on a drop in the unemployment rate that "on the surface, it looks like good news, but if you dig into the numbers, they're really not that great." Why? Because "we're losing manufacturing jobs, which are high paying, and we're adding amusement park kinds of jobs, which don't pay much."
<p>
This is nothing new for Brady, who has been bashing service jobs for years. On March 10, 1989, he reported that "in today's figures, the big job increase is in low-paying service industry jobs" while a graphic of a teen flipping burgers was on the screen. Good employment news on September 4, 1992 was tempered by losses in "manufacturing, the industry that's the heartbeat of the economy."
<p>
On March 5, 1993, Brady reported that "there was hardly any growth in high paying manufacturing jobs," only in service jobs, which "don't pay what the old jobs did." And on March 4, 1994, Brady reported that despite a drop in unemployment, "still, the biggest winners came in low-paying service jobs."
<p>
But just how bad are service jobs. According to National Review's Ed Rubenstein, service jobs include "positions in law, advertising, computers, and medicine." During the 1980s, he reported, "only 12 percent of the increase in employment occurred in the lowest-paid, low-skilled service occupations such as retailing and fast-food restaurants." And what about the 1990s? According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the January 30 Nightly News, "The Census Bureau today said that [computer] software is by far the fastest growing part of the service economy."
<p>
So Brady and other reporters should take a good look at the wide range of service jobs before stereotyping them as "amusement park kinds of jobs." Most of the new service workers do just fine.

<Title>Reporters Promote Corporate Welfare </Title>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Reporters Promote Corporate Welfare </h2>
</center>
<p>
Journalists don't question Administration officials' defense of business pork 
The corporate welfare state has found presumably unwitting allies in the media. Despite the Clinton Administration's stated policy of being against federal subsidies for business, reporters haven't challenged Administration officials to explain their defense of business pork against budget cutters.
<p>
CNN's Charles Bierbauer, for example, on the July 4 World News reported on the threatened elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA). Introducing the story, anchor Bobbie Battista described USTTA as "the small federal agency set up to lure tourists to the U.S....now on the chopping block." 
<p>
Bierbauer quoted Greg Farmer, Undersecretary of the Commerce Department, defending the program: "There's a new job created every 2.5 seconds in the travel and tourism industry in the world. I want the United States to get its fair share." He didn't ask Farmer if this made USTTA an example of corporate welfare. Bierbauer concluded his segment by saying that "tourists will continue to come to the United States, of course, but they may no longer have Uncle Sam to lead them here."
<p>
Another network reporter who let corporate welfare go unchallenged was John Roberts, who warned, on the June 25 CBS Evening News, of federal summer job programs being hurt by Republican budget cuts. "For the past 30 years," Roberts said, "kids from low income families have had help from the federal summer jobs program, which funds student employment."  Concluding his story, Roberts said: "[Labor Secretary Robert] Reich points out that one-third of disadvantaged kids who get summer jobs in the private sector wind up working for the same companies in permanent jobs."
<p>
But, if that's the case, isn't a federal program that forces taxpayers to subsidize the training costs of businesses a prime example of corporate welfare, which Reich claims to oppose? Roberts didn't ask the Labor Secretary. 
<p>
A July 2 Washington Post story lacked similar insights. "Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, a strong advocate of free trade, today expressed confidence 'cooler heads will ultimately prevail' and his department will not be dismantled by Republicans in Congress," according to the Post.
<p>
"As Commerce Secretary, Brown has made U.S. exports a cornerstone of his department, leading trips abroad with American businessmen in hopes of prying open overseas markets." The Post quoted Brown: "It's unbelievable that the United States would be the only country in the world where the private sector would not have a seat at the Cabinet table."
<p>
The Post didn't speculate that the Commerce Department may itself embody corporate welfare. Nor did the Post give any non-Administration views, such as those of economist Murray Weidenbaum of the Center for the Study of American Business. "The current management of the Department boasts that it is especially effective in using its vast resources to help individual companies succeed in an increasingly competitive global marketplace," Weidenbaum said in his testimony to the House Commerce Committee.
<p>
"Of course, the relatively few who benefit from the Secretary of Commerce personally opening doors for them think this is a great idea," Weidenbaum said. "Millions of other businesses, large and small, however, pay the taxes that finance these programs. They do not benefit from this personal attention. In a nutshell, this whole process is unfair." According to Weidenbaum, most American businesses and the American economy would be better off if the money spent by the Commerce Department went to lower taxes or reduce the deficit.
<p>
Remarkably, reporters who were quick to publicize the Administration's crusade to end corporate welfare aren't suspicious when the same Administration claims it can help private companies create jobs and train employees.

<center><h2>Kudos: Post Looks at Regulations from Business Perspective</h2>
</center>
<p>
The concerns of small business owners rarely make it into the stories of the Washington media (See page 2). A notable exception: the July 17 Washington Post. Staff writer Jay Matthews, in a front page story, describes how the federal regulatory maze causes one small business, the Drypers Corporation, to "fear" and "shudder" at the cost of compliance. According to Matthews, that fear can now be remedied by "a Republican led Congress [that] tries to rewrite and scale back what businesses consider irrational intrusions." Matthews gives readers a "close look at Drypers' multi-layered relationship with Washington [which] helps explain the resentment that drives this [deregulatory] campaign."
<p>
The story quotes Walter Klemp, chairman of the Texas-based diaper company, as fearing almost any new government action. Referring to the last time Congress changed tax laws, he asks: "How many volumes and rooms of tax code did they add to the whole thing the last time?" Matthews notes that "Drypers must calculate its income in one way for the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and its shareholders and in quite another way for the [Internal Revenue Service]." Other "conflicting rules" which "almost no one reads" include "a federal law that requires a plan to reduce its employees' commuting time while a state law says the company does not have to put the plan into effect." Such conflicting rules require Drypers' management to neglect their "families for weeks to produce stacks of reports," causing Klemp to declare that "government has tried too much to work social issues through business."
<p>
While Matthews didn't point out the cost of excessive regulations for consumers and society (See Editor's Note, page 8), kudos to him and the Post for reporting on how overregulation does hurt small, struggling business owners.
<p>
 MediaNomics noted recently that NBC's Lisa Myers has been emerging as one of the most original network reporters. During July, the trend continued. Last month Myers reported again on sugar subsidies for Dateline. She pointed out that the program costs consumers while a limited number of sugar growers get billions in subsidies.
<p>
Then, in a Nightly News story, she returned to the Medicare debate. Myers reported again that most recipients receive much more in benefits than they paid into the program and that Medicare's explosive growth wasn't predicted by its founders.
<p>
Myers' fact-based reporting continues to clear up the often foggy entitlements debate.

<title>Reporters Ignore Those Who Support Tax Cuts</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Economists Unanimous on Taxes? </h2>
</center>
<p>
Reporters seem to think they have found something others have been trying to find for years -- a consensus among economists.  Journalists in both the print and broadcast media are reporting that "most economists" are against Dole's tax cuts. But a recent study that actually surveyed economists finds much less agreement than the media are conveying.
<p>
"Bob Dole says his new economic plan will carry America `to the threshold of a breathtaking future.' But to many economists, it looks like `Back to the Future,'" wrote the Boston Globe's Peter G. Gosselin on August 6. "For all Dole's claims about the innovativeness of his proposal analysts said that it relies on two tried-and-troubled ideas -- spending cuts like those balked at by the public last year, and an economic payoff largely missing from the nation's last experiment with substantial tax cuts under Ronald Reagan."
<p>
Clay Chandler, in the August 6 Washington Post, agreed: "Economists, investors and budget experts yesterday questioned the validity of those assumptions and the budget numbers underlying Dole's ambitious claims." He quoted Norwest Corp.'s chief economist, Song Won Sohn, as saying, "If we were to put in a package like this, I'm concerned that income growth effects would be negative, not positive."
<p>
Broadcast reporters were equally adamant. NBC's David Bloom, on August 5, said: "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan." 
<p>
It turns out not to be so clear, though. Professor William C. Adams of George Washington University conducted a nationwide survey of 700 members of the American Economics Association. According to Adams, the survey found "an unexpected degree of sympathy for tax cuts" as well as "an enormous diversity of opinion and no profession-wide consensus on these key issues." (See box.)
<p>
About the same percentage of economists, for instance, think federal spending caused the increased deficits of the 1980s (52) as think Reagan's tax cuts were the culprit (48). More than eight out of ten, though, agree that Reagan's tax cuts increased economic growth. A sizable minority of economists (41 percent) think Dole's plan to recapture 30 percent of the revenue lost from his tax cut through faster economic growth -- the classic supply-side argument -- is plausible. 
<p>
According to the survey, the closest thing to a consensus among economists concerns reining in spending. When asked their preferred priorities for the next Congress, a plurality (42 percent) picked cutting taxes and restraining spending. Thirty four percent chose restraining spending. In other words, a full 76 percent favor restraining spending, a story still waiting to be told in the news.

<title>Issue Review: Coverage of Business Subsidies</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Schizophrenic on Corporate Welfare</h2>
</center>
<p>
When General Colin Powell, in his speech at the Republican National Convention, challenged his party to rein in corporate welfare and not just other parts of government, reporters responded approvingly. But a look at their own past record in coverage (or lack of coverage) of subsidies to business and industry reveals that reporters themselves need to start challenging both parties on the issue.
<p>
"One of the things that I thought was interesting about Colin Powell's speech," commented MSNBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell, "is that he did talk about the hard choices and he said, `Listen friends, let me put it to you. We're going to have to give up corporate welfare as well.'" PBS anchor Charlayne Hunter-Gault said to the Family Research Council's Gary Bauer: "You heard the reaction in the room at the conclusion of the speech. You also heard Mark [Shields] say that when he talked about corporate welfare and welfare for the wealthy there was a deafening silence in the room. How do you think this crowd is really receiving this message?"
<p>
As important is how the media have received this message. For while they are interested in corporate welfare now, the real deafening silence has been in the media's coverage of business subsidies. As reported by MediaNomics in past issues, reporters over the last several months have often either ignored corporate welfare when it was a major part of a prominent issue, or they have actually promoted business subsidies.
<p>
Example: Last summer when some budget cutters in Congress were trying to cut business pork, reporters came to the rescue. CNN's Charles Bierbauer, for example, on the July 4, 1995 World News, reported on the threatened elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA). Introducing the story, anchor Bobbie Battista described the USTTA as "the small federal agency set up to lure tourists to the U.S....now on the chopping block."
<p>
Bierbauer quoted Greg Farmer, undersecretary of commerce, defending the program: "There's a new job created every 2.5 seconds in the travel and tourism industry in the world. I want the United States to get its fair share." Is the USTTA corporate welfare? Bierbauer didn't ask. Bierbauer's conclusion: "Tourists may continue to come to the United States, of course, but they may no longer have Uncle Sam to lead them here."
<p>
John Roberts, on the June 25, 1995 CBS Evening News, warned that budget cuts may hurt summer jobs programs. "For the past 30 years," Roberts said, "kids from low-income families have had help from the federal summer jobs program, which funds student employment." Roberts quoted Labor Secretary Robert Reich as pointing out that "one-third of disadvantaged kids who get summer jobs in the private sector wind up working for the same companies in permanent jobs." So does taxpayer funding of businesses training costs constitute corporate welfare? Roberts didn't ask Reich.
<p>
A July 2, 1995 Washington Post story assumed the Commerce Department was necessary and didn't bother interviewing critics who were calling it the embodiment of corporate welfare. The entire story was from the point of view of then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. According to the Post, Brown, "a strong advocate of free trade, today expressed confidence `cooler heads will ultimately prevail' and his department will not be dismantled by Republicans in Congress."
<p>
The Post said the secretary had been "leading trips abroad with American businessmen in hopes of prying open overseas markets" and quoted Brown as saying that "it's unbelievable that the United States would be the only country in the world where the private sector would not have a seat at the cabinet table." The Post didn't give any space to non-administration views, such as those of economist Murray Weidenbaum of the Center for the Study of American Business. "Of course, the relatively few who benefit from the Secretary of Commerce personally opening doors for them think this is a great idea," Weidenbaum told the House Commerce Committee. "Millions of other businesses, large and small, however, pay the taxes that finance these programs. They do not benefit from this personal attention. In a nutshell, this whole process is unfair."
<p>
Sometimes journalists simply ignored corporate welfare altogether, even when it was part of an issue they were covering. This past spring, for example, most reporters accepted at face value the Clinton Adminstration's expensive plan to restore parts of the Florida Everglades. The fact that federal subsidies, supported by both the Clinton Administration and Republicans in Congress, were propping up the same sugar industry which threatened the Everglades rarely merited a mention.
<p>
The Clinton plan is "the largest infusion of federal dollars ever proposed for the Everglades, making it one of the biggest ecological restoration projects ever," cheered CBS News correspondent Art Rascon on the February 20 This Morning. Miami correspondent Peter Katel, in the March 4 Newsweek, added that "Clinton's plan is the high-water mark of reform. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Florida's two senators have a more modest plan to spend $200 million of taxpayer funds -- not sugar money -- to buy some of the sugarcane land for water-restoration projects." On February 20 reporter Mike Clary of the Los Angeles Times called Clinton's plan "as ambitious and comprehensive as any environmental project of recent years."
<p>
But none of these reporters made the connection between the subsides provided to industry by the sugar tariff and damage to the Everglades. None asked why the government, before spending a lot of money, shouldn't just bring down the tariff. Only Eric Schmitt of the New York Times criticized the subsidies. "The government sets price supports that maintain domestic sugar prices at twice those on the world market and, according to the General Accounting Office, cost consumers $1.4 billion a year," Schmitt pointed out. "Strict quotas on cheaper foreign sugar maintain the support price levels, which critics say benefit a small number of wealthy plantation owners and encourage overproduction in environmentally sensitive areas like the Florida Everglades."
<p>
Such subsidies to business constitute some of the least defensible of federal spending programs. Although neither Republican nor Democratic politicians want to talk about corporate welfare, it has critics outside of Congress and the Clinton Administration on both the right and the left. Reporters generally cheered Colin Powell for bringing up corporate welfare in his convention speech. But when it comes to specific programs, they have usually been slow to mention corporate welfare's critics and quick to assume that business subsidies are justified.

<center><h2>Kudos: NBC's Lisa Myers and Andrea Mitchell</h2>
</center>
<p>
One of the encouraging recent trends on the evening newscasts is the development of regular segments in which reporters explore how the government often misspends taxpayers' money. As recent coverage has demonstrated, NBC Nightly News' version, "The Fleecing of America," has proven to be one of the best.
<p>
The July 10 "Fleecing of America" segment told viewers how the Social Security Administration spends tax money for union representatives who, as Tom Brokaw said, "do no work on Social Security matters." According to correspondent Lisa Myers: "Taxpayers are paying the salaries of 146 full-time employees who do not work on Social Security matters and instead spend all of their time on union activities," as well as another 1,800 who spend part of their work time engaged in union tasks. Myers reported that "under President Clinton, the cost of these union activities has doubled to almost $13 million a year."
<p>
She interviewed former SSA employees who told of the union workers' using their jobs, and therefore tax money, to promote the Democratic Party, and confronted an SSA official about such partisan ties. "This is not happening just at the Social Security Administration," she concluded, "but in virtually every other federal agency."
<p>
Correspondent Andrea Mitchell, for the August 7 segment, told viewers about an "expensive new Medicare handbook, courtesy of the U.S. Government." According to Mitchell: "The handbook is supposed to describe Medicare benefits and where to get help, basic information. It cost $2.1 million to distribute last year. But this year, an election year, it cost nine times as much -- $18 million."
<p>
Mitchell pointed out that "critics wonder, was the chief reason for this year's big cost increase politics." One of those critics, Rep. Bill Thomas, (R-Calif.) said, "The primary goal was to create a positive, warm feeling in an election year with taxpayers' dollars."
<p>
Mitchell pointed out that "a separate copy went to every American over 65. That's 37 million copies," which went even to married seniors whose spouses received a copy. She pointed out that, despite the high cost, the handbook didn't even mention one of the new programs Medicare recipients are eligible for and concluded that to many, "it reads like another chapter in the fleecing of America."
<p>
Kudos to Myers, Mitchell, and NBC for holding government to the same standards reporters have long held the private sector.

<title>Guest Review, by Linda E. Platts</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Where Science Meets Politics</h2>
</center>
<p>
Science and technology are now major players in the public policy arena. While much of the media ignore the science behind many political issues, at least one show takes it on squarely. TechnoPolitics, a half-hour public television show, is helping its viewers make sense out of technical information and also see how the policies that evolve will affect their lives.
<p>
Hosted by James K. Glassman, a Washington Post columnist who also hosts CNN's Capital Gang Sunday, TechnoPolitics is designed to "distinguish the science from the politics in policy debates," according to the producers. Thus, it deals with issues such as electronic communications, air defense, fat substitutes, medical research, and global warming.
<p>
The show delves into one topic at length and then follows with a briefer look at two other subjects. Film clips provide background information usually followed by a debate by experts representing both sides of the issue.
<p>
What distinguishes TechnoPolitics from other shows dealing with topical issues is its willingness to air views that get short shrift elsewhere. In a recent show, the World Bank came under close scrutiny. It is supported by the American taxpayers to the tune of $789 million a year and relies on the American government to guarantee its loans. Glassman dug in with queries on the bank's hefty salaries, its new $314 million headquarters, and its often risky loans, which no private bank would consider.
<p>
For another show, TechnoPolitics tackled pornography on the Internet. One side weighed in with the view that children must be protected at all costs and government control is essential. The opposing side suggested parents should do their jobs, rather than allow the government to gain a foothold on the free flow of information over the Internet. Another emotionally charged issue tackled recently by TechnoPolitics was medical research using animals. News footage with an animal rights activist and a patient battling AIDS introduced the segment, then in the studio two scientists presented contradictory "scientific" evidence. There were no clear winners or losers in this debate, but it highlighted the complexity of making public policy about animal testing.
<p>
Whether the subject is a replacement for the F-16 or saving human lives, TechnoPolitics doesn't shy away from the hard issues. The joint strike fighter, for instance, is intended to meet the needs of all the military services, but the development time, as Glassman noted, stretched well into the next century. Even more attention to the costs behind the science would be a welcome addition.
<p>
The last segment of each show does not examine an issue so much as raise an interesting subject. A New York Times reporter told how alternative medicines can deter patients from seeking effective treatment from conventional sources. A writer from Scientific American explained that all great scientific discoveries have already been made and from now on we will just be refining the details. Interesting, yes, but there is no debate and viewers are left in limbo waiting for the point that is never made. TechnoPolitics might be better leaving these stories to another program and sticking with the clear, rapid exchange of views that distinguishes the earlier portions of the program.
<p>
TechnoPolitics is produced by the Blackwell Corporation in association with South Carolina Educational Television and it is distributed by the Public Broadcasting System. It is broadcast on 180 stations and reaches 40 of the top 50 markets. It airs on Sunday mornings in most markets.

<Title>Tax Cuts Concern Reporters, Medicare Increases Don't</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Deficit Chicken Hawks</h2>
</center>
<p>
Bob Dole pledged to cut income taxes by 15 percent, balance the
budget, and leave Social Security and Medicare untouched. Toughminded
reporters believed none of it and shared their skepticism with
a national television audience,&quot; writes the Weekly Standard's
David Frum in the September 9 issue of that magazine.
<P>
But then, according to Frum, &quot;Two weeks later, the Democrats met in
convention and, to put it simply, lied through their teeth about
their plans for Medicare. They accused Republicans, in Al Gore's
words, of wanting to `give health insurance ripoff artists a license
to change Medicare, to let this program for our seniors wither
on the vine. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But
we won't let them.' Those remarks are blatantly untrue, both about
the Republican plans and about Clinton's own. And the media said...nothing.&quot;
<P>
Is Frum correct? Are reporters more skeptical of Bob Dole's tax rhetoric
than of Bill Clinton's Medicare rhetoric? Media Research Center
analysts reviewed all of the stories about either tax cuts or
Medicare on ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly
News, and CNN's World Today during the month of August. The MRC's
findings: While network journalists were ardent deficit hawks
when reporting on tax cuts, they lost their deficitcutting zeal
when Democrats denounced Republican Medicare plans.There were
a total of 24 stories during the month that questioned whether
Bob Dole could both cut taxes and balance the budget. Only two
stories questioned whether Bill Clinton could erase the deficit
while not advancing Medicare reforms in his second term.The reaction
to the unveiling of Dole's tax plan was the same across the networks.
&quot;Since Dole would leave Social Security, Medicare, and defense
untouched,&quot; reported CBS News correspondent Phil Jones, &quot;it's
still unclear what would be cut in order to pay for his tax cut.&quot;
According to CNN's Gene Randall, &quot;Bob Dole has produced an
economic plan that is getting mixed reviews even from Republicans.
The bipartisan Concord Coalition on Sunday warned against electionyear
taxcut Santas.&quot;
<P>
NBC's Mike Jensen offered that &quot;most
analysts say it's not good economics. Bob Dole says about a fourth
of the tax cuts would be paid for by an expanding economy, but
the rest would have to come from spending cuts, and those haven't
been spelled out yet.&quot; Over at ABC, correspondent John Cochran
claimed that &quot;if critics say Dole's tax plan would lead to
budget deficits of the size of those dating back to the Reagan
era, then his campaign simply isn't going to worry about it for
now.&quot;
<P>
But what about Bill Clinton and Medicare? Economics
columnist Robert Samuelson, in the September 4 Washington Post,
pointed out that in the upcoming years &quot;the only way to avoid
(or minimize) much higher taxes, the [Congressional Budget Office]
said, would be a mix of an older retirement age, reduced benefits
and a shift of Medicare toward managed care. On Medicare, the
Republicans proposed precisely such a shift...Clinton's demolition
of this effort confounds the CBO's sensible advice.&quot;
<P>
Only
two network reporters questioned whether leaving Medicare alone
could be compatible with balanced budgets. &quot;A generation
of baby boomers begins retiring within a decade,&quot; ABC's Jerry
King pointed out. &quot;So, the bad news is, unless the politicians
find a way to cut entitlement spending, today's deficit reductions
will be impossible to sustain.&quot; ABC's Jeff Greenfield reported
that &quot;with the huge baby boomer generation retiring in about
15 years, those entitlement programs could take every single dollar
of the budget.&quot;
<P>
King and Greenfield were the only reporters
concerned about how to &quot;pay for&quot; automatic Medicare
spending increases. If Bill Clinton won't reform Medicare in his
next term, why aren't reporters asking him which taxes he will
raise?

<Title>Issue Analysis: The Media Versus Tobacco</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Addicted to Tobacco Stories, Part II</h2>
</center>
<p>
 Which is worse, a legal product that if used over many decades can be lifethreatening,
or an illegal product that can be of more immediate danger?
<P>
For
America's news media, the answer is overwhelmingly the former.
Over a recent twelvemonth period, television news has devoted
significantly more air time to reporting on tobacco than to reporting
on cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined.
<P>
This is one finding
of a special yearlong Media Research Center study of news coverage
of risky products and the industries which make and sell them.
Tobacco and the tobacco industry received more negative coverage
by far than any other risky legal product, such as dietary fat
and the food industry, automobiles and the auto industry, alcohol
and the alcohol industry, and pesticides and the chemical industry.
Tobacco even received more coverage than illegal drugs. This media
obsession with tobacco affected coverage of other issues as well,
even coverage of the 1996 presidential campaign. 
<P>
Media Research
Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about several risky
products on network morning and evening news shows between August
1, 1995 and August 1, 1996. There were 413 stories during that
twelvemonth period about tobacco; there were 340 stories about
illegal drugs. This disparity was present despite welldocumented
rapid increases in the use of illegal drugs over the past few
years, notably among teenagers.
<P>
Among the print media, the disparity
has been even greater. A Nexis search of headlines in American
newspapers finds that the terms &quot;tobacco or smoking or cigarette&quot;
were employed 26,546 times between January 1, 1993 and September
9, 1996. Over the same time period, the terms &quot;cocaine or
heroin or LSD or illegal drugs&quot; were used only 8,501 times.
In other words, there were more than three times as many stories
focusing on tobacco than there were stories focusing on illegal
drugs.
<P>
President Clinton has helped put the tobacco story on the
map. Eightyfive of the television news tobacco stories were about
the Clinton Administration's attacks on the tobacco industry.
Almost all of the stories were upbeat about Clinton's attempts
to regulate tobacco, portraying him as courageously taking on
a powerful industry. NBC's Bryant Gumbel, for instance, announced
on the August 11, 1995 Today that &quot;in a historic move the
Clinton Administration has declared nicotine to be a drug and
has proposed regulations aimed at curbing smoking by teenagers.&quot;
According to CBS' John Roberts, on the August 10, 1995 This Morning,
&quot;President Clinton is stepping up federal efforts to harness
smoking among teenagers. He'll detail some tough new measures
today that are sure to put him at odds with the powerful tobacco
lobby.&quot;
<P>
But when the issue was the increases in illegal drug
use, Clinton was mentioned only in 45 stories, and most of those
mentions were positive. Again, the disparity is revealing. The
same reporters who are willing to accept Clinton's premise that
government policies can discourage smoking behavior among the
young demand little accountability from him for increased illegal
drug use. And there was rarely even the suggestion in the media
that the president was playing up the tobacco issue to hide how
much illegal drug use had increased during his watch.
<P>
Among the
print media, the same disparity was present. A Nexis search reveals
that there were 4,057 stories between January 1, 1993 and September
9, 1996 that had &quot;tobacco or smoking or cigarette&quot; in
the headline and a reference to Bill Clinton in the body of the
story. Stories with the terms &quot;cocaine or heroin or LSD or
illegal drugs&quot; in the headline and a reference to Clinton
in the body of the story numbered 381.
<P>
This singling out of tobacco
had effects on 1996 campaign coverage. Normally, when a politician
radically changes positions on an issue, it's big news. For instance,
there were several evening news stories during the 1996 Republican
National Convention about Jack Kemp altering his positions on
illegal immigration and affirmative action once he became the
Republican vicepresidential candidate. &quot;
<P>
The quarterback became
the acrobat today,&quot; reported ABC's Jackie Judd on the August
14, 1996 World News Tonight. &quot;Kemp was flipflopping on long
held positions.&quot; She noted that these changes &quot;left
at least one delegate here feeling abandoned&quot; and that &quot;Kemp's
change in position on these core issues fights the very image
that he's built for himself as an independent thinker.&quot; According
to Dan Rather, on that same night's CBS Evening News, &quot;Bob
Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts.
Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration.&quot;
Rather wondered: &quot;Isn't that, or is it, going to make it
more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?&quot;
<P>
But
these bloodhounds sniffing out hypocrisy turned quiet when Vice
President Al Gore radically changed his position on tobacco. In
his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Gore said that
his sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his antitobacco
crusade. None of the network evening newscasts pointed out that
in 1988, he boasted to tobacco growers that &quot;throughout most
of my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my
own hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred
it. I've hoed it. I've dug it in. I've sprayed it, I've chopped
it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped
it and sold it.&quot; Apparently, politicians changing their positions
cannot go unpunished by the media unless they result in the politician
becoming an antitobacco zealot.
<P>
The disparity between tobacco and
other legal products was even greater. On television  during the
same time period in which there were 413 stories about tobacco
 there were 136 stories about dietary fat and obesity; there were
94 stories about auto safety; there were only 58 stories related
to alcohol and health.As MediaNomics reported two months ago,
the disparity between reporting on tobacco and reporting on dietary
fat and obesity is especially curious. The same health advocates
who tell us that tobacco contributes to 400,000 deaths in the
U.S. each year also report that obesity contributes to 300,000
deaths in the U.S. per year. Reporters acknowledged this risk.
&quot;Obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country,&quot;
Tom Brokaw reported on the April 29, 1996 Nightly News. &quot;It
is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from
heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like.&quot;
Other reporters pointed out that obesity during pregnancy can
cause birth defects and other serious problems in babies. One
reporter, ABC's John McKenzie, insisted that even one highfat
meal, if eaten at an inopportune moment, can be dangerous. But
there were still only onefourth the number of stories on obesity
and dietary fat as there were stories about tobacco. 
<P>
There was
also a different standard of judgment for the industries that
make and sell other risky products. They were never subjected
to nearly the same hostility that the tobacco industry endured.
There were no stories, for example, about fastfood advertising
enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day
kill them. Nor were there any stories pointing out the medical
costs of obesity. And no network reporter sought to outline the
campaign contributions of companies which produce and sell alcohol.
But all the networks were critical of tobacco advertising and
campaign contributions, as well as the medical costs to society
of smokingrelated illnesses.
<P>
Journalists seem to have lost some
perspective when reporting on tobacco. They not only air far more
stories on tobacco than on other legal, risky products, but they
have allowed Clinton to use smoking to deflect attention from
rising illegal drug use. Reporters should not ignore tobacco,
but they should not apply to it a harsher standard than they apply
to even illegal drugs.Editor's note: This issue analysis is adapted
from a longer Media Research Center special report about media
coverage of both legal and illegal risky products and the industries
which produce them.

<center><h2>PBS: Already Commercial</h2>
</center>
<p>
In all of the heated debate about privatizing
public broadcasting, one observation has struck me most forcefully
about PBS: It is a fact seldom commented upon that many PBS shows
have had their roots firmly fixed in commercial soil from their
inception. Many of public television's bestknown offerings are
either transfers from the networks, adaptations from them (often
using the same personnel), or purchases (on a commercial basis)
from British television companies (including such forprofit competitors
of the BBC as Thames Television).
<P>
The <I>MacNeil-Lehrer Report</I>, for
instance, was produced by a team from NBC News and resembled the
<I>Huntley-Brinkley</I> Report. Bill Moyers shuttled between PBS and <I>CBS
News</I>. William F. Buckley's <I>Firing Line</I> had run on RKO General
stations before moving to PBS. <I>Frontline's</I> first anchorwoman was
NBC News' Jessica Savitch. The American Experience was headed
by veteran Moyers' producers from CBS News. National Geographic
specials were simply moved from CBS. Ken Burns' The Civil War
was sponsored by General Motors.
<P>
Sesame Street was produced by the makers of CBS's Captain Kangaroo. British comedies like Monty
Python's Flying Circus were sold profitably to individual stations,
as were howto programs such as This Old House and The French Chef.
Masterpiece Theatre and Mystery! were brought to PBS by the Mobil
Corporation. The story of Milton Friedman's Free to Choose is
a case study of how private sponsorship made possible a major
PBS miniseries. 
<P>
One could choose a different selection of programs
to analyze, but it would be difficult to find truly excellent
PBS fare which did not have some commercial connection. It is
precisely these market forces which serve to improve the range,
quality, and choice of programs on public broadcasting.
<P>
The extent
to which public broadcasting had developed into a large, powerful,
and wealthy establishment over the past three decades remained
largely obscured from public view prior to 1992, when political
deliberation over continued funding for the system began in earnest.
As a result of the subsequent years of debate and disclosure there
is now a bipartisan consensus in Washington that public broadcasting
can be selfsupporting. In 1996 Congressman Jack Fields, chairman
of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, introduced what
he called the &quot;Public Broadcasting SelfSufficiency Act.&quot;
Although I have opposed such a billiondollar final payment to
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (as a &quot;trust fund&quot;),
no one has come forward to publicly argue against the principle
of selfreliance.
<P>
Indeed, a January 1996 public opinion survey commissioned
by CPB found broad support among the American public for PBS sales
of videotapes and merchandise, commercials, retail stores, online
computer services, and mailorder catalogs. Fiftyseven percent
of those asked said, &quot;The more sales the better.&quot; Eightysix
percent agreed that &quot;sponsorship announcements are okay because
public broadcasting has to do something to raise money in the
face of the decreased support from the federal government.&quot;
That is, the public now accepts that educational and cultural
programming on PBS can be successfully supported by private revenue
streams.
<P>
A system which began with a $5 million appropriation for
CPB in 1967 has grown over thirty years into a multibillion dollar
worldwide multimedia empire. With over a thousand public radio
and television stations, public broadcasting is now the largest
network in the United States. When judged by the number of stations,
National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service, Pacifica,
and Public Radio International are bigger than Fox, CBS, NBC,
or ABC.
<P>
In addition to their on-air activities, public broadcasters
publish magazines and newsletters; provide computer programs,
online services, sites on the World Wide Web, study guides and
textbooks; host conferences; license toys, games, and clothing;
produce stage shows; sell products through mail order catalogs
and retail stores; and distribute videocassettes and compact disks.
From these activities a large industry has grown to parallel commercial
broadcasting. And, just like other telecommunications giants,
public broadcasting spends millions on public relations firms
and lawyers to lobby Congress.
<P>
The political issue of &quot;zeroing
out&quot; federal subsidies is no longer a matter of &quot;if&quot;
but merely a matter of &quot;when.&quot; For the evidence is clear
and convincing: public broadcasting does not need tax dollars
in order to do its job.

<CENTER><H2>Studies on Religion, Economy Available</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
The Media Research Center has produced a new landmark study of how news and 
entertainment television treat religion. Faith in a Box, 1994 builds on the 
1993 study of the same name, which found that religion received poor treatment 
in both the news and on prime time.
In the 1994 study, the MRC found marked improvement in Hollywood's depiction of 
religion, but network news continued to trivialize or downplay religious 
themes.
<P>
As was the case with its 1993 predecessor, Faith in a Box, 1994 was recently 
released to the media in Hollywood and Washington, and distributed to 
conservative and religious activists nationwide.
<P>
Leaders in the entertainment industry, including network executives, have been 
briefed on the MRC's findings as well, and given the MRC's recommendations on 
improving religious portrayals on their television shows.
<P>
To obtain a copy of Faith in a Box, 1994, please call 1-800-MRC-1423 or write 
to us at: Media Research Center, 113 S. West Street, Suite 200, Alexandria, VA

<P>
MediaNomics readers still have a chance to obtain Out of Focus: Network 
Television and the American Economy by MediaNomics editor Burton Yale Pines, as 
well.
<P>
Out of Focus takes an in-depth look at an entire year's network reporting on 
such as issues as health care reform, environmental policy, taxes, government 
spending, business, and consumer affairs. The book also looks into the impact 
of prime-time entertainment television on the culture of free enterprise and 
business.
<P>
According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, "Out of Focus is a major blast at 
American network television. It deserves the attention of thinking Americans."
National Review agreed: "Out of Focus does for TV viewers what Consumer Reports 
does for car buyers, exposing the recurring flaws in the reports of Ray Brady, 
Irving R. Levine, most of the CNN staff, and the like."

<CENTER><H2>Letting Government Polluters off the Hook</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
For reporters, industry is always the polluter; government is always the 
protector. When it's government programs, such as subsidies for pesticide-using 
farmers, that encourage pollution, reporters are silent.
<P>
Robert Hager's August 8 NBC Nightly News story was a case in point. He began: 
"The purity of the water we drink, the air we breathe, the food we eat. For two 
decades the Environmental Protection Agency has led the clean-up." From 
corporations pouring dioxin into the Great Lakes to protection of wetlands, 
"which prevent flooding and permit wildfowl to breathe." According to Hager, 
House efforts to rein in the EPA would bring "the first big slowdown in 
environmental clean-up since the 1970s."
<P>
But what if the government is the culprit? Take the Everglades. As Jonathan 
Tolman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) points out, the U.S. sugar 
program, by subsidizing sugar production, is responsible for much of "the 
increased phosphorus contamination of the Everglades which is disrupting the 
unique nature of the ecosystem." Tolman also lit into the USDA peanut program, 
which not only "costs consumers $500 million a year in higher peanut prices," 
but increases pesticide use by permitting peanuts to be grown in just a handful 
of counties.
<P>
Elimination of farm subsidies has been advocated by environmentalists of all  
political stripes, from the free-market CEI to the liberal Wilderness Society. 
Only reporters are letting government off the hook.

<CENTER><H3>Medicare Reporting Improving, But...</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
In June, MediaNomics described how TV network news reporters were incorrectly 
characterizing Republican plans to slow the rate of Medicare's growth. During 
the study period, reporters called GOP plans "cuts" twice as often as they 
correctly called GOP plans "slowing Medicare's growth."
<P>
Since then, there has been a dramatic improvement in network labeling. Now, 
half of the time network reporters get it right labeling Medicare reform plans. 
Media-Nomics analysts reviewed all of the stories about Medicare on network 
evening newscasts from July 15 to August 15. In the 15 stories, there were 24 
references to either the GOP plan or the Clinton plan to reform Medicare. 
Twelve of the references labeled the plans "cuts" or "reductions." An equal 
number of references labeled the plans as slowing the rate of increase in 
Medicare.
<P>
There is, however, still some confusion. Many reporters now use the terms "cut" 
and "slow the growth" interchangeably, sometimes even in the same story. CNN's 
Catherine Calaway, for instance, on the July 25 World News, referred to 
Medicare "spending cuts," but then, two sentences later, said: "Both parties 
hope to slow Medicare growth, but Republicans would go further."
<P>
Her CNN colleague, Jill Dougherty, did the same four days later. On the July 29 
World News she reported on "Republican plans to cut the growth in Medicare 
spending," but then later in the story alluded to "the $270 billion in 
GOP-proposed cuts." On the next day's World News Dougherty again clouded the 
issue. After first reporting that "Republicans propose cutting Medicare's 
growth by $270 billion," she mentioned charges that "Republican cuts are just a 
cover for the $245 billion they want to give away in tax cuts." 
<P>
Later in the story she said the GOP was "intent on giving voters a balanced 
budget along with hefty tax cuts, and it's hard to see any way to do that 
without taking something out of Medicare."
<P>
The other networks were similarly sloppy. On the July 25 World News Tonight, 
for example, ABC reporter Rebecca Chase pointed out that "both parties propose 
slowing the growth of Medicare spending," but then later talked about how much 
they would "reduce" Medicare spending. At CBS, reporter Bob Orr said: 
"Republicans want to reduce the growth in Medicare spending by $270 billion 
over the next seven years, more the double the $124 billion reduction proposed 
by the White House." But as he was saying this, viewers saw a graphic on screen 
with the same numbers, only under the headline "Proposed Medicare Cuts." 
Viewers presumably must have wondered if Medicare spending was being cut or 
merely slowed.
<P>
The most frequently mentioned number in network Medicare stories was $270 
billion -- the amount by which Republicans propose to slow the projected growth 
of Medicare. It was cited by ABC's Rebecca Chase and Bob Zelnick, CBS's Bob 
Orr, CNN's Jill Dougherty (twice), and NBC's Joe Johns (although Johns called 
it a cut, saying seniors were "angry over Republican plans to reduce Medicare 
spending $270 billion.").
<P>
According to ABC's Zelnick, for example: "Republicans want to cut $270 billion 
from projected cost increases during that time." These reports (except for 
Johns') were true, as far as they went. But they still gave the impression that 
reform meant fewer dollars for Medicare recipients. A clearer way of phrasing 
it would have been: "Republicans would allow the program to grow by $105 
billion over the next seven years instead of the projected $375 billion."
<P>
Only one reporter, CBS's Rita Braver, pointed out that spending per recipient 
would increase over the next seven years under the Republican plan. On the July 
25 CBS Evening News, after running soundbites from Democrat politicians calling 
on Republicans to keep their "greedy" hands off Medicare, Braver put things in 
perspective: "Republicans argue they don't want to cut Medicare, just control 
its growth, spending only $6,700 per capita instead of $8,000 per capita  in 
2002." A graphic on screen clearly showed that spending under the Republican 
plan would increase from $4,800 per recipient to $6,700 per recipient in 2002.
While reporters have improved the accuracy of their Medicare reform labels, 
there are still some of the same weaknesses in Medicare reports that 
MediaNomics identified three months ago. In soundbite selection, for example, 
reporters still overwhelming favor politicians over economists and others who 
could give non-political angles.
<P>
Twenty-five soundbites were from politicians (14 Democrats and 11 Republicans), 
as well as a story-length interview of former Republican Senator Warren Rudman 
by NBC's Brian Williams on the July 27 Nightly News. Only three soundbites, and 
no lengthy interviews, were from economists. And two of those were in one 
story, a July 27 Nightly News report by NBC's Lisa Myers.
<P>
And when it came to the views of ordinary Americans, most reporters seemed to 
agree with NBC's Brian Williams who claimed, on the July 29 Nightly News, that 
the elderly "would be most affected by GOP plans to fix the cost of Medicare." 
There were seven soundbites from elderly Americans who benefit from Medicare. 
There was only one soundbite -- again in Myers' July 27 story -- from someone 
younger who supports today's retirees while knowing they will get less support 
in their old age.
<P>
Only three of the 15 reports, in fact, covered more than the usual political 
angles of Medicare. One was Braver's July 25 CBS Evening News report mentioned 
earlier. She was the only reporter to point out just how much more will be 
spent per recipient under Republican plans. 
<P>
Another was a July 25 World News Tonight story by ABC's Rebecca Chase. She told 
viewers that "Medicare spending has gone from $7 billion [in 1970] to $159 
billion today." She added that "spending, now rising 10 percent a year, must be 
controlled, because in another 15 years the great wave of baby boomers, the 
largest generation ever, will be eligible for Medicare." No other reporter told 
of those numbers.
<P>
The most informative story was Myers' July 27 Nightly News report. She touched 
bases every other reporter missed, such as the fact that the average recipient 
will receive over $100,000 more in benefits than he or she paid in Medicare 
taxes and that the Johnson Administration was almost $100 billion short in its 
projection of what the cost would be in 1990. She also interviewed a Medicare 
expert, rather than just politicians, and a worker whose taxes support 
Medicare, rather than just elderly Medicare recipients.
<P>
But most of the network Medicare reporting, while improving, is still hamstrung 
by a narrow focus on the politics of the issue and an unwillingness to 
distinguish between a cut and slowed growth. If reporters want to help the 
public understand the continually explosive Medicare issue this fall, they will 
focus less on the politics of the issue and more on the numbers behind the 
crisis.

<CENTER><H3>Train Wreck or Fender Bender?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Washington is abuzz with talk of an impending budgetary "train wreck." To most 
Americans this conjures up the image of gruesome wreckage and bloody 
casualties. But the truth is that the budget train wreck should have little if 
any impact on the lives of ordinary Americans even if it forces a temporary 
shutdown of the federal government. The only forces that will collide in 
October will be the two competing philosophies of governance of a Democrat 
President and a Republican Congress. Reporters should, therefore, be careful 
about calling the impasse a crisis.
<P>
To be precise, there are actually two potential budget train wrecks ahead. The 
first would occur if President Clinton vetoes any or all of the 13 
congressional appropriations bills. If spending programs have not received an 
appropriation before the start of the fiscal year on  October 1, then no money 
can be spent on the programs. Only "essential" functions, such as defense, law 
enforcement, and air traffic control, would continue to operate.
The second train wreck would occur if President Clinton vetoed the debt 
extension bill. The current debt ceiling of $5 trillion is expected to be 
reached by late October. Mr. Clinton might veto an extension because 
Republicans plan to attach welfare reform, Medicare savings, and tax cuts to 
the debt ceiling. If the ceiling is not raised on time, then the federal 
government is legally prohibited from continuing to borrow. It can continue to 
spend the money that is collected in taxes, but it cannot borrow to send out 
Social Security checks, veterans benefits, payments to defense contractors, and 
so forth.
<P>
How should the press cover this melodrama? Some tips:
<P>
First, a budget train wreck would be neither disastrous nor unprecedented. 
Ronald Reagan closed down the government for a day on several occasions as a 
result of policy disputes with Congress. Then, the circumstances were reversed: 
Reagan vetoed congressional appropriations bills because they spent too much, 
not too little. Moreover, even if the impasse between Congress and the White 
House lasted for several or even many more days, since essential government 
services would continue, only nonurgent federal spending would be halted. 
Surely few would be hurt if Head Start funding or NEA grants were discontinued 
for a few days.
<P>
Second, White House claims that the GOP budget includes deep, mean-spirited 
cuts should be greeted with skepticism. The GOP budget would allow federal 
spending to climb by $350 billion over the next seven years. The President 
wants to spend an extra $600 billion over this same period. Like the dispute 
over school lunch programs earlier this year, the debate is really about how 
much more should be spent on social programs.
<P>
Third, the charge that the GOP plan includes substantial tax cuts for the rich 
lacks factual support. Of the $250 billion tax cut package that will soon be 
agreed to by the House and Senate, the vast majority of the benefits accrue to 
working class Americans with children. The middle-class child tax credit is 
about four times as expensive as the capital gains tax cut. And this child 
credit is very similar to the middle-class tax cut Bill Clinton promised in 
1992. The official Joint Tax Committee finds that the House GOP tax package 
provides the largest percentage reduction in taxes to Americans with incomes 
between $30,000 and $75,000.
<P>
Fourth, the President may not be altogether hostile to the idea of a short-term 
shutdown of the government. During some past shutdowns of the federal 
government, few Americans even noticed. A several-day closure of non-essential 
federal activities may not be the doomsday scenario outside of Washington that 
it is perceived to be inside the beltway. This train wreck may have no 
casualties.
<P>
Fifth, the underlying policy disagreement between the President and Congress is 
whether there should be a balanced budget by 2002. The core dispute between the 
Congress and the President is not over tax cuts, Medicare savings, or welfare 
reform. The fundamental disagreement is whether the nation should be set on a 
course toward a balanced budget.
<P>
The budgetary showdown will, of course, be big news. But reporters should 
refrain from calling a temporary shutdown of the government a crisis when most 
Americans' lives will be changed very little. If reporters cry wolf too often, 
people may stop listening.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
Small, ugly Ferengi represent sci-fi series' vision of business owners
Many observers have noted the exceptional nature of the Star Trek shows. 
According to TV Guide, for instance: "The Star Trek series and films can, in 
theory, foster deeper understanding and better communication among people. But 
do they?" When it comes to race relations, the value of friendship, and the 
virtue of loyalty, the Star Trek shows do. But when it comes to business, 
economics, and the profit motive, they do not.
<P>
The only regular characters on the Star Trek shows who engage in commerce are 
the Ferengi. They are a small, ugly species. They care only about profit and 
seem to think that the best way to earn a profit is to cheat and trick 
customers, even each other. They are disdained by nearly every other species, 
which, it is made clear, have evolved beyond the profit motive.
<P>
The Ferengi have the highest profile role on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the 
third incarnation of the Star Trek series. Almost all of the show's non-Ferengi 
regular characters promote virtue and bring honor to their jobs. They lead 
admirable lives. Viewers, last season, saw the stoic Commander Sisko devote his 
life to his son and his crew. They saw Major Kira, a former terrorist, become a 
trusted crew member.
<P>
Odo, a Changeling (one who can change form at will) and the space station's 
head of security, defies his own aggressive species when they threaten his 
friends on the station. Viewers learn that Doctor Bashir chose medicine as a 
profession because it would allow him "to help people." Lieutenant Dax, Sisko's 
confidant, is reliable and wise. And Chief O'Brien puts the happiness of his 
wife, a botanist turned teacher, above his own happiness.
<P>
But then there's Quark, a Ferengi business owner on the space station. Quark 
runs a bar and gambling casino. He puts nothing ahead of profit, except perhaps 
saving his own skin. For instance, on the October 1, 1994 episode, Sisko is 
assigned to establish relations with a relatively unknown species. He wants 
Quark to go along on the dangerous mission because the Ferengi have done 
business with the species. Quark is reluctant and recommends sending his 
brother, Ram, instead. "Ram only has a son to think about. I have a business," 
Quark pleads.
<P>
On the October 15, 1994 episode, a Klingon is accidentally killed in Quark's 
bar. The bar had been doing poorly, but the killing attracts the morbid 
curiosity of onlookers. Quark, to keep their interest, concocts an elaborate 
story about how he killed the Klingon. Business booms, but Ram is worried about 
his brother's ploy. Quark remains steadfast: "Look at that crowd. How long has 
it been since you've seen that many customers waiting to get in here? This is 
an opportunity to turn everything around."
<P>
On the May 20, 1995 episode, Quark visits the Ferengi home planet and viewers 
learn that Ferengi women are not allowed to wear clothes, address men they do 
not know, and, most of all, earn a profit. Quark's mother is accused of all 
three and Quark is held responsible. The clear message: Everything about the 
Ferengi, including the pursuit of profit, is antediluvian. In the same episode, 
one of Quark's relatives decides to join Star Fleet. Quark is livid: "He's a 
disgrace to this family and to Ferengi everywhere. He should be here, helping 
us earn a profit, not in his room learning how to be more like a human."
<P>
On the February 25 episode, the Grand Nagus, who is the leader of the Ferengi 
people, is abducted and brainwashed by aliens. When he returns he seeks to 
reform the Ferengi way of life, to make Ferengi less interested in profit. 
Quark confronts the aliens, who explain their disgust of profit: "We found the 
concept aggressive, adversarial, dangerous. We could not comprehend how any 
species could lead such a barren existence."
<P>
Quark then threatens that if the aliens don't restore the Grand Nagus to his 
former self, more Ferengi would come and bother them. Only then do they agree 
to restore the Nagus. From what viewers see of the Ferengi, who could blame 
them?
<P>
Such depictions of the Ferengi are typical, and there are no positive business 
characters balancing such portrayals. On Star Trek, viewers see people of 
different races, even different species, working together for a common cause 
and putting others ahead of themselves. Unfortunately, business isn't part of 
this vision; rather it's seen as fit only for a small, ugly, less-than-evolved 
subspecies.

<center><h2>Reporters Say American Dream
Stolen</h2>
</center>
<p>
&quot;America: Who Stole the Dream?&quot; was the provocative
title of a recent tenpart Philadelphia Inquirer series, published
nationally in KnightRidder newspapers, by PulitzerPrize winning
journalists Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele. Their answer
to the series' title question: freemarket proponents and foreigners.
But in their lengthy series they didn't mention some important
facts that critics have since pointed out.
<P>
Free trade was one of
Barlett and Steele's main villains. Instead of creating jobs in
export industries, low American tariffs have &quot;wiped out jobs
and driven down wages.&quot; Barlett and Steele lamented that
in 1996, &quot;the United States will record its 21st consecutive
merchandise trade deficit  a record unmatched by any other developed
country.&quot; America's other big economic problem, according
to Barlett and Steele, is immigration to the U.S. &quot;No other
industrial country has allowed in so many workers in so short
a time, depressing wages and living standards.&quot;
<P>
While these
policies are good for big business in the short term, the two
reporters suggest that American workers may be on the verge of
starting a revolution. They quoted a Kansas factory worker as
saying: &quot;Are we just going to keep lowering our standard
of living? When that happens, nobody is going to have money to
put food on the table. Then you are going to see a revolution,
because people are not going to be able to feed their families.&quot;
A Pennsylvania factory worker told the duo that &quot;there's
going to be bloodshed before we get out of this.&quot; These workers,
Barlett and Steele informed readers, &quot;reflect a largely silent
but growing sentiment&quot; in the U.S. Profiles of people with
such sentiments dominated the series. The two reporters proposed
restricting immigration and hiking tariffs.
<P>
The reaction to the
series was quick and severe. Economics columnist Robert Samuelson
called it &quot;junk journalism&quot; in a September 18 Washington
Post column. &quot;What [the series] doesn't say is that the trade
balance and employment are hardly connected,&quot; he wrote. Samuelson
pointed out that the trade surpluses of Germany, the Netherlands,
and Sweden  which Barlett and Steele envy  haven't kept those
countries from having far higher unemployment rates than the United
States. According to Samuelson, Barlett and Steele reported such
matters &quot;so select ively...that ordinary readers are misled.&quot;
<P>
The reporters' selective use of anecdotes and statistics bothered
George Washington University's Steve Suranovic. In a September
25 letter to the Inquirer, Suranovic wrote that it is easy for
reporters &quot;to choose individuals whose stories confirm their
conclusions.&quot; He argued that Barlett and Steele could have
&quot;found workers with new jobs in export industries earning
higherthanaverage wages&quot; and &quot;profiled  a couple of
millionaires with middleclass backgrounds who created export industries
employing thousands of workers. Bill Gates springs to mind.&quot;
<P>
The Cato Institute's Stuart Anderson argued that Barlett and Steele
misled readers about the economic effects of immigration. In an
October 14 Investor's Business Daily editorial, Anderson pointed
out that having more people in the U.S. does not lead to more
unemployment. The reason: &quot;While immigrants do increase the
supply of labor, they also increase the demand for labor.&quot;
His proof: As immigration and trade deficits have increased over
the past 20 years, and total employment has increased 59 percent,
&quot;the unemployment rate has dropped from 7.7 percent to 5.2
percent.&quot; According to Anderson, &quot;Even the total number
of unemployed people in the country has dropped.&quot;
<P>
The views
of Samuelson, Suranovic, and Anderson are held by enough economists
that they should be discussed in any major, tenpart economic series
that purports to be serious journalism.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Global Economy As a News Story,
1991-1992 vs. 1995-1996</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Deficit in Trade Reporting</h2>
</center>
<p>
International trade has almost ceased to be an issue to report on for the network
news media. This is in stark contrast to 1991 and 1992, when the
media reported heavily on trade as an electionyear issue. As a
result, the trade deficit  though large  is not nearly the negative
story (except in KnightRidder papers, see page one) for President
Clinton that it was for President Bush. Media Research Center (MRC)
analysts reviewed all of the stories about foreign trade on ABC's
World News Tonight, CBS <I>Evening News</I> and NBC <I>Nightly News</I> between
July 1, 1991 and June 30, 1992. There were 134 trade stories during
this period. MRC analysts also reviewed all of the stories about
foreign trade on the same shows between July 1, 1995 and June
30, 1996. There were only 39 trade stories during this period.
<P>
There was also a large difference in the tone of the stories. During
the 1991-1992 study period, many stories focused on how trade,
especially with Japan, was harming America. Trade was like war.
According to NBC's Garrick Utley, on the January 12, 1992 Nightly
News, there is a &quot;new superpower rivalry. We, of course,
won the old one with the Soviet Union. The outcome of the new
one with Japan is much less certain.&quot; Stories focused on
union demands for tariffs and the views of protectionist economists.
<P>
Reporters adopted a different attitude during the 1995-1996 study period.
Spurred by Pat Buchanan's criticism of free trade, the networks
began pointing out the benefits of a global economy. Before the
South Carolina primary, NBC's Mike Boettcher contrasted the &quot;new
South, flush with foreign investment and hightech jobs&quot; with
&quot;the old South, shuttered textile mills, unemployment, and
pleas for protection from foreign competitors.&quot; ABC's Aaron
Brown reported that &quot;while Buchanan says you can protect
industries with high tariffs without driving out foreign companies
here, economists say that is nonsense.&quot;
<P>
There was also a dramatic change in the amount of coverage given to the trade deficit. In
a 1988 study for the Media Institute, Virginia Commonwealth University's
Ted J. Smith III found that as the American economy improved during
the 1980s, reporting on the economy decreased in volume and became
more negative in tone. In particular, he found that the media
became more interested in one statistic  the trade deficit  when
it widened and less interested in other indicators as they improved.
<P>
The trend in trade reporting that Professor Smith found during the
1980s was present during the 1991-1992 study period, when the U.S.
economy was coming out of recession. There were 21 reports about
the trade deficit, about the same number he found when the economy
was coming out of recession from 1982-1983. But during the 1995-1996
study period, when the economy was fully out of recession and
the trade deficit was expanding, there were only eight such reports.
During the Reagan era, when the economy was fully out of recession,
trade deficit reporting increased dramatically.
<P>
During 1991-1992, even decreases in the trade deficit were treated skeptically.
&quot;Some mixed signs on the U.S. economy today,&quot; reported
ABC's Forest Sawyer, on the March 19, 1992 World News Tonight.
&quot;The U.S. trade deficit grew smaller in January, down $5.8
billion. Still, many economists say they are concerned that American
exports were also down.&quot; 
<P>
Trade deficits, though, have not been big news more recently. In two instances, only CBS mentioned reports of widening trade gaps. On July 18, 1995, Dan Rather announced:
&quot;The United States has taken another beating in world trade,
posting a recordhigh deficit in May.&quot; Nearly two months later,
on September 12, 1995, Rather used almost identical language:
&quot;The U.S. took a beating in the world markets for the second
quarter of the year, posting the biggest quarterly trade deficit
ever.&quot; ABC and NBC ignored the news.
<P>
Trade deficits may not be such bad news. Many economists point out that prosperous countries often run trade deficits because they have a lot of money to spend,
and that imports constitute a great benefit to an economy. So
perhaps ABC and NBC were correct to play down the trade numbers.
Still, this was a new standard not applied to GOP presidents.
<P>
And trade in general could be a bigger news issue in this election
year than it has been. Will Bill Clinton, if reelected, again
defy union backers and work to expand the North American Free
Trade Agreement? Reporters, who seem to have lost interest in
trade, aren't asking.

<Title> Review: Lifetime'sTraders</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>New Business Show Better Than Most</h2>
</center>
<p>
This is the battleground of the modern world, where war is waged daily. Fortunes are made
or lost in seconds. These are the men and women of Gardner/Ross.
They're brilliant, ruthless, only as good as their next deal...They
work hard and play harder and agree on just one thing  winning
is everything.&quot;
<p>
From this promo for Traders, a Canadian program
now being shown on cable's Lifetime network, one would think that
it would be another typical TV caricature of business: A world
dominated by rogue greedheads who have no redeeming qualities
and whose work does nothing beneficial for society.
<p>
While this
tendency is present in the show, it doesn't always dominate. Traders
instead treats investment banking the way television usually treats
some other vocations, which is a step above the way business is
normally portrayed. Traders focuses on the Torontobased investment
firm Gardner/Ross. The plots center on the firm's senior executives:
<p>
<blockquote>
Sally Ross -- An idealistic economics professor, Ross steps into her father's
role as senior partner when he is arrested for illegally skimming
$5 million off of a $47 million deal. She is immediately at odds
with the firm's other senior executives, who want to make money
at all costs. She wants to make money, but also wants to preserve
her family firm's good name. When she doesn't allow the firm's
head trader to trade on inside information, he yells: &quot;You
know, you've got a really unhealthy sense of morality.&quot;
<p>
Adam Cunningham -- Ross's alter ego, Cunningham is willing to blackmail
government officials to land a deal. He has no conscience, but
a great knack for cliches: Investment banking is a &quot;zerosum
game. Nobody wins unless somebody loses&quot; and &quot;We all
know the game. You buy on rumor, you sell on fact. Look, if enough
people believe that fertilizer is worth more than gold, the next
thing you know crap is selling at $600 an ounce.&quot; When the
Russian mob threatens the family of the editor of the firm's newsletter,
Cunningham worries that the editor will care more about her family
than the firm.
<p>
Jack Larkin -- A very hungry young trader, he makes
his way to Gardner/Ross by landing a seatofthepants mining deal.
He's willing to risk everything for a big deal, but he's no Cunningham.
He cares deeply about mending his poor relationship with his father,
and his father's illness occupies as much of his time as does
the firm's business. It also gives him some perspective. When
a young trader almost ruins her career by not placing an order
out of concern for a client who is a compulsive gambler, Larkin
tells her: &quot;I'll deny I ever said this, but it's just a job;
it's just money.&quot; By steering the firm into investing in
an emerging medical drug, Larkin shows viewers that investment
banking can help society.
<p>
Marty Stephens -- The firm's head trader,
Stephens is a younger Cunningham. When the firm's building catches
fire, he threatens to fire any trader who leaves the floor. Is
extensive flooding in South Africa bad news? Not for Stephens,
because the firm will make money from the flood's effect on the
markets. His family life is a mess: He doesn't know the name of
his son's girlfriend, even though she eats dinner with the family
every week. When Stephens is suspended for 30 days because of
unethical trades, his life seems to change. He finds a support
group and learns that he is obsessed with money to compensate
for his own insecurities. He resolves to change his ways, but
once he's back on the floor the old Marty returns.
<p>
Suzanna Marks -- Marks runs the firm's investment newsletter. She becomes the
target of the Russian mob, which wants her to recommend a stock
she doesn't want to recommend. She stands on principle, refusing
to compromise her integrity. The Russians then threaten her family,
including her young daughter. Though terribly tempted, she still
doesn't cave. The situation is resolved when Larkin, whom viewers
learn has some mysterious tie to the Russian mob, finds out about
the threats and intervenes. The stress, though, ruins her family
life. Her husband, believing she places too great a priority on
work, files for divorce and custody of their daughter. 
<p>
Traders has often been compared to ER, but it is more like L.A. Law. On
ER, there is no question that the doctors are engaged in noble
work. On L.A. Law, sometimes the lawyers helped people and society;
sometimes they harmed people and society. Some of L.A. Law's lawyers
were extremely unethical, some morally upright. Traders' traders
are a similar mix. For business, as portrayed on television, this
is a step up in the world.

<title>Guest Editorial, by Stephen Gold</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Media
Tweak Tax Facts</h2>
</center>
<p>
Many journalists swarmed like hornets after the
first presidential debate, their stingers aimed at a Bob Dole
soundbite statistic. Maybe the numbers seemed implausible to them.
Maybe they deemed Dole's private source for the statistic less
reliable than comparable government sources. Or, just maybe, they
were simply expressing their kneejerk bias against conservative
economic principles.
<p>
Whatever the reason, the day after the first
debate, several media outlets challenged Dole's Tax Foundation inspired
statement  that the average American household today pays more
in taxes than it does for food, clothing, and housing combined.
<p>
In a frontpage story, for example, the Los Angeles Times hinted at
a Dole blunder. The article related that while Dole relied on
a conservative think tank for his data, &quot;the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' consumer expenditure survey found that the average
household spent more than twice as much on food, clothing and
shelter as on taxes in 1994.&quot; Eric Engberg of CBS News was
more forthright in his analysis. Asserting that &quot;some [of
Dole's] facts got mangled,&quot; Engberg stated the GOP nominee's
claim was an &quot;exaggeration&quot; that could be disproved
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) study.
<p>
Ironically, while these and other news organizations used the opportunity to show
how Dole, in the words of the Times, was &quot;tweaking&quot;
the truth to his advantage, it appears the media were doing the
same thing. By accepting the BLS data as unimpeachable, the reporters
made an error of such magnitude that, if committed by either of
the presidential candidates, it would have made frontpage news
nationwide.
<p>
The problem is the BLS survey greatly understates taxes
paid. While the national survey is considered an accurate portrayal
of consumer expenditures, in the tax category the report only
covers individual income taxes (federal, state, and local), real
and personal property taxes, and an amorphous category called
&quot;other taxes.&quot;
<p>
Among the most recognizable omissions
from the survey: Social Security taxes paid. While the BLS survey
doesn't have a category for such payments, the Tax Foundation
estimates that the average household will pay about $1,100 for
the employee's share of payroll taxes alone this year. Similarly,
the BLS survey doesn't specifically report sales and excise taxes
paid. In the only entry in the survey in which these taxes might
fit (&quot;other taxes&quot;), households earning between $50,000
and $69,000 are said to pay $77 annually. By comparison, based
on Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data, the Tax Foundation
estimates that households in that income group average over $2,000
in federal, state, and local sales and excise taxes paid.
<p>
Also,
the BLS survey results altogether ignore the effect of indirect
levies, such as business taxes, on American society. Unlike the
survey, the Tax Foundation incorporates all taxes at all levels
of government in its annual analysis, including those levies hidden
from taxpayers. For example, business taxes (including corporate
income taxes) must be borne by the general population somehow,
whether through lower wages for workers, lower shareholder dividends
(which harms anyone with a pension fund), or higher consumer prices.
So, while the typical American won't ever see a tax bill for these
taxes, they're certainly paid by everyone.
<p>
In total, the BLS survey
 relied on by so many reporters to knock Bob Dole's argument for
lower taxes  understates total taxes paid by more than four times,
according to the Tax Foundation's analysis based on BEA data.
<p>
The
flaw here isn't the BLS survey. It lies in the way the survey's
results were used by reporters. The search for truth by the media
is undeniably critical, especially during an election year. Unfortunately,
the public is hurt when reporters, to prove a point, choose to
accept certain economic premises without verifying their legitimacy.

<title>Reporters Ignore Education Inflation</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Reporters Ignore Education Inflation</center></h2>
<p>
With Congress trying to scale back the Clinton Administration's direct lending program for college students, the media have focused on partisan bickering over the issue. This has obscured the larger question: Why are tuitions rising so fast in the first place?
<p>
On the September 10 World News Tonight ABC's Michele Norris said, "The battle over federal funding for education is turning into an all-out political war. Republican lawmakers are proposing deep cuts in education. President Clinton has said that one of his top priorities is not only maintaining but increasing education spending, particularly for needy college students."
<p>
This politics-centered coverage continued with Rita Braver's report on the September 11 CBS Evening News: "President Clinton took his education crusade to Southern Illinois....He told college students that Republicans in Congress are trying to cut their financial assistance." Braver's story, like Norris's, was relatively balanced; Braver noted "Republicans suggest the President is perpetrating a big lie on campus, engaging in scare tactics to make families believe that student aid is in jeopardy." 
<p>
But neither report took the opportunity to discuss why college costs have risen and how growing federal education spending may be the culprit. Heritage Foundation scholar John Hood points this out in the May issue of Reason: "College administrators, waxing sympathetic, beg for more aid from Congress and state legislatures. Interestingly, those same administrators, along with policy makers and the media, rarely try to explain why college costs are rising." 
<p>
Hood points out that average tuitions rose by a third between 1984 and 1994 because "governments, both federal and state, subsidize colleges and universities -- even private ones -- so heavily that tuition and fees have only the murkiest relationship to the costs of providing higher education."
<p>
Hood shows that the recent rise in federal spending on higher education closely corresponds with the hike in tuition: "During the 1970s, the real-dollar value of government assistance to higher education, adjusted for the number of full-time students, fell slightly. So did real tuition, room, and board charges for both public and private colleges."
<p>
"Throughout the 1980s, however, government assistance per full-time student rose significantly (10 percent, not including loans), accompanied by a 27 percent real rise in public college charges and a staggering 50 percent real rise in private college charges. College and University revenue from Pell Grants rose by more than 25 percent from 1985-86 to 1991-92; revenue from state-level need-based grants rose by about 15 percent."
<p>
If prices in private industry ever rose so fast, reporters would be quick to ask why. They should hold educators to the same standard.

<title>Easy on the Earned Income Tax Credit</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Easy on the Earned Income Tax Credit</h2><center>

The October 2 Newsweek hailed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) as a boon to 
the working poor and called Congressional efforts to cut the program "the war 
on work." But Newsweek didn't tell readers about evidence that the EITC 
actually discourages work by creating a huge marginal tax rate on the poor.
<p>
According to Newsweek's Marc Levinson, the program, which provides a tax credit 
to low-income workers and cash to those who don't pay taxes, "hits the 
bulls-eye, aiding families who earn too much for welfare but too little to have 
a tax-favored mortgage." Levinson quoted EITC beneficiary Janene Moore as 
saying: "My kids are not welfare statistics....They can say that their momma 
gets a check all right, but it's from her job, seven hours a day, 35 hours a 
week." Levinson also argued that the EITC "does nothing to discourage marriage" 
and cited fraud as the only argument against cutting the credit.
<p>
But what if the EITC actually discourages work? According to the September 20 
Investor's Business Daily (IBD), "Most economists agree that today it's doing 
more harm than good." According to IBD: "Once the family reaches that limit 
[$11,600], the credit is phased out. For each dollar over $11,600, the family 
loses 21 cents of its EITC until its income hits $28,000. Economists say this 
acts like a marginal tax rate of 21 percent," which "provides a strong 
disincentive to work."
<p>
IBD also cited American Enterprise Institute economist Marvin Kosters who 
points out that even having an EITC may discourage work. "After all, 
[recipients] get a 40 percent raise without working any harder." Kosters also 
claims that the EITC does indeed exact a marriage penalty, in some cases as 
much as $5,000 per couple. According to Kosters, That "would be about 25 
percent of the combined income of the married couple."
<p>
It's not enough for reporters to cite fraud as an argument against the EITC. 
Economists have serious concerns about the program's disincentives to work, 
concerns which must be addressed in a balanced story.

<title>Inequality Study Left Unchallenged by MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</title>

<center><h2>Inequality Study Left Unchallenged by MacNeil-Lehrer 
NewsHour</center></h2>
Something unusual happened on September 28. The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, 
normally well known for balanced and fair coverage, gave a one-sided account of 
an important issue. David Gergen, now returned from his role as White House 
adviser, conducted a softball interview of economist Edward Wolff about wealth 
inequality which ignored many flaws in Wolff's analysis.
<p>
Gergen didn't challenge Wolff, author of a recent study on the subject for the 
20th Century Fund, when he claimed that "income of the average family has been 
basically stagnant for the last fifteen, twenty years, and has actually started 
to decline during the 1990s." Wolff said he saw "nothing that suggests that 
these forces are going to abate." Moreover, he blamed the stock market as 
"another factor which has caused wealth and inequality to rise."
<p>
Gergen could have asked Wolff to respond to critics of his study. Christopher 
Farrell reports in the October 9 Business Week what many economists have long 
maintained: "The consumer price index has been overstating inflation by at 
least a percentage point. If that's the case, then real wage gains are 0.8 
percent a year," rather than the 0.2 percent decline reported by government 
statistics. Farrell also reports that "the skill level of American labor is 
improving, with more workers getting the education and training employers 
require" and that in the past, that has produced more equal income 
distribution.
<p>
The August 22 Investor's Business Daily (IBD), meanwhile, points out a major 
flaw in Wolff's study. "Pensions account for about one-third of the average 
household's assets," the newspaper reports, and are "the way most Americans are 
invested in the stock market." But Wolff's study, according to IBD, excludes 
the value of pension plans. (See page 5.)
<p>
Instead of pushing his guest to answer these criticisms, Gergen asked softball 
questions like, "I take it from the tenor of your remarks, as well as your 
study, that you think this growing inequality as you found it is dangerous 
socially for the country?" Viewers have come to expect more from the 
MacNeil/Lehrer News-Hour.

<title>Missing Japan's Revolutionary Debate</title>
</head>

<center><h2>Missing Japan's Revolutionary Debate</h2></center>

Network news coverage of Japan has changed recently. When Japan seemed 
invincible, network journalists would often report on Japanese industrial 
policy with the underlying premise that it made Japanese capitalism superior to 
American capitalism. Now, with Japan's economy in a prolonged tailspin, the 
networks have dropped the subject, no longer showing any interest in the 
economic effects of Japanese industrial policy.
<p>
Ned Potter's December 15, 1992 ode to Japan's government planners for ABC's 
World News Tonight was typical of a pre-1995 network story on Japan. Potter 
told viewers that environmental protection would be the biggest new industry of 
the future. He said that while the U.S. was leading the world in environmental 
cleanup technology, "Japan is mounting a major offensive to be the new leaders 
in what they call the eco-industrial revolution."
<p>
Potter glowingly described "Genesis," the Japanese plan to direct companies to 
work on such projects as technology for clean coal and oil plants. The moral of 
Potter's story: Genesis "shows how far ahead the Japanese are looking. And 
that's the challenge for America. With the new Administration seeking an 
economic revival, how can it best help U.S. industry compete with Japan for the 
environmental marketplace?"
<p>
That was 1992. Reporters, understandably, no longer use Japan as a model of 
government economic planning. But they also aren't talking about Japanese 
industrial policy at all anymore, even though in Japan, the role of government 
is the subject of fierce debate. U.S. News & World Report's Stephen Butler 
relates that "a fast-selling, controversial new book that has unleashed a 
torrent of debate in Tokyo suggests Japan must do more than throw money at its 
problems."
<p>
According to Butler, Japanese author Yukio Noguchi argues that Japan's economic 
woes "are a painful legacy of World War II, when the government intervened 
heavily in the private economy and suppressed market forces to boost industrial 
output." But despite this "torrent of debate" about Noguchi's book, no network 
report from Japan has mentioned Noguchi or his free market arguments.
Network reporters should be more curious about the roots of Japan's four-year 
economic stagnation. If they are, they will find and report on a robust debate 
in Japan about the role of government in a free economy.

<center><h2>Editor's Note, by Burton Yale Pines</h2></center>
<center><h3>Post: Low Pay Not a Dead End </h3></center>

A nation of hamburger flippers in dead-end jobs.
<p>
That's almost always the dire outcome predicted by journalists when they cover 
America's fast-food industry. Such reporting, intended or not, tends to confirm 
and bolster the calls by politicians and academics for ambitious federal 
job-training programs and other measures that they claim are needed to lift 
unskilled Americans out of the minimum-wage trough.
<p>
Such reporting, sadly, misses one of America's major economics and business 
stories: The fast-food industry as the nation's most effective job-training 
program. 
<p>
One reporter, however, obviously has not missed the story. He's the Washington 
Post's Peter Behr who, in a September 11 page one article, profiles Le-Van 
Hawkins, a 35-year-old African-American Horatio Alger who now owns a $39 
million-a year business and who got his start where? At hamburger-flipping 
McDonald's. Throughout his perceptive report, Behr uses Hawkins' own successes 
to make the valid but almost always ignored point that fast-food jobs can be a 
great career beginning rather than a dead end.
<p> 
Behr explains how Hawkins, a high school dropout who had "a serious cocaine 
habit" and grew up in Chicago's notorious Cabrini Green housing project, was 
taught discipline and skills by his fast-food employers. At his first 
McDonald's job, writes Behr, Hawkins "became a walking encyclopedia on 
McDonald's procedures for dealing with burgers, pickles and fries. The lesson 
of getting the details right struck." These lessons were reinforced by 
subsequent jobs at Kentucky Fried Chicken and other fast-food outlets.
<p>
Citing an executive with Hawkins' firm, Behr tells his readers that there is "a 
career ladder inside the fast-food world, even if the bottom rungs don't reach 
very high. Workers who start out preparing food can advance to production 
leader, hourly shift manager and assistant manager." Some of the Hawkins' store 
managers, reports Behr, "earn up to $50,000 annually and will have the option 
to buy stock in the company."
<p>
Behr too notes the broader economic implications of the fast-food industry. He 
writes: "Fast-food franchises have long been islands of commerce in the often 
depressed sections of major cities." These typically inner-city franchises, 
says Behr, then "provide business for attorneys, accountants and suppliers in 
the community."
<p>
Behr's report is a needed antidote to journalists' prevailing low-view of 
low-paying jobs. Characteristic of this is Time's John Greenwald in the 
magazine's November 14, 1994 edition. Writing about high-salaried computer 
jobs, Greenwald remarked that they "bear little resemblance to the low-paying 
gas-pumping and fast food-making positions that the word 'services' has often 
brought to mind." This echoed Beth Belton's USA Today article of February 15, 
1994, talking about "low-paying jobs with few opportunities for advancement." 
TV viewers, meanwhile, would have heard ABC's Bob Jamieson, on the March 15, 
1994 World News Tonight, refer derisively to what he called "the low-paying 
service sector."
<p>
These and other journalists should study closely Behr's article. They then 
should investigate how poorly-educated Americans actually can learn job skills 
and work discipline. Their resulting articles could address the questions: What 
trains more workers -- government programs or fast food employers? Who does a 
better job of training? How long do most fast-food workers actually remain at 
the lowest-paying level? Such articles, at last, would begin educating the 
public that hamburger-flipping seldom is a dead-end job.

<title>&quot;MEDIA REALITY CHECK '96&quot;</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote>
<center><img src="/mrc/images/checkbox.gif" <br>
<p></center>

A WORD FROM L. BRENT BOZELL III<br>
CHAIRMAN, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER<br>
JUNE 1996<p>

CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg said it best: &quot;The old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true it's hardly worth discussing any more.&quot; From Walter Cronkite to Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas, more and more media personalities are admitting the liberal bias they denied for so long, while ridiculing conservatives who raised that charge. 
<p>
The recent Freedom Forum poll of Washington reporters and editors found 89 percent of them voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, to only seven percent for Bush; 61 percent identified themselves as liberal or moderate-to-liberal, to only nine percent who were conservative or moderate-to conservative; 59 percent called the Contract with America &quot;an election-year campaign ploy,&quot; to only three percent who thought it was
&quot;a serious policy proposal.&quot; 
<p>
And their coverage of public policy and politics reflected these views. We are not here today to prove a blatantly obvious anti-conservative bias in the press. We have proven that for almost a decade. We are here to demand an end to the non-stop media onslaught against the conservative movement -- against our ideas, our character, and our leaders. We are here to demand the media be fair and balanced -- for once. 
<p>
To this end, I announce &quot;Media Reality Check '96,&quot; a 2.8 million dollar campaign by the Media Research Center to expose for the American electorate the
blatant left-wing agenda that has made a mockery of the term &quot;objective journalism.&quot; The message from the conservative movement, like the line from the movie &quot;Network,&quot; is loud and clear: &quot;We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more.&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; will combine the most sophisticated media research operation with the most advanced technology to produce what we believe the most comprehensive and creative national campaign ever waged to confront, expose, and neutralize the liberal bias that dominates the news media today. 
<p>
Knowing how so many establishment media outlets feel it is their right to examine everything and everyone under the sun, while refusing to allow any criticism of themselves, this year we are bypassing the establishment media and going straight to the voters through the fledgling conservative media. And based on the test-marketing of this campaign over the past month, I can confidently state that our message will reach,
on average, at least 50,000 conservative activists and 25 million voters every week. As well, all of our findings will be made available to thousands of journalists on a regular basis to let them know their days of journalistic political activism are over.
<p>
&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; will have nine major components: <br>
<ol>
<li>Research. The basis of all our products is research by our eight-member media analysis team, who are taping and analyzing every single network newscast, national
newspaper and news magazine to document trends of liberal bias. Our comprehensive network news tracking system will not only document bias in 1996, but show, with scientific data, just how this follows the pro-Clinton, anti-conservative coverage in 1992.

<li>Publications. All of the MRC's monthly and bi-weekly publications -- MediaWatch, MediaNomics, Notable Quotables, and Flash -- will focus almost exclusively on the issues and trends of campaign '96 for thousands of reporters, subscribers, and activists.

<li>Pattern of Deception. MRC Senior Analyst Tim Graham's new book documents the astonishing bias Bill Clinton has benefited from in the last four years and sets the stage for a national discussion of the media's obvious preference for this President. In less than six weeks, he has conducted interviews or had his blockbuster book cited on over 50 radio shows, from local shows to nationally syndicated programs like the G. Gordon
Liddy show, the Ollie North show, and Rush Limbaugh. 

<li>Talk Radio. Over the past several months we have established an informal network of over 100 radio talk shows -- including every major nationally-syndicated show -- to provide them with up-to-the-minute evidence of left-wing bias in the establishment press masquerading as &quot;objective news.&quot; As well, MRC spokesmen are now conducting daily interviews on numerous shows coast to coast to expose the liberal media.

<li>The Internet. Using the Internet, the MRC will be communicating with hundreds of thousands of conservative activists while providing immediate intelligence to the conservative media. The MRC website will be up and running on June 24 for public
and media use during the 1996 campaign, with a full slate of studies, profiles, and special reports. MRC Executive Director Brent Baker is providing &quot;Reality Check Cyber Alerts&quot; through e-mail to the nation's most influential opinion leaders three to five
nights a week for a rapid response to media bias.

<li>Media Outreach. Two-page &quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; rebuttals are being sent via &quot;blast fax&quot; to over 1500 media and political contacts across the country on a regular basis. In addition, bias during major campaign events -- such as the upcoming conventions -- will be addressed with news releases and news conferences throughout the year.

<li>Conventions. Once again this year, the MRC will publish a daily newsletter during the two party conventions to document the ongoing political slant in prime-time convention
coverage. This year, the MRC is also considering a daily national radio feed to provide evidence of reporters' biased coverage. This daily commentary will reach tens of millions of voters.

<li>Conservative Grass-Roots Activism. To make the so-called objective national media an issue in this campaign, the MRC is mass-producing thousands of bumper stickers,
pens, refrigerator magnets and other novelty items with the tag line &quot;I Don't Believe the Liberal News Media.&quot; The national distribution efforts are already under way. MRC members -- 75,000 nationwide -- will also participate through letter-writing  campaigns and other efforts to expose and confront liberal bias at the local level.

<li>Paid Advertising. The MRC will be advancing its efforts through a paid advertising campaign. Conservative newspapers, magazines, and radio talk shows will be the vehicle of choice for our paid advertising efforts; again, based on the test-marketing of this communications strategy, we are confident it will have a huge impact.
</ol>
Will the national media try again to tilt the election in favor of Bill Clinton? Will they try again consistently to label the Republicans as &quot;extremists&quot; -- or worse -- and the Democrats as moderates, even conservatives?<br>
Will they regularly denounce Republican ads as &quot;wrong&quot; when they were proven right, while ignoring Clinton ads altogether?<br>
Will they try again to single out the Republicans as mudslinging campaigners while presenting the Democrats as a hopeful force for positive change? If so, the MRC will be there to show America just how distorted the message really is. 
<p>
By no means do we suggest that all reporters in the national press are culpable. Many have distinguished themselves, and continue to distinguish themselves with their dedication to balance and fairness. And that's all we conservative ask. But this year we demand it.

<img src="/mrc/images/pattern.gif" align="right">The explosive new book <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> assembles a mountain of evidence proving how the liberal media, especially the television networks, have promoted the Clinton agenda, both during his campaign and his presidency.<p>

You'll learn:

<ul>
<li> Which TV producer bragged about setting up Clinton's campaign public relations while working for ABC.

<li> How the media campaigned to discredit Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, and Troopergate.

<li> How Clinton lied about being drafted -- and how the networks virtually spiked it.

<li> Which <i>Time</i> editor misled readers about Clinton being drafted -- and eventually landed the # 2 job in the State Department.

<li> Which <i>Washington Post</i> reporter compared Clinton to Jesus Christ.
</ul>

"In <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i>, you'll read how the press have given the Clinton administration a free ride on policy issues which are far more important to the future of liberalism than personal peccadilloes."<br>
-- Cal Thomas<p>

"The liberal media have the power to set the national agenda, and <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> proves that this is just what they're doing."<br>
-- L. Brent Bozell III<p>

"Must reading for the GOP."<br>
-- Arianna Huffington<p>

<h2><center>Quote of the Day</h2><p>
  
    <i>"I think there were some transcendent moments but some risky
rhetorical gambles here, where Bob Dole may have taken the
risk of coming across more as the preachy grandfather than
the grown-up he most wants to be, and that could turn off
some voters." <p>

-- ABC s Michel McQueen just after Dole's
acceptance speech last night.<p></i>
  
<h2><a name="speech">Dole's Speech</a> Performance Praised by Most, But... 
ABC: Dole s "A Preachy Grandfather"</h2></center>
  
    Bob Dole speech coverage featured praise for his delivery,
but the networks were critical of its content. <p>
  
    -- ABC condemned it as "preachy," and NBC called it "tough."
Just after Dole finished, ABC's Michel McQueen warned that he
may have come across as a "preachy grandfather" [see Quote of
the Day below]. Sam Donaldson called it "a red meat speech"
and a "a very tough speech, I mean, Bob Dole says that
violent criminals will have their lives made a living Hell,
he'd pursue terrorists to the ends of the Earth, I think he s
going to dash the teachers  unions into the sea." NBC's Lisa
Myers described it as "the best speech I ever saw Bob Dole
give," but colleague David Bloom said "this was a very tough
speech, Bob Dole calling himself combative for country, but
the people down here, the partisans loved it."<p>
  
    -- CNN went to Wolf Blitzer for a Democratic response just
four minutes after Dole finished. Gene Randall then demanded
Dole campaign manager Scott Reed respond to that spin: "Let
me just run by first what George Stephanopoulos said about
the speech. Even before it was over he called it, 'The most
negative, partisan, divisive acceptance speech since
Goldwater in 1964.'"<p>
  
    -- In Dole's speech CNN's Bernard Shaw discovered the
beginning of a nasty campaign: "I ve maintained that this
campaign is going to be one of the nastiest, bare-knuckled,
direct to the gut campaign's in America s political history.
Listen to this one sentence, quote 'It is demeaning to the
nation that within the Clinton administration a core of the
elite never grew up, never did anything real, never
sacrificed, never suffered and never learned, should have the
power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving
schemes.'"<p>  
    -- One day after Ted Koppel left San Diego, Nightline covers
the convention, talking with a focus group; reporters discuss
GOP inclusiveness.<p>
  
    -- A Video Contrast: In 1992 ABC and CBS ran bios of Clinton;
but nothing for Dole this year. NBC ran part of Clinton's
video, but none of Dole's. <p>
  

<h2><center><a name="diversity">So Much for Network Bio Diversity
The Man from Hope vs. Russell's Own</a></h2></center><p>

    Four years ago at the Democratic convention in New York, ABC's 
Peter Jennings explained the quandary biographical films present
to the networks. "I'm not precisely sure what to call it," 
Jennings said, "but it's the Democratic Party's film 
about Bill Clinton's life, and it's something we try to 
come to grips with every four years when the party decides what
its view of the candidates is." ABC's 1992 resolution: "We 
think it's usually more prudent to give the assignment to a
reporter." Reporter Jeff Greenfield then introduced viewers to
Bill Clinton's life story.<p>

    CBS did the same. Dan Rather told viewers: "The delegates are 
now watching a film about Bill Clinton, prepared by the Clinton
campaign. We asked correspondent Richard Threlkeld to look at the
film and report on it." NBC aired the final three minutes of the
"Man from Hope" film. This year, CBS only showed the last 30
seconds of the Republicans biographical film for Dole and didn't
assign the story to a reporter. NBC aired nothing. ABC skipped
the film so it could check in with Brit Hume with President
Clinton in Wyoming, with the vital news that Clinton claimed he
wasn't watching the convention.<p>

    Bob Dole's life story would still be news to many Americans. 
<i>U.S. News & World Report's</i> Gloria Borger noted in the 
June 3 issue that "A Harris poll last month found that 59 percent
of Americans don't know Dole has a disibility." They must watch
too much television news.<p>


<h2><center><a name="CBS">Paula Zahn Insists CBS Coverage Has "Been Abundantly Fair"
But CBS Impugned GOP as "Extremist"</a></h2></center><p>
  
    Wednesday night Marc Morano, best known as the Rush Limbaugh
TV show's "man in Washington," confronted several network
reporters with his camera and microphone. Asked about liberal
bias, CBS correspondent Paula Zahn responded:<p>
  
    "Those of us who work for organizations like CBS News take
great pride in being fair and I think if you look at this
Republican convention, our coverage, you ll agree that we
have been abundantly fair." Well, Morano asked, what about
the use of extremist labels? "I don t think I ve used the
word extremist once since I got here on Saturday," the former
CBS This Morning co-host insisted. "Obviously, labels, I
think are very limiting and we have to be very careful about
how we use that."<p>
  
    She may be able to restrain herself, but her colleagues are
not so professional. On Monday's CBS Evening News Dan
Rather asked Jack Kemp: "Even some Republicans describe the
current platform as quote, 'harsh, extreme,' even 'radical.' 
Do you see it that way?"  <p>
  
    Lesley Stahl, later that night in prime time, claimed: "The
whole purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program, is
to diminish the image of this party as extreme, because
that's what's turning the women off. Four years ago, the main
speaker at the convention...was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling,
his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin Powell,
he will appeal to civility. On the platform, women find that
extreme. It's turning them off." <p>
  
    But Zahn is far from innocent. Take a look at a question that
she posed on the July 5, 1995 CBS This Morning to Pat
Buchanan: "Even your sister concedes, although some
supporters might like what you have to say about the economy
and these very specific issues you just mentioned, they re
very turned off by some of your social policies. And you know
you ve got political enemies out there calling you an
isolationist, a bigot, you re anti-gay, and some even go as
far as saying that your social stands are reminiscent of Nazi
Germany. How are you to win them over?"<p>

    So what have viewers across America heard about the
Republican convention? At week s end, here s a collection of
the most biased quotes from the networks:<p>
  
    -- "He [Kemp] is a rare combination 'a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They're
supposed to be haters.'" <p>
<i>-- CNN analyst Bill Schneider, August
9 Inside Politics.</i><p>
  
    -- "Ronald Reagan will still have to learn how history will
judge his time in office -- the deficits, the Iran-Contra
affair. But for the members of this party, there is no more
beloved figure." <p>

<i>-- Tom Brokaw just after Nancy Reagan's
emotional thank-you following a video tribute to Ronald
Reagan, August 12 NBC convention coverage.<p></i>
  
    -- "You know a lot has been made of the Republican Party
being a very inclusive party, one that can embrace the views
of various people. Given the way the platform has worked out
vis-a-vis abortion, and the fact that some of these
Republican governors are not speaking because they felt as if
they were being censored. Do you still believe you can call
the Republican Party an inclusive party?" <p>
<i>-- One of seven
abortion questions posed by NBC's Katie Couric to Senator Kay
Bailey Hutchison, August 12 Today.</i><p>
  
   -- "Women have not responded well to a message that at times
has been considered too harsh, too mean." <p>
<i>-- ABC's Michel
McQueen, during August 13 coverage.<p></i>
  
    -- "It was grand TV, well-scripted, well-staged, craftily
designed for a broadcast image of tolerance and diversity
that's starkly at odds with reality." <p>
<i>-- ABC's Jim Wooten on
Colin Powell s address, August 13 World News Tonight.</i><p>
  
    -- "The right to abortion has never been an overwhelming
issue for women at election time. But this fight within the
Republican Party has many women questioning how far this
party will go to limit their rights."  <p>
<i>-- ABC s Peter Jennings,
August 13.</i><p>
  
    -- "Although his speech was generally well-received, the
reception was restrained, and there were boos whenever Powell
steered away from the right. Though they booed and also
heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of inclusion
throughout the first night of their convention. We can expect
more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996." -- <p>
<i>Today
co-host Bryant Gumbel.</i><p>
  
    -- "Do you think -- this is a party that is dominated by men
and this convention is dominated by men as well...Do you
think before tonight they thought very much what happens in
America with rape?" <p>
<i>-- Tom Brokaw to rape victim Jan Licence
who had just addressed the convention, August 13.  </i><p>
  
    -- "I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is
dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be
interpreted by some people as mean." <p>
<i>-- NBC's Tim Russert
previewing Hutchison's August 13 speech.</i><p>
  
    -- "Polls will tell you these days that people do not want
much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on
President Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating
habits." <p>
<i>-- ABC Good Morning America co-host Charles Gibson,
August 14. </i><p>
  
    -- "There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so
loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking
tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it,
or quite the contrary?" <p>
<i>-- Gumbel to Tim Russert, August 14
Today.</i><p>
  
    -- "Just how tightly scripted is this convention? Well, a
Russian television reporter said today that this is as
tightly controlled as anything the Communist Party ever put
on, Tom." <p>

<h3>Bryant the Killjoy</h3><p>
  
    As the rest of the media conceded the success of Elizabeth
Dole's Wednesday night speech from the floor, Today co-host
Bryant Gumbel grumbled Thursday morning: "Yeah, I guess some
would say it was cool. Others would say it was calculating,
huh?" <p>
  
    Later, Gumbel added: "In keeping with the softer image that
Republicans are trying hard to project at their convention,
Elizabeth Dole last night did her impression of Oprah
Winfrey, and in a fashion that supporters would call
heartfelt but others would call hokey, Liddy Dole sang her
husband s praises to the delegates." <p>
  
  
<h3>Ending With a Bang</h3><p>
  
    ABC's Brian Ross filed stories all week long on the corporate
money lavished on the GOP, but his Thursday World News
Tonight report focused on a surprising target: "Very much in
the middle of the mix are the giant media corporations, like
CNN, whose multi-million-dollar merger has yet to be formally
approved by federal regulators. Time Warner gave more than
$100,000 to be an official sponsor of the convention."<p>
  
    Former <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Dwight Morris told Ross
media companies shouldn t use the conventions to lobby, and
Ross noted: "But that didn t stop CBS lobbyists from giving
the Republicans thousands of dollars to help pay for the cost
of food and liquor in the skybox belonging to Republican
Party Chairman Haley Barbour." <p>
  
    Ross even reported on his own bosses: "Last night, the ABC
hospitality suite was a lobbyist s dream. With visits from
Congressman Tom Bliley, the chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, which handles telecommunications issues. And then
from the #2  man in the House, Majority Leader Dick Armey,
who could be seen with top ABC executives, including the ABC
lobbyist, who insisted he wasn't lobbying." We look forward
to an equally revealing set of nightly reports from Chicago.<p>
  
  
<h3>William's Wimps</h3><p>
  
    <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter Bob Davis wrote an article for
the Thursday morning edition on MRC Chairman Brent Bozell and
the Media Reality Check '96 effort in San Diego. Davis found
notable hostility at CNN to Bozell: "His criticism is mostly
background noise,  says CNN political director Tom Hannon."
Davis asked CNN analyst Bill Schneider to explain his claim
last weekend that "conservatives are supposed to be haters"
and Jack Kemp "is a rare combination: a nice conservative."
Said Schneider: "I wasn t name-calling. I was making an
analytical point." He added that he calls liberals wimps, but
"they re so wimpy, they don t complain. When you talk about
mean conservatives, the wrath of God comes down on you."<p>
  
    But a look into the Nexis news data retrieval system finds
something different. Schneider quoted criticism of Colin
Powell s "wimpout" on abortion in 1995. The only other uses
of "wimp" in the last five years were three nearly identical
references in 1992 and 1994 to the 1988 Bush-Dukakis
campaign. Schneider declared on November 1, 1994: "Michael
Dukakis got beaten up by the wimp, which proved he wasn't
tough enough for the job."<p>

<h2>On the Bright Side, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2>
<p>
<h3>Nightline's True Story</h3>
<p>
ABC News has never been eager to report the truth on GOP efforts to reform Medicare. Good Morning America anchor Morton Dean continually got the story wrong. On October 12 Dean relayed the Democratic line: "The Republican plan would cut $270 billion in Medicare spending over seven years." Exactly two months and scores of inaccurate reports later, ABC finally told the truth with a December 12 Nightline dedicated to exposing President Clinton's demagoguery.
<p>
Chris Bury explained the game, "`Devastate, destroy, dismantle` -- strong words, but in reviewing Mr. Clinton's performance on Medicare, Republicans have another word in mind: deceptive...The truth is, both President Clinton and the Congress want to spend more money, not less, on Medicare."
<p>
Reviewing Hillary Clinton's 1993 appearance before Congress, Bury showed the First Lady's testimony where she proclaimed that her health plan reduced "the rate of growth in Medicare from about 11 percent increase annually to about a 6 or 7 percent increase annually." Then Bury added, "But this year, when Republicans proposed to slow the annual growth of Medicare spending to 7.2 percent...President Clinton accused them of gutting the program."
<p>
Bury concluded his report: "Since August, when President Clinton cast himself in the role of Medicare's protector, his own standing in the polls has risen steadily, and though his performance has been a smashing popular success, many critics believe the price of admission has cost the country an honest debate."
<p>


<h3>A Woman on Welfare</h3>
<p>
When Republicans began to tinker with the welfare system, reporters were quick to point out the millions who would end up in poverty as a result. But on the November 19 60 Minutes, CBS' Lesley Stahl offered a different take when she profiled "a woman who knows as much about the subject as anyone. A woman on welfare? No, a woman on the subject of welfare."
<p>
She was Eloise Anderson, head of California's welfare division. Anderson knows what welfare is like; she was once on it. She  also supports Republican proposals. Stahl noted: "What Anderson wants to get rid of are the cash payments that go directly to welfare recipients, known as AFDC....It seems there's no argument for AFDC that she agrees with. The problem, she says, starts with the way welfare marginalizes men, because no poor man who makes the minimum wage, can compete with it."
<p>
Stahl pointed out: "Her critics have called her everything from mean-spirited to compassionless, but Anderson says it's a question of fairness to low-income workers who pay taxes."  As for fears of disaster, "Anderson says there will be no excuse for not taking a minimum wage job when the cash payments end, because poor people will still get help; with food stamps, medical coverage, and child care."

<center><h2>Janet Cooke Award, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>CNN Describes Speaker as "Too Extreme" and "Scary," A "Clown Prince" with "Fits of Pique"<br>
Newt Gingrich, Political Liability?</h3>
<p>
Time selects its Man of the Year not by picking its favorite person, but the person with the most historical impact in that given year. In 1995, certainly, Newt Gingrich had a powerful impact on America's political debate. But that didn't mean Time had to like him -- and neither did CNN in producing a December 17 CNN Presents to announce the pick. For maligning the Speaker as a politically damaged and morally questionable figure after celebrating Time's choice of Bill Clinton in 1992, CNN earned the Janet Cooke Award.
<p>
CNN split its show between interviews with Gingrich and documentary segments. In the first segment, host Judy Woodruff used loaded language to describe Gingrich's "Path to Power," calling his ambition to be Speaker "An obsession that shaped almost every decision, every alliance, what some saw as every betrayal on his path to power." Woodruff relayed a rumor about Gingrich's first wife, Jackie: "It has become part of the Gingrich legend that he would later go to her hospital room where she was being treated for cancer to discuss a divorce." 
<p>
Woodruff described how Gingrich first came to the capital's attention: "In late-night tirades on C-SPAN, he needled then-House Speaker Tip O'Neill, painting ruling Democrats as corrupt thugs." Woodruff called him "a clown prince of an out-of-favor group." She concluded: "His self-ordained mission to save Western civilization is becoming overshadowed by a barrage of accusations that the most powerful Speaker in history illegally used political money." While CNN followed with Rep. David Bonior charging Gingrich's ethics are "in the toilet," Woodruff did not explain any of the charges, most of which were dismissed by the House ethics committee days later.
<p>
Another segment, titled "Homefront," explored Gingrich's hold on his constituency in Georgia: "Cobb County -- the soul of Newt country, Republican, white, well-educated, and affluent. The man who would wield the federal budget ax represents a county that exploded into suburban sprawl because of billions of federal dollars. Unemployment is low here, at 3.4 percent. It's well below the national average. And only a scant five percent of Cobb's population is on public assistance. The social fallout of the Contract with America if it passes will have little consequence here, but those hit will be hit hard."
<p>
CNN talked mostly to social service providers, liberal activists, and projected victims: "For the Hogan family, some cutbacks are the wrong thing to do. Daughter Kimberly, disabled from birth, has spent most of her life in a hospital. Thanks to Medicaid, this year has been different." Protesters held up signs reading "Newt: Your Plan Will Kill Us."
<p>

These documentary segments were heavily salted with Gingrich opponents: "The Path to Power" featured five negative talking heads (including three from Rep. Pat Schroeder and one of Bonior) to only three positive. "Homefront" featured twelve anti-Gingrich soundbites to four defenders. A segment called "Report Card" focusing on his future balanced the talking heads six to six, which included Bonior predicting that Gingrich's ethics problems were "so severe" he wouldn't be in office much longer.
<p>
If that hostility weren't enough, there were Woodruff's interview questions to the Speaker: "There's something we saw that was kind of interesting, the latest CNN-Time poll, they asked people what they thought about you and a lot of people said, most people said, very intelligent. A number of them said he has a vision for the future, but they also said -- a large number of those same people said, and I thought this was interesting, they agreed you were too extreme, 66 percent -- and out of touch, 52 percent, and even scary 49 percent. Where does that come from?"
<p>
When Gingrich suggested that things like being portrayed as Scrooge on the cover of Time didn't help, Woodruff replied: "But there's also been, in addition to that, what many people look at as the effect of the Republican budget cuts, and most of the people -- what they see is that most people, according to the studies we've seen, who would lose under the combined budget cuts and tax changes are the very poorest Americans, and people have a hard time understanding that."
<p>
Gingrich challenged that spin, but Woodruff reacted: "The study I'm referring to came out I think in the last week or so, by the Urban Institute, highly respected group, supposed to be nonpartisan -- and they set aside Medicaid and Medicare, they just looked at the budget cuts separate from Medicare and Medicaid and tax changes, and their conclusion was that the families that would lose under the Republican plan, two-thirds are in the poorest fifth of the population." The Urban Institute has often disseminated research that concludes with the need for more federal social spending.
<p>
Woodruff concluded the program with a decidedly negative spin: "He couldn't have envisioned the blizzard of ethics charges or the stir his fits of pique would cause. Now that they've gotten to know him, more than half of all Americans say they don't like him. More than half say they don't trust him. The irony is that Time's Man of the Year may wind up the biggest liability to the revolution he launched."
<p>
This program was a 180-degree change from the show CNN aired on December 26, 1992, when Bill Clinton was named Time's Man of the Year. The 30-minute show featured at least 18 positive talking heads, including Clintonites Robert Reich, Ron Brown, Dee Dee Myers, and Betsey Wright, Democratic Reps. Tom Foley and Lee Hamilton, Democratic consultant Bob Squier, and black academic Henry Louis Gates. Only one soundbite from conservative Arkansas editorialist Paul Greenberg offered any balance. 
<p>
The narration by CNN's Lou Waters and Natalie Allen said nothing about Clinton's troubled private life, nothing about ethics, nothing about overweening ambition. Allen began the show with a quotation: "He was not born a king, but a child of the common people who made himself a great persuader, therefore, a leader by dint of firm resolve, patient effort, and dogged perseverance." Chimed in Waters: "The words were written by Horace Greeley a century ago to describe Abraham Lincoln. They apply as well to this persevering young man from Arkansas, now leader of the Free World." Allen continued: "The election of 1992 was a leap of faith in a sour and unpredictable year. American voters were angry and disgusted and often afraid of the future. They took an enormous risk and made a fascinating choice." 
<p>
CNN prepared a response to MediaWatch questions, but it did not arrive by press time. It will appear next month. CNN may have contributed to the effect its polls have noticed: viewers were instructed that the Speaker was politically extreme, even scary, while Clinton was Honest Abe.

<center><h2>Newsbites, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>The Silent Veto.</h3>
Bill Clinton vetoed the welfare reform bill late on January 9, in an apparent attempt to avoid that night's news coverage. His concern was understandable; the veto would be an admission that he was breaking his famous campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it." 
<p>
Clinton worried needlessly: None of the network's January 10 evening news shows mentioned Clinton's veto, even after possible GOP opponent Bob Dole took to the Senate floor to criticize Clinton's betrayal. Although the media properly focused on criticism when George Bush broke his "no new taxes" campaign pledge, there was no focus on criticism of Clinton. The media missed another opportunity when Clinton held a press conference January 11. He was peppered with 18 questions, but not one raised the issue of his breaking his welfare promise, the crux of his effort to portray himself as a "New Democrat." 
<p>

<h3>Flattening Forbes. </h3>
At first glance, Steve Forbes' presidential campaign would seem to fulfill the media's standards for a proper Republican candidate: One with sufficiently soft stands on social issues to avoid the "divisive" label. Unable to attack Forbes as extremist (he has suitably "tolerant" stands on such issues as abortion and immigration), in the December 4 Time, Senior Writer Richard Stengel charged that "for all his patrician good humor, Forbes' message and his campaign have begun to show a hard edge." Stengel exploited a tenuous link between Forbes and Senator Jesse Helms' racially-tinged campaigns: "While Forbes generally shuns the politics of exclusion, he has nonetheless attracted to his organization two veterans of Jesse Helms' race-baiting campaigns." 
<p>
He also attacked Forbes' centerpiece flat tax proposal: "Despite his frequent protestations that he understands the needs of the average Joe, his flat-tax proposal would reward wealthy investors while leaving the burden on middle-class families." He added the plan would "do little to disabuse taxpayers of the notion that the rich get a better deal from the tax system." He cited data from the "generally liberal" Citizens for Tax Justice, stating a seventeen percent flat tax would produce a revenue shortfall of $200 billion. The group also claimed Dick Armey's similar flat tax plan would raise taxes on middle class families, estimating increases in the $1,740-$4,600 range on families earning between $45,000 and $85,000. 
<p>
Stengel didn't quote a conservative expert, but for a balancing view he could have referred to Time's very own flat tax analysis of April 17, when a CPA estimated how much tax a hypothetical family of four making $50,000 could expect to pay under the Armey plan. Time found the family's taxes would be cut by almost half, from $4,249 under the existing system to $2,244 under the Armey plan.
<p>

<h3>DeParle's Platform.</h3>
Twice in December, The New York Times provided a platform for reporter Jason DeParle's personal crusade against Republican welfare reforms. In the December 17 New York Times Magazine he depicted a post-welfare reform nightmare. DeParle wrote his story as an encyclopedia entry from the year 2015 that took a look back at the history of welfare. 
<p>
The fictitious excerpt presented welfare reform as an initial success when left to the states until a recession hit in 1999: "Faced with declining revenues and rising aid requests, states slashed their payments....With families crossing borders in search of aid, the `race to the bottom' ensued, with each state trying to be as tough as its neighbors." DeParle described an almost apocalyptic state where mothers were "arrested each year for locking their children in cars as they worked." DeParle predicted a million families would be "lining up at shelters, stealing into abandoned buildings and begging on street corners." DeParle continued his gloomy forecast: "Some became more reliant on abusive boyfriends, and reports of domestic violence rose. Abortion rates hit record levels and so did arrests for prostitution, leading several cities to decriminalize the practice in specified red-light zones."
<p>

DeParle's Other Platform. Two weeks earlier in a Times "Week in Review" piece, DeParle charged: "While the Republicans promise that the poor will prosper, the evidence does not. Indeed, most suggests the opposite: whether the economy or poor people are ultimately to blame, most will fail to replace their lost benefits. If the past is a guide, less will not mean more. Less will mean less, for those who already have little." 
<p>
DeParle criticized the GOP plan to let states run welfare, taking on supposed GOP arguments such as "The programs don't help much anyway," and "Earnings will improve with time." DeParle even refuted the notion that the poor actually "will be better off by working," answering: "Or will they? No one knows how many of the five million women of AFDC will be able to find and keep work. Many have few skills and lead the kinds of chaotic lives that interfere with full-time work: sick kids, dangerous neighborhoods, abusive boyfriends, broken cars."
<p>

<h3>Newt the Destroyer? </h3>
ABC previewed the Democratic strategy to hang Republican Tom Campbell with the "Newtoid" tag, but when the strategy backfired ABC ignored the results. In Carol Lin's December 10 piece for World News Sunday she highlighted Democrat Jerry Estruth's effort to defeat Republican Campbell in a special congessional election to replace retiring Democrat Norman Mineta. Anchor Carole Simpson introduced the story: "For all of Mr. Gingrich's power on Capitol Hill, opinion polls show his star is fading with American voters. So much so that one congressional candidate in California is using the Gingrich image to beat down his once-popular Republican opponent." 
<p>
Lin reported Campbell at one point had enjoyed a 43-point lead over Estruth. "Yet this political novice has managed to cut his popular Republican opponent's lead in half. By redefining the enemy. Estruth launched an ad campaign attacking House Speaker Newt Gingrich. And labeling Tom Campbell as a Gingrich clone." Lin pointed out that Campbell was more moderate than the Speaker on many issues, "But the strategy seems to be working. With more than a million dollars in donations pouring in." Lin continued, "Democrats hope Gingrich's negatives will be the central issue that can turn election campaigns across the country," before concluding: "Campbell is still the front runner in this race but only by a narrow margin. Democrats say that alone is still a victory for their party. Because they found their weapon. The man who started the Republican revolution may give frustrated voters reason enough to bring more Democrats back to office."
<p>
So, did ABC make it a big story when Campbell trounced Estruth by 23 points on December 12? No, not a word about the result on World News Tonight.  
<p>

<h3>Hot Media Air.</h3>
CBS and ABC have recently portrayed House Republicans as the catalysts to impending global doom, but have ignored scientific studies which back the GOP. "Some House Republicans are objecting to the global agreement to ban industrial chemicals widely believed to be depleting the earth's ozone layer," Dan Rather intoned on the November 23 CBS Evening News. Eric Engberg explained "that 150 countries have signed a treaty banning production of ozone depleting chemicals," but "to the number three Republican in the House, it's Chicken Little Stuff...Time out! Not proven? Didn't this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry go to Dr. Mario Molina and two others who discovered ozone depletion?" 
<p>
Over a month later, ABC's January 4 World News Tonight ran another alarmist warning. Peter Jennings began: "Two thousand scientists from all over the world agree the earth is getting warmer all the time, in part because the United States is not practicing what it has been preaching." Ned Potter followed, "scientists say if they [temperatures] keep going up as they have heat waves will spread across North America. A third of the world's glaciers will melt, flooding coastlines in dozens of countries. Tropical diseases will spread, exposing large parts of the U.S. to malaria." Potter charged that the Clinton administration "gave in to the petroleum and auto industries" and then he allowed Vice President Al Gore to blame the House GOP. 
<p>
But the need for action isn't so clear. Washington Post science writer Boyce Rensberger reported January 8 that of the three major studies of global temperatures during 1995 one reported an increase in average temperature, one called 1995 "ordinary," and one found some cooling. Guess which two the networks have ignored?
<p>

Moyers On Wages. PBS omnipresence Bill Moyers returned to Milwaukee for the December 19 Frontline to visit two families who suffered layoffs in 1991 at the motor company Briggs and Stratton. Moyers complained: "Good-paying jobs are heading south or out of the country and workers like Tony Neumann are searching desperately for new jobs that will support their families...In the early '90s, families like the Stanleys and Neumanns were thrown into a emerging new economy built on light manufacturing and service jobs. It was a time when unemployment hit record lows. But many of the new jobs offered only part-time work and no benefits, and they paid lower wages." Moyers concluded the show: "For working people all over America, real wages continue to decline."
<p>
But in a review on the morning before the show, a sequel to the 1992 program Minimum Wages, Washington Post reporter Steven Pearlstein told a story Moyers didn't: "In fact, today there are 12,000 more manufacturing jobs in the Milwaukee area than there were in the fall of 1991 when Claude Stanley and Tony Neumann were laid off, while the average hourly wage in manufacturing has climbed from $12.54 an hour to $13.98, just about keeping pace with inflation." Pearlstein added that Briggs and Stratton motors are now cheaper for consumers and the company is making money for its stockholders.
<p>

Rather Embarrassed. While on Denver's KOA talk radio host Mike Rosen's program, Dan Rather tried to defend himself and his network against charges of bias. Rosen questioned Rather's repeated use of the word "cut" when describing the Republican Medicare plan on the CBS Evening News. Rather shot back, "Some of the time we use the language, `Medicare cuts,' which is what the Democrats insist these are, and some of the time we use that these are, `cuts in the rate of growth for Medicare,' which is what the Republicans prefer. We try to walk that line, we try to call it one way one time, one way the next time."
<p>
A review of Evening News broadcasts from September 20, the night before the Republicans unveiled their Medicare plan, to November 28, when Rather appeared on Rosen's program, shows the CBS anchor should pay closer attention to what comes out of his mouth. During this period, Rather used the Democratic spin term `cuts' eight times such as when Rather announced as fact on September 20: "Democrats and Republicans in Congress late today came close to actual physical blows over proposed cuts in Medicare. That's the separate U.S. government health care coverage for 37 million older Americans of all income levels. There's no doubt that Medicare spending will be cut, the question is how much and for how many." On October 25 he claimed that "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and extreme."
<p>

He applied the phrase that best described reality, "reducing the rate of growth," or "reducing spending" three times. He relayed the Republican spin, "making the plan solvent" just once; hardly the "one way one time, one way the next time" which Rather claimed.

<h3>Networks Search for Victims in the Wake of Second Budget Stalemate<br>
The Shutdown Soap Opera</h3>
<p>
December brought a second shutdown of the federal government, and with it came the networks' ratings-grabbing specialty: hanky-waving sob stories of shutdown "victims."
<p>
On December 22, a week into the shutdown and before paychecks were delayed, Jack Smith mourned on World News Tonight: "The shutdown now has a human face. Joe Skattleberry and his wife Lisa both work for the government. Both have been furloughed. They can't afford a Christmas tree."
<p>
NBC's John Palmer warned on the December 29 Today: "The shutdown is affecting more people's lives every day in places like Grand Teton National Park, where furloughed park employees worried about mortgages, car payments, and  credit card bills have begun filing unemployment benefits. In California and in dozens of other states, serious cutbacks in food programs are threatened unless the budget crisis is resolved soon." Later, David Bloom added: "The shutdown continues. The pain spreads. The pressure grows for Washington to end America's worst budget crisis."
<p>
On January 2, CBS Evening News reporter Scott Pelley compared budget negotiators to bombers: "In April, terrorists tried to kill them. Today, politicians stopped their paychecks. In Oklahoma City's Social Security office, they're being ordered to work for nothing....The bomb broke Beverly Rankin's ankle. Politics is breaking her bank." 
<p>
That night NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw mourned: "Far from the marbled halls of Congress and the elegant furnishings of the White House, this government shutdown is about a lot more than politics. It's about people and their real needs."
<p>
NBC's George Lewis found an Indian health clinic in San Diego: "Two-thirds of the clinic's budget, $95,000 a month, comes from the federal government. Without that money, the clinic can't meet its payroll. The people who run this clinic fear that if it has to close its doors, many of the 4,000 patients who seek treatment here will not look elsewhere. Ron Morton says traditionally, Native Americans do not like to accept handouts." But didn't NBC just say the clinic is two-thirds funded by the federal government? Morton later asserted that "if this budget is not signed there are people who are going to die."
<p>
Bryant Gumbel preached at the start of the January 4 Today: "Although some politicians have foolishly suggested the fact that we are going on about our business despite the absence of the workers says maybe they weren't needed anyway, we will show you how some average Americans are suffering each and every day as a result of what is now 20 days of the government shutdown."

<h3>Today Gushes Over Hillary<br>
"Really Terrific" Book</h3>
<p>
As questions swirled around Hillary Clinton's veracity on Whitewater and the travel office, NBC News gave her a gift: a January 16 Today interview by Maria Shriver, who campaigns for and donates to her uncle Ted Kennedy's Senate campaigns. Shriver served more as political flack than journalistic inquisitor. Shriver opened the show by calling Clinton's new book, It Takes a Village, "really terrific."
<p>
Her first question: "What's this last week and a half been like for you personally?" She followed up about daughter Chelsea: "What has she said to you about these attacks?...This is beyond the territory....This is your mom that someone's talking about." After wondering if she'd be willing to testify before the Senate and posing one question about the travel office, Shriver showed sympathy for Clinton's plight: "Whitewater, I know you've been answering questions on this subject for four years, thousands of pieces of documents have been handed over, but they still want even more. As you look back on this, do you wish you'd never worked for Madison Guaranty?"
<p>
Shriver did ask: "Regarding these billing records that came about that had been subpoenaed two years ago, people say, `Gosh, how could a woman as smart and politically savvy as Hillary Clinton not know where these records were these past two years? Why didn't she make that her priority to find them, particularly when they were found in her own home, under an assistant's desk?'"
<p>
Shriver returned to softballs: "You also quote a letter in there that Nelson Mandela wrote to one of his daughters while he was in prison, and I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he wrote that there is no personal misfortune that one cannot turn into a personal triumph if one has the iron will and the necessary skills. You clearly have an iron will, you clearly are skilled. How are you going to turn this personal misfortune into a personal triumph?"
<p>
Shriver then stumped for liberalism: "You think government should do a lot more than it's doing in terms of making children a priority, doing things for kids. We're clearly living in an age where people are anti-government. How do you get across the message that we all need to see everybody's kids as our own, we need to have more programs, the government needs to be more involved?"

<h3>Brinkley Agrees Media are Liberal<br>
Paula Zahn is "Overloaded"</h3>
<p>
In a December 7 appearance on CNBC's Cal Thomas, David Brinkley reacted with dismay when read a quote from the MRC's Best Notable Quotables of 1995: The Eighth Annual Awards for the Year's Worst Reporting.
<p>
Thomas, one of the judges who voted on which quotes deserved inclusion in the year-end issue, asked: "Could you get away, for example, with asking a question like this, that was recently asked by a major network anchor of Pat Buchanan...`You've got political enemies out there calling you an isolationist, a bigot, you're anti-gay, and some even go so far as saying your social stands are reminiscent of Nazi Germany.' Now that's the kind of ideologically loaded stuff that turns a lot of people off, isn't it?"
<p>
Brinkley agreed: "That is so loaded, it's overloaded and it destroys itself in its own excess. Nobody would ever take that question seriously, I wouldn't even bother to answer it." Though Brinkley didn't know it, the quote, first runner-up for the "Damn Those Conservatives Award," came from Paula Zahn's July 5 CBS This Morning interview.
<p>
Earlier in the show the former NBC anchor and current This Week host acknowledged liberal bias."Well, it's there and it doesn't show itself in everything that is printed or broadcast but it is there, and I think we're all used to it, we discount it. Some of the press also is more conservative and it's just the way the action is in this country and I don't know any way to change it. You just have to live with it."

<center><h2>Revoving Door, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>If You Can't Boost 'Em...</h3>
<p>
Just weeks after writing a piece for The New Republic denouncing Republican efforts to shut down AmeriCorps, Newsweek Deputy Washington Bureau Chief Steven Waldman decided he could do more good helping run the government program than he could as an external advocate. In mid-January he became senior adviser for policy planning and evaluation for former Senator Harris Wofford (D-Penn.), the new Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National Service, overseer of AmeriCorps and VISTA. 
<p>
Waldman "explained that the program's recent change in leadership convinced him that the move would be ethical even though he's written extensively about the program," National Journal reported.
<p>
"Republican attacks on AmeriCorps have been bizarrely hyperbolic," Waldman charged in the November 13 New Republic. "The GOP has also practiced gross statistics-abuse in order to portray AmeriCorps, inaccurately, as a boondoggle." He predicted that "when Republicans calm down and start picking bits of safety net from their teeth, they will undoubtedly feel silly. They will realize that AmeriCorps -- which gives college scholarships to young men and women who do full-time community service -- was the solution to their dilemma of how to dismantle the welfare state without seeming cruel."
<p>
Earlier in 1995 Waldman, part of Newsweek's Washington bureau since 1987, wrote The Bill, a book detailing the creation of AmeriCorps. It grew out of a "behind-the-scenes" look at the program for the September 20, 1993 Newsweek, in which he concluded: "John F. Kennedy attracted to his Peace Corps a narrow group of mostly white, well-educated Americans. Clinton's plan is far more ambitious, seeking to regenerate fragmented American communities and break down rock-hard barriers of the heart. Because Clinton must confront the emotional issues of race and class, he is more likely to fail. But should he succeed, Clinton will have accomplished something far more significant than his hero ever did."
<p>
AmeriCorps is hardly the only area in which Waldman has been a liberal advocate. He co-authored a September 19, 1994 piece headlined, "The Lost Chance" with the subhead, "The Clintons: Newsweek reveals how they set out to reform a broken health care system -- and squandered a historic opportunity." One impediment: those who spent money "on blatantly untrue advertisements meant to scare the public."
<p>
A few issues later his byline accompanied a story on the Contract with America: "The problem is that the Contract's main idea has already been tried and discredited. House Republicans are now pledged to tax cuts, increased defense spending, and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Sound familiar? `This was a dopey political move,' [Rep. Fred] Grandy says. `We were holding the high ground on welfare, foreign policy, so why would we go back and shoosh down the Laffer Curve? This is like giving the Democrats a nuclear weapon.'" 
<p>

<h3>Being Frank</h3>
<p>
A CNN veteran is the new Deputy Press Secretary to Senator Frank Lautenberg. Ken Jaques, an off-air reporter in the CNN political unit from 1992 to 1994, has come aboard the New Jersey Democrat's staff, Roll Call reported December 21.

<p>
<h3>Networks Mourn Victims of Second Shutdown, Single Out Republicans for Blame<br>
Same Liberal Song, Second Verse</h3>
<p>
As a second partial government shutdown descended on Washington, network coverage once again favored President Clinton's arguments  over those of House Republicans. Last month, MediaWatch examined coverage during the November 13-20 shutdown and found not a single story noted how much more than the GOP  Clinton wanted to spend. No story questioned his rhetoric about "destroying" Medicare even though the GOP plan called for hikes. Reporters conveyed the Democratic spin about the disastrous impact upon federal workers and the public.
<p>
As a new budget impasse began in mid-December, MediaWatch analysts reviewed all 131 budget-related stories on evening newscasts (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's World News) from the evening before the shutdown (December 14) through the day it ended (January 5).
<p>
After President Clinton vetoed several spending bills, not one story blamed Clinton for the shutdown, but nearly two dozen declared the GOP culpable. Furloughed workers and other "victims" were featured in half the stories while no story explored the "Washington Monument" stategy or the financial boost offered by a balanced budget.
<p>
Blame. To fund the government, Congress passes appropriation bills which the President must then sign. Clinton vetoed spending bills on December 18 and 19 that would have kept open six cabinet departments. But on the question of who caused the shutdown, reporters exclusively pointed a finger at the Republicans. In the 48 stories in which reporters allocated blame, 23 assigned blame to the Republicans, but not one held Clinton culpable (25 blamed both).
<p>
On December 16, when the government's temporary spending authority ran out, Bob Schieffer led off the CBS Evening News like a disappointed father: "Well, they've done it again. Nine days from Christmas, Republicans have forced another partial shutdown of the government because they cannot come to an agreement with the White House on how to balance the budget." The next night, ABC's Jerry King also blamed the GOP. "There's no indication from House Republicans, whose budget-cutting zeal started all of this, that they are ready, Christmas season or not, to end it."
<p>
During the negotiations that followed the vetoes, reporters repeatedly blamed Republicans for not compromising. On December 23 CNN's Wolf Blitzer pined for an earlier time: "In the old days, the two sides would simply have split the differences, but House Republicans say they are proud to be revolutionaries...From the White House perspective there's still one very big wild card: the most militant House Republicans say they're in no mood to compromise. The question remains whether Speaker Gingrich can reign them in, or wants to."
<p>
Even as Clinton delayed agreement by breaking his promises to release a seven-year balanced budget, the networks still blamed the GOP. ABC's Peter Jennings intoned on January 4, "We begin in Washington tonight, where the Republicans and the Clinton administration may be inching their way towards a partial resolution of the government shutdown. President Clinton and the Republican leaders in Congress have been meeting almost daily this week, but today the Republicans apparently felt the need to reassess their position, which has kept a quarter of a million government employees off the job."
<p>
Spending. None of the 131 stories compared the higher levels of spending both sides proposed. Only two mentioned the levels of spending in the President's plan or the Republican plan, one coming not in a news story, but in a CBS commentary by Joe Klein.
<p>
Federal Workers. Only 280,000 workers were placed on furlough, just 15 percent of the work force. Still, the media focused on the issue in nearly half the stories (62), while only three reports focused on overburdened taxpayers. ABC's John Martin examined those angry at the de facto paid vacation on December 18: "This time government workers have an added worry -- Congress has been hearing from people who do not want to pay furloughed workers as they were paid after last month's shutdown."
<p>
"Victims." Sixty-seven of 131 stories mentioned a victim of the shutdown. Thirty stories called attention to families being turned away from National Parks or Smithsonian Museums. On December 22, CBS looked at how the stalemate canceled a re-creation of an Olde English Christmas banquet. John Blackstone reported, "For thousands of people, a Christmas dream is a traditional Christmas in Yosemite National Park. But the budget stalemate has closed the park gates and Yosemite's old fashioned Christmas is slipping away....The valley has somehow been drained of a seasonal joy it's known for almost 70 years." Although not by a reporter, in this story both sides were blamed as one of the participants wrote a poem about the cancellation in which she referred to Newt Gingrich as "slimebucket" and Clinton as "sleaze."
<p>
"Washington Monument." Not one report brought up the "Washington Monument" game being played when high profile services, like national parks and passport offices are closed in order to maximize inconvenience. No report questioned why these services were stopped even though, as The Wall Street Journal found, one-third of the federal workers at the Interior Department and two-thirds of State Department employees were considered essential and thus were on the job. 
<p>
Upside to the Shutdown. If you relied exclusively on the evening news, you would never have thought there was an upside to the shutdown. Only twice did a report call attention to a positive effect of the shutdown. Both were on CNN and dealt with the airline ticket tax expiring at the end of 1995. Anchor Linden Soles announced on January 1, "Washington's budget battle has reaped a windfall for air travelers," saving these travelers $12 million a day. But NBC anchor Brian Williams saw just the opposite the same day: "We have this footnote to the mess here in Washington tonight, because of it a tax on domestic airline tickets expired at midnight so while the budget negotiators are arguing about the best way to save money, the government is actually losing money."
<p>
Similarly, never mentioned were the benefits of a balanced budget. The Washington Post reported January 4 that experts estimated a balanced budget would give $1,000 annually to families through lower interest rates.  
<p>
For years, the media have complained about politicians ducking the tough issues; debating slogans, not substance. Finally, a substantive policy dispute presents itself. Unfortunately, the media aren't able to overcome their biases and look beyond the very bumper sticker politics they formerly decried.

ABC Promotes A Green "Demonstration" That Didn't Happen, Ignores March for Life
<p>
The Evangelical Right Wing That Wasn't 
<p>
Pro-life activists gather together in the nation's capital every January 22 to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. This year, 60,000 came to Washington for the annual March for Life, but the networks didn't pay much attention.
<p>
NBC Nightly News and CBS Evening News each gave the event 19 seconds. CBS followed up with a long story about the federal investigation into anti-abortion violence. CNN also had an anchor brief, although reporter Anthony Collings did a story the night before. On the day of the march, CNN's Inside Politics didn't mention the march, but devoted more than seven minutes to an interview with pro-choice Republicans Ann Stone and Julie Finley.
<p>
ABC's World News Tonight didn't even mention the march. But just nine days later, on January 31, Peter Jennings announced a "major demonstration on behalf of the environment designed to pressure those congressional Republicans who wish to eliminate or dilute many of the country's environmental laws. ABC's Barry Serafin reports that the pressure comes from a group of the Republican conservatives' strongest supporters." For ignoring the march of religious conservatives against abortion and then promoting the activities of a small group of religious liberals as if they were conservatives, ABC earned the Janet Cooke Award. 
<p>
Serafin explained: "Protecting the environment is a relatively new issue for evangelical Christians. But a group called the Evangelical Environmental Network [EEN] says it will spend a million dollars on a campaign to block efforts by congressional conservatives to weaken the Endangered Species Act, starting with a television commercial in 18 states." ABC aired a section of the ad which asserted: "The Endangered Species Act has rescued dozens of God's creatures from extinction. But today, the Act itself is threatened."
<p>
Serafin added that the group encouraged children to write letters lobbying Newt Gingrich to stop the GOP bill, before concluding: "The evangelical delegation in Washington delivered some of the children's letters, but it was unable to meet with Gingrich today. Gingrich's position on the Endangered Species Act is still a question. A bigger question is how congressional conservatives will deal with opposition from those they usually consider political allies." 
<p>
ABC's report was grossly misleading for a number of reasons. Despite Jennings' insistence, there was no "major demonstration." ABC showed no video of a demonstration, only a shot of a few professionals in overcoats walking outside the Capitol. In other words, ABC had ignored a major demonstration of 60,000 pro-lifers, only to cover one that did not even occur. The Environmental Information Center (EIC), which other news accounts identified as the million-dollar funder behind the evangelical group's ads against GOP reform of the Endangered Species Act, told MediaWatch there was no demonstration, only a press conference. 
<p>
In an August 19, 1995 Washington Post story about the activities of the liberal environmental groups Greenpeace, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and the Sierra Club to stop Republican proposals to strengthen the rights of property owners, reporter Gary Lee noted the liberal strategy behind the founding of EIC: "The major conservation groups and a few private donors and foundations pooled their resources last spring to create the Environmental Information Center, a new lobbying organization charged with doing whatever it takes to stop the anti-environmental tide in Washington." 
<p>
The Post noted EIC spent $1.3 million during last year's House debate on regulatory reform on TV ads saying "Don't let Congress roll back 25 years of environmental progress." But ABC identified these liberal activists as "a group of the Republican conservatives' strongest supporters" and "those they usually consider political allies." 
<p>
Not only has the Environmental Evangelical Network taken sides on the environmental issues, it has taken sides against the religious right as well. The February 1 San Diego Union Tribune noted EEN leaders "were critical of the environmental stands of some conservative Christian groups, such as the politically influential Christian Coalition." ABC aired a soundbite of Ron Sider, President and founder of Evangelicals for Social Action, the EEN's parent organization. But they did not note he signed a document last May called the "Cry for Renewal." The primary authors of the letter, leftist Sojourners magazine editor Jim Wallis and Clinton friend Tony Campolo, declared their intention to create a "progressive evangelical caucus" to challenge traditionally conservative evangelical events and hold town meetings to address community problems like "gay bashing." ABC did not reconcile Sider's partisan press conference with his signature on the "Cry for Renewal" document, which declared "religion as a political cheerleader is inevitably false as religion."
<p>
ABC denigrated Republican stands with pejorative adjectives ("eliminate," "dilute," "weaken") without allowing the GOP to explain their side of the debate. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Calif.) issued a press release the day after the ABC telecast asking the Evangelical Environmental Network to be honest in their characterization of the Republican bill, which currently has 126 co-sponsors in the House. Among the major provisions of the bill is an actual increase in funding for Endangered Species Act programs. 
<p>
ABC's blindness to opposing views extended to free-market environmental experts like Ike Sugg of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who told MediaWatch the Young-Pombo bill "doesn't go nearly far enough. They tried to pre-emptively compromise, and Gingrich is seeking to water it down further. The Republicans are not guilty of what they're accused of."
<p>
Sugg added: "The Young-Pombo bill is a step in the right direction since it weakens the federal government's power over private land use. But the current Endangered Species Act has created perverse incentives for property owners to remove any possibility of endangered species appearing on their property. It creates an enmity between wildlife and land owners. The ESA's supporters care more about saving the act than saving wildlife." 
<p>
Serafin did not return phone calls to discuss his story. ABC's story contrast suggests the irony of their biases. Their focus suggests heart-tugging concern for the kangaroo rat, but not the unborn child. ABC sometimes labels the religious right as "ultraconservative," but the religious left receives no label, or worse yet, is portrayed as conservative. But the worst characteristic of their reporting is the absolute refusal to acknowledge that issues they advance with partisan passion have more than one side.

<center><h2>Newsbites, from the February 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Tricky Dick's Tax Break.</h3>
When Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) filed an ethics complaint against House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt for possibly illegally evading capital gains taxes on a land swap, the story's hypocrisy angle seemed obvious. Insight reported last summer that Gephardt, who dem-agogues against capital gains tax cuts as windfalls for the rich, listed a beachfront property he was purchasing as an investment property, thus avoiding tax on a $79,500 capital gain. To obtain a loan to build on the North Carolina property, he signed a covenant pledging the house would be used as a second home, and not as an investment property. 
<p>
Reporters had two chances to make Gephardt's hypocrisy a news story, one when Dunn filed the complaint February 2, and another when Gephardt's lawyer denied the allegations a week later. Despite short stories in The Washington Post and The New York Times, in both cases the network evening news programs completely ignored the allegations.
<p>

<h3>Newt Left Hanging.</h3>
Last July, when the National Republican Congressional Committee printed a Wanted poster featuring targeted Democrats, CNN thoroughly covered the ensuing outrage from Democrats. The NRCC Wanted poster merely pictured Democratic incumbents up for re-election in 1996. CNN gave the most coverage overall of the poster, airing stories on the July 10 and July 15 Inside Politics as well as on World News for July 12 and 13. Declared anchor Bobbie Battista: "Some of the Democrats pictured on a Republican Wanted poster are complaining the ad is racist and could even put their lives in danger." The next day anchor Linden Soles reported, "Democrats say the poster is racist, anti-semitic and could even lead to physical attacks against them." 
<p>
So where was CNN when the Democratic National Committee (DNC) posted a Hangman game on its Web site that depicted Newt Gingrich as hanging from a gallows? According to John Pitney in the January 29 Weekly Standard, "For each correct guess, the site added a new part to a stick figure and displayed a different quotation from Gingrich. At the end of the game, the screen showed the stick figure hanging from a gallows, above the game's magic word: EXTREMIST." Surely, the lynching of the Speaker of the House on an official DNC computer Web page deserved at least a brief spot. But neither CNN's Inside Politics or The World Today aired a report on the Hangman game. A review of the three other major networks showed they also failed to mention the DNC's ghoulish depiction of Gingrich on the gallows.
<p>

<h3>PBS on Privates.</h3>
Are the personal lives of politicians relevant? Apparently, the PBS answer is "only if they're Republicans." On January 16, the tax-funded documentary series Frontline devoted an hour to the rise of Newt Gingrich, which included tales of how friends had to raise money to feed Newt's kids because he wouldn't pay alimony. Frontline also aired a man heckling Gingrich at a book signing: "You profess family values. This is hidden wisdom in the Holy Bible. And I want to know where it says oral sex doesn't count as adultery. I'd like you to sign it because, you know, you've been cheating on your wife. You've been crying family values. I don't know where it says oral sex is moral while you're trying to take away children's rights and children's benefits." 
<p>
But Frontline has almost completely avoided dealing with Bill Clinton's sex life. The only snippet came on March 3, 1992, in a documentary on racist David Duke, who declared: "I am not a wizard under the sheets. I have to leave that title to Bill Clinton from Arkansas." But that's about it. The October 21, 1992 Frontline titled "The Choice," a two-hour history of Bush and Clinton, leaped at the very end from Clinton's announcement speech in 1991 to the Los Angeles riots. There was no Gennifer Flowers. In 1995, Frontline aired "What Happened to Bill Clinton?" The answer: He hadn't been liberal enough. PBS said nothing about the allegations of state troopers or the sexual harassment lawsuit of Paula Jones. 
<p>

<h3>Another Travelgate Yawn.</h3>
While promoting her new book in January, First Lady Hillary Clinton defended her role in the May 1993 firing of the White House Travel Office staff. She said "financial mismanagement" justified the action. But a  recent audit by the General Accounting Office shows that whatever the situation in 1993, it has only gotten worse.
<p>
According to an Associated Press story that appeared in the January 30 Washington Post and Washington Times, an audit by the General Accounting Office found: "The current travel office rarely follows its own policy of paying vendors, such as airlines and telephone companies, within 45 days of the invoice date....office employees never balanced checkbooks from January through August 1995." The audit also found that the office's accounts receivable had soared to $5.6 million under the new management, while the employees that were fired had only $366,000. The new employees also forgot to enter over $200,000 in deposits into the office's checking accounts.
<p>
The audit drew little national media attention. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today all failed to report the embarrassing revelations. With the exception of the NewsHour on PBS, no network evening news show ran a story. Neither did Time or Newsweek.
<p>

<h3>Hillary's Decade of Greed.</h3>
Newsweek's Martha Brant and Evan Thomas analyzed the duality of Hillary Clinton in the January 15 issue. Instead of condemning her as a hypocrite for trashing the "greed is good" 1980s in public while cashing in on her influence in private, the Newsweek duo marveled at her "missionary zeal" as a liberal crusader. "The same zeal that is so impressive in her fight for worthy causes," Brant and Thomas suggested, "can also lead her (at best) to be politically insensitive and (at worst) to be ruthless about getting her way." 
<p>
The article shows why Hillary never resorted to ruthlessness when dealing with the press on Whitewater; reporters like Brant and Thomas are willing to rationalize her behavior: "It has fallen mostly to Hillary to finance the Clinton's public service. (As governor, her husband never earned more than $35,000 a year.) To the outside world, her commodities trading -- a $1,000 investment to make $100,000 -- looks suspiciously cozy. And the family's lost investment in the failed Whitewater land development has the smell of a sweet deal turned sour...Although she would never admit it, she may feel that she was relatively restrained in Little Rock, given the temptations of her position and the culture of the place. For a governor's wife who was also a senior partner in a politically connected law firm, the opportunity for lucrative deals must have been huge."
<p>
Zuckerman's Zero Interest. Liberals often claim that media owners push the media to the right. Not so at U.S. News & World Report where owner Mortimer Zuckerman liked investigating George Bush, but is not so happy about probing the Clintons. Zuckerman used a two-page editorial on January 29 to lambaste Republican handling of the Whitewater hearings. He recalled Joseph Welch's famous dictum, "Have you no sense of decency?" from the Army-McCarthy hearings of the 1950s as he regurgitated the Clintons' public relations line that a report prepared for the RTC by former Republican U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens cleared the Clintons. On the issue of the billing records that were discovered nearly two years after being subpoenaed (and which contradict the RTC report), Zuckerman wrote: "What about the time sheets showing the amount of legal work that Hillary Clinton performed for the failed S&L?...Again, no. Her role...was minimal." 
<p>
The editorial led to a January 26 guest appearance on Michael Jackson's KABC talk show in Los Angeles. Talk Daily reported that "he called the charges against the Clintons `outrageous' (a term he used several times)," claimed that in the First Lady's Madison dealings "all transactions were legitimate," was "disgusted" by the investigation and considered much of the press coverage a "witch hunt." 
<p>
Zuckerman's U.S. News piece also attacked fellow journalists for investigating a Democrat: "The press has slipped its moorings here...The two questions now -- what did the President's wife know and when did she know it? -- seem a childish irrelevance by comparison [to Watergate]." However in his own June 22, 1992 editorial on Iraqgate, Zuckerman suggested the Bush administration obstructed justice, claiming: "Certainly the attempts to limit inquiries by Congress on the spurious grounds of national security smell of coverup....In short, what did the administration know and when did it know it?"
<p>

<h3>California Scheming. </h3>
Host Jane Pauley's introduction to the January 23 Dateline NBC dripped with sarcasm: "Do you feel that everyone is after your job, and they just might have an unfair advantage? That people can criticize you and it's OK? Are you a white American male? In California, two men have taken up the cause of the beleaguered species. They've written a ballot proposal that, if passed in November, would change affirmative action in California's state hiring and education admissions." Reporter Josh Mankiewicz charged, "They (Glynn Custred and Tom Wood) are portrayed as `genial scholars,' just two `apolitical professors,' an image Wood and Custred have worked hard to maintain."
<p>
Then Mankiewicz moved to discredit them: "The two are key figures in a conservative organization...very critical of many aspects of higher education, including black and women's studies, sexual harassment policies, the emphasis on racial diversity, and affirmative action." John Leo of U.S. News & World Report took exception to the Mankiewicz segment in the February 19 issue: "Senator Joe himself couldn't have phrased this better. It artfully left the impression that NAS [the National Association of Scholars, to which Wood and Custred belong] is a sinister, antiwoman, antiblack group." In fact, Leo noted that "a prominent Marxist, Eugene Genovese, sits on the board of advisers."
<p>
Mankiewicz criticized the men for not having statistics on how many white men have suffered discrimination, but Leo pointed out "Nobody has good statistics on this. Since a lot of reverse discrimination is legal under Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act], many who are hurt by it never bother to file any complaints and thus don't get counted."
<p>

<h3>Judge Baer Not Bared.</h3>
<p>
When Federal Judge Harold Baer threw out the key evidence  in a New York drug arrest, $4 million in cocaine and heroin, only one news magazine noted that the Clinton administration had appointed the judge. All four networks ran stories on the case, explaining how the judge tossed the evidence, which officers found in a duffel bag they earlier saw being placed inside a car, under the guise of it being obtained through an illegal search. A story on NBC's February 6 Dateline noted that the woman charged admitted to being a drug runner and that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) now regretted suggesting Baer be nominated. But none of the networks noted the Clinton link. 
<p>
U.S. News & World Report was the only news magazine to make the connection between Clinton and Baer. However reporter Ted Gest, writing in the February 12 issue, failed to tie Baer's ruling with any liberal leanings. Analyzing the administration's judicial choices, he wrote, "Clinton's Supreme Court choices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, are moderates, and so are most of his lower court appointees...Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson...stresses diversity without sacrificing quality." Quality that let a $4 million admitted drug trafficker go free.

<center><h2>Front Page story, from the February 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>CBS Reporter Bernard Goldberg Charges Colleague, <br>Media with Liberal Bias
Reality Check for Eric Engberg</h3></center>
<p>
This month MediaWatch planned to include an article about CBS reporter Eric Engberg's February 8 CBS Evening News "Reality Check" attack on Steve Forbes' flat tax. But one of Engberg's colleagues beat us to it. In an unprecedented February 13 Wall Street Journal op-ed, CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg said that "Mr. Engberg's report set new standards for bias." Reaction was swift: CBS News President Andrew Heyward tagged the charge "absurd." 
<p>
Goldberg began by observing that one reason fewer people are watching network news "is that our viewers simply don't trust us. And for good reason. The old argument that the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore. No, we don't sit around in dark corners and plan strategies on how we're going to slant the news. We don't have to. It comes naturally to most reporters."
<p>
Reciting the story, he noted that Engberg showed Forbes saying the "economy can grow twice as fast if we remove `obstacles,' starting with the tax code. Mr. Forbes may be right or wrong about this, so Mr. Engberg lets us know which it is. `Time Out!' he shouts in his signature style. `Economists say nothing like that has ever actually happened.'"  
<p>
Next, Engberg showed Forbes asserting "A flat tax would enable the economy to grow. That would mean more revenue for Washington." To that "Engberg tells the audience: `That was called supply- side economics under President Reagan. Less taxes equal more revenue. It didn't work out that way.'" Engberg then allowed an economist from the Brookings Institution, which he failed to label as liberal, to predict the same thing would happen again. 
<p>
Goldberg wondered: "But haven't other experts argued that we wound end up with `hideous deficits' not because of the tax cut but because of increased spending?"
<p>
Engberg offered this snide hit: "OK, how about Forbes' number one wackiest flat tax promise?" In a clip, Forbes explained how "parents would have more time to spend with their children, and with each other." Goldberg queried, "can you imagine, in your wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Clinton's health care plan `wacky?'" Engberg concluded: "The fact is, the flat tax is one giant untested theory. One economist suggested that before we risk putting it in, we ought to try it out someplace, like maybe Albania." 
<p>
"Reality Check," Goldberg explained, "suggests the viewers are going to get the facts. And then they can make up their mind. As Mr. Engberg might put it: `Time Out!' You'd have a better chance of getting the facts someplace else -- like Albania."

<h3>Networks Scared of Flat Tax<br>
Furious At Forbes</h3>
<p>
The higher Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes rose in the polls, the more reporters felt compelled to discredit his flat tax proposal, often by trying to stir class envy.
<p>
In the February 8 Investor's Business Daily reporter Thomas McArdle uncovered the agenda. In mid-January ABC News interviewed Alvin Rabushka, a Senior Fellow with the Hoover Institution and an architect of the flat tax idea, for a Peter Jennings piece. 
Rabushka told McArdle that "the cameras rolled for an hour, and throughout the hour, over and over again, he kept trying to get me to agree it would be a tax on the middle class, if not in the long run, then at least in the interim period. And over and over I wouldn't say it." Rabushka concluded that Jennings just wanted to "get me to say the 18-second soundbite he wanted to use to discredit Steve Forbes."
<p>
Indeed, Rabushka did not appear in Jennings' January 15 World News Tonight story in which he tagged the flat tax as "a very radical notion." Jennings wondered "Will plumbers be hurt more than plutocrats? President Clinton believes that middle class homeowners will see the value of their homes go down if there is no mortgage deduction. And charities worry about how generous folks will be if their contribution is no longer deductible. Certainly the rich would do better than the middle class."
<p>
Two days later NBC's Mike Jensen looked at three families, concluding as fact: "For poor and middle class families, critics say the 17 percent flat tax is a cruel hoax, that to avoid big deficits, it would have to be much higher than 17 percent. So not only would it fail to help the poor, it would increase taxes for most middle class Americans."
<p>
Nightline devoted its February 1 edition to a 30-minute assault. Robert Krulwich went through four supposed benefits of the flat tax, concluding each was wrong. As for fairness, he decided that "it doesn't seem fair that while" millionaire candidate Morry Taylor "pays zero tax on his $15 million" in stock sales, "his employees -- because they're not getting stock, they're on a salary -- they pay a 17 percent tax on their money; but that's what happens when you eliminate capital gains."
<p>
As for whether it's simpler, Krulwich decided it's not because not everyone will really be able to do their taxes on a postcard. Moving on to the third claim of lower taxes for everyone, he countered: "Sounds wonderful, but then Forbes' tax helps some more than others, especially wealthy families. Still, somebody must lose and the government could be the big loser. Forbes' tax could cut government revenues by $40 billion a year or $180 billion, depending upon who you ask, which means deeper cuts in programs" or bigger deficits.
<p>
On the last claim, that it "will be good for the economy," he explained how "Forbes is an old-fashioned, kick-up-your-heels optimist. He believes if you don't tax savings, people will save a lot more. If you don't tax investment income, people will invest a lot more, and in the end, the economy will grow a lot more." He countered that "history does not bless Steve Forbes' optimism." For the rest of the show Ted Koppel interviewed two opponents: Newsweek columnist Robert Samuelson and the magazine's Wall Street editor Allan Sloan, who sneered, "when I first heard it, I almost fell on the floor laughing wondering how anyone could take it seriously."

<h3>Global Warming Shtick Returns<br>
The Heat Is Off </h3>
<p>
Snow in Arizona, ice in Mississippi, and record low temperatures in between? It must be global warming. So said Newsweek's January 22 cover story: "The Hot Zone: Blizzards, Floods, & Hurricanes: Blame Global Warming."
<p>
Senior Writer Sharon Begley promoted Goddard Institute scientist James Hansen (an early and influential exponent of global warming). The story included a graph claiming, "The average surface temperature of the earth has risen more than 1.5 degrees in the last 135 years."
<p>
Begley noted how some scientists are skeptical, but didn't detail their evidence. Instead, she concluded by endorsing Hansen's theory of immenent climate change, writing "to many people trudging along streets lined with urban Himalayas last week, it already has."
Reporter Bob Dotson fingered the same suspect to explain the weather on the February 2 Dateline NBC: "Despite the cold, last year was the hottest on record. Mix those two extremes, says Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, and stir with global warming." Dotson failed to tell viewers that Oppeheimer is a long-time promoter of warming scenarios for the liberal Environmental Defense Fund. 
<p>
Both got their data from the University of East Anglia, whose climate researchers anointed 1995 the warmest year ever after measuring the Earth's surface temperature for the first 11 months of data, making an "educated guess" about December.
<p>
Oops.
<p>
Reporter Kathy Sawyer in the January 26 Washington Post pointed out "Temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere plummeted in December by almost 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit," a drop "unprecedented in the 17-year satellite record." She cited figures from NOAA, whose satellite data showed that out of 17 years included in their research, "1995 was only about the eighth-warmest year." 
Ronald Bailey, producer of Ben Wattenberg's Think Tank on PBS wrote in the February 5 Weekly Standard that "One climate scientist at NASA speculated that the East Anglia group was afraid that if they waited, December temperatures might plummet and they'd lose their opportunity for a scary headline." Bailey suggested a more accurate headline: "'95 Eighth-Warmest Year on Record."

<h3>Knowledgeable Limbaugh Dittoheads<br>
Not The Media Caricature</h3>
<p>
In his just published book, Hot Talk: All Talk, All the Time, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz argues that talk radio, especially Rush Limbaugh, has a corrosive effect on society as hosts heighten division and spread misinformation. But a new poll by Kurtz' own newspaper found that listening to Limbaugh may be the antidote, not the cause, of public ignorance as his listeners are among the best informed Americans.
<p>
A major Washington Post survey revealed an incredible level of ignorance as 40 percent of the public could not name the Vice President, 47 percent failed to identify the House Speaker, 66 percent had no idea who is U.S. Senate Majority Leader, 94 percent were unable to name the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and 58 percent thought the U.S. spends more on foreign aid than Medicare. 
<p>
But Limbaugh listeners are in a better league. As the Post noted January 29, "They are much more knowledgeable than most about what goes on inside the Beltway and, although they are among the least trusting of the federal government, they are also among the most politically engaged voters." Over 80 percent are registered voters, "compared to only a quarter of non-dittoheads."
<p>
The poll demonstrated just how far off the mark reporters have been. In a January 1995 NBC Nightly News Bob Faw asked whether "talk radio is not democracy in action, but democracy run amok." Writing a Washington Post book review last May former CBS and NBC reporter Marvin Kalb charged: "Cut off the funding for NPR, or gradually reduce its funding to the point where it becomes a mere shadow of its usual robust, sensible self, and the American people may find themselves left with nothing much more than Rush and dozens of his mini-clones for information about the world. For Limbaugh's `dittoheads,' this may be the most splendid of tomorrows, but for other more thoughtful listeners, it may be the bleakest of forecasts." 
<p>
Six in ten Limbaugh listeners "have very little confidence in the news media." Sounds like dittoheads have a better understanding of the media than the media have of them.

<h2><center>Revolving Door from the February 1996 MediaWatch</center></h2>
<p>
<h3>NBC Goes Left with Moyers</h3>
<p>
Three months after the electorate rejected liberal policies, NBC News decided to hire Bill Moyers, a Democratic political activist and left-wing crusader on PBS since leaving CBS News in 1986, to offer commentary on its third place Nightly News. A Deputy Director of the Peace Corps and Press Secretary to President Lyndon Johnson, Moyers began his new duties on February 14, though he will continue his PBS work. NBC has no plans to provide a conservative counter-weight.
<p>
The New York Times relayed February 1 that NBC News President Andy Lack dismissed questions about Moyers' liberal bias at PBS, insisting "that perception is inside the beltway, and perhaps inside about ten blocks of New York and ten blocks of L.A. I don't think the American people give a whit about it." The same day the Baltimore Sun quoted Moyers: "I'm not in politics. I have no agenda. I'm not pushing a platform. I have no ideology."
<p>
Really? In a 1989 Esquire profile Moyers tagged Newt Gingrich "Joe McCarthy with a southern accent." Some other non-ideological quotes:
<p>
From a March 1991 address to the Democratic Issues Conference: "I was raised on mother's milk and Roosevelt speeches, and over the years, I still cherish the party's defining stands." Taking on Democrats from the left, he charged: "By the 1980s, when the Democrats in Congress colluded with Ronald Reagan and the Republicans to revise the tax code on behalf of the rich, it appeared the party had lost its soul."
<p>
In comments during the 1992 PBS press tour: "What liberalism is, is a belief that a democracy like ours has to be tolerant. Has to open itself to ideas, that the answer to a bad idea is a better idea. Civility. I mean, I'd like to think that's what liberalism is. I define myself in that sense as a liberal." On conservatives: "I find it very hard to have intelligent conversations with people on the right wing because they want to hit first and ask questions later. And I just simply don't let that criticism set my agenda." 
<p>
From a September 1991 Washington Post Magazine interview: "The right gets away with blaming liberals for their efforts to help the poor, but what the right is really objecting to is the fact that the poor are primarily black. The man who sits in the White House today [George Bush] opposed the Civil Rights Act. So did Ronald Reagan. This crowd is really fighting a retroactive civil rights war to prevent the people they dislike because of their color from achieving success in American life."
<p>
After Mario Cuomo's 1992 Democratic convention speech, he declared on CNN: "It's worth dying prematurely so you can hear someone else do your eulogy if that someone is Mario Cuomo."
<p>
Following a 1989 PBS re-broadcast of his 1982 CBS Reports: People Like Us, he insisted: "The documentary has held up as both true and sadly prophetic. While Congress restored some of the cuts made in those first Reagan budgets, in the years since, the poor and the working poor have born the brunt of the cost of the Reagan Revolution. The hardest-hit programs have been welfare, housing and other anti-poverty measures. Even programs that were not cut have failed to keep up with inflation. Meanwhile, rich people got big tax breaks. And the middle class kept most of their subsidies intact. As a result, the Reagan years brought on a wider gap between rich and poor."
<p>
In his 1992 PBS show Listening to America, he asked candidate Bill Clinton: "What do you think the American people get for their government? We have no universal health care, we have no federal guarantee of higher education...The regulatory agencies in many cases have been gutted...Why not just say `We will have universal health care and we will raise taxes to pay for it?'"  
Sounds like he'll feel quite comfortable reporting to NBC Nightly News Executive Producer Jeff Gralnick, Press Secretary to then-Senator George McGovern in 1972.

<center><h2>Study, from the February 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>A Social Problem Blamed on Reaganomics Fades Away in Clinton-Era Media Coverage<br>
The Incredible Shrinking Homeless</h3>
<p>
The poor may have always been with us, but the network news has often presented homelessness as a problem created by the Reagan adminstration. 
<p>
"In the 1980s, the Reagan years, the amount of government money spent to build low-income housing was cut drastically. Then the homeless began to appear on streets and in doorsteps and housing became a visible human problem," proclaimed then-NBC anchor Garrick Utley on November 3, 1990. ABC's John Martin told the same tale in reporting a 1989 homelessness march: "They staged the biggest rally on behalf of the homeless since the Reagan revolution forced severe cutbacks in government housing programs."
<p>
It mattered little that budget experts John Cogan and Timothy Muris noted in The American Enterprise in 1990 that "while budget authority for subsidized housing programs declined 77 percent (from 1981-89), the number of subsidized units and the number of families living in those units increased by one-third." Reporter Harold Dow recycled the same old media spin on the March 26, 1991 CBS Evening News: "In New York there are an estimated 70,000 homeless people, three million across America. A problem that got a lot worse during the boom times of the 1980s."      
<p>
So now that Bill Clinton has been in office for three years, has the ever-growing problem of homelessness continued to burden the White House? Or did the problem recede from the media's agenda? MediaWatch analysts used the MRC Media Tracking System to count the number of network evening news segments on homelessness in America on the four evening newscasts (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's Prime News or World News). Analysts found the problem faded from the  list of priorities. In the Bush years (1989-1992), the number of homeless stories per year averaged 52.5, but in the first three years of the Clinton administration, the average dropped to 25.3 stories a year.
<p>
During the Bush administration, the story count grew from 44 in 1989 to a peak of 71 in 1990, followed by 54 stories in 1991 and 43 in 1992. By contrast, stories on America's homeless dipped slightly to 35 stories in 1993, and 32 in 1994. In 1995, the number fell dramatically to just nine. When the count is broken down by network, CNN had the widest gap in reporting during the Bush years and Clinton years (90-30), closely followed by ABC (45-16), CBS (41-15), and NBC (36-15).
<p>
But the numbers alone do not tell the whole story. The decline in homeless coverage coincided with the lessening of unsupported statistics about the size of the homeless population. CNN anchor Lou Waters announced on August 8, 1989: "A new research report is warning that homelessness in this country could easily double or triple if there is a mild recession...there now are up to 40 million Americans living on the knife edge of homelessness, just one paycheck, one domestic argument from the streets."
<p>
The willingness to wildly extrapolate the number of America's homeless began to change slightly in 1991, when the Census Bureau's partial count of the homeless in shelters and on the street reported an estimate of 220,000 homeless Americans. All four networks reported on the Census count the night it occurred (March 20, 1990). But when the Census Bureau released its official report announcing a count of 220,000 on April 12, 1991, only CNN reported it. ABC referred to the estimate on May 9, but only to note that congressional sources claimed the estimate was "meaningless."
<p>
While the stories in the Bush era regularly blamed Republican administrations, not one of the 75 homeless stories in the last three years has placed any blame on the Clinton administration. On January 21, 1993, ABC featured a report on the gaudiness of the Clinton inauguration, which reporter Judy Muller concluded: "The Republicans were criticized for their show of wealth in the face of need. The Democrats seemed to have avoided such criticism. Perhaps because President Clinton has promised to help those less fortunate. For now, not many people seem to begrudge Bill Clinton his night on the town, considering the sobering realities he faces the morning after."
<p>
Indeed, in a March 12, 1995 NBC story, reporter Giselle Fernandez warned of the consequences if congressional Republicans succeeded in trimming spending on homeless aid programs in a small $17 billion rescission bill: "Across the nation there are an estimated 20,000 homeless families. And social workers worry the crisis will only worsen if the new Congress keeps its promise and makes deep cuts in bedrock social programs and especially in public housing." Fernandez did not explain why the networks did not blame this problem on the Clinton administration: they announced plans to spend a whopping $2.1 billion in fiscal 1995 on homeless aid, more than three times the $550 million spent in the last year of the Bush administration. To NBC, reducing this dramatic increase was a "deep cut."
<p>
The only story that MediaWatch analysts found on ABC  in 1995 was an anchor brief by Catherine Crier: "A new report today from the advocacy group Children's Defense Fund finds life for millions of American children still filled with poverty and violence. In its new yearbook, the group cites Census Bureau figures showing nearly 16 million children living in poverty last year, the highest level since 1964, and among the homeless, one in four is a child." In other words, the liberal group that used to be chaired by Hillary Clinton has noted that child poverty by one measure is the worst in thirty years, but ABC never wondered whether the Clinton administration could be at fault. 
<p>
The network trend of slowly dropping the story of homelessness, and quickly transforming the issue from an indicator of Republican economic failure to a nonpartisan social problem, suggests that politics more than journalism is at play. Homelessness served as a negative campaign tool against the Republican intention to curb the unending growth of federal spending on social programs.

<P>
<H3>CBS Reporter Smears Pat Buchanan by Connecting Him to the Ku Klux Klan<BR>
-- McNamara Tries Guilt by Association </H3>
<P>
After newscasts highlighted the story of Larry Pratt, the Pat 
Buchanan campaign co-chairman who resigned to combat the discovery 
that he spoke in a number of forums where racists and other bigots 
appeared, liberal Boston Globe columnist Tom Oliphant loaded his 
February 20 column with friendly fire: "For liberals to be silent 
simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the 
Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
If the networks wished to investigate the charge of bigotry against 
Buchanan, they had a library of columns and an archive of video 
clips to spend weeks hunting through for examples. Instead of doing 
the hard work of combing the minutiae of his paper (and TV) trail, 
the networks decided to practice guilt by association, suggesting 
his campaign appeal is too indiscriminate, too likely to appeal to 
bigots. 
<P>
In a February 23 Nightline, ABC's Ted Koppel refined the issue: 
"It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly 
anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has 
created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts 
or statements by others." Koppel not only suggested Buchanan's 
father was a regular listener to the anti-Semitic radio show of 
Father Coughlin (he later apologized when the family denied this), 
he even stooped to accusing Buchanan's little brothers of having 
beaten up Jewish kids in the 1950s.  This is odd coming from 
Koppel, who said of Bill Clinton's 1969 draft-dodging thank-you 
letter: "If we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and 
thought and felt at that time would be germane."  
<P> 
Koppel ended his show with a pro-Buchanan letter from Russian 
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky charging Israel controls America's 
finances "through American Jews or Negroes." Koppel concluded: 
"It's not that Buchanan hasn't expressed some of the views that 
Zhirinovsky echoed, but perhaps he'd never realized how ugly they 
sounded until he heard them in the mouth of a genuine bigot." 
For a desperate search for damaging Buchanan allies, the other 
networks could not match CBS. For finding Buchanan guilty by 
association with people he's either repudiated or never heard of, 
CBS reporter Bob McNamara won the March Janet Cooke Award.  
On the February 28 Evening News, Dan Rather began the story: "For 
his part, Buchanan vowed to come back big in the next phase of 
primaries and immediately, quote, `lit into' Forbes during a 
southern campaign swing today, lit into Forbes as too liberal. At 
the same time, Buchanan is trying to deflect criticism that he is 
an extremist, who, at the very least, uses code words to attract 
voters with racist, bigoted views. Buchanan flatly denies this. 
Correspondent Bob Mc- Namara has been looking into it." 
 <P>
McNamara moved quickly to the issue of Buchanan's fans: "They were 
waiting 3,000 strong for Pat Buchanan outside Atlanta last night. 
They say they've been waiting for years... Here, his call to take 
back the country is a crowd pleaser. But outside the campaign, 
critics charge that Buchanan's rhetoric is making this race about 
race. And the man and his ideas are now beginning to be judged by 
the company they keep." 
<P> 
McNamara explained: "Lurking in the shadows of last month's 
Louisiana campaign, there was former Klan leader David Duke." Duke 
told CBS: "I let the word out to all my supporters in the state 
that I supported Patrick Buchanan, and if Patrick goes on to win 
the nomination, I guess part of the credit will have to go to us."  
McNamara  allowed a perfunctory rebuttal: "It is not an endorsement 
Buchanan wants, and today his backers took pains to distance their 
man from charges of extremism on economics and immigration, race, 
and religion." CBS aired Buchanan backer Rabbi Aryeh Spero: "This 
is a guilt by association, which is very dangerous to our whole 
political system." 
<P>
Focusing on racism, McNamara countered: "Today, even in the New 
South, old ideas have not been completely laid to rest. And for 
people uncomfortable with the way the world has changed, Buchanan's 
message is hitting home....Danny Carver is a roofing contractor, a 
Christian, and a lifetime member of the Ku Klux Klan. He says he 
and Buchanan speak the same language." Carver told McNamara: "About 
everything he says we agree with....When he's talking about 
affirmative action he has to be talking about women and niggers, I 
guess." McNamara asked: "Do you think Buchanan would want to hear 
that you support him?" Carver replied: "He would want to hear it, 
but he don't want it on TV." 
<P>
CBS didn't explain how Carver came to their attention. He's not an 
unknown, but a self-promoting semi-regular on Howard Stern's 
syndicated radio show. Stern, who's Jewish and calls Carver a 
"lunatic," has featured him as the butt of humor on his Butt Bongo 
Fiesta video (where he struck out in the game "Guess Who's the 
Jew"), and as a judge of the topless "Miss Howard Stern" contest in  
a 1993 New Year's Eve pay-per-view special. 
<P>
McNamara concluded: "The Buchanan campaign said tonight that it 
adamantly rejects all forms of racism as immoral, saying that their 
campaign is, quote, `populated by people who embrace the sense of 
justice in the Old and New Testament.' But he has become a 
candidate battling a political Catch-22. A man who says what he 
means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of 
people who think they know exactly what he is talking about." CBS 
News spokeswoman Kim Apgar told MediaWatch "I can't speak to this. 
You need McNamara." But CBS could not locate a number where 
McNamara could be reached. 
<P>
While CBS attempted to connect Buchanan with neo-Nazis and the KKK, 
they have been critical of any look at the associations of Bill 
Clinton. In October 1992, The Washington Times and others 
investigated Clinton's role in the anti-Vietnam war movement. 
Father Richard McSorley's book Peace Eyes recounts Clinton's role 
as an organizer of a protest service that ended in a march to the 
U.S. embassy with white crosses, left "as an indication of our 
desire to end the agony of Vietnam." McSorley reported the 
protest's organizers were "Group 68 (Americans in Britain)," which 
"had the support" of the British Peace Council, a Soviet front 
group.  
<P>
After Clinton's anti-war involvement came up in the first 
presidential debate, CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith declared 
on October 12: "Clearly, that red-baiting junk didn't work last 
night." The networks aired no stories questioning "the company 
Clinton keeps" or suggesting "It's not that Clinton has signaled 
through acts or statements his support for the Soviet Union, but 
that he created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to 
such acts or statements." They called it a smear. Guilt by 
association is clearly a game reporters play on only one side.

<P>
In an attack uglier than any of this year's attack ads, Time
national correspondent Jack E. White announced the culprits behind
black church burnings in the South. After blaming Pat Buchanan's
"ugly rhetoric" in the March 18 issue, he broadened the smear: "In
fact, all the conservative Republicans, from Newt Gingrich to Pete
Wilson, who have sought political advantage by exploiting white
resentment should come and stand in the charred ruins of the New
Liberty Baptist Church in Tyler [Alabama]...and wonder if their
coded phrases encouraged the arsonists. Over the past 18 months,
while Republicans fulminated about welfare and affirmative action,
more than 20 churches in Alabama and six other Southern and Border
states have been torched."
<P>
White noted the current lack of evidence of a racist conspiracy in
the bombings, yet concluded: "But there is already enough evidence
to indict the cynical conservatives who build their political
careers, George Wallace-style, on a foundation of race-baiting.
They may not start fires, but they fan the flames." 
<P>
<a name=rooting>
<H3>Rooting Against Rush.</H3>
<P>
Tom Brokaw may have engaged in wishful thinking on the February 14
Nightly News when he devoted the "NBC News Online" to the alleged
fall of Rush Limbaugh. Brokaw claimed "Election results are one way
to tell who's hot in politics. Then there are the ratings in this
business." Brokaw charged that Limbaugh's "radio and television
ratings have tumbled, and his books, once huge best-sellers, now
are in the discount bins." He added a plug for the book Rush
Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot by Al Franken, a fellow NBC employee:
"And a book about Limbaugh, by the comedian Al Franken, is riding
high, it's number two behind Hillary Clinton's book and rising
fast."
<P>
But as Talkers magazine Editor Michael Harrison noted in the March
3 Washington Times, Limbaugh's ratings "dropped a marginal,
insignificant amount" in the fall. "The guy belches in ratings, and
everyone runs around as if the witch is dead," Harrison said. He
noted Limbaugh is on 650 radio stations, with a total audience more
than double his closest political talk show competition. 
<P>
Linda Cecere of the Rush Limbaugh television show told MediaWatch
there are 8.9 million copies of Limbaugh's two books currently in
print, and noted the books have spent a total of 114 weeks on the
New York Times bestseller list (hardcover and paperback). His first
book spent 24 weeks at the #1 spot. Brokaw ignored how virtually
all bestsellers with a big press run are eventually discounted.
<P>
<a name=friends>
<H3>With Friends Like These.... </H3>
<P>
During the usually contentious primary season the media focused on
Republican rifts, but ignored Democratic divisions over their party
leader. With two exceptions the networks failed to report attacks
on President Clinton from two prominent Democrats. In an interview
with Washington Post reporter Martha Sherrill in the January issue
of Esquire magazine Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) insisted:
"Clinton's an unusually good liar." Kerrey's extraordinary
admission received very little coverage. Tim Russert, prompted by
a Washington Times article, asked Colorado Gov. Roy Romer about the
Kerrey quote on the February 4 Meet the Press.
<P>
CNN's Bernard Shaw briefly mentioned the quote on the February 6
Inside Politics, and added the remarks of Sen. Ernest Hollings
(D-S.C.) who joked of Clinton's poll ratings: "If they get up to 60
percent, his people tell me Bill can start dating again." Shaw also
relayed a Hollings quote from a South Carolina paper: "Clinton's as
popular as AIDS in South Carolina." The Hollings quotes received no
coverage in the usually AIDS-sensitive television networks of ABC,
NBC and CBS. By contrast, in December 1994 when Senator Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.) joked that Clinton was so unpopular that he had better
bring bodyguards if he visited any military bases, the Helms remark
generated nine stories on the three broadcast network evening news
shows.

In the weeks following the Oklahoma City bombing, the news media
were quick to portray suspect Timothy McVeigh unsympathetically as
a violent extremist, as well they should. But when 26-year-old Lori
Berenson was sentenced to life in prison by a Peruvian military
tribunal for being closely involved with the Marxist terrorists of
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), the news media tried
to portray her sympathetically as a concerned American who went to
Latin America to work for the poor. 
<P>
Although she admitted to being affiliated with the MRTA, the
January 22 Time didn't feel that was important: "Her friends and
relatives know Lori Berenson as a compassionate idealist, an
innocent waylaid by her concern for the poor and oppressed of Latin
America." Time concluded: "But Berenson's real passion was always
to help the downtrodden; as a teenager she donated time to a soup
kitchen." A February 4 Washington Post headline read: "Little Girl
Lost. American Lori Berenson, 26, Was a Good Daughter, A Good
Worker, a Good-Hearted Person. In Peru, She Got Into Trouble. Bad
Trouble." On February 21, ABC Prime Time Live reporter John
Quinones used the same approach in a story titled "To Love A
Country": "In the 8th grade, Lori volunteered to work at a soup
kitchen. Later that year she was selected to narrate a commercial
for CARE, an appeal to feed needy children."
<P>
This theme was countered by a Mark Falcoff article in the February
26 issue of The Weekly Standard: "But let the record show that she
is charged not for her views, but for her involvement with a
terrorist group that, in recent years, has been involved in
assassinations, bombings, kidnappings, robberies, and attacks
against innocent people, many of them poor."
<P>

<H3>Ethics Absentees</H3>
<P>
The networks continue to ignore ethics complaints against
Democratic leaders of the House of Representatives. In early
February, the networks saw no need for a story when Rep. Jennifer
Dunn (R-Wash.) filed a complaint with the House ethics committee
suggesting House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt may have evaded
capital gains taxes on a land swap.  
<P>
The February 23 Washington Times reported that Gephardt dumped his
share of ownership of the vacation home on North Carolina's Outer
Banks. George Archibald wrote that Gephardt, who is an avid
opponent of capital gains tax cuts, "claimed for
financial-disclosure purposes that his condo was not a rental
property the year he sold it for $183,000. He simultaneously
claimed it as a rental property for tax purposes to escape capital
gains taxes of about $17,000 in 1991." Archibald struck again with
a March 6 piece in the Washington Times noting that Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.) formally requested the Justice Department undertake a
criminal probe of Gephardt's tax situation. Neither story piqued
the networks' curiosity.
<P>
On March 6, the conservative Landmark Legal Foundation filed a
complaint against House MinorityWhip David Bonior, the ethical
scold of Speaker Newt Gingrich, for misusing his congressional
staff to write a 1984 book on government time. The networks didn't
cover that either.

"This morning we're taking a close look at the problem of child
care, a problem some countries are solving," co-host Harry Smith
announced on the February 21 CBS This Morning. The country with the
solution? France and its expensive, old-style socialist system. 
<P>
Smith marveled at the state-mandated benefits: "Like all new
mothers in France, Helene took a 16-week paid maternity leave from
her job. In addition, mothers who work for larger companies can
take off two more years unpaid, with the guarantee their jobs will
still be there when they get back." To support this system, Smith
admitted that taxes are "much higher in France than in the United
States...and that may be why they're going through some of their
own economic problems." But, incredibly, he also referred to the
system as free: "When Jeanne leaves day care, she can attend a
completely free, good quality, state-run pre-school where she stays
until she is six and primary school begins."  Smith followed the
segment with an interview of Ellen Galinsky of the liberal Families
and Work Institute. His first question was more accusation: "In the
United States, are we just not willing to pay for child care?"

<H3>ABC vs. the First Amendment</H3>
<P>
A special interest group wants to use the coercive power of the
government to silence the opposition. ABC News naturally comes down
on the side of free speech, right? Not quite. Here's how Peter
Jennings introduced a February 14 World News Tonight story:
"Supporters of gun control, who had no success convincing a
Republican Congress to pass stronger gun control legislation, have
adopted a new tactic. They have asked the Federal Trade Commission
to stop certain advertisements by gun manufacturers."
<P>
Lisa Stark explained that the ads "sell safety and security,
offering guns as a way to protect loved ones, to guard home and
family. But critics say this picture is deceptive and misleading."
After a soundbite from Sarah Brady, Stark elaborated: "Gun control
advocates point to tragedies you won't find in the ads. In Texas,
a teenager shot and killed, mistaken for a burglar by her father;
in California, a four-year-old shoots himself," and a 15-year-old
"killed by his best friend." 
<P>
Stark asserted that "scientific studies show handguns are more
likely to hurt family members than protect them." ABC aired three
soundbites from opponents of the gun ads, but only one from Tanya
Metaksa of the National Rifle Association. Metaksa was only allowed
to defend the right to air ads, not to counter the liberal
statistics about gun accidents. If Stark had any interest in
balance, she could have noted that Dr. Arthur Kellerman, a fervent
gun control advocate, explained in the August 14, 1994 U.S. News &
World Report that "Studies such as ours do not include cases in
which intruders are wounded or frightened away by the use or
display of a firearm." Last year in his book Guns, David Kopel
noted that bicycle and swimming pool accidents kill more children
annually than do guns. If ABC wants the FTC to regulate
advertisements from weapon manufacturers, then who will regulate
the network's own gun control ads disguised as journalism?
<P>
<a name=episcopal>
<H3>The Episcopalian Inquisition?</H3>
<P>
The word inquisition brings to mind torture sessions in dark
castles in medieval Europe where unbelievers were strapped to the
rack until they swore allegiance to the church. Recently, the
networks used the word to describe whether the Episcopal Church
should allow a practicing homosexual minister to lead church
services.
<P>
Peter Jennings led off the rhetorical overkill about Bishop Walter
Righter on the February 27 World News Tonight: "This next story in
the news tonight may conjure the Spanish Inquisition for some but
the dateline is Wilmington, Delaware. A retired bishop could become
the second Episcopal priest in the two hundred year history of the
U.S. Episcopal Church to be tried for heresy, the most serious
breach of Christian faith. His offense: ordaining a practicing
homosexual five years ago."
<P>
On the same night's CBS Evening News, reporter Richard Threlkeld
referred to the trial as something "right out of the middle ages"
and stated that "critics charge Bishop Righter's the victim of a
conservative inquisition." The idea that conservative bishops
inside the Episcopal Church wanted to enforce church doctrine left
Threlkeld scratching his head: "It's ironic that something so
medieval should be happening within the Episcopal Church, one of
the more tolerant of Protestant denominations."

<H3>Networks Ignore Clinton Ally's Coalition-Building with Louis Farrakhan<BR>
--Reserving Rebukes for Buchanan</H3>
<P>
When the liberal Center for Public Integrity released a report
February 15 showing Larry Pratt, co-chairman of the Pat Buchanan
campaign, had attended and spoken before meetings of white
supremacists and anti-semites, it led all the network evening
newscasts. Some made Buchanan guilty by association. "Pat Buchanan
was caught today in his own crossfire with accusations that he is
running a campaign of hate and bigotry," declared Phil Jones on
CBS. 
<P>
But five days later, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore attended the
swearing in of Kweisi Mfume as President of the NAACP, the networks
refused to make an issue of Mfume's links to the Nation of Islam's
Louis Farrakhan. The four network evening shows didn't even mention
the event.
<P>
As New York Post editorial page editor Eric Breindel pointed out
February 29, Mfume "helped forge the 1993 `Sacred Covenant' between
the Congressional Black Caucus, which Mfume chaired, and Louis
Farrakhan's Nation of Islam." Surely, asked Breindel, "the
fringe-right groups with which Larry Pratt associates are no more
pernicious than the Farrakhanites." 
<P>
Pratt, head of Gun Owners of America, immediately took a leave of
absence from the Buchanan campaign. "Mfume, by contrast," Breindel
noted, "hasn't manifested any inclination to distance himself from
Farrakhan....the ex-Congressman hasn't even been asked to do so."
Not even after Farrakhan praised the leaders of Libya, Iraq and
Iran during a world trip. Farrakhan accepted a $1 billion pledge
from Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi for his separatist
organization to "mobilize `oppressed' minorities to influence this
year's U.S. elections," The Washington Post reported February 17,
three days before Clinton stood beside Mfume.  
<P>
Back in the U.S., Farrakhan offered some fresh anti-semitism. In a
clip shown February 29 on Rush Limbaugh, he said: "When you bring
me before Congress, I'm going to call the roll of all the
Congressmen who are honorary members of the Israeli Knesset and get
contributions from the Zionist AIPAC, and then I want you to
register as a foreign power! Every year you give Israel $46 billion
of the taxpayers' money and you haven't asked the taxpayers one
damn thing. Who are you an agent of?"
<P>
Did reporters demand Clinton explain his support of Farrakhan
backer Mfume? No, they were too busy tarnishing Buchanan. In a
February 23 NBC Nightly News piece, Gwen Ifill proffered to
Buchanan: "People say that you are a sexist, a racist, an
anti-semite." Ifill concluded that "Buchanan fancies himself a
trench-fight-er, a warrior for a new conservatism of the heart. But
increasingly he's being judged by the company he keeps." That's not
a judgment reporters made of Clinton.

<H3>Poor, Poor OSHA</H3>
<P>
The Congress may have failed so far to pass a regulatory reform
bill, but The Washington Post is warning of the consequences of
"deregulation" nonetheless. In a four-part February 18-21 series
titled "De Facto Deregulation," Post reporters didn't so much
describe "deregulation" as they did the frustration of regulators
and their political allies at their inability to implement
additional rules.
<P>
In the first story, reporter Cindy Skrzycki did feature opinions
from the "libertarian" Cato Institute and the "conservative"
National Center for Public Policy Research, but leftist Ralph Nader
was simply a "consumer activist." Despite their prominence in  the
series, liberal groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council
(NRDC) were not described as liberal.
<P>
Stephen Barr's story on the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) read like a bureaucrat's newsletter,
beginning with the headline "Cuts Frustrate OSHA Plans to Improve
Worker Safety." Barr mourned the agency's 15 percent budget
reduction and trotted out the OSHA line that it has far too few
inspectors to enforce its regulations in every business across the
nation. Barr passed on OSHA complaints that it hasn't enough money
for its office redesign plans and computer networking operations.
Barr added that its employees "likely will lose part of their
salaries through unpaid furlough days....The possibility of layoffs
has flattened morale at OSHA and left many OSHA employees feeling
anxious about their futures." 
<P>
Barr didn't address the philosophical point of new congressional
oversight -- that for decades, regulatory agencies had no check or
balance in the legislative branch -- or the obvious counterpoint
that OSHA's actions have often caused economic frustrations and
anxieties to businesses.
<P>
In the last article of the series, reporter Gary Lee mourned the
failure to implement new revisions from the 1990 Clean Air Act
reauthorization. As David Hawkins of the NRDC complained in the
series' last paragraph: "We'll never be able to get clean air in
areas like [Baltimore or Houston] without stricter enforcement of
the act." Apparently to the Post, "deregulation" doesn't mean the
repeal of regulations, but merely slowing down the juggernaut of
ever-increasing government interference.

<H3>CBS Spikes Goldberg for His Honesty--Blew the Wrong Whistle</H3>
<P>
What a difference the message makes. After 60 Minutes last fall
spiked part of an interview with Jeffrey Wigand, the ex-Brown &
Williamson cigarette company executive, CBS reporters were angry
and embarrassed that Wigand's confidentiality pledge prevented him
from blowing the whistle on his former employer. On February 4, CBS
overcame the legal hurdle and aired the spiked charges about
manipulated nicotine levels. On PBS's Charlie Rose February 6 Dan
Rather said that story "was gutsy, great reporting."
<P>
Fast forward a week and CBS correspondent Bernard Goldberg blew the
whistle on CBS, detailing in a February 13 Wall Street Journal
op-ed how colleague Eric Engberg's story on the flat tax "set new
standards for bias." Goldberg explained that "The old argument that
the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so
blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore."
<P>
So did journalists trumpet this whistle-blower? Hardly. "It's such
a wacky charge....I don't know what Bernie was driving at. It just
sounds bizarre," Face the Nation's Bob Schieffer told The
Washington Post. "To accuse Eric of liberal bias is absurd,"
sniffed CBS News President Andrew Heyward. "The test is not the
names people call you or accusations by political activists inside
or outside your own organization," Rather told the New York Post in
an insult to Goldberg's professionalism, insisting "I am not going
to be cowed by anybody's special political agenda."
<P>
USA Today's Peter Johnson reported March 11: "Some colleagues
supported him privately. But many others stopped talking to him,
dismissing him as dead wrong, an ingrate, a nut or all of the
above. Mostly, the big chill set in. Not-so-coincidentally, none of
his commentary segments on the News, `Bernard Goldberg's America,'
has aired since the day his piece came out."
<P>
Johnson concluded that CBS has decided to bully the messenger:
"Goldberg has spent the past month lying low, hoping animus toward
him would die down. It hasn't, and all signs around CBS News are
that it will continue until Goldberg shows interest in eating a
healthy serving of humble pie." 
<P>
The March 13 New York Post reported that Goldberg apologized to
Engberg and is sorry if he "hurt anyone's feelings." But Goldberg
felt he had to go public since, as he explained to the Post's Josef
Adalian, he "tried for years and years to discuss this issue," but
was "met with varying degrees of `Who cares?'"

Two network veterans have joined the effort to re-elect President 
Clinton. In the Clinton-Gore campaign office, Roll Call reported that 
Joseph Lockhart, who bounces between Democratic presidential campaigns 
and network slots, has bounced again, this time into the national press 
secretary slot. Lockhart was an assistant press secretary to Democratic 
candidate Walter Mondale in 1984, then Press Secretary to Senator Paul 
Simon until becoming assignment editor for ABC News in Chicago in 1985. 
He put in a stint as a deputy assignment editor at CNN before joining 
the 1988 Dukakis-Bentsen campaign as a traveling press aide.
Stuart Schear, the off-air health and science reporter until last year 
for the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, has joined the White House press office 
as coordinator of local and national TV interviews with the President, 
The Washington Post reported. For the July/August 1995 Mother Jones, 
Schear wrote "a consumer guide to the health insurer's new, overheated 
advertising campaigns."
<P>
<H3>Politics in All News</H3>
<P>
ABC and Fox have chosen political operatives to head their future 
all-news cable channels. ABC News President Roone Arledge went left, 
hiring back former ABC News executive Jeff Gralnick from NBC News where 
he's been Executive Producer of the NBC Nightly News since 1993. In 1971 
Gralnick served as Press Secretary to liberal Senator George McGovern 
(D-S.D.). After promoting the future presidential candidate, Gralnick 
jumped to ABC, where by 1979 he had risen to Executive Producer of World 
News Tonight. He oversaw all election coverage for ABC since 1980, 
becoming Vice President and Executive Producer of special events in 
1985.
<P>
Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch went to the right, naming Roger Ailes, 
President of CNBC since 1993, as the chief executive of the Fox All News 
Network as well as of the Fox broadcast news operation. While  producer 
of the Mike Douglas Show in the 1960s, Ailes met Richard Nixon and left 
the show to become media adviser to the 1968 Republican candidate's 
successful run. He spent the next two decades devising media and ad 
strategies for GOP candidates, including Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
In 1992 he took the helm of the Rush Limbaugh TV show as its Executive 
Producer.

Six media veterans are making out pretty well at the White House, a June 
26, 1995 payroll report shows. The March 1 Washington Times ran the list 
of salaries of 407 White House staffers released by the Senate 
Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on the Treasury, Postal Service 
and general government.
<P>
The list shows that speechwriting head Donald Baer, a former U.S. News 
Assistant Managing Editor, earns $125,000 a year. Wall Street Journal 
and Time reporter turned speechwriter Daniel Benjamin gets $80,000, as 
do speechwriters Carolyn Curiel, a former Nightline producer, and Alison 
Muscatine, a former Washington Post reporter who also helped write First 
Lady Hillary Clinton's book It Takes a Village. Deputy Press Secretary 
Virginia Terzano, a CBS News election unit researcher in 1988, pulls 
down $66,000. At the bottom end lies Anne Edwards at $50,000, a former 
CBS News assignment editor and Senior Editor for NPR who now runs the

in Washington for ABC, jumping to the Clinton team in 1993 as Chief 
Public Affairs Officer for the Department of Defense where she remained 
through late 1994. For the past year she's been Deputy to the

Reporters don't like ideological labeling, at least when it's
applied to them. Last November, Dan Rather told Denver radio host
Mike Rosen he hated "to be tagged by someone else's label. I try
really hard not to do that with other people, particularly people
who are in public service and politics."
<P>
So do reporters use labeling in campaign coverage? MediaWatch
analysts compared media coverage of the primaries in 1992 with
those in 1996. Analysts reviewed evening news coverage of the four
networks (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly
News, and CNN's The World Today and in 1992 World News or Prime
News) for 19 days, starting with the Tuesday before the New
Hampshire primary.
<P>
For 1992, the days studied were February 11-29; in 1996, February
13-March 2, the day of the South Carolina primary. Both were 
periods when voters and reporters winnowed down the presidential
field.
<P>
The study found the Democratic candidates or their supporters were
labeled "liberal" only four times, none suggesting extremism. In
1996, GOP candidates or their supporters were labeled 73 times, 45
of the labels suggesting extremism. Analysts also looked at
campaign controveries. Five stories investigated the finances of
Republicans, compared to no investigations of the Democrats.
Charges of bigotry by  Pat Buchanan were featured in 20 stories.  
<P>
<a name=labels>
<H3>Labels.</H3>
<P>
Reporters used only four liberal labels to describe the Democratic
candidates, all in the first two days of the 1992 study period. On
February 11, NBC's Andrea Mitchell used two labels, calling Tom
Harkin "a pure liberal and proud of it" with "old-fashioned liberal
solutions." That same night, ABC's Judy Muller noted: "If Kerrey's
health plan strikes some voters as too liberal, his more
conservative proposals for dealing with the recession seem to
strike a chord with voters trying to make ends meet." The next
night, Muller said Harkin calls himself "an unabashed liberal." 
<P>
Even when the ideology seemed obvious, reporters stressed
candidates were not liberal, but part of the mainstream. On
February 12, 1992, ABC reporter Chris Bury reported on Jerry Brown:
"To those who hear him, Brown's appeal is his idealism, his calls
for political reform, universal health care, and environmental
activism." Despite that left-wing agenda, Bury underlined: "Some
voters seemed surprised Brown did not sound so radical." The
closest thing to a Clinton label came from ABC's Jack Smith, who
told viewers a week later that Clinton's economic message "runs
counter to so much traditional liberal ideology." (Did reporters
eschew labeling in 1992? No. Stories during the study period on the
1992 GOP race used the word "conservative" or "from the right" on
77 occasions, with four references to extremism.) 
<P>
In 1996, Republicans and their voters were labeled on 73 occasions.
The networks employed 18 conservative descriptions, six moderate
labels, and even four liberal tags (all of them from  reporters
quoting Buchanan's attacks on his rivals). On the 18th, NBC's David
Bloom said Lamar Alexander was "trying to bolster his conservative
credentials." But extreme terms were applied on 45 occasions -- all
but one to describe Pat Buchanan. (The exception: Bloom called 
Alexander a "moderate Republican with a radical plan of
devolution.") Among references to extremism, 36 used the terms
"extreme" or "extremist," but analysts included the terms
"ultraconservative," "too conservative" or "out of the mainstream."
<P>
CBS led the networks with 19 references to Buchanan's extremism
(compared to 12 for CNN, nine for ABC, and five by NBC). On six
occasions, CBS underlined their perception of Buchanan's
ultraconservatism by referring to the networks' Voter News Service
exit poll question asking if Buchanan was too extreme. In a
February 18 interview with Sen. Phil Gramm, Dan Rather asked:
"There is a perception that Buchanan has around him people with
extremist views on race. Do you agree?" On February 25, CBS weekend
anchor John Roberts asked CBS consultant Joe Klein: "Some call
Buchanan an extremist. Others call him as American as apple pie.
What is this fellow's appeal?" Klein replied: "He is both. He is an
extremist and as American as apple pie." 
<P>
<a name=finances>
<H3>Finances.</H3>
<P>
Reporters were not interested in the Democratic candidates'
finances in 1992, airing no stories during the study period. When
Whitewater first came to light on March 8, 1992, NBC aired only one
story, eight days later. CBS made a brief mention on the 8th, and
then dismissed financial questions on the 16th. Reporter Richard
Threlkeld portrayed Whitewater questions as an invasion of Hillary
Clinton's privacy.  All together, the networks did just five full
stories on the Clinton finances in 1992.
<P>
In 1996, CBS and NBC combined for five stories in just 19 days
touching on Republican candidate finances. NBC investigated the
sweetheart deals of Lamar Alexander on February 13, and mentioned
them again February 18. CBS investigated the Alexander deals on
February 15, then added another look at Honey Alexander's and
Elizabeth Dole's financial moves on February 17. On March 2, CBS
suggested hypocrisy in Buchanan's stock ownership of Fortune 500
corporations. On February 21, CBS reporter Rita Braver claimed
Lamar Alexander had "some financial dealings in his past that might
put Whitewater to shame."
<P>
<a name=bigotry>
<H3>Bigotry?</H3>
<P>
Sparked by the disclosure that Buchanan campaign co-chair Larry
Pratt spoke at forums shared by white supremacists, the networks
aired twenty stories raising the allegation that Buchanan was
bigoted against blacks or Jews. CBS reporter Phil Jones concluded:
"Buchanan has been talking and writing like this for years. Then,
he was on the fringe. Now, he's on the front line and Americans are
starting to take a closer look at Pat Buchanan's America." The
story count didn't include isolated soundbites, like one voter on
the March 2 CBS Evening News: "Buchanan scares me. He reminds me of
a little guy over in Germany with a mustache." 
<P>
In September 1992, Bill Clinton claimed: "Nobody's had a tougher
press than I have. No candidate in history has." Some of this
year's candidates may beg to differ.

<Center><h2>
Bright Side for April 1996 Mediawatch
</h2></center>


<b>Detecting Deception</b><br>

CNN's Brooks Jackson was first out of the gate to critique the presidential candidates in their ads and speeches. On the April 1 Inside Politics he critiqued Republican charges that Clinton judges were soft on crime. But in a surprising turn Jackson has also slammed Clinton's newest set of ads. His April 4 "Spin Patrol" segment challenged each claim made in the Democratic National Committee ads.
<p>
CNN aired the ad: "The President proposes a balanced budget protecting Medicare, education, the environment. But Dole is voting no. The President cuts taxes for 40 million Americans. Dole votes no." 
<p>
Jackson replied: "Dole voting no to a balanced budget and tax cuts? Let's see that again...True, Clinton's latest budget would balance in 7 years on paper, but experts are skeptical." Jackson used moderate-to-liberal Carol Cox Wait of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution.
<p>
Jackson found the ad's claim "The President cuts taxes for 40 million Americans" was "Not the whole story." He pointed out that the Clinton administration arrived at the 40 million number through the 1993 budget bill's expansion of the earned income tax credit to "15 million low wage families, 40 million if you count their children." Jackson countered they also raised taxes on 1.5 million high-income families and 5 million Social Security recipients, not to mention higher gas taxes for everyone.
<p>
Another ad claimed Republicans cut school lunches. Jackson: "Not so. The Republican Congress appropriated more money for school lunches this year....And the Agriculture Department says it has increased the number of children served." 
<p>
The same ad charged the GOP cut Head Start: "Money for the Head Start pre-school program has been cut four percent this year, temporarily. But Republican leaders have agreed to a one percent increase once a permanent appropriations bill is passed. Meanwhile not a single child has been affected. In fact Head Start enrollment is up this year."  
<p>
And the DNC's claim that Republicans "cut child health care" did not go unchallenged. Jackson explained that Republicans only reduced the rate of Medicaid growth and that there is not much difference between the GOP and Clinton's proposal.

<title>Janet Cooke Award April 1996</title>

Janet Cooke Award for the April 1996 Mediawatch. 
</h2></center>

<i>The Janet Cooke Award is given to the most outrageously distorted news story of the month. The award honors the Washington Post reporter who won the Pulitzer Prize for a story later proven completely false.</i>
<p>

<b>
CBS, NBC Suggest "Extremist" Bishop Guilty of "Witch Hunt" for Upholding Church Teaching.
</b><br>
In the sophisticated ambiance of TV newsrooms, freedom of association is a concept apparently as outmoded as traditional religion. The notion that in America, a church is a voluntary association, bound together by commonly held theological beliefs, is a strange and alien argument. For holding up a Catholic bishop as a symbol of "extremism" enforcing a "blacklist," CBS and NBC earned the Janet Cooke Award. 
<p>
On the March 25 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather began: "In Lincoln, Nebraska, a bishop is taking the Catholic Church's battle over personal morality a step further. He is threatening to excommunicate any parishioner who joins groups advocating positions the church opposes. That threat puts this bishop in the forefront of a national furor, as we hear from Scott Pelley."
<p>
Pelley began: "Critics call him an extremist, a danger to the Catholic Church. What has thrust national notoriety upon Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz is a list, his own blacklist of organizations, he says, threaten the mortal soul...Bruskewitz has decreed that parishioners in his diocese of southern Nebraska have seven weeks to resign memberships in the listed groups, or be excommunicated, severing, the bishop says, their relationship with God."
<p>
He added: "The list includes pro-choice Planned Parenthood and the Hemlock Society, which advocates a right to die. But it also includes some organizations that consider themselves to be Catholic, even though they stray from Vatican teaching. One of them, known as Call to Action, advocates the ordination of women."
<p>
Call to Action's Robert McClory claimed: "The organization was founded to promote dialogue on issues, about which Catholics are seriously divided. He would prefer, evidently, that there be no discussion, and he's ordered those people, who think so, to simply get out of his house." Pelley noted: "The Bruskewitz list may be unique in America. Bishops rule their own diocese; parishioners are welcome to appeal to the Pope. Randall Moody faces excommunication. He is a parishioner and a member of Planned Parenthood's [national] board of directors." Moody oozed: "The organizations affected by this excommunication order are mainstream America, and it paints the church into the corner of being an extremist organization."
<p>
Pelley allowed Bruskewitz to speak: "These groups mislead people into thinking that they're compatible with the Catholic religion when they're not....It's not a question of not wanting to discuss issues. It's a question of an organization, which is, by its very constitution, inimical to the Catholic faith, which is destructive of church discipline."
<p>
Pelley ended: "The controversy is an example of tension in the American church, with a conservative Vatican on one side and reform-minded Catholics on the other. Now in Nebraska, there is a deadline for those who must decide whether they live their conscience or keep their faith."
<p>
NBC Nightly News had a similar take on April 1. While the on-screen graphic read "Blacklisted," Tom Brokaw pronounced: "A controversy is splitting apart a church as it prepares to enter its holiest week. At issue: A threat by a Catholic bishop in Nebraska to expel members from the church, for reasons his critics say belong in another era. Here's NBC's Linda Vester."
<p>
Vester began: "Last night in Lincoln, more than 60 Catholics gathered to figure out how to avoid being kicked out of their church...They're angry with the bishop of Lincoln for threatening them with the ultimate punishment: excommunication. Their crime: belonging to any of twelve groups the bishop has blacklisted, including Planned Parenthood, the Freemasons, and Call to Action, a nationwide organization that advocates women priests, married priests, and birth control."
<p>
Bruskewitz said: "Membership in these organizations that are listed certainly imperils the Catholic faith." Vester countered: "But a blanket order of excommunication, for any reason, is rare, unheard of in modern times. Some members of Call to Action, like Rosalyn Carr, are afraid and are quitting the group." Carr charged: "Well, I think the bishop has ways to retaliate."
<p>
Vester added: "But at Call to Action's meeting last night, others were defiant. Those who defy the bishop's order will be excommunicated May 15, which means they can attend mass, but they can't take communion or get  married in the church. The bishop says he won't enforce the order; he expects people to police themselves....But the bishop is getting help. The pro-life group, Rescue America, is going to give him members' names from the local Planned Parenthood."
<p>
Vester asked: "Is it a witch hunt? One theologian thinks it may turn people away from a church already struggling with its image." Father Richard McBride of the University of Notre Dame exclaimed: "It reinforces the prejudice that a lot of people have that it really is a new, a modern form of authoritarianism."
<p>
Vester wrapped it up: "Despite what critics say, Bishop Bruskewitz insists his order stands." Bruskewitz said: "Oh, I have no intentions of waffling." Vester's conclusion was almost identical to Pelley's: "Which leaves some Catholics here feeling forced to choose between their conscience and their church." When contacted by MediaWatch, both reporters were said to be on assignment. Despite numerous calls and faxes, neither responded.
<p>
William Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, told MediaWatch the networks are guilty of "rank hypocrisy" in their coverage of freedom of association: "The American Civil Liberties Union has a policy that every officer is pro-choice. If an officer were to evolve into a pro-life position, he would become a pariah, like Nat Hentoff, who was thrown off the board of directors. That's their prerogative. But where's the charge of authoritarianism?"
<p>
Donohue said the same is true for reporters: "I asked a newspaper reporter: what if one of your colleagues went on the local TV station and denounced your newspaper? If a secular organization won't tolerate that kind of insubordination, why is the Church held to a different standard?" This is especially pertinent in the case of CBS News after reporter Bernard Goldberg was kept off the air for months after he denounced the liberal bias of his own network. A CBS statement said Rather "disagrees with Mr. Goldberg's opinion...and its expression." 
<p>
Perhaps the networks' blind spot is unique to religion, where they imply that dissent is noble and church doctrine autocratic, that theology is subject to a vote and salvation is accomplished by focus group. CBS and NBC had three possible ways to present its story: Bruskewitz as hero for standing up for tradition, Bruskewitz as author-itarian villain, or a balanced presentation of both views. Instead of pursuing the professional third option, they opted for the bishop as villain.

<center><h2>
Newsbites for the April 1996 Mediawatch
</h2></center>
<p>

<b>First Pitch Glitch</b><br>

NBC's Tom Brokaw swung and missed when he tried to cover for the President. During the traditional first pitch thrown by the President on baseball's Opening Day, Bill Clinton was roundly booed by many in attendance at the April 2 Orioles game. Brokaw delivered the play-by-play:
<p>
"President Clinton taking the mound for the ceremonial first pitch. All the way from the pitcher's rubber, it was a little on the high side, and watching from the stands and not booing like most of the rest of the crowd -- Pat Buchanan. By the way the boos, like the first pitch, are traditional whoever the President.
<p>
Dan Rather didn't even mention the boos on the same night's CBS Evening News. Viewers only heard cheering at Clinton's lob. But on that day's CNN Inside Politics Bruce Morton replayed five recent Opening Day first pitches, one from Ronald Reagan, three from George Bush, and a previous Clinton throw. In all five, including Clinton's earlier pitch, the President was cheered.
<p>

<b>The Nadir of Coverage</b><br>

GOP presidential candidates like Pat Buchanan and Phil Gramm were not only labeled as conservative but as "hard right," "extreme," and "hard-line." Then it would only make sense that someone to the left of Bill Clinton would be considered, at the very least, a liberal. But in the midst of Ralph Nader's campaign for President on the Green Party ballot, reporters referred to the outspoken leftist as not "hard left" or "far left" but as merely a "consumer advocate" or "consumer activist."
<p>
Since the media started paying attention to the Nader candidacy, reporters have failed to mention liberal in the same sentence as Nader. NBC's Gwen Ifill referred to him as "the consumer activist" on the March 24 Nightly News. On The World Today the same night, CNN's Martin Savidge reported: "Consumer advocate Ralph Nader says he'll be on California's presidential ballot this fall." In a search of Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and USA Today, only U.S. News mentioned the "L" word: the March 25 issue called Nader a "liberal alternative to Clinton." 
<p>

<b>What's "Risky and Radical"?</b><br> 

On the March 12 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather warned of coming Social Security reform proposals: "The stock market could play a big role in major changes in Social Security. A bipartisan commission is due out soon to officially propose some radical changes in the whole Social Security system that would include privatizing Social Security, allowing some of your Social Security contributions to be invested in the stock market. Now, this may or may not prove to be a good idea, but it could be risky business." 
<p>
CBS reporter Bob Schieffer, who also called the plan "radical change," stated on the March 26 CBS This Morning that "even more radical, [is] a plan favored by some commission members to allow taxpayers to invest, any way they want, almost half of what they now pay in Social Security taxes." How does the media's take on Social Security reform stack up against other large-scale changes proposed in Washington? 
<p>
Database searches reveal that not once did a network reporter refer to the Clinton health care plan as "radical." The plan Hillary Clinton and Ira Magaziner cooked up amounted to a government take-over of one-seventh of the economy. That's not radical -- but allowing people to invest their own retirement money is.

<p><b>
Cartooning Contrasts.
</b><br>
During this year's Lenten season, when Christians examine their faith and commitment to God, the Los Angeles Times decided to show its own hostility to religion. In the March 28 issue the paper ran an editorial cartoon with the image of Bob Dole crucified. The crown of thorns on his forehead read "Christian Coalition."
<p>
Three days later, the paper spiked Johnny Hart's Palm Sunday B.C. comic strip, featuring the character Wiley writing a poem honoring Christ's death for man's sins. Los Angeles Times spokeswoman Ariel Remler told The Washington Times that "lately he's [Hart] been running cartoons with religious overtones." Then in an April 2 statement quoted in The Washington Times, Remler announced that the paper would spike the strip on all three days of the Easter weekend. After receiving hundreds of protest calls, the paper reversed itself, announcing it would run the Friday and Saturday strips.
<p>
Two years ago, the Times played a similar game, spiking Hart's "inappropriate" Easter Sunday strip with a resurrection theme, but then ran in June a series of Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury strips featuring John Boswell's controversial claim that the Catholic Church sanctioned same-sex marriages in the middle ages.  
<p>
<b>
No Liberal Lobbies.
</b><br>
In March, the House of Representatives voted on repealing the assault weapons ban and outlawing partial-birth abortion. But the media found a narrow "lobby" on only one side of these issues. During the gun debate in late March, the networks employed the term "gun lobby" over six times on the morning and evening news to denote those who opposed the ban. Most happened on CBS, like the March 21 CBS Evening News piece where Bob Schieffer announced: "With Republicans knowing they lack the votes to override a veto and with little enthusiasm for any of this in the Senate, the House effort may turn out to be little more than a publicity stunt to impress the gun lobby."
<p>
In the liberal lexicon of Washington, an industry is termed a "lobby" when it pushes narrow interest for its own gain. But those who opposed the partial birth abortion ban were pushing a narrow, extreme interest to satisfy their own backers. Yet not once during the congressional wrangling over partial birth abortions did anyone on the networks use the term "abortion lobby." 
<p>
<b>
Gender Chasm!
</b><br>
Like they do every presidential election year, reporters are raising the so-called gender gap, claiming that Republicans have problems attracting women. On the March 25 NBC Nightly News, essayist Anne Taylor Fleming stated: "Polls show a huge gender gap brewing. Women, like these we gathered, are more upset than men by budget cuts and family issues that they feel are being ignored." So do Democrats have a problem attracting men? Yes, but this didn't interest ABC and NBC.
<p>
On Good Morning America Sunday March 24, ABC's Jack Smith recalled the budget fight: "Where men saw deficit reduction, women worried about what the cuts were doing." In the ensuing discussion, co-host Willow Bay asserted: "If you're still making 70 cents to that male dollar, you're probably more reluctant to see cuts in social spending -- your safety net."
<p>
While some attributed the gap to social spending, others cited the GOP's pro-life stance. NBC's Lisa Myers began her report on the March 5 Nightly News: "Republicans have a problem with women....And today, polls show women leaning even more heavily in favor of Democrats. The big reason: Pat Buchanan." Myers spoke to Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe and stated: "Snowe says even though Buchanan won't be the nominee, his polarizing anti-abortion rhetoric has done lasting damage." Myers concluded that Clinton's lead over Dole with women is "not a gender gap, [it's] a chasm."
<p>
If reporters believe the gap is due to abortion, they need to examine the polls. A May 1995 Tarrance Group poll found that 47 percent of women (compared to 44 percent of men) believe that abortion should be "illegal and prohibited under all circumstances" or "illegal except in cases such as rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother."
<p>
<b>
Green Gary
</b><br>
Guilt by association is still a handy media tool. The March 21 Washington Post headline read: "Industry Funds Global Warming Skeptics." Reporter Gary Lee began: "A Washington environmental group charged yesterday that three researchers who are outspoken critics of the scientific evidence for global warming have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the petroleum and coal industries, and that this funding has influenced their views."
<p>
Lee described his source, Ozone Action, only as "an environmental group that lobbies on the issues of air quality and global climate change." Lee didn't use the word liberal or note they've even criticized Vice President Gore for being too soft on the environment. While Lee did call the researchers for comment, and quoted Patrick Michaels calling the charges "ludicrous," Lee excluded one obvious point: liberal environmental groups also take in hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil companies. The Capital Research Center noted that Exxon gave the National Audubon Society $112,500 in 1991 alone. The Post didn't do that man-pays-for-dog-to-bite-him story.
<p>

<b>Gannett Fires Like America.
</b><br>
The Gannett-owned Burlington [Vt.] Free Press fired Paul Teetor for reporting a story accurately, another victim of political correctness. But now he's been vindicated. In August 1993, Teetor angered black activists by reporting that a white woman was escorted from a community forum on racism after she tried to address it. A black city official, Rodney Patterson, told her the microphone they had set up for comments was for people "of color" only, not whites. After the story appeared, black activists demanded Teetor be fired for publishing an inaccurate story, even though a videotape confirmed Teetor's account. The Free Press canned him and ran a piece whitewashing Teetor's account of the meeting in accordance with the activists' demand.
<p>
Teetor filed a lawsuit against the paper. According to the March 29 Washington Post, the paper settled in his favor for an undisclosed sum. At trial, Teetor's lawyer alleged the real reason for the firing was the Gannett chain's "All-American Contest" where papers are evaluated and scored on how many minorities the paper hires and how positively minorities are depicted in news stories. Free Press editors were worried how the town meeting story would affect their scores because the contest results could be a factor in their own job promotions. 
<p>

<b>Fighting Forbes
</b><br>
The day before Steve Forbes ended his presidential bid, CBS reporter Phil Jones declared on the Evening News: "He struck fear in the hearts of his opponents by launching what may turn out to be the most massive, negative TV attack campaign in the history of American politics." Jones failed to mention the role CBS played in promoting negative politics. The network provided opponents with a free negative ad when it ran Eric Engberg's February 8 hit piece on the Forbes flat tax. Engberg referred to Forbes' "number one wackiest flat tax pro- mise." No wonder the Center for Media and Public Affairs found that with 87 percent derogatory comments, Engberg was the most negative reporter during the primaries.
<p>
<b>
Goldberg Survives, for Now. 
</b><br>

Speaking of Eric Engberg, CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg returned to the air April 9 with an Evening News "Eye on America" segment on rising youth crime caused by a deficit of values. Goldberg had been off the air since his February 13 Wall Street Journal op-ed arguing Engberg's story "set new standards for bias" and the liberal bias charge is "blatantly true."
<p>
The CBS Evening News had been airing "Bernard Goldberg's America," but CBS News President Andrew Heyward dumped the feature and has assigned him to the "Eye on America" beat. Goldberg's eight-week shunning and loss of his signature piece, however, may not be his only punishments. The Washington Post's John Carmody reported March 22: "Heyward would not comment on Goldberg's future when his contract expires at the end of the year." So much for promoting free speech.

Media Tied Talk Radio, Conservatives and Gingrich to Oklahoma City, But the Unabomber's On His Own
</b><br>
After the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing the media hurled charges of complicity at conservatives. Referring to Newt Gingrich's language, Time declared that the "burden of fostering the delusion" that government is the enemy "is borne not just by the nut cases who preach conspiracy but also to some extent by those who erode faith in governance in the pursuit of their own ambitions." Asked Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation: "There's been a lot of anti-government rhetoric, it comes over talk radio...Do you think that that somehow has led these people to commit this act?" 
<p>
But this April, even after ABC detailed the Unabomber's left-wing ties, the rest of the media failed to pick up the theme.  
<P>
Two days after suspect Ted Kaczynski's April 3 arrest, Brian Ross reported on World News Tonight that his "name appeared...in connection with an FBI investigation of a radical environmental group called Earth First...Over the years, Earth First has been best known as a violent group spiking trees and blowing up logging equipment, and in many respects its anti-corporate philosophy parallels that of the Unabomber." 
<P>
Ross noted "that authorities believe Kaczynski was at a meeting attended by top Earth First members." A private investigator, Ross relayed, "says the bomb last year that killed the head of the California Forestry Association clearly can be tracked back to a hit list published in one radical environmental journal."
Instead of being consistent,  reporters buried the tie. On April 8 the environmental angle made it into the 35th paragraph of a USA Today story as well as the 15th paragraph in The New York Times that day and The Washington Post the next. Insisting "there is no proof," NBC's David Bloom dismissed the link April 10.
<P>
The Unabomber manifesto rails against capitalism (it begins "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race"), but the April 15 Time noted no one recalled him having contact at Berkeley "with the leftists he would later excoriate in his manifesto." 
<P>
Some were sympathetic. USA Today's April 11 front page read: "UNABOMBER: A Hero to Some." Richard Price reported he's "being romanticized for his intellect" as "some people even feel sorry for him, seeing him a brilliant boy gone astray." On C-SPAN's Sunday Journal April 7, Time's Elaine Shannon found parts of the manifesto she agreed with, such as, "industrialization and pollution are all terrible things." She reasoned: "He wasn't a hypocrite, he lived as he wrote." Kaczynski "carried it to an extreme, and obviously murder is something that is far beyond any political philosophy, but he had a bike, he didn't have any plumbing."

Rotten in Denmark?
</b><br>
The media have often promoted liberal claims about the dangers of "overpopulation." Now that a new book, Our Stolen Future (with an introduction by Al Gore) theorizes that man-made chemicals are responsible for impending sterility, the media reaction is the same: unquestioned acceptance of ominous liberal claims. 
<P>
Time science writer Michael Lemonick wrote March 18 that "In study after study, sperm counts in men the world over seem to be dropping precipitously." He claimed the book contains "powerful evidence" to support the hypothesis that "reproduction-related ills may be caused by chemical pollutants in the environment, including DDT." The book is based on data from a Danish scientist, Niels Skakkebaek, whose meta-analysis of 61 sperm count studies found a 50 percent decline since 1938.
<P>
Though Lemonick wrote "the evidence for a chemical-infertility link does remain largely circumstantial," he warned of apocalypse: "Extrapolating from Skakkebaek's admittedly controversial data, it's conceivable that the average man will be infertile within a century. Even if things are only half that dire, it would be bad news indeed for the human race."
<P>
<i>Today's</i> Bryant Gumbel used the same tone with book cowriter Theo Colborn on March 12: "The extinction of the human race has long been a staple of science fiction, but according to a group of scientists, it could one day prove to be all too true, and they say the cause of the problem may be man-made chemicals." 
In a letter to Today, Dr. Glenn Swogger of the American Council on Science and Health claimed Colborn's "claims of lower sperm counts relates to a subsequently discredited study a number of years ago and is stale news in the scientific community...We run the risk of so limiting pesticide use through excessive regulation and discouragement of research that we will lose the valuable contribution they make to producing cheap and healthy fruits and vegetables." Gumbel only mentioned the ACSH to note they're "partially funded...by industry."
<P>
Robert Hager provided a more sober account on the April 1 NBC Nightly News, noting critics claimed the book was "bad science." Journalist Ronald Bailey was then allowed to critique the book's science in NBC's "In Their Own Words" segment.

<b>Bryant Gumbel, a Conservative? 
</b>
<br>
The March 21 Radio & TV Correspondents Dinner drew a lot of pressattention to the remarks of talk show host Don Imus, but the betterstory came from Marc Morano, Rush Limbaugh's man in D.C. He asked reporters in attendance about liberal bias, and the reporters only demonstrated their liberalism. 
<P>
Former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite admitted: "Everybody knows that there's a liberal, that there's a heavy liberal persuasion among correspondents." Cronkite argued, however, this is justified:"Anybody who has to live with the people, who covers police stations, covers county courts, brought up that way, has to have a degree of humanity that people who do not have that exposure don't have, and some people interpret that to be liberal. It's not a liberal, it's humanitarian and that's a vastly different thing."
<P>
When asked about the new Whitewater book, Blood Sport by JamesStewart, ABC's John Cochran felt the book was beneath him: "I haven't read it. I'm just now going through Elizabeth Drew's book,which is about the battle between the Gingrich Congress and theClinton White House and it's fascinating. It has nothing to do with gossip or Whitewater or what happened with Vince Foster or any ofthat, it has to do with what's happening with issues of importance to the American people." CBS's Bill Plante felt the issue was a waste of time: "The problem with the media coverage of Whitewater is that it has been done over and over and over again. I haven't read the book yet, but I understand that there's nothing basically new in it."
<P>
CNN's Judy Woodruff retorted to a query about Bernard Goldberg's comments about liberal bias: "I think Mr. Goldberg went a little bit too far...I don't think there's any blatant, rampant bias in the news media. If there were, then we wouldn't last in the jobs that we have." Most incredibly, Today weatherman Al Roker claimed:"I don't think there's a liberal bias in the media. Let me put it this way, I've never worked with a liberal anchorman, they're all very conservative." This from the man who shares a studio with Bryant Gumbel.

Revolving Door for the April 1996 Mediawatch.
</h2></center>
<P>
<b>Oklahoma Bill's Hate Radio</b><br>

After a year away to deal with heart trouble, Bill Moyers, a former Press Secretary to President Lyndon Johnson, returned to NBC on April 12 to host a Dateline NBC special "Oklahoma City: One Year Later." The day of the show, the New York Post quoted Moyers as insisting that he went to Oklahoma City "with nothing but a desire to find out what was happening. There was no agenda."
<P>
In reality, Moyers implied conservative rhetoric led to the bombing. But instead of having the integrity to name names or cite statements, Moyers offered an hour filled with vague generalities which held culpable "hate radio" and "the rhetoric of politics this season." Dateline featured this exchange with service station owner Bud Welch, whose daughter was killed:
<P>
Welch: "I thought, the first few months, that there was probably going to be more unity in the country, politically."
Moyers: "That this tragedy would bring us together?"
Welch: "Yes, that this tragedy would bring it together, but we're seeing through the elections that's going on right now, the same negative thoughts, the militia groups, the hate radio."
Moyers: "And you think that contributed to the tragedy, the bombing here?"
Welch: "Absolutely, without a doubt. Because it justifies a lot of the angry feelings that people have."
<P>
As Welch listened to G. Gordon Liddy on his car radio, Moyers charged: "The airwaves are still saturated with militant rhetoric. Day and night you can hear a stream of rage and insult directed with unremitting hostility at government and others. It rubs like salt in deep wounds and some of the families are trying to counter it."  
<P>
Then, as viewers saw several victims being interviewed by KTOK's Carole Arnold, Moyers explained: "Emerging from their private grief, they appeal for an end of hateful talk and political invective. Their experience is their message. What a society sows, it reaps....This local station has given the families a forum, but it also carries several hours of talk every day that they find inflammatory." The station does not carry Liddy, so the broadside against "hate" and "inflammatory" talk goes undefined. Welch proceded to tell Arnold: "Of course I think the media need to be involved a little bit in a little bit of control of the hate radio going on. I'm very disturbed about that. I mean where's the responsibility?"
<P>
Having impugned talk radio, Moyers turned to the government shutdown: "Just as federal workers were coming out of shock from the bombing, there was another blow, this time from Washington." He asked a HUD supervisor who survived the blast: "It's been a tough year for you federal workers here. The bombing, the furlough, you lost pay for a while. You continue to be demonized in the rhetoric of politics this season. What does that do to your idea of yourself?"
<P>
Finally, Moyers concluded the hour with this seeming indictment of House Speaker Newt Gingrich as co-conspirator: "It will never be the same. The bombers saw to that. The tears and grief, the pain and the sorrow were all intended. Terrorism is the politics of murder. We should have seen it coming. Hate was in the air. Government had been vilified, found guilty and sentenced to die. It didn't matter who was in the way. There are lessons for us here, something to take away from the wreckage of that day, if we're listening, one year later."

<TITLE> Study for the April 1996</TITLE>

<center><h2>
Study for the April 1996 Mediawatch.
</h2></center>
<P><b>
Network Religion Coverage Still Limited to Roughly One Percent of Total Coverage: Social Liberalism Rears Its Head on TV</b> 
<br>
In their survey The Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. The vast majority believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired Word of God. Sixty percent  can be found in houses of worship in a given month. This "silent majority" still worships under the radar screen of a secularized media elite.
<p>
The Media Research Center's first study of TV news coverage of religion in 1993 found a surprising paucity of  coverage and overt advocacy against traditional values: only 212 evening news stories and 197 morning show segments dealt with religion. Prime-time magazine and Sunday morning interview shows broached religion on only 18 occasions.  Religion coverage declined in 1994. Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments fell to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments dropped to nine. 
<P>
Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to religion, a slight increase (11 percent) from 1994.
  <p>
Despite more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1995. That's a one-third increase over 1994, but still less than one percent. 
<P>
The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on Sunday morning shows and prime-time magazines. Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live, and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60 Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly 400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994 to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also included three one-hour programs on religion, one on ABC and two on CBS. 
<P>
Institutions: The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up eight from 1994. Generic religion stories, often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations, came in second with 70 stories. News of Protestant denominations was again nearly absent.
<P>
The networks again portrayed the Catholic Church as an oppressive, narrow-minded, outmoded hierarchy. When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: "It's another example of the country's move to reinvent itself as a more modern and progressive Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently, there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run from government buildings and not the Vatican." 
<P>
Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning: "It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more tolerant place."
<P>
Abortion: Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142 stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
<P>
On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a decade." With coverage like that, reporter David Culhane could convey the results of a new poll during the January 8 CBS Evening News: "A new CBS poll shows that three out of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at several abortion clinics." 
<p>
What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, only CNN reported that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. In 1995, Daniel Adam Mahoney became the first pro-abortion activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school in Suffern, New York. But the networks were silent. 
<P>
While the networks devoted 142 stories to anti-abortion violence outside clinics, only three alluded to violence inside. CNN's September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated uterus during an abortion. Two 1995 segments aired estimates of 1.5 million abortions a year, two more mentions than in 1993 or 1994. 
<P>

Social Issues: The number of stories primarily about homosexuality increased from 105 in 1994 to 113 in 1995, still a fraction of the 1993 total of 756. But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again: in the few morning show interviews that aired, proponents of homosexuality outnumbered opponents, 13 to 3. 
Once again, the networks portrayed the religious right as a negative force in the Republican Party. While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or suggested they were less than Christian.
<P>
Dan Rather introduced a September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm "was at a meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling itself the Christian Coalition." Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather charged: "The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting Republicans elected."

<title> Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</title>

<h2> Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation </h2>
<h4>Network Reporting a Slave to Wages </h4>
</center>
Last month, <I>MediaNomics</I> reported that there were 19 stories about layoffs during the first two months of 1996, but only two stories about job growth. We noted how such a focus on the negative offered a distorted picture of the true nature of a competitive economy, which does destroy some jobs, but always creates more jobs.
<p>
The sister issue to job creation is living standards. A competitive economy would be of little benefit to workers if it caused their standard of living to decrease. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story that focused on wages and incomes on network morning and evening shows during the first three months of 1996. Ten of the 11 stories stressed the alleged wage stagnation of average workers over the last few decades. Only one story pointed out that opportunities have been increasing. No story pointed out that when benefits and payroll taxes are included, workers' total compensation has been steadily increasing.
<p>
A lack of diversity in guest selection kept the morning shows from giving viewers a balanced story. For instance, on the March 12 <I>Today</I>, Bryant Gumbel interviewed only Jared Bernstein of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Introducing the segment, Gumbel pointed out that the U.S. economy has created eight million new jobs over the last three years, adding that "the quantity of jobs is not being questioned, but the quality is."
<p>
Bernstein then said that "wages and compensation have been falling in our labor market since 1979 for most workers. yet in the current economy, profit rates, or corporate profits, are at a 30-year high." Bernstein also claimed that "this is a long-term trend and workers are experiencing falling wages and compensation and even increased turnover. That is, we have less stable employment and the typical American family is really running faster just to stay in place."
<p>
Gumbel's reaction: "OK, so let us accept all of that as fact. Could it be otherwise?" Since Gumbel didn't provide an alternative opinion, viewers had no choice but to accept Bernstein's assertions as fact.
Other reporters also seemed to assume that accounts of workers' falling wages was a fact. On the February 26 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather concluded that "the fear and anger of some American workers over layoffs and barely rising wages have emerged as a campaign issue." Earlier, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, Rather said: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages."
<p>
On that same broadcast, correspondent Wyatt Andrews portrayed "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." According to NBC's Mike Jensen, on the March 4 Nightly News, "William Young of California is typical -- 50, a victim of downsizing, laid off by Northrup after 29 years in the aerospace industry."
<p>
On the February 25 <I>World News Sunday</I>, ABC's Jeff Greenfield, normally one of the most balanced reporters at the networks, also bought the party line. He reported "something very disturbing behind the record Wall Street numbers and corporate profits." He interviewed a Wall Street economist who said, "This surge in financial markets was really based on an untenable situation of workers taking a real squeeze in living standards to improve corporate profit margins and competitive prowess." Greenfield called this the "dark side of productivity."
<p>
But just how dark is the American wage and income picture? According to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists W. Michael Cox and Beverly J. Fox, writing in a January National Center for Policy Analysis Policy Backgrounder, it's not as bad as many have been led to believe. The problem with most analyses of stagnating wages is they don't look at benefits. Cox and Fox pointed out that "employee benefits have grown from 20 percent of payroll in 1953 to more than 41 percent today." Since benefits aren't taxed, they argue, employees have sought benefit increases. Increasing payroll taxes have also taken a bite out of wages.
<p>
Cox and Fox also maintain that looking at stagnating household income, as Bernstein apparently was, is misleading. "Today's households are nearly 15 percent smaller than they were in the 1970s -- so household income is spread over fewer people," they report. "The median family income statistics for yesterday's Brady Bunch cannot be accurately compared with those of today's Murphy Brown." Overall, Cox and Fox demonstrate that "per capita real personal income increased an average of 1.4 percent a year" from 1974 through 1993. Unfortunately neither they nor like-minded economists were interviewed by network reporters.
<p>
Only NBC's Jim Avila, on the March 4 <I>Nightly News</I>, gave any hint that the job and wage picture for American workers was not completely bleak. Though he didn't point out that total compensation has been increasing for American workers over the last few decades, he did look at small businesses creating jobs and noted that "many of the new jobs being created provide good salaries, full benefits, and something some of the old jobs did not provide -- a piece of the action. Often small companies offer new employees stock options and other incentives." According to Avila, "The workplace has changed, perhaps forever. The job security of the past replaced by uncertainty and, more often than you might think, also replaced by new opportunity." But, of course, Avila was the exception.

<center><h2>Bright Side for May 1996 Media Watch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>NBC: Tough on Criminals?</h3>
<p>
Any suggested link between crime and welfare dependency is usually dismissed by the media as Willie Horton redux. However, Elizabeth Vargas' March 26 Dateline report showed that often welfare money acts as a direct subsidy for scofflaws.
Vargas noted there are "more than 415,000 fugitives on the lam across the country, men and women wanted by the law for serious crimes." After a morning expedition with the Cuyahoga Ohio County Sheriff department, knocking on doors in a fruitless search for a fugitive, she noted that "just a few blocks away from the sheriff's department is all the information those officers say they need. Here in this office are the names, addresses, phone numbers, even photographs, of some of those fugitives from justice. People fleeing from the law but not from the welfare department."
Vargas deftly phrased the irony: "So, while one government agency spends your tax dollars to find fugitives from the law, another government agency gives more of your tax dollars, welfare, to fugitives in hiding." 
After interviewing county welfare director Joseph Garcia claiming the police were on a "fishing expedition" and targeting the poor, Vargas noted that after McFall went public with his battle against federal privacy laws that prevent welfare departments from sharing names and addresses, "deputies are getting some information."
Robert Hager probed the same politically incorrect line in his Fleecing of America report on the April 24 Nightly News. 
Anchor Tom Brokaw introduced the story: "How would you feel if you found out your tax dollars were paying a massive telephone bill for calls that never should have been made, calls coming from prisoners?"
Hager related the General Accounting Office findings of prisoners calling the Agriculture Department -- collect: "652 collect calls accepted from eighteen prisons in all, in just the four months auditors sampled." Hager explained, "The prisoners had found dishonest employees at the Agricultural Department's Washington headquarters, willing to forward on their calls long-distance to whomever the prisoners wanted to talk to, private individuals, anywhere, at taxpayers expense," even calls to sex lines in the Dominican Republic.
<p>
<h3>Stossel on Davis-Bacon</h3>
<p>
In 1931, Congress passed the Davis Bacon Act, prompted by white laborers who were upset that blacks were underbidding them on government contracts. Davis Bacon sets minimum wages for contractors that build government buildings. On the April 12 20/20, ABC's John Stossel looked at how this out-dated government regulation continues to cost taxpayers millions and benefits a major contributor to the Democratic Party: labor unions.
Stossel started at the Labor Department, the agency that enforces Davis Bacon. Stossel explained: "Dozens of them [employees] here, and others in state and city labor departments, spend their time deciding what construction workers on government projects must be paid. The result? Government buildings cost more and poor people who want to work can't." Stossel explained: "Carpenter David Shepherd must get $29 an hour. Normally he makes $15. Sheet metal worker Mike Harley has his pay doubled by the Labor Department."
Stossel explained how the Labor Department uses a complicated formula to issue their wage edicts. In turn, prevailing wages are often set higher than union wages so open-shop contractors can't underbid union shops. Stossel referred to the unions clout: "It is true that the law protects union jobs from cheaper competition. And if a Congressman even discusses changing the law, crowds like this [footage of a congressional hearing with union members] will remind him of the union's clout. Congress' most potent defender of Davis Bacon has been Sen. Edward Kennedy. He declined our request to talk about this."
Stossel went on to point out that while these higher wages may benefit some, there's also a downside for less-skilled laborers. Stossel pointed out: "A side effect of fixing wages is that some workers end up being excluded." At Cabrini Green in Chicago, one of the nation's poorest housing projects, the government is doing repairs. Some construction workers who reside at Cabrini Green would like to be hired to do the work, but as Stossel learned: "They can't get hired because when contractors are forced to pay high Davis Bacon salaries even for the simplest jobs, they're not going to take a chance on inexperienced strangers, they're going to use their most experienced workers."

<h3>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of Debate<br>
MINIMUM WAGE</h3>
<p>

One of the key debates currently defining the differences between Republicans and Democrats is the argument over efforts to raise the minimum wage. Democrats argue that the government can legislate higher pay for those earning the minimum wage without harming anyone. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that by artificially raising wages, the government will cause employers to lay off workers.
<p>
On which side did the media weigh in? Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the minimum wage stories on evening news shows (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC) and morning news shows (ABC, CBS, NBC). There were 36 stories and anchor-reads about the debate. With a few notable exceptions, the networks took the side of those supporting a minimum wage increase. For example:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Soundbite sources were almost twice as likely to be supporters of the minimum wage increase than opponents. Out of 60 soundbite sources, 39 supported the minimum wage increase, while only 21 were opposed to it. Several stories contained soundbites from only Democrats and their allies.
<p>
Bob Schieffer's April 25 CBS Evening News report, for instance, had soundbites from Democrats Maxine Waters, Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, and two minimum wage workers whom the Democrats had brought to Washington for a news conference. "Democrats will keep the pressure up," Schieffer said. "They believe that Republicans are taking such a pounding on this they'll eventually allow a vote." He didn't tell viewers what Republicans believed.
<p>
This emphasis on supporters of the minimum wage hike led some reporters to just accept the Democrats' opinion that the wage could be increased without harming workers. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, on the April 17 Nightly News, a minimum wage increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers now earning near the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, frozen since 1989." CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, on the April 24 The World Tonight, worried that "people earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon. Despite political pressure from both parties, House Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey have virtually ruled out scheduling a vote on the minimum wage increase."
<p>
<li>The political horse-race aspect of the debate was emphasized far more than the economics of the debate. There were only three soundbites from economists. There were 46 soundbites from politicians. The networks were much more interested in who would win and lose politically from the debate than what the effect would be on the country. According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the April 17 Nightly News, it was likely that "the most basic wage in this country affecting millions of workers and businesses will go up. But, who gets the credit?"
<p>
This weighed heavily on the minds of other reporters, as well. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, on the April 24 Nightly News, predicted that "by digging in their heals, Republicans may also be digging themselves into a political hole." And ABC's Cokie Roberts, on the April 23 Good Morning America, said: "If the Republicans are stuck going along, then they want to get some credit."
<p>
<li>Journalists were more interested in interviewing other journalists than in interviewing economists. On the morning news shows, the obsession with political angles reached almost comic proportions. On the morning shows, where live interviews are common, there were five such interviews of journalists about the minimum wage. There were none with economists.
<p>
ABC's Willow Bay interviewed ABC's Sam Donaldson on a Good Morning America Sunday segment. ABC's Charles Gibson interviewed ABC's Cokie Roberts and ABC's Tyler Mathison on a Good Morning America segment. NBC's Bryant Gumbel interviewed NBC's Tim Russert on a Today segment. And CBS's Harry Smith interviewed The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes. None of these shows were interested in the insights of economists, however.
<p>
<li>There was more skepticism of Republican motives than Democratic motives. Three stories suggested that Republicans opposed raising the minimum wage because their business allies opposed it. ABC's Carole Simpson, on the April 28 World News Sunday, reported that Republicans "say [a minimum wage hike] is bad for small business." According to Bob Schieffer, on the April 17 CBS Evening News, Republicans "know polls show most Americans favor an increase, but many of their business allies oppose it." Neither Simpson or Schieffer suggested that Republicans may oppose an increase because it would hurt workers.
<p>
No reporter made the similar charge against Democrats, that they support the increase simply because their labor allies support it. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, on the April 25 Today, did at least state that there was a principle at stake for the GOP: "They can stand their ground on principle on this issue, but lose ground in public opinion." He did not explain what that principle was, though.
<p>
<li>The one study of the impact of minimum wage increases cited by reporters is one most economists disavow. The infamous Card-Krueger study, named after the two economists who directed it, was mentioned favorably in two stories. Card and Krueger looked at the impact of a minimum wage increase in New Jersey, compared to neighboring Pennsylvania, which hadn't increased its state minimum wage. They found that there was no job loss in New Jersey due to the increase. Since this is one of the only studies to produce such a finding, it is often cited by advocates of increasing the minimum wage.
<p>
ABC's Tyler Mathison mentioned the study on the April 23 Good Morning America. NBC's Mike Jensen also mentioned it favorably on the April 26 Nightly News. Neither of them mentioned the well-publicized problems many economists found with the study's methodology. Jensen, in fact, used a soundbite from one of the study's chief critics, economist Richard Berman, but didn't mention his criticisms of the study. He even employed an Alan Krueger soundbite to refute Berman.
<p>
There were exceptions.
<p>
Anthony Mason, interview with Republican Senator Don Nickles and Democratic Congressman David Bonior: "After the last increase in the minimum wage, Department of Labor statistics show we lost some half a million jobs, I believe. Is this going to cost us jobs? Are we making a mistake if we do this now?" Mason: "Congressman, in the first two years of President Clinton's term, when you controlled Congress, this issue was never brought up. Why is it on the table suddenly now, when we're running up to an election. You had an opportunity to something and it wasn't done then."

<P>
<DD>To convince Congress they deserve more funding, advocates of government  
programs regularly highlight examples of all those the program benefits.  
Reporters should look for the reality. For touting the Legal Services  
Corporation (LSC) as if he were on staff, CBS's Terence Smith earned the  
Janet Cooke Award.
<DD>His April 28 Sunday Morning story focused on Legal Services of Greater  
Miami: "They deal mostly with bread-and-butter issues: housing,  
employment, custody, divorce. The concept of helping the poor with their  
problems would seem, on the face of it, to be something most Americans  
could agree upon. But Legal Services is one of those hot-button issues  
that divides people on political, practical, and ideological grounds."
CBS did not present a balanced slate of proponents and opponents, with  
18 soundbites of LSC backers and three from LSC opponent Rep. Charles  
Taylor (R-N.C.), who revealed: "Many of the cases that I've seen are  
very extreme, radical areas that are being funded by the taxpayers...It  
is not the average elderly person being evicted from homes that you  
would have people believe that you defend. There's more of this radical  
view, I see, funded by the taxpayer."
<DD>Smith never allowed Taylor to elaborate. For decades, the LSC has used  
its grants to fight against conservative policies. As LSC chairman,  
Hillary Clinton funneled taxpayer money into defeating a 1980 California  
ballot initiative (Proposition 9) to cut state income taxes in half. In  
1983, the General Accounting Office cited the LSC for violating  
statutory bars against partisan activity. 
<DD>In 1994, The Washington Times reported the state of California was  
forced by the LSC-funded Western Center on Law and Poverty to revoke a  
2.3 percent reduction in welfare payments, costing an estimated $5.6  
million a month. They also filed successful suits to increase payments  
to MediCal, the state's Medicaid plan, and force the state to pay day  
 been terminated by this particular time." 20
Smith moved on: "Barbara Goulsby is the Legal Services attorney for  
Damon Johnson, and 36 families who lost their possessions when Miami  
police suddenly evicted them from their apartment building in a  
drug-infested neighborhood. The city said the building was a center for  
drug activity." 
<DD>To complete the picture of victims, Smith added: "Daniel Barker, another  
Legal Services attorney, is helping Deborah Williams fight eviction from  
her apartment...He interceded with the public housing authority, which  
had accused her of having unauthorized persons living in the apartment."  
Smith asked Williams: "Where would you have been without Legal  
Services?...On the street?" Williams agreed: "Yes, exactly, okay?"
CBS did not investigate whether LSC grantees use tax dollars to fight  
the eviction of drug dealers from public housing. The August 15, 1994  
New York Times reported a group representing 500,000 New York tenants  
entered a case to back expedited eviction of drug dealers, only to be  
opposed by the Legal Aid Society, an LSC grantee. (New York public  
housing officials declared drug-related arrests in their complexes grew  
from 813 in 1973 to 11,092 in 1993). As Boehm testified to Congress: "A  
program determined to use public funds to keep drug dealers in public  
housing -- in the name of helping the poor -- is a program that's lost  
what it means to help the poor."
<DD>Smith asked: "So what are the prospects for Legal Services, given the  
current political climate?...Charles Taylor wants to kill the program."  
Taylor declared: "We've been able to take it from $400 million down to  
283, right at the moment. We need to take it to zero." Smith noted:  
"That won't happen this year. But last week Congress imposed new  
restrictions on Legal Service attorneys, barring them from bringing  
class-action suits, challenging welfare reform, and representing many  
immigrants." Smith did not explain why the new restrictions were  
necessary.
<DD>Taylor's press secretary, Jack Cox, told MediaWatch the CBS story  
followed a formula: "Every single time we've done an interview, the  
reporter finds one local group, interviews a few nice little fuzzy cases  
where people say `I couldn't live without them,' and then they quote us  
saying `Zero it out.' They never let us give the justifications for  
zeroing it out. I sat in on the CBS interview for more than an hour.  
[Taylor] must have hammered home the drug-dealer issue about 40 times to  
 get it into the piece." It didn't get in.
<DD>Smith told MediaWatch he stood by his use of Taylor: "I would argue  
that's a very full description of his view of Legal Services." As for  
the story's imbalance, Smith declared, "Obviously, I think it was fair."  
When asked about drug-related evictions, Smith protested that he was  
unfamiliar with the New York case and insisted: "Taylor did not cite a  
single specific case. When I asked attorneys in Florida, they said  
they'd never represent a convicted drug pusher."

<H2>Media Clique Clap for Clinton</H2>
<H3>Nine of Ten Washington Reporters Voted  
for Clinton; Are Liberal by 6 to 1
</H3>
<DD>When Americans went to the polls in 1992, 43 percent voted for Bill  
Clinton and 38 percent for George Bush. But the results were very  
different in another America, the news media's Washington bureaus.  A  
poll of 139 bureau chiefs and congressional reporters discovered 89  
percent pulled the lever for Clinton and seven percent picked Bush.  
In mid-April the Freedom Forum released a report examining  
media-congressional relations. Buried in the appendix were "a few final  
questions for classification purposes only." These were part of a 58  
question Roper Center survey completed by mail in November and December  
1995. 
<DD>Asked "How would you characterize your political orientation?" 61  
percent said "liberal" or "liberal to moderate." Only nine percent  
labeled themselves "conservative" or "moderate to conservative."
The poll also found that 59 percent considered the Contract with America  
"an election-year campaign ploy" while only three percent thought it was  
"a serious reform proposal." A decisive 85 percent admitted they were  
"very" or "somewhat" surprised by the 1994 GOP win. 
<DD>So do these views affect the news? Study chief and former Chicago  
Tribune reporter Elaine Povich told the April 18 Washington Times: "One  
of the things about being a professional is that you attempt to leave  
your personal feelings aside as you do your work." Boston Globe Editor  
Matthew Storin insisted on CNN's Reliable Sources April 21: "I think,  
actually, those figures are a great endorsement for the professionalism  
of our business. Has anyone looked at the coverage of Bill Clinton's  
administration? I mean, it's been, almost from the get-go, negative."
On the April 28 Fox News Sunday Linda Chavez opined that people realize  
reporters' personal views influence their reporting, prompting Wall  
Street Journal Executive Washington Editor Al Hunt to coun-ter: "If that  
poll is correct, it basically reaffirms the argument that Linda just  
argued against. Which is, would anyone argue that Bill Clinton has  
gotten an easy press the last three years? If 89 percent voted for him,  
he's gotten an awfully tough press." Later he asked incredulously: "You  
think his health care proposals got a good press?"
One reporter on the CNN show realized the impact. The Washington Post's  
Howard Kurtz explained: "Clearly anybody looking at those numbers, if  
they're even close to accurate, would conclude that there is a diversity  
problem in the news business, and it's not just the kind of diversity we  
usually talk about, which is not getting enough minorities in the news  
business, but political diversity, as well. Anybody who doesn't see that  
is just in denial." Indeed.

<h2>Revolving Door</h2>
<P>
<H4>Snow on Sunday</H4>

<DD>To moderate its new Sunday morning public affairs show, Fox News Sunday,  
the network tapped Tony Snow. Those hired by the media who have liberal  
ties don't raise a concern in the journalistic world. But the selection  
of the conservative Snow prompted some reporters to question the slant  
of the show, although Marty Ryan, former Executive Producer of NBC's  
Today, will hold the same title with Fox News Sunday. "A rabidly  
conservative columnist and former speechwriter for President George  
Bush, Snow knows that his right-wing image may put off lefties,"  
declared Philadelphia Inquirer television reporter Gail Shister on April  
8.  Shister explained that "as for some critics' contentions that Snow could  
be `tainted' by his Bush connections, he says: `I've worked for half as  
many politicians'" as Meet the Press host Tim Russert, who toiled for  
former Governor Mario Cuomo and Senator Daniel Moynihan, both New York  
Democrats. The show, which premiered April 28, is aimed at younger  
viewers and will include questions sent via the internet.
<P>
<H4>Filling the Slate</H4>
<P>
<DD>Michael Kinsley, Editor of Microsoft's new online publication, Slate,  
has built his team. Among those tapped by the liberal former co-host of  
CNN's Crossfire: Jodie Allen, Editor of the Washington Post Outlook  
section since 1990, who served under President Carter as Deputy  
Secretary of Labor for policy evaluation and research. For Slate, to  
debut May 31 on the internet, she'll be the Washington editor.
<P>
<H4>Revolving Online</H4>
<P>
<DD>First she reported the news, then she spun the news. Now Kathleen  
deLaski will do both in cyberspace in a post which involves covering  
Clinton's re-election effort. America Online, the on-line computer  
service, National Journal reported March 16, "has hired deLaski to  
direct campaign coverage for its politics channel." In 1988 she became  
an on-air Washington reporter for ABC News. She jumped to the Clinton  
team in 1993 as Chief Public Affairs Officer for the Defense Department.  
For the past year she's been Deputy to the Undersecretary for Policy  
Liaison.
<P>
<H4>Recalling Candidacy</H4>
<P>
<DD>Since late last year Walter Shapiro, Press Secretary to Carter Labor  
Secretary Ray Marshall and a Time Senior Editor from 1987 to 1993, has  
penned a twice-weekly news section column for USA Today. 20
Shapiro began his April 12 "Hype & Glory," in which he fawned over  
Victor Morales, the Democratic Senate nominee in Texas, by recalling his  
own early partisan foray: "Nearly a quarter of a century ago, at the  
height of the Vietnam War, I was seized by the quixotic notion that  
anti-war students deserved representation in Congress." At the time he  
was a 25-year-old graduate student at the University of Michigan.  
Shapiro lost, but he noted "I did come within 1,400 votes of winning a  
six-way Democratic Primary. My partisan days are long behind me."
<P>
<H4>Willie Hortonizing CNN<H4>
<P>
<DD>CNN announced in March that Ken Bode, a top aide in Democrat Morris  
Udall's 1976 presidential run, will be a national political analyst. An  
April 26 Washington Week in Review look at Bob Dole's claim that Clinton  
has nominated liberal judges, offered a preview of Bode's analysis. From  
his perch as moderator of the PBS show, Bode asked: "So, federal judges  
are going to become this year's Willie Horton?"

<h2>Hugh Downs' Hate Radio--ABC's Avuncular Star On the Left</h2>

<DD>Hugh Downs may seem harmless hosting 20/20, but in the Spring Forbes  
MediaCritic Steve Kroll revealed another side -- a liberal ideologue in  
weekly commentaries for ABC Radio's Perspectives. From1990: "The  
Reagan-Bush team did more than just support dictatorial rule around the  
world. It helped foster a climate of dictatorship at home." In 1994, on  
the Gulf War: "Nobody in his right mind would incinerate or blow up  
innocent children, but that's exactly what the United Nation's said that  
American bombs did in Iraq."
<DD>Downs had quite a conspiratorial view of the discredited October  
Surprise theory, which he said "has tentacles that reach deep into the  
empire of Manuel Noriega, into the scandal at BCCI, and into  
the...destruction of Iraq....For 11 years suspicions have grown that  
renegade intelligence officers illegally seized the American  
government....There is a growing number of reasons to believe that the  
October Surprise is true." 
<DD>Finally, Kroll noted that Downs attempted to "liken Ronald Reagan to a  
communist dictator because he entertained the idea of repealing the 22nd  
Amendment, which limits a President to two terms. While Gorbachev  
attempts `to liberalize the Soviet Union by adopting Thomas Jefferson's  
democracy,' opined Downs, Reagan `in almost mirror-like fashion,' moves  
`toward absolute rule.'"

<h2>Bright Side. Liberal Bias Admitted</h2><p>

A major media figure has conceded that liberal bias really exists. On the May 12 Inside
Washington, host Gordon Peterson raised House Speaker Newt Gingrich's charge that the media are
in a "passive conspiracy" to help President Clinton. NPR's Nina Totenberg shot back: "I think
it's basically sour grapes....and I'm tired of politicians just sort of saying, when things go
badly for them, blaming us. It's not our fault, it's their fault." But then Evan Thomas,
Newsweek's Washington Bureau Chief, asserted: "They blame us, but this is true. There is a
liberal bias. It's demonstrable. You look at some statistics. About 85 percent of the reporters
who cover the White House vote Democratic, they have for a long time. Particularly at the
networks, at the lower levels, among the editors and the so-called infrastructure, there is a
liberal bias. There is a liberal bias at Newsweek, the magazine I work for -- most of the people
who work at Newsweek live on the upper West Side in New York and they have a liberal bias."
Thomas, however, didn't make a full confession, denying any bias with those under him: "I don't
think it's so much Washington. It's New York. You have to look at which city we're talking
about. It's where the networks are based. It's where The New York Times is based. I think the
greatest liberal bias is amongst the people who work for large, major news organizations in New
York."<p>

<h2>Verdict: Media Guilty of Apathy--Networks Aggressively Ignored the Crimes of Whitewater</h2><p>

The media elite keeps waiting for Whitewater to end.  "Is this basically the end of
Whitewater?," asked New York Times reporter Linda Greenhouse on PBS's Washington Week in Review
after the First Lady's cattle-futures press conference in 1994. "Whitewater is...sort of
diminishing, sort of fading away," predicted host Ken Bode on the same program on May 24. Just
four days later, Bode and other reporters were embarrassed when the story exploded with 24 fraud
and conspiracy convictions of President Clinton's business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal, and
Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker.

After NBC Nightly News aired only one reporter-based story in the entire three months of the
trial, anchor Tom Brokaw asked Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert May 28, the night of the
convictions: "Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican Senator who's been running the Whitewater hearings
on Capitol Hill, has so much as admitted recently that he didn't get very far. There have been
any number of exhaustive journalistic efforts. What do we think may be out there? Anything
left?"

On CBS, Dan Rather quickly disposed of "Republican special prosecutor Kenneth Starr" and spent
15 minutes on newly discovered footage surrounding John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination. When he
returned to the trial, Rather twice insisted "President Clinton was not charged with anything in
this trial." Reporters Scott Pelley (once) and  Rita Braver (twice) repeated that the President
was not a target of investigation. 

The convictions were a stark contrast to the stunning lack of TV coverage of the trial. A
MediaWatch analysis from February 29 to May 28 found the Big Three networks aired only 13
reporter-based Whitewater stories on their evening news shows -- an average of about four
stories per network over three months. (CNN's The World Today reported ten stories.) The three
morning shows also yawned at the story, airing only 14 reporter-based stories and five
interviews during that time. 

Other Clinton scandals continue to be ignored.  On April 5, the Los Angeles Times  broke the
story that the Clinton administration secretly encouraged Iran to send arms to the Bosnian
Muslims while Clinton publicly defended the arms embargo. CBS and NBC have not broadcast a
single evening news story. ABC aired two evening anchor briefs, CNN's The World Today, three.

The networks have yet to touch the May 2 Washington Times story of how Senate Democrats have
placed a hold on a bill reimbursing former White House Travel Office chief Billy Dale for
$500,000 in legal fees -- money he spent defending himself against the Clintons' false charges
that he was an embezzler.<p>
<h2>Setting an Example</h2><p>

While the television networks have been reluctant to cover Whitewater, the print
 media have been
much more thorough. The June 2 Washington Post ran an in-depth, front page story
 on the scandal,
focusing on the role of First Lady Hillary Clinton, concluding that: "Her public
 record suggests
conflicts with self-portrait of naivete."<p>
The nearly five-page story story by David Maraniss and Susan Schmidt looked at t
he conflict
between what Mrs. Clinton has stated and the documented record. While  most of t
he story looked
at the players involved and recounted the entire scandal, the Post prefaced the
story: "The
image is of a mere bystander, a good person victimized. But an examination of Hi
llary Clinton's
public statements suggests someone less passive in her behavior, less consistent
 in her answers,
and less committed to full disclosure than the figure in her self-portrait....He
r wording seems
alternately terse and lawyerly, providing the narrowest possible answers, and un
abashedly
political, ornamented with asides and anecdotes."  <p>

<h2>Newsbites</h2><p>


<h3>Dole's Code</h3><p>

How will the media cover Bob Dole and Bill Clinton clashing on issues? The May 23 CBS Evening
News offered a preview of how Dole is the divider while Clinton is the unifier. First, reporter
Phil Jones analyzed Dole's criticism of Clinton's veto of the partial birth abortion ban. Jones
predicted it would energize the religious right, but that it really served a more sinister
purpose: "It's also Dole campaign code. When he talks about abortion, that leads to morality.
When he talks about morality, that raises the issue of character. And that's exactly what Dole
and the Republicans want -- to force a presidential election based on Bill Clinton's character."<p>

Next, Rita Braver praised Clinton: "The White House had expected the Republicans to go negative,
but not this hard, this fast. And the President's remarks were very well thought out. He was
sending Dole a message that your remarks are not going to go unchallenged." Braver then
criticized Dole for raising the issue: "You could see the President's strategy here and that is
to tell Americans that Bob Dole is dragging the campaign into the mud and trying to divide the
country."<p>


<h3>Hands Off Clinton </h3>

The Bush campaign got lambasted over Willie Horton while the media ignored that future Vice
President Al Gore first raised Horton in a 1988 primary debate. This year, while fulminating
about a 1990 ad from Republican Jesse Helms, the media failed to dredge up the President's
relationship to the man behind the Helms ad, Dick Morris.<p>

NBC's Bob Faw warned May 7 that "every time he has run, Helms has exploited racial tension." Faw
showed a clip of the Helms' 1990 affirmative action ad, "Hands," showing a pair of white hands
crumpling up a job rejection letter: "You needed that job, and you were the best qualified. But
they had to give it to a minority."  Faw continued: "For many voters here the basic if
bedeviling question is whether a black or white challenger has a better chance against an
incumbent who in the past has played the race card and can be expected to do so again." (Black
1990 candidate Harvey Gantt won the primary again this year.) On May 5 ABC's Carla Hill played
the ad, adding: "Jesse Helms successfully played the race card against Gantt in 1990." Los
Angeles Times reporter Eric Harrison wrote May 11: "Helms unleashed a barrage of racially
inflammatory television commercials as the close contest came to an end and defeated Gantt by
six percentage points."<p>

Only reporter Lloyd Grove noted, sotto voce, in the 35th paragraph of a May 24 Washington Post
profile of Gantt: "One of his [Helms'] key advisers -- pollster Richard Morris, who has taken
credit for conceiving the so-called `Hands' spot -- is working this year for President Clinton."<p>

<h3>A Lying Shame</h3><p>

As part of NBC's week-long series on "Dishonesty in America: Lie, Cheat, Steal," the May 19
Dateline NBC aired a story on how to recognize when someone is lying. With the Clintons telling
whoppers weekly, NBC wouldn't have to go back very far to find some good examples. Instead,
reporter Sara James left an amazing impression: only Republicans lie. <p>

James interviewed Paul Eckman, a psychologist who trains law enforcement officers to detect
lies. Eckman used video of five liars to demonstrate his techniques; child murderer Susan Smith,
former Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman, Oliver North, who James stated lied "in the
name of country," and Reagan national security aide John Poindexter. Closing the piece, James
showed a video of Richard Nixon denying involvement in Watergate. She stated: "Eckman is the
first to admit that many lies, especially when they come in prepared statements, are tough to
catch. As America discovered, it was far from the truth, but not even Paul Eckman knew that
Richard Nixon was lying back then." Before the James story aired, Dateline promos left the same
partisan impression, showing only Nixon and North, not the Clintons.<p>


<h3>Murdering Genius</h3><p>

The Unabomber was just a troubled soul who lost his way, said The New York Times. "Theodore
Kaczynski: Unabomb Suspect's Tortured Genius and Lost Promise" blared a May 26 front page
headline. Reporter Robert McFadden set a romanticized scene: "It was just a dusty, cobwebbed
cabin high in the Rockies, as remote as a cougar's lair. But it suited a man who had always been
alone, this genius with gifts for solitude, perseverance, secrecy and meticulousness, for
penetrating the mysteries of mathematics and the dangers of technology, but never love, never
friendship." McFadden continued: "The furnishings were the fragments of his life: the books for
companionship and the bunk for the lonely hours, the wood stove where night after night he
watched dying embers flicker visions of a wretched humanity, the typewriter where, the
authorities say, the justifications for murder had been crafted like numbered theorems." Put the
Hammer Down.<p>

Reporters constantly argue for the most expansive interpretation of the Bill of Rights. But
there's one amendment on which reporters' interpretations become very narrow -- the Second. 
Look at how Jack Ford assaulted National Rifle Association President Marion Hammer on the April
28 Today. Ford asserted: "Assault weapons. The NRA has been consistent in its opposition to any
restrictions on assault weapons. What possible compelling reason is there for private citizens
to own assault weapons?" Ford also asked, "What would you say to the mother of an inner-city
child who was killed by stray gunfire? How would you explain to that mother why the rights to
own weapons are more important than that mother's child?" Finally, he raised the now standard
media linkage, "We've seen recently that members of anti-government groups, militia groups, have
been linked, if not directly, in some ways philosophically, with the NRA. Are you concerned
about that?"<p>


<h3>Stacked Reporting</h3><p>

Do you wonder if reporters make up facts or use questionable information to support their own
views? ABC's Lynn Sherr did in an April 26 20/20 in which she argued "the number one way to get
sexy, in many women's minds, is with larger breasts."<p>

But Washington Post pollster Richard Morin revealed May 19 that Sherr ignored ABC's own
scientific poll conducted specifically for the story. Instead she relied on an unscientific Self
magazine survey which found that half the women felt their bosoms were "inadequate." In fact,
the ABC poll found only 23 percent had "ever" wished their breasts were a different size. Asked
by Barbara Walters whether breast size is most important to men, Sherr explained that the ABC
poll found that "It's the face first, breasts come a close second." Really? Morin noticed that
at eight percent, breasts came in a distant fourth place.<p>


<h3>Park Panic</h3><p>

As summer approached the media offered a barrage of stories decrying the condition of the
national parks and laying the blame at the feet of the Republican Congress.  The Los Angeles
Times led the charge with a May 14 story titled, "Tapped-Out National Parks Turn to Corporations
for Aid." Staff writer D'Jamila Salem began: "As Congress pulls the purse strings tighter, the
National Park Service is turning to corporate America for funds to refurbish and maintain many
of the nation's parks and memorials, including the Washington Monument....The National Park
Service has a 1996 budget of $1.32 billion, down $67 million from 1995." But the Heritage
Foundation's Scott Hodge told MediaWatch the Park Service's budget has risen $79 million from
$1.488 billion in 1993 to an estimated $1.567 billion for 1996.<p>

NBC's Bryant Gumbel opened a May 24 Today interview: "On Close Up this morning, our national
parks are in a bit of trouble...Budget cutbacks have left many more understaffed struggling to
cope with the needs of visitors." Talking to two park service officials, Gumbel queried, "How
much have you had to cut those regular levels of seasonal employees?" And, "To what extent do
you think safety has been compromised at your facility as a result of the cutbacks?" He asked,
"Are you saying that when people say they want lower taxes, maybe they don't think about what
happens to their parks?" Finally, he took a jab at Congress, "Do you think Congress, the people
on Capitol Hill, have any true appreciation of the dire straits the parks are in?"<p>

On the May 27 World News Tonight, ABC's Tom Foreman brought some reason to the process. He
observed that while visitors to the parks have been increasing, "It is worth noting the National
Parks have been spared some of the major budget cuts...This year the park budget actually went
up $4 million. No wonder some in Congress feel the park service is crying wolf."<p>


<h3>Skip the Other Side</h3><p>

"A balanced report, in some cases, may no longer be the most effective or even the most
informative. Indeed, it can be debilitating. Can we afford to wait for our audience to come to
its conclusions? I think not." Apparently this policy, written six years ago by CNN producer
Teya Ryan, continues today. <p>

On the May 8 The World Today, anchor Linden Soles scared viewers: "It's elementary. We need to
breathe to stay alive. But what if the air is so dirty it could kill you? That's what happens to
tens of thousands of Americans each year, according to a new report. It comes as environmental
regulations are under fire in Congress." Reporter Skip Loescher opened: "Depending on where you
live and your medical condition stepping out for a little fresh air may not be a good idea. In
fact, according to a new report what's in the air we breathe may be prematurely killing us."
Loescher offered soundbites from a press conference by the Natural Resources Defense Council,
the author of the new report. David Hawkins, from the NRDC claimed 64,000 prematurely died from
heart and lung disease brought on by particulate air pollution. Acting like an NRDC spokesman,
Loescher simply lifted numbers from the report. "The number of premature deaths in some cities
is startling. In Los Angeles, for example, the report cites more than 5,800. More than 400 early
deaths are estimated in New York..." Nowhere did Loescher offer an opposing side to counter the
NRDC claims.<p>


<h3>Reinventing Mathematics</h3><p>

Part of the Clinton Administration's attempt to paint itself as moderate involves "reinventing
government," fostering the idea that they are making government smaller. Peter Jennings played
along on the May 14 World News Tonight. He delivered this finger wag to anti-government folks:
"There are a couple of things about government which may surprise you. The federal government is
only about three percent larger than it was more than thirty years ago. And the number of
federal employees is about the same as it was in the 1950s." <p>

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) figures for federal employees have indeed been relatively
stable at around 2 million over the last thirty years. But in the February American Spectator,
Byron York pointed out that most of the Clinton-era cuts were from a Cold War drawdown begun by
the Bush Administration and the closing of the Resolution Trust Corporation: "Add up just those
two areas-Defense and the RTC-and you get 140,800 jobs, or 90 percent of the cuts claimed by
Clinton and Gore. That means the administration has cut a grand total of 16,000 jobs -- less
than one percent of the workforce." The actual scope and power of the federal government is
measured most directly by the federal spending level. According to Edwin Rubenstein's The Right
Data, OMB figures showed federal spending grew 173 percent in real terms between 1965 and 1992.
Hardly the benign "three percent larger" federal government of Jennings' imagination. <p>


<h3>Israel's Gingrich?--Defining Fear and Extremism</h3><p>


An upset election occurs, turning the media conventional wisdom on its head as a conservative
politician wins. The media dismiss the win as unsubstantive, the product of fear and angry white
men. They throw terms like "hardliner" and "right-winger" at the winner and accuse him of
inspiring violence with his rhetoric.<p>

In 1994, the target of this media barrage was Newt Gingrich. In 1996 it was Israel's new Prime
Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Prior to the vote, on the May 27 CBS This Morning, Jesse Schulman
set up the choice: "Shimon Peres, statesman of the old school...talking about the big picture,
about Israel's place in a changing Middle East, about hopes for peace, versus Benjamin
Netanyahu, the slickest TV politician in the business, master of the soundbite, master of the
cheap shot."<p>

Others picked up on Netanyahu's American conservative connections. That night, NBC's Martin
Fletcher tried some guilt by association: "[Netanyahu] has American politician written all over
his campaign. That's thanks to an American political consultant, who has advised conservatives
like Senator Al D'Amato and Jesse Helms. The consultant told Netanyahu to stick to one simple,
negative theme: fear."<p>

The media stuck to a simple message, increasingly invoking the fear theme as the returns became
clearer. Good Morning America anchor Charlie Gibson made the charge on the May 30 broadcast:
"Yesterday's watershed vote, so important to the peace process in the Middle East, has been
called a choice between Israel's hopes and fears, and it now appears, though the results are
still oh so close, that Israel may have voted its fears. Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed to apply
brakes to the peace process, if not reverse it entirely, is ahead in the vote count."<p>

Later on the same show, New York Times reporter Judith Miller declared that "it was both a
victory for the forces of fear and militancy." Just like Newt Gingrich in 1994, Bibi Netanyahu
was accused of running a campaign not on important issues but on base emotions. <p>

In 1995, Gingrich and House Republicans were accused of inspiring the Oklahoma City bombing. In
1996, Netanyahu was charged with creating the environment for Yitzhak Rabin's assassination. On
the May 31 CBS This Morning, Harry Smith asked Middle East analyst Fouad Ajami: "Let's talk
about his words for a second. Because it's not that many months ago that a lot of people were
accusing Bibi Netanyahu of fanning the flames of the Israeli right, of setting the rhetorical
tone for Rabin's assassination."<p>

Netanyahu, like Gingrich, was subjected to extreme labeling, but their opponents, Peres and the
Democrats, were almost never tagged left wing, extreme or radical. On the May 30 CBS Evening
News, Dan Rather suggested "Serious questions about the future of Middle East peace as Lebanese
terrorists attack an Israeli army convoy and the Israeli government appears headed for a major
shift to the hardline right." The next night he announced, "Right-wing hardliner Benjamin
Netanyahu is declared Israel's new Prime Minister."<p>

On Today May 31, NBC's Ron Allen worried: "The transition seems already underway. This morning
Netanyahu continued talks that could create the most right-wing Orthodox religious government
here ever. During the count, Netanyahu has been silent, leaving aides to offer reassurances that
nothing radical is about to happen."  <p>

<h2>Stand for More Money--Media Promote Liberal Rally</h2><p>


Liberal advocates of increased welfare spending used kids to advance their own interests through
the Children's Defense Fund's (CDF) June 1 Stand for Children march. And the media bought the
facade. Time set the tone with a June 3 story headlined "The Children's Crusade: A '60s style
campaign aims to put kids first in this year's budget battles and the presidential race."
Elizabeth Gleick managed to squeeze only two conservatives into five pages as she painted the
CDF as a group working to fix the "disconnect between what Americans say they want for children
and what they actually do for them." Joan Lunden endorsed the message of organizer Marian Wright
Edelman during a May 30 Good Morning America interview: "It seems like there's more money being
spent for the environment or for the gun lobby...the federal government's talking about turning
over a lot of the social programs to the states...What do you think is the best way to approach
this?" As Edelman responded, "The first thing is we've got to make a commitment," Lunden chimed
in "Yeah, yeah." Edelman then charged that march sponsors "will no longer tolerate the neglect
and abandonment of our children or the massive budget cuts or the dismantlement of the safety
net." To which Lunden gushed: "Gotta get the message out there and get people to rally around
one of our most important problems." Even pieces that included a conservative view still spun
for the marchers. On the May 30 CBS Evening News, Wyatt Andrews talked to kids at a teen center,
noting "the fear they express and the troubling state of kids in general is the reason" for the
march. "A massive rally for children sounds like one of the least controversial ideas in
history, and yet conservative critics believe this march is just a backdrop masking a liberal
agenda." After a clip of the Heritage Foundation's Robert Rector, he showed a teen saying "I
don't want our future to be messed up. I want to, like, have a nice environment and live
peacefully." NBC's John Palmer concluded his June 1 Nightly News story with the marcher's spin:
"As the rally ended, parents were urged to go back home and fight for increased public funding
for programs that help children and to carry the message that children should come first."  <p>

<h2>The Dick Morris Echo Chamber--Reporters Pile "Extremist" Labels on Republicans, But Spared
Democrats in 1993 and 1994</h2><p>

At the dawn of the Clinton era, the Democratic Party dominated both the executive and
legislative branches. Within months, Democrats peeled away  restrictions on abortion on demand,
pushed for openly gay soldiers in the military, raised taxes to historically high levels, and
promoted universally subsidized health care. Two years later, in the gloomy days after the
Republican sweep of Congress in 1994, Bill Clinton sought the advice of political consultant
Dick Morris, who urged him to "triangulate" between the extremes of the ascendant conservative
Republicans and the liberals in his own party. Would reporters label liberal Democrats
"extreme"? To analyze the media's use of labels to describe the political parties, MediaWatch
analysts used the Nexis news data retrieval system to search for the word "extreme" within 25
words of "Republican" or "Democrat" in the three news magazines (Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News &
World Report) and USA Today from January 1, 1993 to May 31, 1996. Analysts discovered reporters
did not use many extremist labels in 1993 and 1994 -- 41 -- but 26 of those were applied to
Republicans, compared to ten mentions of dual extremes and only five for the Democrats who ruled
both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. But in the first 17 months of GOP control, Republicans were
described as "extreme" in 123 stories, while only 15 found "extremes" on both sides. Just two
mentioned "extreme" Democrats. USA Today's Richard Benedetto exemplified reporting on Republican
extremism on June 16, 1995: "Democrats are trying to keep a stiff upper lip as they continue to
oppose `extreme' GOP cuts." Many of these were attributed to Democrats, but more than 20 came
directly from reporters, such as Gloria Borger's March 11, 1996 U.S. News suggestion that
"taking on Buchananism would be good for Gingrich. Recall that until Buchanan surged, Gingrich
was Washington's resident extremist." The reports citing dual extremes weren't always perfectly
balanced. Witness U.S. News's Kenneth Walsh on July 31, 1995: "The President is trying to
position himself as a moderate who occupies a middle ground between liberal Democrats and
ultraconservative Republicans." A rare extreme label for Democrats came in the August 22, 1994
Newsweek, when Joe Klein hit the Clintons: "This President -- and more to the point -- the First
Lady have cultivated the most extreme Democratic health-care cultists and boycotted the
moderates of both parties." The breakdown by publication: USA Today described Republicans with
extreme terms in 14 news stories in 1993 and 1994, compared to five on dual extremes and two
touching on Democrats. More common was  Richard Benedetto on June 27, 1994: "Some analysts warn
the growing strength of conservative Christians in the GOP, and their reputation for
intolerance, will drive moderates and independents to the Democrats, and cause selection of an
extremist 1996 presidential candidate who can't win."<p>
 USA Today tossed in 62 mentions of GOP extremism in 1995-96, seven of dual extremes, and one on
 Democrats. Judy Keen and Bill Nichols found just one extreme on March 16, 1995: "Clinton wants
 to steer a middle course between traditional Democratic liberalism and `extremist' GOP budget
 cut proposals." The duo explained this "middle course" involved "using the broad theme that the
 GOP agenda is extremist, callous toward children and the poor, and cuts government more than
 the nation will tolerate."<p>
U.S. News & World Report contained four mentions of Republican extremism, three of dual
extremes, and one of Democratic extremism in 1993-94; but in 1995-96, U.S. News led the
magazines with 28 GOP extremist labels, two mentions of dual extremes and just one Democrat
extreme. Kenneth Walsh claimed on March 25, 1996: "Clinton's feuds with some allies will make it
harder to label him a liberal extremist, as George Bush in 1988 caricatured Michael Dukakis." On
October 27, 1995, Walsh happily noted: "President Clinton, playing Horatius at the bridge
against the Republican hordes, is finally winning some favorable reviews. Democrats are rallying
to his side as he defends the poor and elderly against GOP `extremism.'" Time carried five
mentions of Republican extremism, and zero mentions of dual or Democratic extremes in 1993-94,
but forwarded 21 mentions of Republican extremism in 1995-96, compared to three mentions of dual
extremes and zero of Democratic extremism. A typical mention was Robert Hughes arguing in an
August 7, 1995 cover story that to Republicans, PBS was "a carcass they can toss to their
extreme right." Newsweek was the least tilted in 1993-94, with three mentions of GOP extremism,
two of dual extremes, two of Democrats: one came in Klein's story quoted above, the other  a
Sharon Begley mention of a professional protest group called BEIRUT (Boisterous Extremists for
Insurrection Against Republicans and Other Unprincipled Thugs). But in 1995-96, the magazine
employed 22 references to GOP extremism, three mentions of dual extremes, and no example of
Democratic extremism.     Howard Fineman tapdanced around associating Republicans with Timothy
McVeigh on May 8, 1995: "the Oklahoma bombing has illuminated a once dark landscape much farther
afield: a radical fringe of militant gun owners, `hate radio' talk-show hosts, racial
extremists, and religious cultists. Their numbers are small -- and their GOP ties tenuous at
best. But their fervor is influential at the grass roots Republicans call their own." Joe Klein
cheered on November 13: "[Colin] Powell has done a great national service by confounding the
extremist publicists and fundraisers of the Republican right." On CNBC's Tim Russert May 25,
Time's Jeffrey Birnbaum told of an adversary relationship with the White House, which saw
reporters as a group "that was there to be manipulated....the conduit for their talking points."
That's all too accurate. The evidence shows reporters aren't stenographers for the White House
-- they're stenographers for White House political consultant. Klein's January 30, 1995 column
didn't count: "[House Minority Whip David] Bonior's reputation of extreme decency and hard work
has saved him."What didn't count was Gloria Borger's April 11, 1994 plaint about White House
inquiries into the hiring of Republican prosecutor Jay Stephens to investigate Whitewater: "It
has swung from a stubborn refusal to disclose to the current extreme of apologizing for
perfectly appropriate behavior."  At least Richard Stengel more evenly presented dual extremes
on February 5, 1996, saying the "triangulation" strategy of "steering between the extremes of
the House Republicans and the liberals in Clinton's own party -- has had the counterintuitive
effect of making Clinton seem like a 'conviction politician.'" On December 19, 1994, Newsweek's
Lucy Howard and Carla Koehl did note an accusation of liberal extremism in the Republican Party,
quoting a flier distributed by "conservative activists" warning of Rep. Susan Molinari's
(R-N.Y.) "extreme pro-abortion agenda," which the reporters immediately followed by noting:
"House sources say that the strident attack angered members, who thought it was unfair." On
November 20, 1995, Joe Klein tried to cast himself in the "radical middle" by scoffing at
Democrats who claimed Colin Powell's refusal to run for President as proof of Republican
extremism: "The witless husk of the party that remains is as intolerant of heresy -- on
abortion, racial gerrymandering, the sanctity of teacher unions -- as any of Pat Robertson's
wing-nuts are." <p>

<center><h2>"Moderates" Vote Left--Democrats Backed Since 1976</center></h2><p>


A survey of his colleagues by a White House correspondent has confirmed that the Freedom Forum
poll, showing 89 percent of Washington reporters voted for Clinton and 50 percent identify
themselves as Democrats, but just four percent as Republicans, matches how they've voted since
1976.<p>

For his new book, Feeding the Beast: The White House Versus the Press, U.S. News & World Report
White House correspondent Kenneth Walsh personally polled 28 of his White House colleagues. His
findings: "In 1992, nine respondents voted for Clinton, two for George Bush, and one for
independent Ross Perot. Three said they had not voted for anyone, and one reporter wrote in the
name of former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas. In 1988, twelve voted for Democrat Michael
Dukakis, only one for Bush, and three did not vote for a presidential candidate. In 1984, ten
voted for Democrat Walter Mondale, no one admitted voting for Ronald Reagan, and four said they
had not voted for a presidential candidate."<p>

In a May 10 appearance on the Fox Morning News Walsh maintained "that the overwhelming number of
reporters" he polled "identify themselves as moderates." Walsh insisted reporters don't have a
liberal bias, "I think it's more just an engine of anti-incumbency." But that's not what his
poll found the last time a Democratic incumbent faced re-election: "In 1980, eight voted for
Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter, two voted for Ronald Reagan, four voted for independent
candidate John Anderson, and three did not vote. In 1976, eleven voted for Carter and two for
Republican incumbent Gerald Ford."<p>

Walsh's survey included reporters from all the major media: the four TV networks, the Los
Angeles Times, New York Times, USA Today, and The Washington Post; Copley, Cox, Hearst,
Knight-Ridder, plus Newsweek, Time and U.S. News & World Report.  <p>

<h2>MRC-Study from July 1996 Media Watch</h2>
<p>
<h4>Medicare: The Story with 1,060 Errors</h4>
<p>
<dd>The Health Program That Grows by Leaps and Bounds Mysteriously Described 
as "Cut"
<p>
<dd>No subject inspires more  daily journalistic fabrication than the 
federal budget. For the last 15 years, as federal spending mushroomed, 
journalists told a story echoing liberal economist John Kenneth 
Galbraith,  of a squalid public sector starved of its necessary funds. 
No program benefited more from the statist illusions of baseline 
budgeting than Medicare, which reportedly suffered "deep cuts" as it 
expanded -- 72 percent in the Bush years, for example.
<p>
<dd>In the last 18 months, reporters have made Medicare "cuts" an essential 
part of its method of underlining the "extremism" of the Republican 
Congress. The GOP's balanced-budget plan called for a $270 billion 
reduction in projected Medicare increases over seven years (with 
spending per recipient scheduled to increase from $4,800 to $7,100), but 
"cuts" remained the most popular paradigm of reporting.
<p>
<dd>To determine the accuracy of Medicare coverage, MediaWatch analysts 
reviewed 1,134 news stories in three newspapers (The New York Times, The 
Washington Post, USA Today) and three news magazines (Newsweek, Time, 
U.S. News & World Report) from January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996. 
Employing the Nexis news data retrieval system to secure every news 
mention of "Medicare" within 10 words of "cut," "reduce," "slash," 
"scale back," and "savings," analysts found 1,060 examples of 
journalists describing Medicare "cuts."
<p>
<dd>Analysts counted multiple references within stories, but only references 
to overall Medicare spending growth, and did not include references to 
specifics, such as smaller reimbursements to doctors and hospitals. Also 
omitted were references to "saving" Medicare, which do not refer to 
spending. Analysts did include descriptions that did not match the 
search terms ("gut," "trim," "shrink," "chop," "slice," "curtail").
<p>
<dd> Other less harsh and inaccurate terms were also used. References to 
"savings" were most common, with 439 mentions. "Cuts in the growth" of 
Medicare spending drew 347 uses, and "cuts in projected spending" 
appeared 115 times. But the 901 uses of these terms were outnumbered by 
the 1,060 uses of "cut" variants. In this sample of stories inaccurate 
terminology drew more than half (54 percent) of journalistic 
declarations of Medicare's up-or-down fiscal fate.
<p>
<dd>Even the more accurate terms were garbled reactions to the dominant 
baseline-budgeting news paradigm. After all, how informative is the term 
"savings" when spending will increase by seven percent instead of ten 
percent? "Cuts in growth" and "cuts in projected spending" are 
interesting synonyms for a seven percent increase, especially when these 
terms were modified to sound harsher by reporters: "unreasonably large 
savings," "deep cuts in projected spending," "massive reductions in 
growth." To break it down by publication:
<p>
<dd>In 39 stories, Newsweek contained 24 mentions of "cuts," and only 11 
more accurate terms: five of "savings," five of "cuts in growth," and 
one "cut in projected spending." The January 8, 1996 "Corporate Killers" 
cover story warned: "Congress's budget debate -- and possible cuts in 
programs like Medicare and Medicaid -- feeds fears that the social 
safety net is about to be savaged."
<p>
<dd>Out of 63 stories, Time employed 49 descriptions of "cuts," to 20 uses 
of "cuts in growth," nine of "savings," and two of "cuts in projected 
spending." The May 15, 1995 "The Week" news summary read: "The 
President's strategists were not about to offer Republicans a hand with 
their balanced-budget/tax-cut promises by agreeing to deep slashes in 
Medicare." Richard Lacayo wrote on February 12, 1996 that a flat tax 
"could mean either a higher deficit or even heavier spending cuts in 
such places as Medicare."
<p>
<dd>U.S. News & World Report's 69 stories included 47 "cut" terms to 55 of 
the more accurate terms -- the only source  to tip slightly in 
accuracy's direction. The stories featured 29 references to "cuts in 
growth," 21 to "savings," and five to "cuts in projected spending." A 
March 13, 1995 budget story reported: "Among big-ticket programs, 
Medicare, the health care program for the elderly, and Medicaid, for the 
poor, both came in for major cuts."
<p>
<dd>The New York Times filed 508 stories matching the search terms, with 386 
references to "cuts." Reports of "savings" came on 144 occasions, "cuts 
in growth" on 112, and "cuts in projected spending" on 76. On May 11, 
1995, reporter David Sanger wrote: "But when it came to the details, 
they balked at many of the most extreme cuts, from the deepest slashes 
in Medicare to the elimination of the Commerce Department."
<p>
<dd>On October 27, the Times reported a controversy over its poll question: 
"If you had to choose, would you prefer balancing the budget or 
preventing Medicare from being significantly cut?" Not only did media 
outlets err in news stories, then they erred in their polls and in the 
news stories reporting the poll results.
<p>
<dd>In 256 stories, USA Today carried 157 mentions of "cuts," compared to 63 
of "savings," 56 of "cuts in growth," and 12 of "cuts in projected 
spending." Reporter William M. Welch suggested on May 10, 1995 the 
Republican budget would "make huge cuts in Medicare and Medicaid." 
Despite the 157 boo-boos, USA Today actually printed a correction on 
September 6, 1995: "In its Thursday edition, USA Today incorrectly 
states that Republicans have proposed reducing Medicare spending by $270 
billion. Under the Republican reform proposal to ensure that the program 
remains solvent, Medicare spending over the next seven years increases." 
<p>
<dd>The Washington Post led the survey with 397 uses of "cuts" and its 
variants in 370 stories, contrasted by 197 references to "savings," 125 
to "cuts in growth," and 19 to "cuts in projected spending." An October 
22, 1995 headline charged: "Critics Say Huge Medicare Cut Will Not Heal 
System as GOP Predicts." But the emblematic Post error came in reporter 
Howard Kurtz's attempt to correct a Clinton ad on February 7, 1996: 
"What the ads don't say is that Clinton has also proposed to cut 
Medicare spending, albeit less than the GOP." Kurtz's story, as well as 
the sample as a whole, suggests print reporters are hardly the most 
reliable judges of accuracy, even on the most basic budgetary truths.

<p>
<h4>Slow Out of the Gate on Filegate</h4>
<p>
Networks Criticize Republicans for Aggressive Investigations of 
Wrongdoing
<p>
<dd>After some initial reluctance, the networks eventually picked up the 
news that the White House had improperly obtained FBI files. But instead 
of launching their own investigations, they selectively ran revelations 
uncovered by others.
<p>
<dd>The White House admitted on June 7 collecting FBI reports on 338 GOP 
officials. ABC, CBS and CNN failed to mention the revelation that night. 
NBC's Tom Brokaw did a brief item. ABC aired its first story the next 
day after Bob Dole raised the Watergate comparison. Over on NBC, anchor 
Brian Williams painted Dole as the bad guy: "The politics of Campaign 
'96 are getting very ugly, very early. Today, Bob Dole accused the White 
House of using the FBI to wage war against its political enemies."
<p>
<dd>Three days later only ABC reported that FBI procdures were violated and 
the next day, June 12, ABC and NBC didn't bother noting that President 
Clinton apologized. On June 13 the networks were silent though the 
Senate announced hearings would be held, the FBI began an overhaul of 
procedures, and the New York Post reported that Anthony Marceca, who got 
the files, had ties to Democratic politicians.
<p>
<dd>On June 14 FBI Director Louis Freeh charged the White House with 
"egregious violations of privacy." All four did stories, but the day 
after this critical report that contradict-ed the White House claims, 
only CBS touched the subject.
<p>
<dd>"There's no question that the press initially blew this story," 
Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz declared on the June 16 Fox 
News Sunday. Why? There was a "feeling that...a political snooping 
operation was not the kind of thing they expected from the Clinton White 
House, whereas if hundreds of files had been obtained by Ed Meese in the 
Reagan administration on Democrats, I think this story would have 
rocketed to the front page." But that failed to prod his colleagues. No 
network noted that day's Washington Post report that, in contradiction 
to White House claims, the Secret Service said they did not produce the 
list.
<p>
<dd>Instead, CBS painted the Clintons as victims. When the Senate issued its 
June 18 report on its Travel Office investigation, Dan Rather intoned: 
"The more than year-long investigation ended almost the way it began: A 
Republican offensive targeted First Lady Hillary Clinton. Democrats 
claim that it's an all-out election-year political smear-attack."
Weeks later abuses of pow-er still failed to raise concern. The July 6 
Los Angeles Times reported that Marceca "learn-ed from his own 
background file the names of two women who made critical comments about 
him to the FBI. After seeing the file, Marceca sued the two women for 
defamation." Network coverage? Zilch.

<h4>Contract Attacked, But...Families First Favored</h4>
<p>
<dd>NBC doesn't know what to think about the Contract with America's 
political appeal, but in 1994 they denounced its content while providing 
a more favorable forum this year for the Democratic platform.
<p>
<dd>House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt appeared on the June 24 Today to 
discuss his Families First agenda. Katie Couric asked: "Speaker Gingrich 
and company's Contract with America was ultimately rejected by the 
majority of Americans and few people believe it was really behind the 
GOP sweep of the congressional elections in 1994, so why are Democrats 
trying the same approach?"
<p>
<dd>But 45 minutes later reporter Joe Johns had a different view: "The new 
Democratic agenda echoes a successful GOP strategy. In 1994, Republicans 
unveiled the Contract with America, which framed their national agenda 
in the weeks before the elections."
<p>
<dd>Whatever its public appeal, NBC panned the Contract when the Republicans 
unveiled it on September 27, 1994. Anchor Tom Brokaw announced: "GOP 
congressional candidates were summoned to Washington and given a battle 
plan. However, as NBC's Lisa Myers tells us tonight, it is long on 
promises but short on sound premises."
<p>
<dd>Myers lambasted it with five condemnations. After saying it called for 
tax cuts and a balanced budget, Myers charged that "an independent 
budget expert called it standard political bunk." She let a Democrat tag 
it "a big fraud" and then she stated the plan "fell hundreds of billions 
of dollars short of balancing the budget." Myers allowed Gingrich to 
defend the term limits plank, but only to use his response ("I don't 
think you're going to say to everybody who's been here 12 years, `You 
know, this is your last term'") as a foil for her closing sentence: "And 
politicians wonder why voters are cynical."
<p>
<dd>The networks went much easier on the Democrats. On the June 23 CBS 
Evening News John Roberts relayed, without any critical comment: "The 
Families First agenda includes higher paychecks, welfare reform, college 
tuition tax credits, better health care, retirement security and safer 
neighborhoods." A Nightly News piece by NBC's Johns was balanced, saying 
only the proposal was "short on specifics" without attacking any of the 
planks. Gingrich would have appreciated similar treatment.

<P>
<H4>Coia and the Mafia</H4>
<P>
<DD>Both Newsweek and Time have filed stories detailing the interesting 
relationship between President Clinton and Arthur Coia, head of the 
Laborers International Union of North America. The Justice Department's 
suspension of a federal takeover of the union coincided with generous 
donations to Clinton from both Coia and the union.
<P>
<DD>Newsweek's Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman were first on the story 
in the May 20 issue, noting the union has given more than $3 million to 
the Democrats since 1991. The June 24 Time story by reporter George 
Church suggested the relationship seemed to pay off for Coia: "After 
three months of negotiations, however, the Justice Department persuaded 
the union to sign a consent decree acknowledging Mob influence and 
conceding to court-appointed officers. But the department agreed to hold 
off filing the decree...The deal left Coia on the job even though the 
original complaint described him as `associated with and controlled and 
influenced by organized-crime figures.' Those are documentable 
facts...Did Justice make a deal because of Coia's White House 
connections?" Church added: "The unprecedented agreement dismayed some 
investigators in the field, who had spent years building the case 
against the union."
<P>
<DD>Church also noted: "Though there is no evidence of a White 
House-engineered fix, the laborers' lavish donations to the Democratic 
Party and Coia's frequent appearances at the White House -- as well as 
deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes' past life as a lawyer for the 
Laborers -- may hand the Republicans a campaign issue."

<h2>Revolving Door, from the July 1996 Media Watch</h2>
<p>
<h4>Chancellor's Last Spin</h4>
<p>
<dd>On July 12 NBC News veteran John Chancellor, who anchored NBC Nightly 
News from 1970 to 1982, passed away at age 68. For two years during the 
Johnson administration, Chancellor served as Director of the Voice of 
America. His death generated a series of tributes to his fairness and 
impartiality from his media colleagues.
<p>
<dd>On the July 13 NBC Nightly News, for instance, anchor Brian Williams 
observed of the man who delivered commentary until his 1993 retirement: 
"He was a role model for all who care about truth, justice and fairness. 
John Chancellor died last night of cancer, two days short of his 69th 
birthday. He helped define what TV news should be." Washington Post 
reporter Howard Kurtz recalled that Chancellor "called himself a man of 
the `extreme center.'"
<p>
<dd>"He dealt in facts," asserted former NBC News President Michael Gartner 
in a July 16 USA Today column. "For his last ten years at NBC, he 
delivered 90-second commentaries three nights a week....At dinner one 
night, I remarked that he got more facts into 90 seconds than we could 
get into the rest of Nightly News in 21 minutes."  Here's a look at some 
of those "fact"-based commentaries:
<p>
<dd>April 17, 1990: "The overall tax burden for Americans, federal, state, 
and local, is actually quite low....The fact is Americans could pay more 
taxes and the country wouldn't go down the tube. Taxpayers don't believe 
this because they are being conned by the politicians...The truth is 
that the United States needs higher taxes and can afford them. Some 
political leaders are now starting to say that, but until more say it, 
the country will remain in trouble."
<p>
<dd>November 20, 1990: "Some say Ronald Reagan won the Cold War by spending 
so much on defense that the Kremlin went bankrupt trying to keep up. 
That won't wash. During Reagan's presidency the United States itself 
became a bankrupt country."
<p>
<dd>August 21, 1991, on the Soviet Union: "It's short of soap, so there are 
lice in hospitals. It's short of pantyhose, so women's legs go bare. 
It's short snowsuits, so babies stay home in winter....The problem isn't 
communism; nobody even talked about communism this week. The problem is 
shortages."
<p>
<dd>April 30, 1992, after the riots in Los Angeles: "It's not a big surprise 
that the jury in suburban Simi Valley sided with the white policemen. 
Just as it's no surprise that the blacks in downtown Los Angeles rioted 
and people died....Politicians have fanned these flames with code words 
about `welfare queens,' `equal opportunity,' and `quotas.' Language 
designed to turn whites against blacks. With two-party politics that 
favored the rich and hurt everyone else."
<p>
<dd>March 12, 1992, a year after the Gulf War: "Greenpeace, the public 
interest organization, believes that the Iraqi death toll, civilian and 
military, before and after the war, may be as high as 198,000. Allied 
military dead are counted in the low hundreds. The disparity is huge and 
somewhat embarrassing. And that's commentary for this evening, Tom."
Election night, 1992, looking back at the Republican convention: "I 
think that the convention -- and certainly all the polling data 
indicates this -- offended a lot of women, offended a lot of people in 
the country who thought it was too religious and too hard-edged."

<h2>News Bites, from the July 1996 Media Watch</h2>
<p>
<b>Humorless Howard.</b>
<p>
To read Washington Post media writer Howard Kurtz, one might think Bill 
Clinton was some poor fat kid getting ridiculed on the playground. In a 
June 4 story he claimed Clinton "has drawn a phenomenal amount of 
personal ridicule" from comedians, "Unflattering images -- of a 
philandering, draft-dodging, pot-smoking, cheeseburger-chomp-ing, 
self-indulgent finagler -- reverberate through the media." And 
"Republicans have concluded that barbed humor can be a particularly 
sharp weapon." Unfortunately, Kurtz did not quantify his feelings by 
consulting experts. On June 24, the Center for Media and Public Affairs 
released the results of its study detailing jokes told by David 
Letterman, Jay Leno, and Conan O'Brien. Since the end of the primaries, 
"the latenight comics have told twice as many jokes about Dole as they 
have about Clinton."
<p>
<b>Richer Under Clinton.</b>
<p>
The June 20 New York Times headline declared: "Income Disparity Between 
Poorest and Richest Rises." Reporter Steven Holmes relayed a Census 
Bureau finding that "during the first two years" of Clinton, "the share 
of national income earned by the top 5 percent of householdsgrew at a 
faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan administration, 
which was often characterized as favoring the rich."
Where were the networks? On March 5, 1992, when the Times ran a similar 
piece, CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather announced: "In America in the 
1980s, what former President Reagan and those who support him call the 
Reagan Revolution put more money in the pockets of the rich. We already 
knew that. But a new study indicates that those who did best of all by 
far were the very richest of the rich." This time CBS was silent, as 
were ABC and CNN. The news made the June 20 NBC Nightly News, but anchor 
Brian Williams didn't blame Clinton, but corporate America: "Much of the 
blame for the income gap has been laid on vast changes in the job 
market, a job market that keeps shrinking. A while back corporate 
f pumping the story up."
<p>
<b>The Invisible McDougals.</b>
<p>
Two recent morning show interviewers demonstrated the convictions of the 
President's Whitewater business partners on multiple felony counts 
hasn't changed the media's tune. On the June 5 Good Morning America, 
ABC's Elizabeth Vargas interviewed Michael Chertoff, Republican Counsel 
to the Whitewater investigation. She inquired: "It would seem very 
natural that Hillary Clinton's fingerprints would be on her own billing 
records. Is this at all significant?" Throughout the interview Vargas 
sounded like a White House flack: "But, Mr. Chertoff, Mrs. Clinton 
freely admits she examined those documents back in 1992. How do you know 
these prints aren't several years old?"
<p>
CBS This Morning substitute host Erin Moriarty spent three straight days 
using the White House spin to challenge guests on June 18-20. 
Questioning  Rep. Susan Molinari (R-N.Y.), Democratic activist Lynn 
Cutler, and David Maraniss of The Washington Post, Moriarty asked 
nothing but pro-Clinton questions. She asked Molinari: "But let's be 
honest here. I mean, this is an election year. How much of this, as the 
White House of course says, is just a matter of the Republicans piling 
on in a presidential election year?" She asked Maraniss: "We're talking 
about transactions that occurred a decade ago. I mean, can't some of 
this just be simply forgetfulness?" The next day, Moriarty tried to 
dismiss Filegate in a question to Rep. William Clinger (R-Pa.): "Are you 
concerned that this will mean a number of redundant investigations into 
the same matter?"
<p>
Schneider's Wishful Thinking.On the June 14 Inside Politics, CNN polling 
analyst Bill Schneider trumpeted,  as the death knell of conservative 
activism, Virginia Sen. John Warner's decisive win over Jim Miller in a 
GOP primary: "This week the voters struck a resounding blow against 
political correctness --  not political correctness of the left, 
political correctness of the right." Schneider reported Warner took 
"moderate positions on abortion and gun control" and "refused to support 
radical right nominees of his own party, like Oliver North in 1994 and 
former Moral Majority official Mike Farris in 1993."
<p>
According to Schneider, activists representing term limits, gun owners 
and Christian conservatives were rejected by even the Republican 
faithful in Virginia. "Warner didn't just beat Miller, he wiped the 
floor with him. Warner won everywhere, even in solidly Republican 
areas...the Republican mainstream turned out to vote against him 
[Miller]."
<p>
Schneider charged conservatives were on a losing streak. "This 
represents the third defeat in a row for the right wing in Virginia. 
They couldn't win general elections in 1993 and 1994." He forgot the GOP 
made big gains in the state legislature in 1995 and elected conservative 
Gov. George Allen in 1993. Schneider also failed to mention the actual 
tone of Warner's TV ads. Some attacked Miller from the right, while 
others pitched Warner as a conservative: "Committed to common sense 
conservative principles like lower taxes, less regulation, and a 
balanced budget."
<p>
<b>It's Our Land of Hackdom Now.</b>
<p>
An article in the June 3 Newsweek by Mark Hosenball and Daniel Klaidman 
showed the Willie Horton defense is already being deployed in Campaign 
'96. Titled "Desperately Seeking the Next `Willie Horton,' the piece 
detailed what Newsweek called "part of a concerted Republican effort to 
build a `Hall of Shame' for prosecutors and judges deemed soft on 
crime...A loose network of former Republican prosecutors is searching 
for liberal jurists and lawyers, the kind who might, say, turn loose 
another Willie Horton."
<p>
Specifically, Newsweek tried to short-circuit Republican criticism of 
Janet Napolitano, a Clinton-appointed U.S. Attorney who had been one of 
Anita Hill's lawyers. Napolitano's office refused to grant a search 
warrant to postal inspectors investigating a child porn ring because she 
had a "`philosophical disagreement' with the sting operation because it 
targeted homosexual males." Oddly, while Hosenball and Klaidman decried 
this injection of politics into criminal justice, they cheered on that 
the "Justice [Department] is learning how to fight back. Using the 
lexicon of the campaign, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick has told 
aides she wants a `rapid response' to counter charges `in the same news 
cycle.' Gorelick is even setting up a campaign-like `war room' in her 
office. In a campaign year, Justice can't afford to be totally blind."
<p>
This contrasted with Newsweek's attitude in 1992 that "Clinton, for a 
change, should pick an Attorney General who is above politics." In that 
November 23, 1992 article Newsweek's David Kaplan criticized the Justice 
Department under Ed Meese for being too political: "Meese ran a Justice 
Department that was the Land of Hackdom -- little more than an agency to 
service the needs of President Reagan and, occasionally, of the A.G. 
himself. [Meese's] four-year reign was the archetype of politics over 
conscience, ideology over law."
<p>
<b>Hyping the Hippie.</b>
<p>
When Timothy Leary died on May 31, the media lauded him as a barefoot, 
smiling hippie who spent his life dispensing wisdom and encouraging 
people to open their minds. CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson related 
that "the last words of the man who spent a lifetime asking questions 
[were] `Why not?'
<p>
Newsweek's David Gates gave a much more complete portrait of Leary's 
life. Gates reported June 10 that by the end of the '60s, Leary "found 
it `inconceivable' that turned-on parents wouldn't share acid with kids 
as young as 7." In 1970, he broke out of prison with the help of the 
ultra-violent leftist Weather Underground, fleeing to the Black 
Panther's "exile" camp in Algeria. Gates reported that Leary suggested 
it was a "`sacred act' to shoot cops." After being captured in 
Afghanistan, Leary informed on drug buddies to curry favor for a lighter 
sentence.
<p>
<b>Brokaw's Bias Drained Out.</b>
<p>
Why are the media perceived as biased and what are the greatest threats 
to honest information? NBC's Tom Brokaw offered novel answers  during a 
June 11 National Press Club appearance aired on C-SPAN. On bias, Brokaw 
explained: "We're out there on the cutting edge of change on a daily 
basis. That's what news is all about....The people...who are the 
recipients of that news, kind of like the status quo for the most part. 
They're comfortable. They've learned to deal with it and they don't want 
to adapt to the change. Therefore they have to learn to blame someone in 
some regard and they think therefore since we brought them the news of 
the change that somehow we are biased of favor of the change." He 
insisted: "We've worked very hard to drain the bias out of what we do."
<p>
He dismissed talk radio, saying "I think that people pretty soon get 
bored with it...I think that you'll find that a lot of these acts and a 
lot of these towns around the country will begin to dry up because it's 
so Johnny One Note and it's not very enlightening." While "they can 
still stir up an issue from time to time," to Brokaw that's not a good 
thing, it's instead "the price of free speech."
<p>
Talk radio is not the only non-mainstream media source that disturbed 
the NBC anchor: "If you don't go on the net and look at the political 
web sites, then you're missing something, because that's an unfiltered 
access to people out there, and there's some outrageous stuff that is 
going out on the Internet right now -- claims that are being made by 
these special interest groups, all the way across the political 
spectrum, from the far left to the far right." It seems that in Brokaw's 
world, free speech is a threat if he or his colleagues can't control it.

<h2>Janet Cooke Award</h2>
<P>
<H4>Newsweek, ABC Put Best Face on First Lady's White House Talks to the Dead</H4>
<P>
<H4>Poor Joan of Arc Can't Get Private Help</H4>
<P>
<DD>Reporter Bob Woodward promoted his new book The Choice with a colorful 
anecdote of Hillary Clinton, under the guidance of psychic Jean Houston, 
speaking in the White House solarium to Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma 
Gandhi. Woodward reported the friendship clicked when Houston said 
Hillary "was reversing thousands of years of expectation, and was there 
upfront, probably more than virtually any woman in human history -- 
apart from Joan of Arc."
<P>
<DD>Reporters at Newsweek and ABC sympathized with the First Lady in 
covering Woodward's psychic scoop. For employing a very different 
approach than their coverage of Nancy Reagan's use of an astrologer, 
Newsweek and ABC earned the Janet Cooke Award.
<P>
<DD>Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas acknowledged the Nancy 
Reagan parallels of Hillary's psychic friends, but countered critics and 
comedians July 1: "A long-time searcher for spiritual meaning, Mrs. 
Clinton had conjured conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt long before 
she met Dr. Houston. Mrs Clinton is not even the first First Lady to 
dabble in psychics or mediums: the wives of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, 
Ulysses S. Grant, John Tyler, Woodrow Wilson, and Warren G. Harding all 
tried, in one way or another, to communicate beyond the grave. Unlike 
Nancy Reagan, Hillary never tried to use psychic powers to influence her 
husband."
<P>
<DD>Thomas added: "To many women, Hillary Clinton is not a cold-eyed 
conspirator, but a martyr." He quoted Mrs. Clinton's fans at a Boston 
fundraiser for the Clinton campaign saying Hillary's "being bashed by 
the press" because "a lot of people don't like a strong woman." Thomas 
concluded that to these voters, "Hillary looks just the way she does to 
her philosopher friend, Dr. Houston -- as a Joan of Arc figure, 
persecuted for her righteous crusade."
<P>
<DD>If it seems hardly noteworthy for liberal Hillary to be popular in 
Massachusetts, the June 21 Boston Herald's account of the fundraiser 
presented a less than popular figure. Reporter Joe Sciacca quoted a 
Democratic operative: "They couldn't give tickets away. A lot of people 
got [free tickets]. Even the applause lines were off. A lot of people 
are getting concerned." Thomas told MediaWatch: "Our reporter Martha 
Brant was there and saw it first-hand. They certainly were enthusiastic 
Hillary-lovers at this lunch...I don't think the point's negated if they 
had difficulty selling tickets."
<P>
<DD>This is not the spin Newsweek gave the Nancy Reagan story, revealed in 
former chief of staff Don Regan's book For the Record. In the May 16, 
1988 issue, George Hackett and Eleanor Clift did allow Mrs. Reagan's 
press secretary, Elaine Crispen, to ask: "If she could get a little 
comfort and consolation from astrology, why not?" But they also 
forwarded other spins: "Scientists showed less tolerance for the 
President's participation in what they consider medieval superstition. 
`How can you control a science budget of billions of dollars when you 
believe in nonsense of this magnitude?,' says James Kaler, professor of 
astronomy at the University of Illinois." Hackett and Clift added: 
"Criticism also rumbled from fundamentalists, who liken astrology to 
Satan worship. `This is the last straw for a lot of religious people who 
treated Reagan as their political savior,' said conservative columnist 
and former Moral Majority vice president Cal Thomas."
<P>
<DD>Newsweek failed to try these lines of attack on Mrs. Clinton's Methodist 
commitments. (It could have been done: Washington Times reporter Julia 
Duin did interview several disappointed Methodist theologians and 
evangelicals -- and some Methodist defenders -- on June 25). But that 
might have clashed with Newsweek religion reporter Kenneth Woodward's 
October 31, 1994 verdict that "Hillary Rodham Clinton is as pious as she 
is political. Methodism, for her, is not just a church but an extended 
family of faith that defines her horizons." He called the Clinton era 
. Sam Donaldson reports the White House will not take the Regan book 
lying down."
<P>
<DD>Donaldson was straightforward instead of sympathetic, airing both 
critics and supporters: "This new, unflattering portrait of the First 
Family is producing new, often humorous, unfavorable public reaction 
which political opponents are clearly savoring.... Reagan loyalists are 
incensed....Reporters like Helen Thomas are just glad to be informed." 
Donaldson ended: "Presidents and their wives look to their place in 
history and to the Reagans, Regan's book doesn't help."
Both outlets were reasonably fair (if a little jokey) with the Reagans, 
but any damaging tidbit on the Clintons, no matter how trivial, seems to 
inspire an entirely different approach: damage control. Remember when 
reporters used to provoke damage control, not practice it?

<blockquote> 
<h2>Double Standard on Rumor -- Aldrich Canceled by Networks</h2>
<P>
<DD>Under intense questioning on the June 30 This Week with David Brinkley, 
former FBI agent turned author Gary Aldrich backed down on the most 
sensational charge in his book Unlimited Access -- that Bill Clinton 
sneaks out of the White House for trysts. Reporters denounced Aldrich, 
and ABC's Nightline, Dateline NBC, and CNN's Larry King Live canceled 
interviews with him, echoing the White House line that guests meet a 
"bare threshhold of credibility." This is not a standard the networks 
have applied in the past. 
<P>
For example:
<BR>
<DD>Kitty Kelley appeared in three consecutive morning interviews on NBC's 
Today show (April 8-10, 1991) and also on CBS This Morning (April 11). 
Time and Newsweek both put her book on their covers. The New York Times 
put her unproven charges on page one, without any attempt to prove her 
allegations, including the fanciful charge that Nancy Reagan had a 
torrid affair with Frank Sinatra in the White House. Bryant Gumbel began 
NBC's three days of interviews arguing that "Best-selling author Kitty 
Kelley has proven her courage and her credibility with her 
no-holds-barred biographies."
<P>
<DD>Anita Hill drew more than 60 evening news stories in October 1991 on the 
networks before the Senate even began hearings, which featured the live 
airing of Hill's unsubstantiated allegations that Supreme Court nominee 
Clarence Thomas talked about the size of his penis and loved discussing 
films showing humans having sex with animals. On October 7, 1991, Dan 
Rather asked Hill questions like: "Why do you believe this man, Judge 
Thomas, that you have worked closely with for a long time, has not 
spoken directly to what you consider to be the substance of this 
charge?" Joseph and Susan Trento claimed, based solely on the guesswork 
of the late Ambassador Louis Fields, that George Bush had an affair with 
State Department aide Jennifer Fitzgerald. On August 11, 1992, CNN's 
Mary Tillotson was the first to ask Bush about the charge. Dateline NBC 
anchor Stone Phillips asked the President in prime time. ABC's Good 
Morning America and CBS This Morning invited the Trentos on for 
interviews.
<P>
<DD>Newt Gingrich's enemies have insisted that Gingrich showed up at the 
hospital bed of his cancer-stricken first wife Jackie with a notebook to 
discuss divorce terms. That unsubstantiated story has been told by Tom 
Brokaw on Dateline NBC, CNN's Judy Woodruff, and then-CBS star Connie 
Chung.
<P>
<DD>Gary Sick's 2,200-word April 15, 1991 New York Times op-ed jump-started 
the discredited "October Surprise" theory that held the 1980 Reagan 
campaign conspired to delay the release of the Iranian hostages. Sick 
was booked on Nightline (where Ted Koppel called him "serious, 
knowledgeable Gary Sick") and Larry King Live, and the charges drew 27 
evening news stories in 1991.

<h2>Networks Try to Create "Houston II"</h2>
<P>
<H4>Prime-Time Coverage Finds Extremists, Asks Liberal Questions, Obsesses Over Abortion</H4>
<P>
<DD>The shadow of Houston has stubbornly remained a part of the media image 
of the Republican Party. The Texas town's 1992 convention quickly became 
a "feast of hate and fear" in the media lexicon, as the networks heaped 
70 statements or questions about the appropriateness of the alleged 
overly negative tone of the Republicans, compared to zero mentions for 
the Democrats in New York's Madison Square Garden.
<P>
<DD>The 1996 convention in San Diego offered reporters the promise of 
another Houston, a mirror image of the punitive, extremist fiasco 
reporters created out of the last convention. But the moderated tone the 
Republicans sought to project gave reporters few opportunities to create 
new controversy.
<P>
<DD>But the biased pattern of past conventions did repeat itself, if not to 
the same degree as four years ago. In short, during the San Diego 
convention: 
<UL>
<LI><a href="#labeling">(1)</a> Republican delegates, speakers, and candidates were described as conservative more than three times as often as moderate, but also as extreme more often than as moderate; 
<LI><a href="#questions">(2)</a> Reporters and anchors posed more than seven times as many questions from the liberal agenda than from a conservative agenda; and 
<LI><a href="#abortion">(3)</a> controversies, especially the intra-party tussle over abortion, of Republican exclusivity and "intolerance," far outnumbered the coverage of controversies and the exclusion of pro-life speakers at the Democrats' 1992 convention.<P>
</UL>
<DD>During the convention, a team of MediaWatch analysts in both San Diego 
and Alexandria, Virginia watched live prime time coverage offered by the 
five networks. The information appeared in a special daily Media Reality 
Check '96 newsletter. This year's study follows the methodology of 
convention studies in 1984, 1988, and 1992, and covered all ABC, CBS, 
and NBC prime time coverage, as well as the combined PBS/NBC coverage 
and CNN from 8 pm to 11pm Eastern time. In the September issue, 
MediaWatch will publish a comparison of the San Diego coverage with 
coverage of the Democrats in Chicago. 
<P>
<a name="labeling">
<B>Labeling</B>
<P>
<DD>Network reporters followed the usual pattern of convention labeling, 
with 46 conservative (with 16 references to extreme conservatism) to 13 
moderate labels. NBC had only two conservative labels and four moderate 
tags. CBS, with nine references to conservatives and five labels for 
moderates, also came close to balancing the labels. ABC(10-0), CNN 
(16-2), and PBS (9-2) underlined the conservative nature of the party. 
PBS led in the use of extreme labels with six, followed by CNN (4), CBS 
(3), ABC (2) and NBC (1).
<P>
<DD>The amount of labeling declined every night: from 29 on Monday to 14 on 
Tuesday, 11 on Wednesday, and five on Thursday. The label count did not 
include mentions of the party's attempts to woo "moderate voters," and 
also excluded historical references (for example, a reference to a "more 
moderate" Richard Nixon in the 1950s). Some examples of references to 
extremism:
<P>
<DD>Margaret Warner asked Newt Gingrich on PBS Monday night: "The Dole 
campaign officials do say that partly this convention is designed to 
undo the damage done to the Republican image by you and the Republican 
Congress, which fairly or unfairly, the voters seem to see as extreme. 
You've heard all the words. Do you think that's true and does it make 
you feel repudiated at all?"
<P>
<DD>On Tuesday night, CBS reporter Lesley Stahl explained the night about to 
unfold: "The whole purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program is 
to diminish the images of this party as extreme because that's what's 
turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the 
convention, the Republican convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling, 
his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin Powell, he will 
appeal to civility. On the platform, women find that extreme. It's 
turning them off." (The study did not incorporate evening news 
statements, like this one from Dan Rather to Jack Kemp on Monday's CBS 
Evening News: "Even some Republicans describe the current platform as 
quote, `harsh, extreme,' even `radical.' Do you see it that way?")
<P>
<DD>NBC's Tim Russert echoed Stahl the same night: "Key words: mean-spirited 
and extremist. They want to avoid those labels. They have thus far after 
two days and that's why you're not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime 
time tonight...I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is 
dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be interpreted by some 
people as mean."
<P>
<DD>Also on Tuesday came this explanation from CBS veteran Bob Schieffer: 
"The Dole campaign had a very delicate assignment as they see it. They 
want to get the word out to mainstream America that Senator Dole's 
thinking is more in line with that thinking, than perhaps even some of 
these very conservative delegates in this hall."
<P>
<DD>References to Republican moderates often came with a skeptical tone. On 
Tuesday night, CBS reporter Ed Bradley asked a Buchanan delegate: 
"There's been an effort to paint a moderate face to this convention. How 
does this sit with you?"
<P>
<a name="questions">
<B>Agenda Questions</B>
<P>
<DD>When network reporters and analysts weren't dwelling on media images or 
tactical gambits, their questions on the issues came more than seven 
times as often from the liberal agenda as they did from the conservative 
agenda: 51 questions were asked from the left, to just six from the 
right. ABC asked only three liberal agenda questions and no conservative 
ones in four nights. CBS came closest to balancing agenda questions 
(8-3), while NBC (10-1), CNN (10-1), and PBS (20-1) stuck almost 
completely to agenda questions from the left:
<P>
<DD>A number of the questions from the left poured skepticism on the Dole 
tax cut plan. NBC's Maria Shriver asked New Jersey Gov. Christie Todd 
Whitman on Tuesday: "Bill Clinton has said that Bob Dole's proposal for 
the economy would end up crippling the economy, balloon the deficit. Why 
is he wrong?" She added: "Governor, are you not all concerned about what 
happens to the federal deficit, which is a major, major concern for most 
of the delegates at this convention, based on the polling that we've 
done, if Bob Dole is able to put into effect his 15 percent tax cut?"
<P>
<DD>On Monday night, Tom Brokaw asked Gov. Pete Wilson: "But why should the 
children of illegal immigrants be penalized, as the language in the 
platform indicates they will be, especially those who become citizens if 
they're born here, even if they're born to illegal immigrants?"
<P>
<DD>On CNN, Bob Franken asked conservative evangelist Jerry Falwell Monday 
night about HIV-positive Republican activist Mary Fisher's speech: "Many 
of the AIDS activists would claim that part of the problem they have is 
the attitude toward AIDS victims among fundamentalists, among 
conservatives like yourself. How do you respond to that?" He added: "But 
you are aware that many in the gay community feel that it is hostility 
from people like your followers that contributes to the problems they 
have."
<P>
<DD>On Wednesday night, after paralyzed former police officer Steve McDonald 
addressed the delegates, Franken pointedly interviewed National Rifle 
Association chief Wayne LaPierre: "I'm going to ask you is here you have 
a policeman who was shot in the line of duty with weapons and...the 
criticism of your organization is that it's because of you those weapons 
are so readily available....Here we have a policeman who was shot by 
weapons that might not have been out there, the critics say, were it not 
for the NRA."
<P>
<DD>There were a few examples of conservative agenda questions, like Bob 
Schieffer's Tuesday question to Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison: "You 
talked a lot about Bill Clinton's broken promises. What promise do you 
think -- I know Republicans are trying to bring women into the big tent 
-- what promise has he made or broken, in your view, that has hurt women 
the most?"
<P>
<DD>That night, Dan Rather asked Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson: 
"Now the main speaker tonight, as was the case for the main speaker last 
night, is pro-choice. How mad does that make you?"
<P>
<a name="abortion">
<B>Controversy:  Abortion</B>
<P>
<DD>Peter Jennings suggested in the August 12 San Diego Union-Tribune: 
"Whenever a political party goes out of its way to restrain, isolate, or 
box in other voices -- and both parties do it -- then you almost 
invariably attract the attention of journalists." But Jennings and the 
rest of ABC, as well as CBS, in 1992 ignored the Democrats' decision to 
refuse Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey an opportunity to state his pro-life 
views from the Madison Square Garden convention podium. NBC interviewed 
Casey once. CNN also interviewed him once, and mentioned the controversy 
on four other occasions.
<P>
<DD>In San Diego, the networks drove home the controversy within the 
Republican Party over abortion: reporters, anchors, and analysts 
referred to the party's split over the issue -- including platform 
disagreements and Gov. Pete Wilson's "disinvitation" to speak -- on 55 
occasions. The emphasis on the abortion controversy was mostly contained 
to the first two nights -- 21 mentions on Monday night, 25 on Tuesday, 
and then only eight on Wednesday night and one on Thursday. CNN (with 18 
mentions) dwelled on the controversy the most, followed by PBS (13), CBS 
(12), ABC (8), and NBC (4).
<P>
<DD>On Monday night, NBC's Tom Brokaw stressed: "But so far the indication 
is that these people, who want to encourage a more tolerant, moderate 
attitude toward abortion have been denied the right to speak. Their 
Republican credentials are impeccable, and they're going everywhere and 
complaining that they're not going to be allowed in this hall." Minutes 
later, he added: "What you will not see at this podium -- the Governor 
of the host state, Pete Wilson. He's not going to be allowed to speak 
because he has some views on abortion that the Dole campaign would not 
rather have expressed here, and also William Weld, the Governor of 
Massachusetts."
<P>
<DD>On Tuesday, CNN's Bernard Shaw suggested: "Bob Dole did not get the 
tolerance lanugage he wanted in the abortion plank which came out of 
this platform committee earlier in the week. He didn't get a few other 
things. The conservatives have ironclad control over this convention, 
but he did get the opportunity to have some people who are pro-choice 
speak before this convention tonight, one of them Susan Molinari."
<P>
<DD>CBS reporter Lesley Stahl took on the controversy from the pro-life side 
of the fence on Wednesday before labeling it extreme: "We're hearing a 
lot of grousing about the repackaging of the party...In gagging 
opponents of abortion, affirmative action, those kinds of issues, Bob 
Dole may be turning off the very people he needs to leave the convention 
gung-ho. They say putting three pro-choice women on last night was too 
much. But Bob Dole has a dilemma: In order to win, he does have to 
change the perception of this party as too extreme."
<P>
<DD>(The study did not include evening news statements, like Peter Jennings' 
oration on the Tuesday World News Tonight: "The right to abortion has 
never been an overwhelming issue for women at election time. But this 
fight within the Republican Party has many Republican women questioning 
how far this party is willing to go to limit their rights.")
<P>
<DD>The convention week focus on abortion was only a small part of the 
network attention this year to the GOP abortion plank. Just during the 
Sunday morning interview shows on August 11, the networks asked 27 
questions about exclusion of pro-abortion Republicans. Eleven questions 
were posed on CNN's Late Edition, compared to nine on NBC's Meet the 
Press, four on ABC's This Week with David Brinkley, and three on CBS's 
Face the Nation.
<P>
<DD>From April 30, when four "moderate" governors declared they would 
challenge the party's pro-life plank, to August 9, ABC, CBS, and NBC 
preferred beating on the Republican side of the story by 60 to 1. The 
networks aired 30 full stories on the evening newscasts, compared to 
only one ABC story on the Democrats. The morning shows aired 30 full 
stories or interview segments on the GOP debate, to nothing about the 
Democrats. (That doesn't include five anchor briefs on the evening shows 
and 34 on the morning shows).
<P>
<DD>CNN's evening newscast The World Today aired seven full stories and ten 
anchor briefs on the GOP pro-life plank, to only one anchor brief on the 
Democrats. CNN's Inside Politics, a show favored by political junkies, 
aired 38 full stories or interview segments on the GOP to two segments 
on the Democrats. The Democrats held platform hearings on July 10 and 
11, and finished on August 5 -- with almost no media attention.

<H2>Ross Takes on the Boss </H2> 
ABC's Brian Ross filed stories during the GOP conclave on corporate  
money lavished on the GOP, but his August 15 World News Tonight report  
looked at a surpising target:

<blockquote>"Very much in the middle of the mix are the giant media corporations,  
like CNN, whose multi-million-dollar merger has yet to be formally  
approved by federal regulators. Time Warner gave more than $100,000 to  
be an official sponsor of the convention." Former Los Angeles Times  
reporter Dwight Morris told Ross media companies shouldn't use the  
conventions to lobby, and Ross noted: "But that didn't stop CBS lobby  
ists from giving the Republicans thousands of dollars to help pay for  
the cost of food and liquor in the skybox belonging to Republican Party  
Chairman Haley Barbour."</blockquote>

<DD>Ross even reported on his own bosses: "Last night, the ABC hospitality  
suite was a lobbyist's dream. With visits from Congressman Tom Bliley,  
the chairman of the House Commerce Committee, which handles  
telecommunications issues. And then from the number two man in the  
House, Majority Leader Dick Armey, who could be seen with top ABC  
executives, including the ABC lobbyist, who insisted he wasn't  
lobbying."

<DD>The Friday before the Democrats convened Ross reported "a labor union  
under federal investigation for its ties to the mafia"  contributed at  
least $250,000 to the party.

<DD> Just after rape victim Jan Licence addressed the Republican convention  
on victims' rights on August 13, NBC's Maria Shriver seemed baffled.  
During combined PBS/NBC coverage Shriver posed to her this question:  
"But why [speak out] at a Republican convention? So many people have  
said that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is  
supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"
<DD>Later, during NBC's prime time broadcast, Tom Brokaw interviewed Licence  
and asked: "Do you think -- this is a party that is dominated by men and  
this convention is dominated by men as well...Do you think before  
tonight they thought very much about what happens in America with rape?"
<P>
<H4>Gumbel Scoldings.</H4>
<P>
<DD>To keep "out what officials call the biased liberal media," the RNC  
launched GOP-TV to provide complete convention coverage, NBC's Bob Faw  
reported on the August 13 Today. Faw asserted: "What GOP-TV calls  
unfiltered, doesn't even begin to pay lip service to balance or  
fairness." NBC should know. 
<DD>Here's how Bryant Gumbel opened that morning's Today: "Good morning.  
Retired General Colin Powell, a new recruit to the GOP cause, addressed  
the delegates in San Diego last night, drawing cheers with accounts of  
why he became a Republican and why he'll vote for Bob Dole. But although  
his speech was generally well-received, the reception was restrained,  
and there were boos whenever Powell steered away from the right. Though  
they booed and also heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of  
inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We can expect  
more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996." 
<DD>Guess which network scares journalists? Faw reported that "Jonathan  
Alter of Newsweek thinks GOP-TV has started something deceptive and  
unwholesome." Alter explained: "It is political propaganda, masquerading  
as news, and that's a problem." Political propaganda masquerading as  
news? Sounds like Bryant Gumbel.
<P>
<H4>It's the Republican's Fault.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Calling conservatives "extremists" and lying about budget "cuts" have  
been Democratic mantra, but two networks blamed the GOP for getting  
nasty. NBC's Maria Shriver asked Dole California campaign chairman Ken  
Khachigian on August 14: "You said coming out of this campaign, Clinton  
is going to have 80 days of hell, that we are going to take Clinton down  
in California, that we are going to take him down hard. How ugly is this  
going to get?"
<DD>About 20 minutes after Bob Dole completed his acceptance speech, CNN  
anchor Bernard Shaw discovered the beginning of a nasty campaign: "I've  
maintained that this campaign is going to be one of the nastiest,  
bare-knuckled, direct-to-the-gut campaigns in America's political  
history. Listen to this one sentence, quote `It is demeaning to the  
nation that within the Clinton administration a core of the elite never  
grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and  
never learned, should have the power to fund with your earnings their  
dubious and self-serving schemes.'" 
<P>
<H4>Decrying Clinton Criticism.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Journalistic sensitivity to any attacks on Bill Clinton quickly came  
through loud and clear the morning after U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari and  
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchision spoke. "GOP Unleashes An Attack On Clinton  
Over Character and His Economic Policies," charged a New York Times  
headline. "Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack dog  
last night, using her keynote address to attack the President," Bryant  
Gumbel began the August 14 Today.
<DD>NBC's morning crew stuck to the Democratic line in their questions.  
Gumbel asked Tim Russert: "There's an old adage that says what you do  
speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking  
tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it or quite the  
contrary?" Katie Couric inquired of Republican strategist Charles Black:  
"Chris Dodd of the DNC says this is a huge con game. That the way you're  
portraying the party as this moderate inclusive party just doesn't gibe  
with say, the platform, and some of the attitudes of members of the GOP.  
How do you address that?" 
<DD>Over on Good Morning America, news anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted:  
"Some of the harshest words were from Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,  
who tried to paint the President as a tax and spend liberal." Co-host  
Charles Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not  
want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the  
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President  
Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits." ABC's Vargas  
didn't shy away from stereotyping: "But in addition to a gender gap,  
Republicans have had problems attracting minorities, a party that has  
traditionally been home to the angry white man."
<P>
<H4>Gutless Moderates? </H4>
<P>
<DD>If only the moderates were more aggressive then conservatives could be  
defeated, Newsweek Senior Editor Jonathan Alter wished in the August 19  
issue. He gave pro-abortion Republicans his recipe for political  
success. In a piece titled "The Passion Gap," he wrote: "Pro-choice  
Republicans insist it's their party, too. But the high-minded moderates  
are too polite to take on the hard-charging right. Until they do, the  
GOP may never truly win over the country."
<DD>The crux of his wisdom? Attack your loyal supporters:  
"This is now the fifth nominating convention in which the GOP has  
applied an anti-abortion litmus test. Ronald Reagan signed an  
abortion-rights law as Governor of California, then changed his position  
in time for his presidential campaigns. George Bush was such a supporter  
of family planning as a congressman that he was called `Rubbers,' but by  
the 1980s had flip-flopped. Bob Dole is pro-life but has gone back and  
forth so many times on platform language and planks that he has raised  
basic questions about his leadership. If he can't stand up to a Phyllis  
Schlafly, how would he handle a Saddam Hussein?"
<DD>Alter closed by holding up the Democratic Party, the same party that  
shut Governor Bob Casey out of its 1992 convention for his pro-life  
views, as an example of the big-tent the GOP should emulate: "The only  
real way to change the Republican Party is for...a pro-choice candidate  
to run for President in 2000....Sometime soon a compelling moderate  
Republican will take a leaf from the successes of centrist Democrats and  
enter a few primaries. Then we'll find out if the Republicans can  
finally pitch that big tent they like to talk about."
<P>
<H4>Republicans Scare Women.</H4>
<P>
 <DD>Supposed GOP intolerance and how Republican policies scare women  
dominated morning show interviews during the Republican gathering in San  
Diego. Talking to Susan Molinari, Christine Todd Whitman, and Kay Bailey  
Hutchison on August 13, Good Morning America's Charlie Gibson laid out  
why women are turned off by Republicans: "It was the Republican Party  
that did take the lead on ending federal welfare payments as they have  
been traditionally paid over the last 50 to 60 years and the prime  
beneficiaries of that are women. It is the Republican Party that took  
the lead on reducing the rate of growth in Medicare and Medicaid. It is  
the Republican Party now that is trying to make an issue of denying  
education and benefits to the children of illegal immigrants. It is the  
Republican Party that has rejected in the last week or so, tolerance  
language on abortion in the platform."
<DD>He also asked: "There was an attempt by some in the platform hearings to  
get language included in the platform that simply asked for toleration  
of dissenting views particularly on abortion. It was language that Bob  
Dole wanted in the platform. The party rejected him, it rejected your  
views, all three of you in this, is this a tolerant party, do you feel  
comfortable in it with its position on tolerance?"
<DD>Quizzing Colin Powell on Today, Katie Couric queried: "Does the party  
platform trouble you? Does the fact that some of these governors opted  
not to speak because they were told they could not discuss their views  
on abortion, do all those things make you basically doubt that this is a  
big tent here?"
<P>
<H4>Buchanan "Destroyed" Bush.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Four years later the media still promote the idea that Pat Buchanan's  
1992 speech, not reneging on his "no new taxes" pledge, led to George  
Bush's defeat. Andrea Mitchell stated on MSNBC August 12 after Colin  
Powell spoke: "There's a real interesting contrast here because Pat  
Buchanan set the tone for the Houston convention four years ago with the  
same prime time starring role on the first night of the convention and  
that of course was the speech that many people feel destroyed George  
Bush's chance of winning re-election because it set a very narrow,  
exclusive and mean-spirited tone and tonight we had the contrast of  
Colin Powell." 
<DD>Earlier in the day on ABC's Good Morning America, co-host Charles Gibson  
couldn't let the issue die: "It is this convention that is going to be  
harmonious. The Republicans are determined that there will be no repeat  
of Houston 1992, which many saw as a harsh and divisive convention."  
While never mentioning that raising taxes could have cost Bush the  
election, ABC's John Cochran opined on World News Tonight: "The one  
thing that Bush did not have to tell Dole is that at all cost Dole  
should try to prevent a re-run of that bitter divisive convention four  
years ago in Houston, that so badly damaged Bush's chances for  
re-election. Dole knows that only too well."
<P>
<H4>Delegates Out of Touch.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Early in the first day of PBS/NBC coverage, millionaire Tom Brokaw  
asked: "The big question, of course, what is the Republican Party these  
days?...Well on the floor of this convention hall, they are  
overwhelmingly white and male, male by a factor of about two to  
one...The largest single income group, more than 38 percent of the  
people here earn more than $100,000 a year." On the CBS Evening News  
that night Ed Bradley asserted: "For the most part they are white, male,  
and they are older than the average American. They are also more  
conservative than the average American. They are also wealthier - about  
a third of the delegates earn more than $100,000 a year." 
<DD>Millionaire anchor Dan Rather announced in prime time: "Delegates in  
this convention have been selected, inspected, detected, categorized by  
the press, the pols, the pros, and the pollsters. We know they're mostly  
male, overwhelmingly white, mostly well to the right politically, and  
almost one in five of these delegates is a millionaire."
<DD>CNN's Judy Woodruff raised the media-created issue with keynote speaker  
Susan Molinari: "We look at the statistics of how many women delegates.  
What? 43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of the delegates are women  
this year. What sort of signal does that send to the country, you  
think?"
<DD>Woodruff also complained: "We talked to Jack Kemp a little while ago and  
asked him about, among other things, the fact that not only not just the  
language in the platform - only three percent of these delegates are  
African American. Only 36 percent of these delegates are women. This is  
not a convention that is necessarily representative even of the broader  
Republican Party, the people who vote Republican, much less the  
electorate overall."
<DD>A Washington Post survey of delegates determined that while 56 percent  
of Republicans reported an income of over $75,000, so did 46 percent of  
Democrats.

<h2>Reaganomics, the Scary Sequel?</h2>
<P>
<H4>Skepticism Showered on Dole Tax Cut Absent for Clinton's 1993 Proposals</H4>
<P>
<DD>Bob Dole's surprising advocacy of an across-the-board tax cut drew quick 
criticism from reporters as the unwelcome return of deficit-ballooning 
Reaganomics.
<P>
<DD>Hours after Dole's tax cut announcement on August 5, NBC Nightly News 
reporter David Bloom declared: "Most economists say the  Reagan tax cuts 
did worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan." 
NBC's Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" minutes later: "They 
say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as they did during 
the Reagan years."
<P>
<DD>CBS Evening News reporter Linda Douglass warned  Dole weeks before on 
July 23: "Each of the proposals he's considering would cost hundreds of 
billions of dollars. Dole will have to convince voters that won't drive 
up the deficit."
<P>
<DD>Newsweek's Joe Klein pronounced: "The Dole tax cut stands, to all but 
hard-core taxophobes, as a transparent and rather pathetic bit of 
politics. He wants to cut $548 billion over six years? And balance the 
budget? Does anyone actually believe this?"
<P>
<DD>The August 12 Investor's Business Daily noted the real Reagan record: 
that Clinton's own Economic Report of the President showed "receipts 
from individual income taxes rose to $446 billion in fiscal `89, 
Reagan's last budget, from $286 billion in fiscal `81, the year Reagan 
began to slash personal rates. That's a 56 percent gain...Spending rose 
to $1.143 trillion in `89 from $678 billion in `81. That's a 69 percent 
gain."
<P>
<DD>Skepticism of Reaganomics stood in stark contrast to the media's 
salesmanlike reaction to Clinton economic proposals in 1992 and 1993. On 
the September 15, 1993 Sunday Morning, CBS's Douglass simply passed on 
the notion that Clinton could insure 37 million uninsured Americans with 
a cigarette tax: "They have a very elaborate plan to pay for this 
revolution in health care. It doesn't provide much in the way of taxes, 
just a sin tax, cigarette tax. They claim the money's going to come from 
savings in spending."
<P>
<DD>After years of stopping deficit-busting stimulus packages and 
nationalized health plans, Newsweek's Howard Fineman awarded the credit 
for the deficit not to Dole, but to his rival: "Clinton, meanwhile, can 
brag that the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and 
that he's a champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be 
Bob Dole."
<P>
<DD>The next week, Time contributor George J. Church echoed Fineman: "A case 
could be made that the candidate who best represents the fiscally 
conservative, moderate Republican tradition is, believe it or not, Bill 
Clinton."

<h2>Network "Fear" and "Anxiety"</h2>
<P>
<H4>Don't Touch Welfare!</H4>
<P>
<DD>Conservatives view welfare reform as a victory -- both for those trapped 
in the system and for taxpayers tired of paying for lifetime recipients. 
But after President Clinton agreed to sign the bill, the networks came 
at it from the left, focusing on those who supposedly would be hurt, 
thus helping Clinton put himself in the middle of the political 
spectrum.
<P>
<DD>NBC's Lisa Myers began a July 31 Nightly News segment: "For six years 
now Cindy McDonald and her three children have struggled to make their 
$400 welfare check and $300 in food stamps last until the end of the 
month. She says she can never treat her kids to candy or soda, they're 
expensive luxuries and has no car to take them anywhere. The phrase 
`welfare reform' infuriates her." She whined: "If they strip me from 
what little I have right now, then I don't know how my kids are going to 
eat." Myers did point out that McDonald actually has two years to find a 
job, but concluded: "Exactly how McDonald and others will cope with the 
change is uncertain. Even supporters of the bill privately admit that 
this is a gamble, that some will lose.''
<P>
<DD>On the CBS Evening News, substitute anchor Paula Zahn announced: "Once 
the welfare bill becomes law, millions of Americans will find their 
lives starting to change in startling and unwelcome ways." Reporter  
John Blackstone looked at three recipients. First up, a woman who just 
had a baby: "[Martina] Gillis, a single mother of two, has been on 
welfare for three years. The new welfare reforms would force her to get 
a job, any job, but that would mean giving up, or at least postponing 
her dream, of graduating from college." Blackstone did ask her if it's 
the taxpayers' responsibility to pay for her mistake and then moved to a 
Mexican immigrant who cried about being cut off.
<P>
<DD>Third, leading into his conclusion, he put on a woman who "says she 
applied for welfare today so she can take care of her two daughters. 
Welfare reform may be aimed at the mothers. But the effects of this 
experiment, good or bad, will be felt equally by the children."
<P>
<DD>On the next day's CBS Evening News, Zahn warned: "The new, landmark 
welfare overhaul President Clinton promised to sign won't be law for a 
while yet, but there is already is a great deal of fear and anxiety all 
over the country over the impact it will have."

<H2>Backhanded Bias</H2>
<H3>Kemp Choice Spurs Talk of "Haters"  </H3>

<DD>Bob Dole's choice of Jack Kemp as a running mate drew praise from a  
number of reporters and analysts, but sometimes that praise accompanied  
backhanded insults about the "haters" that comprise the rest of the  
Republican Party.

<DD>CNN polling analyst Bill Schneider touted the choice on the August 9  
Inside Politics, praising Kemp as he impugned other conservatives: "He  
is a rare combination -- a nice conservative. These days conservatives  
are supposed to be mean. They're supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked  
a minute ago about the frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp  
is buoyant, he's effusive, he's inclusive of everybody in the country,  
not just in the Republican Party. He puts a different face on that  
ticket."

<DD>On the August 9 World News Tonight, ABC's Cokie Roberts also played  
backhand with Kemp: "He's very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive,  
reaching out to minorities, to women, being for immigration, for  
affirmative action. And I think that's very important for this  
particular convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen somewhat  
dour, and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with a big smile on  
his face saying `you all come,' and `I'm going to cut your taxes' while  
you're at it, is not a bad thing for the Republicans."

<DD>During live coverage August 10 of Kemp's vice presidential announcement  
in Russell, Kansas, CNN anchor A0Judy Woodruff declared: "On welfare, up  
through the last few years, he's advocated more moderate policies than  
those that were passed this month by the Republican-controlled Congress.  
Jack Kemp does not like the idea of taking money -- yanking money away  
from welfare mothers with small children."

<DD>Hours later on CNN's Capital Gang, Woodruff's husband, Al Hunt,  
Executive Washington Editor of The Wall Street Journal, disparaged the  
platform while praising the Kemp pick: "Jack Kemp is gonna not only  
excite this convention, but he cuts across regional, racial and  
generational lines, across all of America, and I think that he and his  
incredibly attractive family are going to add lustre and intellectual  
firepower. Now there are some risks. He has a few flaky views, the gold  
standard for one, and more important, Jack Kemp is a can-do optimist who  
cares about all people and that s going to put him at odds with a  
platform that is protectionist, mean-spirited, anti-immigration,  
insensitive to racial minorities."   

<DD>On that day's Inside Politics, Bill Schneider proceeded to repeat the  
previous day's slur: "Kemp also has a rare combination of qualities. He  
s a nice conservative. There haven't been too many of those since Ronald  
Reagan. Most conservatives these days come across as mean [video of Newt  
Gingrich] or intolerant [video of Pat Buchanan] or grouchy [video of Bob  
Dole]. Kemp is tolerant and inclusive. He has an excellent relationship  
with minorities. He showed real courage two years ago when he came out  
against Proposition 187, the punitive anti-illegal immigration measure  
in California. Kemp is not a hater."

<h2>News Bites</h2>
<CENTER><h3>From the September 1996 Media Watch</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Poll: Most Say Media Favor Clinton.  </H4>
A September survey for the Pew Research Center for the People and the  
Press found that while most of the public thinks coverage of Clinton and  
Dole has been fair, when asked "Who do you think most newspaper  
reporters and TV journalists want to see win the presidential election,"  
59 percent said Clinton, 17 percent Dole and just one percent Perot.
<p>
As to how much influence news organizations have on which candidate  
becomes President, 64 percent thought "too much," 30 percent said "about  
right" and a mere four percent believed "too little."
<p>
<H4>
Nasty Bob, Pure Bill </H4>  

On September 12, Bob Dole demanded that Bill Clinton release his medical  
records and complained that Clinton's ads were overwhelmingly negative.  
Instead of examining the tone of Clinton ads, ABC and CBS portrayed Dole  
as the villain.  
<p>
On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings said: "The campaign for  
President took a nasty turn today. First, Bob Dole departed from his  
standard stump speech in Kentucky, lashing out at the Democrats for what  
he says they are saying about him, and negative advertising was the  
kindest thing Mr. Dole had to say." After a piece on Dole, Jennings  
introduced the next story: "The President is going to come under further  
Republican attack with the release next week of the House Committee on  
Government Operations and Oversight's report on the firings at the White  
House travel office."
<p>
On the CBS Evening News Dan Rather followed the same Clinton-as-victim  
theme: "Now for his part, Bob Dole reopened one of his favorite lines of  
attack today about President Clinton's health records." Reporter Phil  
Jones provided a very short piece just on the medical records,  
concluding: "Dan, this campaign is headed exactly where everybody  
expected it to go: personal."
<p>

<H4>Bloom and Doom  </H4>

Only NBC Nightly News bothered to show viewers that night what upset  
Dole. Tom Brokaw declared: "Bob Dole on the ropes and looking for a way  
to boost his sagging campaign made it clear today he is taking off the  
gloves in the war of the political airwaves."
<p>
Reporter David Bloom began: "Stung by a barrage of negative television  
advertising, Bob Dole today accused Bill Clinton of running a campaign  
of fear, of engaging in character assassination." Bloom aired Clinton  
declaring "This must be a campaign of ideas, not a campaign of insults,"  
and then added: "But since then, the Dole camp claims the Democrats have  
run only 42 positive ads with 4, 0 negative ads running across the  
country."  
<p>
Bloom explained: "Dole aides say the campaign will double its ad budget  
next week, unveiling new attack ads blaming Clinton for rising teen drug  
use, ads even tougher than this one." After an ad clip, Bloom ended: "At  
a Dole rally today the music blared `get ready.' Get ready, that is, for  
a very nasty campaign."    
<p>

<H4>What "Moderate" Democrats?</H4>

 "Return to Chicago: This Time, the Democrats Embrace Moderation,"  
declared the headline on the front of the Washington Post's August 25  
convention section. Four pages later, the Post headline over a story on  
a survey of delegates read: "Delegates Leaning More Liberal Than Their  
Leader or the Rank and File." Indeed, 82 percent favored affirmative  
action, 65 percent were against a balanced budget amendment, 72 percent  
opposed "reducing spending on social programs," but 65 percent wanted  
less defense spending.
<P>
Three days later, New York Times reporter David Rosebaum insisted the  
Democratic platform "takes a middle ground between the unfettered  
capitalism and government-enforced morality espoused by Republicans and  
the welfare-state economics and Aquarian values that once formed  
Democrats' image." Four paragraphs later, Rosenbaum summarized the  
"middle ground" policies: "The Democrats call for government-paid  
abortions for poor women, full civil rights for homosexuals, a strong  
commitment to public schools, gun control, tobacco regulations, a  
continuation of affirmative action programs and a greater emphasis on  
environmental protection than on the development of resources."
<P>

<H4>"Most Economists" Split.</H4>

An August survey of 700 economists found that "52 percent blame the  
growth of the federal deficit in the 1980s on increased government  
spending more than on the Reagan tax cut," which was blamed by 48  
percent. The fact that economists are about evenly split contradicts  
many recent media reports.
<p>
"Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit  
and many are skeptical of Dole's plan," announced reporter David Bloom  
on the August 5 NBC Nightly News. Colleague Mike Jensen insisted a few  
minutes later that "most analysts say it's not good economics." The next  
morning a headline over a Washington Post news story declared:  
"Economists Question Dole's Plan." The headline over a Boston Globe news  
story asserted: "Economists Cool to Dole's Tax-Cut Plan: Candidate  
Speaks of Growth, but Analysts See No Big Payoff."   
<p>
The poll of 700 members of the American Economics Association discovered  
that 81 percent agreed that the Reagan tax cuts increased economic  
growth. A plurality of 42 percent "want to see the next Congress put a  
high priority on both restraining government spending and cutting  
taxes," matching the Dole-Kemp promise. William Adams, a professor at  
George Washington University, directed the poll conducted August 19-21.  
<p>
Though reported in The Weekly Standard and The Washington Times, none of  
the previously noted outlets revised their claims. In fact, in the  
September 9 Post, reporter Clay Chandler focused only on the answer  
which put Dole in the minority: "A majority expressed doubt about the  
notion that 30 percent of the revenue lost from a 15 percent cut in  
marginal income tax rates would" be recaptured.
<p>

<H4>Another Gore Gaffe That Wasn't.</H4>

After Al Gore's emotional August 28 speech recalled the 1984 death of  
his sister Nancy and how it motivated him to fight the tobacco industry,  
ABC, NBC, and CNN did suggest hypocrisy. Jennings noted that "tobacco  
companies are here in Chicago wining and dining the hierarchy of the  
Democratic Party." NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled that "the Gore family were  
tobacco farmers." On CNN, Judy Woodruff suggested that Gore "was  
responding to what was said in San Diego," where his tobacco roots were  
highlighted.
<p>
But all the networks ignored the July 3 New York Times report that in  
1988, Al Gore told an audience of tobacco farmers during his  
presidential campaign: "Throughout most of my life, I raised tobacco. I  
want you to know that with my own hands, all of my life, I put it in the  
plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed it. I've dug in it. I've  
sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the  
barn and stripped it and A0sold it." Dan Quayle can only dream of  
getting away with something like that. 
<P>

<H4>Base Bias.</H4>

CBS Evening News took two different approaches to the passionate poles  
that create each party's base. The day before the Republican convention,  
CBS reporter John Roberts suggested "hard-line anti-abortionists"  
controlled the Republican Party: "Delegates are pursuing their own  
agendas and forcing party leaders, including Dole, to fall into line  
behind them...so far the rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots."  
<p>
But on August 28, reporter Harry Smith's piece on unions didn't talk  
about ideologically extreme unions pushing around the party, but how  
Bill Clinton failed to be liberal enough for them: "It still takes steel  
to make America's cars. It still takes labor to get a Democrat elected  
President. But talk to the union rank and file, and you'll find that  
their enthusiasm is less than red hot.... We talked with United Auto  
Workers in Dearborn, Michigan this week. Their biggest gripe: Bill  
Clinton's support of the North American Free Trade Agreement...Organized  
labor will invest millions of dollars to get Bill Clinton elected this  
fall. These dues-paying members wonder if they are still getting their  
money's worth."  
<P>

<H4>Sunday Lefties.  </H4>

The networks came at Republicans from the left on abortion in San Diego,  
and on the Sunday before the Democrats convened, they also came at  
Democrats from the left. By concentrating on liberal complaints about  
welfare reform, reporters helped Bill Clinton's effort to portray  
himself as a centrist. On the August  
<P>
CBS Evening News, Dan Rather demanded of DNC General Chairman Chris  
Dodd: "You said this morning that the party's message will focus on the  
needs and cares of the people. Now, how do you reconcile that with a  
President who has just signed a quote `welfare reform bill' which by  
general agreement is going to put a lot of poor children on the street?"  
Earlier, on Face the Nation, CBS reporter Rita Braver asked Chicago  
Mayor Richard Daley: "Aren't you scared about what is going to happen?  
Aren't you afraid you are going to have a lot of hungry children?"  
<P>
That same day NBC Meet the Press moderator Tim Russert demanded of Dodd:  
"It's an issue of morality to many people, and how can you defend a  
President who basically said to the congressional Democrats: Listen,  
that's your view, but I'm doing this, because -- was it politically  
expedient?" Russert tried the same line with strategist James Carville:  
"But the Democratic Party for sixty years, James Carville, fought for a  
minimum guarantee payment to poor children and Bill Clinton undid that.  
Don't you have to draw the line someplace and say `I'm a Democrat and  
this is what I stand for'?"

<P>
<H4>Welfare-State Television</H4>

All three networks featured stories August 27 critical of the new  
welfare reform law. On NBC Nightly News, Tom Brokaw presented his view:  
"There are serious questions about what happens to these people after  
they're taken off the welfare rolls. Andrea Mitchell went to Indiana to  
look at the conflict between fixing the system and doing the right thing  
by people." Mitchell featured no welfare reform proponents, just social  
workers, Jesse Jackson, and impending victims: "Kimberly Gilbert will  
get benefits for two years. After that, she's cut off, whether or not  
she finds a job. That deadline is near for Charla Milton. Unable to find  
work, she is terrified."
<P>
On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings suggested: "Maybe if he is  
reelected, Mr. Clinton will do something to reverse himself on welfare  
reform. Many of these delegates hope so." ABC reporter Erin Hayes asked  
where the jobs would come from to support welfare recipients: "An Urban  
League study found in Chicago there are six times as many people who  
need work as there are entry-level jobs available." Hayes aired no  
voices favoring welfare reform, and concluded: "There is another concern  
as well: the young children. When their mothers are made to go to work,  
who will take care of them? Right now, no one really has an answer. With  
so much still uncertain about welfare reform, it is no wonder there is  
fear out there."
<P>
CBS reporter Harry Smith also ignored taxpayers and focused on victims  
on the CBS Evening News: "We talked to four welfare moms from across  
Chicago. They feel like they are this year's political  
target...President Clinton seemed deaf to protests last week when he  
signed the new welfare cuts into law. Cuts many Americans support, but  
cuts these women think go too far." Smith concluded: "Neighborhoods like  
Cabrini-Green have more than their share of misery. Folks around here  
think misery is only going to grow. Their long faith in the Democratic  
Party has been shaken, and the actions of President Clinton confirm  
their fear that the poor just do not count."

<H4>Democratic Harshness</H4>
<DD>Democrats blame the GOP for harsh personal attacks, but on the August 26  
Good Morning America co-host Charlie Gibson asked Senator Christopher  
Dodd: "You said the other day that `I got the word out,' that I don't  
want to hear personal attacks against the Republicans at this  
convention. Yesterday on his train trip the President accused  
Republicans of blackmail to get their budget. Al Gore, yesterday,  
accused the Republicans of ignorance and audacity, talked about the  
two-headed monster of Dole and Gingrich. Dick Gephardt, the leader of  
the House, of the Democrats, talked about Republican extremism, said  
they're radicals. Talk about getting the word out?"
<P>
<H4>Labor's Power Ties</H4>

<DD>The labor unions didn't get the Darth Vader treatment reserved in San  
Diego for the Christian Coalition, but in Chicago there were a few  
critical looks at union power.

<DD>CNN campaign finance reporter Brooks Jackson delivered a story on the  
unions' political campaign in which he observed: "So Bill Clinton says  
the era of big government is over? Not at the Democratic convention,  
where unionized government workers are suiting up for battle against  
Republicans."
<DD>On World News Tonight August 27, ABC's Brian Ross reported: "In the  
world of big money and Democratic politics on public display this week  
in Chicago, this man holds a special place. His name is Arthur Coia, who  
despite being president of a labor union the FBI says has long been  
controlled by the Mafia, the Laborers International has become one of  
the Democrats' top money people, raising millions and gaining him  
special access to the Clinton White House....In the last two years, the  
Clinton administration has gone all-out to court Coia and his union  
money with invitations to the White House and an appearance by the First  
Lady at a big union conference."
<DD>Ross added detail: "In an abrupt change of plans that raised questions  
about whether the union's money to the Democrats had bought it some kind  
of sweetheart deal, prosecutors dropped the allegations and instead  
quietly negotiated a deal with Coia that let him keep his job and put  
him in charge of cleaning up the union."

<h2>The Spin: Both Parties Too Conservative</h2>
<P>
<H4>TV Analysts Label Democrats Twice As Often, But Fire Mostly Liberal Questions in Chicago</H4>
<P>
<DD>The networks had big news from the Democratic convention in Chicago: 
liberals exist in the Democratic Party, and they didn't like President 
Clinton's decision to sign a welfare reform bill. From both the 
Republican and Democratic conventions, the networks relayed the same 
message: the parties had become too conservative.
<P>
<DD>During the Chicago convention:
<UL>
<LI><a href="#label">(1)</a> Democratic delegates, speakers, and candidates were labeled twice as often as the Republicans were in San Diego, although they were labeled as extreme only one-fourth as often; 
<LI><a href="#questions">(2)</a> Reporters and anchors posed almost five times as many questions from the left as from the right, a much more liberal questioning agenda than the Democratic convention four years ago; and 
<LI><a href="#welfare">(3)</a> the controversy over welfare reform dominated the convention story line, while the Democrats' abortion-on-demand stance and exclusion of some pro-life speakers garnered no network mentions in prime time.
</UL>
<DD>As during the Republican convention, MediaWatch analysts watched live 
prime-time coverage of the Democratic convention for a special daily 
Media Reality Check '96 newsletter. Analysts watched all ABC, CBS, and 
NBC prime time coverage, as well as the combined PBS/NBC broadcast and 
CNN starting at 8 pm Eastern time.
<P>
<a name="label">
<B>Labeling</B>
<P>
<DD>Previous convention studies in 1984, 1988, and 1992 found the 
Republicans were tagged as conservative or very conservative far more 
often than the Democrats were called liberal or very liberal, with 
reporters instead playing up the moderate nature of Democratic 
candidates and delegates. In 1992, Republicans drew 131 labels, 118 (90 
percent) of them conservative; the Democrats had 89 labels, 51 (57 
percent) of them moderate or conservative.
<P>
<DD>In 1996, the Republicans were labeled only 59 times, 46 of them (78 
percent) conservative; while the Democrats were labeled twice as often, 
on 119 occasions, and 75 of those tags (63 percent) were liberal, to 
only 44 moderate or conservative labels. The Republicans were still four 
times as likely to be described as extreme as the Democrats -- 16 to 4 
-- but the Democrats were never described as extremely liberal in 1992.
<P>
<DD>ABC (with three moderate/conservative labels and 15 liberal tags) was 
the network most willing to underline the liberal nature of the party 
gathered in Chicago, while CBS (8 moderate/conservative, 10 liberal) CNN 
(13-20), NBC-PBS (15-24), and NBC (5-6) held to a more traditional 
percentage of moderate labeling. Labeling decreased nightly -- from 40 
on Monday, to 35 on Tuesday, to 13 on Wednesday -- and then jumped back 
up to 31 on Thursday, when the departure of Dick Morris spurred 
speculation about Clinton's post-Morris ideological positioning.
<P>
<DD>In 1992, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and the Democratic platform were never 
described as liberal. In 1996, Clinton was described as moderate on 28 
occasions and liberal on 16 occasions, but almost always as a tactical 
function of "moving to the left" or "moving to the right." In San Diego, 
the Republican platform was described as conservative on six occasions; 
in Chicago, the platform was described as moderate on six occasions. 
<P>
<I>Some examples of labeling:</I>
<P>
<DD>As the Republican convention began on August 12, PBS anchor Charlayne 
Hunter-Gault told former Sen. Howard Baker: "Pat Buchanan said most of 
his views, most of Senator Dole's views, were consistent with his own, 
and he cited specifically, affirmative action, and the platform position 
of illegal immigration. And as you know, Pat Buchanan is on the farthest 
extreme of the right wing of the party."
<P>
<DD>CNN reporter Gene Randall declared on August 13: "With me is Phyllis 
Schlafly, an ardent anti-abortion rights advocate...Do you think the 
speakers do not reflect the conservatism of the platform?"
<P>
<DD>CNN's Bob Franken explained the next night: "It's interesting they just 
had a minute ago a very brief tribute to the Republican freshmen in the 
House of Representatives. Why brief? Because they are highly, highly 
controversial. It's the freshmen in the House of Representatives that 
really gave Bill Clinton the extremist issue, fairly or unfairly."
<P>
<DD>In Chicago on August 26, ABC's Sam Donaldson explained the Democrats 
"want to accomplish the same thing the Republicans accomplished -- 
showing a unified party, even though we know from our survey that these 
delegates are far to the left of the mainstream just as the Republican 
delegates were to the right of the mainstream."
<P>
<DD>That night on CBS, Dan Rather asked Jesse Jackson: "Bill Clinton's been 
running pretty hard to the right, so far that some Democrats now call 
him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?"
<P>
<DD>Tom Brokaw put Clinton and Gore in Newt Gingrich territory: "Since 1994 
they have slid across the political spectrum to really right of center. 
And they've got a guy by the name of Dick Morris who's advising them on 
a daily basis how to be more pragmatic."
<P>
<DD>Three nights later, Brokaw exemplified post-Morris speculation in asking 
James Carville: "He was the man who moved him to the right. I know that 
you had some philosophical differences with Dick Morris. Does this mean 
that the door has been opened again for those of you who believe that 
the President probably ought to move a little more left of center?"
<P>
<a name="questions">
<B>Agenda Questions</B>
<P>
<DD>The bottom dropped out on agenda questions from the right in 1996. In 
1992, Republicans were asked 130 questions from the left, while 
Democrats were asked only 38 from the right. Actually, Democrats were 
asked more questions from the left (45) than the right (38).
<P>
<DD>In 1996, network reporters asked Republicans 51 questions from the left, 
and only six from the right. Thanks to welfare reform, the pattern in 
Chicago was almost exactly the same: 47 questions from the left, 11 from 
the right.
<P>
<DD>In Chicago, ABC asked only two liberal questions and one conservative 
question, followed by NBC with just three liberal questions and one 
conservative.
<P>
<DD>CBS (12 liberal, zero conservative), CNN (13-2), and NBC-PBS (17-7) 
clearly preferred a menu of questions from the left. Combine both 
conventions, and the questioning numbers are more stark: ABC (five 
liberal, one conservative), CBS (20-3), CNN (23-3), NBC-PBS (37-8), and 
NBC (13-2). Some examples of agenda questions: 
<UL>
<LI><I>From the right to Republicans:</I> CNN's Gene Randall asked New York Gov. George Pataki on August 13: "The focus tonight of course is on the keynote speech and that is by Representative [Susan] Molinari, who it's well known favors abortion rights. Do you sense a dissatisfaction on this floor that she will be giving this address?"
<LI><I>From the left to Republicans:</I> CNN's Judy Woodruff inquired of Rep. Susan Molinari on August 12: "Leading up to the convention, Bob Dole was running well behind President Clinton with women voters. We look at the statistics of how many women delegates. What, 43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of delegates are women this year. What sort of signal does that send the country, you think?"
<LI><I>From the right to Democrats:</I> NBC's David Bloom asked James Carville after Hillary Clinton's speech August 27: "I was struck by the fact that she talked about health care and the need for more health care insurance for the unemployed. That's a topic that got her and Bill Clinton into a lot of trouble two years ago. Why would she revisit that tonight?"
<LI><I>From the left to Democrats:</I> ABC's Michel McQueen asked former DNC official Lynn Cutler on August 26: "She is comparing her candidate not to perfection, but to Bob Dole. Isn't that right, Lynn -- do the liberals in the party, as you unashamedly describe yourself, feel abandoned by the President this year?"
</UL>
<a name="welfare">
<B>Controversy: Welfare</B>
<P>
<DD>The controversy over welfare reform surfaced in prime time on 44 
occasions (questions plus comments by reporters), forming the most 
common basis for liberal analysis. As in agenda questions, ABC (4) and 
NBC (2) did not dwell very much on the welfare controversy, and NBC-PBS 
raised it 10 times in a longer time frame. CNN (16) and CBS (9) were 
most interested in the story.
<P>
<DD>Tom Brokaw provided the only example found of coming at the issue from 
the right, even if it sounded like he wished some lesser welfare reform 
had passed before the GOP takeover of Congress. He asked HHS Secretary 
Donna Shalala: "I guess the question a lot of us have is why didn't you 
come up with something of your own two years ago when you had power in 
the Congress, before Newt Gingrich and the Republicans took over, when 
you knew that Repub -- welfare reform was a high-priority issue for this 
country and the President was talking about it when he was running in 
1992?"
<P>
<DD>Brokaw also asked a more typical network question: "If you were a poor 
single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many resources, 
and you wanted to go to work, you want to do the right things, but there 
aren't too many jobs for people who have real skills. Wouldn't you be 
slightly terrified looking into the next two years?"
<P>
<DD>CBS reporter Ed Bradley questioned far-left Rep. Ron Dellums on August 
29: "Congressman Dellums was unhappy when the President signed the 
welfare bill. I know you saw it not as welfare reform but more as a 
budget cut. What does he have to do to fix it?" Bradley followed up: 
"When the President is expected to say tonight that he's going to 
propose a $3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is that 
enough?"
<P>
<DD>Judy Woodruff pleaded with Hillary Clinton to intervene with her husband 
in six questions of an August 27 interview: "We were just reminded in 
that moving film that we saw here of your lifelong work as an advocate 
for children's causes. And yet, late last week, your husband signed a 
welfare reform bill that as you know, Senator Patrick Moynihan and other 
welfare experts are saying is going to throw a million children into 
poverty. Does that legislation undo so much of what you've worked for 
over the years?"

<h2>60 Minutes Does a 180 on Dole</h2>
<P>
<H4>Rather Asks Clinton If GOP's Extreme, Stahl Raps Dole for Criticizing Hillary</H4>
<P>
<DD>Labor Day weekend marks the start of the campaign season, and this year 
the 60 Minutes interviews with the two presidential candidates 
demonstrated how it also corresponds with another season of tilted 
coverage. 
<P>
<DD>In his August 18 interview with Bill Clinton, Dan Rather wasn't as 
interested in posing questions as setting up speeches: "Some of your 
staff members, not by name, have been saying, `Yes, the President thinks 
Bob Dole is a nice person and has been a pretty good leader in some 
ways,' but, say they, `he's been captured by the extremists in the 
Republican Party, the radical part of the Republican Party, including 
Newt Gingrich.' Is that what you think?"
<P>
<DD>Rather then led Clinton through a set of GOP convention speeches. He 
showed Dole charging Clinton led "a core of elites who never grew up, 
did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned." 
He played video of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison mentioning the FBI files, 
and George Bush on the White House being "diminished" since his wife 
left.
<P>
<DD>When Clinton's response wasn't strong enough, Rather added: "I don't 
know of anyone in the convention who didn't take that as a difference of 
the present First Lady and the former First Lady." Rather insisted: 
"Don't you get mad, Mr. President, when this sort of thing happens?"
<P>
<DD>Two weeks later Lesley Stahl interviewed Bob Dole. But in her September 
1 talk she gave Dole less time to react to attacks. Stahl didn't suggest 
Clinton is too far to the left and when Dole complained about unfair 
attacks, she made him defend his criticisms. Rather never argued with 
Clinton, but Stahl debated the advisability of Dole's tax cut plan.
<P>
<DD>Stahl began by underlining the Democrats' decency: "At the Democratic 
convention, a lot of Democrats were saying that Bob Dole is a good and 
decent man, and even Bill Clinton made a point of saying Bob Dole loves 
his country. I'm wondering what you think of Bill Clinton. What kind of 
a man do you think he is?"
<P>
<DD>When Dole complained about Democratic attacks, Stahl aired a convention 
clip of Al Gore saying Dole voted against creating Medicare and 
Medicaid, Peace Corps and Head Start. She assumed such votes would have 
been wrong: "Did you really vote against all these things?" Then she 
turned on Dole, asking: "They say that you were unfair in what you said 
about Hillary....Do you think you were unfair in what you said to her?"
<P>
<DD>Stahl made Dole respond to 11 inquiries doubting the tax cut. She 
demanded he explain how he's going to pay for it, contending that in 
the '80s he was correct to oppose Reaganomics: "You were right, it did 
explode the deficit."

<h2>Poor Hillary, Is It Worth It?</h2>
<P>
<H4>Media Disdain GOP's "Bitter Attacks"</H4>
<P>
<DD>During the week of the Democratic convention the three networks got a 
chance to interview First Lady Hillary Clinton, but their favorite topic 
was the First Lady's role as the beleaguered martyr of unfortunate 
Republican attacks.
<P>
<DD>On Monday, CNN's Judy Woodruff went first: "Let me take you back to San 
Diego. Bob Dole said it doesn't take a village, a collective, the state, 
which he said has made mistakes in raising children, it takes a family. 
Is this something that is going to become a major issue in this fall 
campaign?"
<P>
<DD>Woodruff inquired: "Also in San Diego, former President George Bush told 
the delegates he `worked hard,' I'm quoting here, `to uphold the dignity 
and the honor of the presidency, to treat it with respect. And then he 
added, quote, `it breaks his heart, when the White House is demeaned, 
the presidency diminished.' Does that hurt coming from your immediate 
predecessor?"
<P>
<DD>Woodruff kept going: "He then went on, Mrs. Clinton, he made a point of 
saying that his wife, Mrs. Bush, quote, `unquestionably upheld the honor 
of the White House.' Is that an insult to you?" When Mrs. Clinton failed 
to answer sharply enough, Woodruff insisted: "But he was clearly drawing 
a contrast there...you're not hurt?"
<P>
<DD>Stories of Mrs. Clinton's rough-house approach to politics, such as her 
reported role in firing and lodging criminal accusations against seven 
workers of the White House Travel Office, did not prevent CBS This 
Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart from asking on August 26: "In the San 
Diego Republican convention, you were the subject of much conversation, 
and I think the target, I think many would say, of some very serious 
attacks....Do you ever, seriously, in the White House, when all the 
doors are closed, do you ever say `Is this worth it'?"
<P>
<DD>Just after she left the podium, NBC's Maria Shriver asked her: "This has 
been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that applause, the way 
you've been treated here, the way people have been reacting to you, kind 
of make it all go away?" And: "You are credited with really redefining 
the role of First Lady and for doing that, you've taken a lot of heat, a 
lot of criticism. As you look back, do you wished you'd redefined it a 
little less?"
<P>
<DD>On CBS, Bob Schieffer inquired of her: "Weren't you a little offended 
when he [Bob Dole] made the reference he did [to your book]?" CNN's Wolf 
Blitzer echoed: "What goes through your mind when you hear some of these 
bitter attacks against you?"

<h2>News Bites</h2>
<CENTER><h3>From the October 1996 Media Watch</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Extreme Agreement.</B> 
<P>
Tagging Republican House freshmen as extremists is Democratic mantra. And, it's an
assessment endorsed by CBS News. On the October 10 Evening News, Bob Schieffer examined the Ohio re-match between GOP rookie Frank Cremeans and the man he beat in 1994, Democrat Ted Strickland. Schieffer found a GOP official who thought Newt Gingrich had gone "too far" and asked him a question that incorporated the Democratic spin on last year's budget showdown: "Where did he make his mistake? In shutting down the government?" Strickland insisted that "people want moderation and when extremes are presented, whether they be from the left or the right, I think people have a tendency to turn away from that." Schieffer then concluded by endorsing the "extreme" assessment: "Obvious perhaps, but as Fall comes to the heartland and the election draws near, dozens of Republican freshmen are running scared, wondering if it's a lesson they learned in time."
<P>
<B>Crediting Clinton. </B>
<P>
For the media, bad news is usually good news. Right? Well, not when the good news helps Bill Clinton. On June 30, The New York Times reported that "the share of national income earned by the top five percent of households grew at a faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan administration, which was often characterized as favoring the rich." ABC's World News Tonight ran no story. But on September 26, when the Census Bureau reported that median income had risen as poverty fell, who got the credit? Bill Clinton.
<P>
Reporter Barry Serafin reported that median income grew 2.7 percent, but remained lower than 1989. Serafin started his story: "The number of Americans living in poverty fell. There were 36.4 million people below the poverty level, 1.6 million fewer than the year before. The poverty rate for African-Americans dropped to its lowest level since 1959, 29.3 percent.
<P>
What does it add up to?"
<P>
Following a soundbite from Clinton, Serafin continued: "Citing the income gains, the
President declared that the country is on the right track. He heralded progress on narrowing
the gap between the richest and poorest Americans." Serafin used a single expert source for
his story, a professor from MIT. Whom did the professor credit? Clinton and Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan. Serafin closed the story: "All in all the new numbers added to a very good
day for Bill Clinton." Thanks to ABC.
<P>
<B>Gore: Too Important to Criticize.  </B>
<P>
If you are powerful enough to get between a microphone and Clinton then you're personal
hypocrisy doesn't matter. At least that's what a CBS story portrayed. 

During the Democratic convention in Chicago Vice President Al Gore was widely praised by reporters for his emotional attack of tobacco by highlighting his sister's death from lung
cancer in 1984. On CBS Bob Schieffer called it "a barnburner." However, reporters failed to recognize that in 1988, four years after his sister died, Gore made an enthusiastic appeal to voters in tobacco states by stressing his own efforts in growing tobacco. 
<P>
The October 3 CBS Evening News included a profile of Gore by Rita Braver. For the first
time, CBS viewers heard about Gore's hypocrisy, but Braver excused him."He's in on every key White House meeting and decision. Just last month in his role as environmental guru, Gore convinced the President to create a controversial national monument in Utah. Of late, Republicans have attacked him for making a convention speech about his sister's death from lung cancer caused by smoking...While for several years after her death he let tobacco be grown on land he owned." But instead of seeing this as a character flaw, Braver relayed Gore's spin about how he "dismisses that attack as politics, an attempt to sully a man so close to the President he feels free to interrupt him." Viewers then saw video of Gore stepping in front of Clinton at a microphone. 
<P>
<B>Media to Dole: Just Stay Home. </B>
<P>
Is it wrong for a presidential candidate to address an ideological political organization?
Only if it's a conservative one.
<P>
When Bob Dole spoke September 14 to the Christian Coalition, on the NBC Nightly News David Bloom was concerned: "Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian Coalition despite worries inside his campaign that a bow to the religious right might send the wrong message to moderate, swing voters....Clinton's campaign spokesman said in a statement:
`Watching Bob Dole arm in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes to the extreme agenda being pursued by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich team.' A top Clinton campaign official was all smiles, saying, `if you see Dole, tell him thanks for me.'" 
<P>
But although Clinton was not criticized for refusing to speak at the same Coalition meeting, NBC cast in racial terms Dole's July 10 decision to decline the NAACP's speaking invitation. Back then reporter Jim Miklaszewski claimed the group considered it <blockquote>
"an insult to African-American voters....By not showing up here, Bob Dole may reinforce those racial divides along party lines and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge." 
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>Christian Contradiction. </B>
<P>
Following David Bloom's piece chastising Dole's  Christian Coalition speech, Brian Williams claimed the Coalition was "no longer the lone voice for conservative Christians." What new group of conservative Christians had NBC discovered?
<P>
Bob Abernethy described a group "uncomfortable" with the Coalition's "partisanship and with what seems to many critics its divisiveness and its neglect of the poor." Abernethy
described the new group's agenda as a "new kind of political action that defends the poor
and brings people together." But at their convention, they "heard from children right's
advocate Marian Wright Edelman," and Christian Marxist Jim Wallis. 
<P>
The group, Call To Renewal, hardly fits Williams' "conservative" label. Yet Abernethy didn't apply a single liberal label, even though "children's advocate" Edelman's speech garnered applause for this line: "Let's guarantee a job. Let's guarantee health care and children care. Let's turn this welfare repeal into real welfare reform." 
<P>
Abernethy simply described Wallis as "Reverend," but in the past Wallis has voiced hope that "more Christians will view the world through Marxist eyes." By failing to disclose Call To Renewal's ideological agenda, Abernethy committed sin by omission. 
<P>
<B>Media Flew the Koop. </B>
<P>
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop endorsed the Clinton health care scheme early on, making him a ubiquitous presence on the networks. Koop made news again when he criticized Bob Dole for suggesting nicotine is not addictive. He appeared on Good Morning America and was featured in stories on other networks castigating Dole. In the infamous July interview in which Dole and Katie Couric sparred over liberal bias, Couric cited Koop: "C. Everett Koop is pretty nonpartisan wouldn't you say? He criticized you quite severely for your comments. You're saying the liberal media had a problem but even Dr. Koop had a problem."
<P>
But when Koop criticized President Clinton for vetoing in April the partial-birth abortion
ban passed by Congress, he fell into TV's memory hole. The former Surgeon General did not appear on any network to talk about his condemnation of the President. The lesson? When a nationally known figure announces he is for a liberal proposal, he is much in demand by the media. When the same figure comes out in support of a conservative cause, the media silence is overwhelming. 
<P>
<B>Dole Behind: Blame Conservatives. </B>
<P>
Conservatives argue that Bob Dole's lack of identity with issues that excite conservatives
explained why he failed to early on secure his Republican base. But more than a month before the election, ABC's Dean Reynolds instead assigned Dole's low standing in the polls to his being "too conservative." For the September 23 World News Tonight Reynolds traveled to Lansing, Michigan where he found that "many of the voters we spoke with blame Gingrich for last year's government shutdown, for a  would be the environmental President and today he went to the Grand Canyon. It was a trip critics charged was nothing more than grand standing." Reporter Ann Compton opened her story: "This morning there was only a slight haze drifting through the Grand Canyon, so the South Rim was a picture perfect spot for President Bush to claim an environmental victory, but on many days smog from a nearby power plant makes it impossible to see across to the Canyon walls just two miles away." Who did Compton use for a soundbite? Then Senator Al Gore.
<P>
What a difference a President makes. When President Clinton and Vice President Gore visited the Grand Canyon exactly five years later to designate 1.7 million acres in Southern Utah as a national monument, no network used this photo op as a chance to tear apart Clinton's environmental record, quite the contrary. On the CBS Evening News, reporter Rita Braver started her story: 
<blockquote>"With Al `Earthman' Gore by his side, the President signed a bill
designating 1.7 million acres of land 70 miles away in Utah as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument." 
</blockquote>
ABC's Sam Donaldson was no different: 
<blockquote>"Dressed in appropriate western attire, boots and blue blazers, the top guns of the Democratic team came to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon to make points as conservationists."

<BR>
<B>Clinton's Character Off Limits--
Networks Declare Dole Criticisms "Mean," "Harsh" and "Nasty"</b> 
<P>
The networks spent early October on referee patrol for Bill Clinton, ruling out of bounds
anything critical or negative about him. <I>World News Tonight</I> anchor Forest Sawyer announced October 3: 
<blockquote>"Bob Dole decided to step onto center stage with a harshly worded attack not only on the administration's work in the Middle East, but its entire foreign policy....The administration has so far answered softly." The "soft" response? ABC didn't show it, but Clinton Press Secretary Mike McCurry retorted that Dole advisers are "nattering naysayers of gloom."
</blockquote>
<P>
MSNBC's <I>The News</I> with Brian Williams that night showed new ads from the Dole and Clinton campaigns: "We're going to begin with the latest ad from the Dole campaign which takes the campaign into a bit of nasty territory." Dole's ad simply showed clips of Clinton talking about taxes to illustrate he's really a liberal. Williams failed to tag the Clinton ad as
"nasty," but it included this negative attack line: "Dole and Gingrich tried to slash school
anti-drug programs. They'd take us back."
<P>
Bozo became the big news on October 8. A man in a crowd yelled at Dole that he should "get Bozo out of the White House." Dole shot back: "Bozo's on his way out." CNN's Bernard Shaw opened <I>Inside Politics</I>: "Was he borrowing the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter, or did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch in his contest with Bill Clinton?"
<P>
On the next morning's Today, Katie Couric asked NBC's Tim Russert: "As you've heard Tim it turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp yesterday. He was talking about a moral crisis. He refused to answer a question if President Clinton was morally and ethically capable of being President. You heard that Bozo exchange. Effective strategy or is this going to come back to haunt him?" Swift network condemnation followed Dole's October 14 decision to raise the ethics issue. On NBC <I>Nightly News</I> David Bloom declared: "In his harshest, most personal attack yet on the President, Bob Dole today charged that the Clinton Administration is unethical, that Bill Clinton himself is slipping and sliding away from questions about possible illegal campaign contributions." The next day Dole again discussed what he termed "public ethics," leading CBS reporter Phil Jones to worry that Dole "runs the risk of looking desperate and mean-spirited."
<P>
Dole's speech prompted Matt Lauer to begin his <I>Today</I> newscast on October 16, the morning of the second debate: "Bob Dole is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics. With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly O'Donnell is standing by live."

<B>Media Scoff at Far Right...Buy Wacky Left</B>
<P>
While the media are quick to dismiss crazy right-wing conspiracy theories about black U.N. helicopters they granted credence to the charge that the CIA introduced crack into black Los Angeles neighborhoods as a way to fund the Nicaraguan Contras. The theory was forwarded in an August San Jose Mercury News series by reporter Gary Webb. The four major networks aired a total of 12 stories with CBS laying claim to five. CNN ran three followed by ABC and NBC which aired two stories each. 
<P>
ABC's Good Morning America and CBS This Morning brought on far-left U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters. She pushed the charge as proof that outside forces created urban drug addicts. CBS's Bill Whitaker accepted the charge and placed the plight of crack babies at the feet of the CIA. His October 1 Evening News piece opened with a shot of woman holding a crying baby:
<blockquote>
"The decade and a half crack epidemic has exacted a ruinous toll. For ten years Eloise
Dangerfield has been rescuing the littlest victims, crack babies, from the death grip in
which the drug has ensnared much of South Central Los Angeles....So when L.A.'s black
citizens heard of the San Jose Mercury News reports claiming CIA backed Contras opened the first pipeline for Colombian cocaine to their communities their first reaction: shock. Their second: anger." 
</blockquote>
Whitaker aired a soundbite from Webb's source, a drug dealer, but offered this ambiguous defense of the CIA: 
<blockquote>"There is no evidence directly linking the CIA to the drug sales and the CIA says its own internal investigation has found no connection. Yet here at Ground Zero of the crack explosion the story simply won't go away." 
</blockquote>
<P>
He ended with more emotion over reason:
<P>
<blockquote>
"Eloise Dangerfield says it is all too horrible to contemplate. Knowing might ease the pain,
she says, but it won't end the suffering."
</blockquote>
<P>
In the September 30 Weekly Standard Tucker Carlson questioned Webb's reporting: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"Webb came up with no evidence to support his claim ....Instead of actual evidence, Webb relies on a series of unrelated events to show a conspiracy was afoot." Carlson noted that Sen. John Kerry's two year investigation failed to prove CIA involvement. "Indeed ample evidence surfaced that CIA officials had worked to remove drug traffickers from the Nicaraguan resistance."

<BR>
<B>Wall of Denial Breaks Down--Media Actually Admit Bias</B>
<P>
Sam Donaldson, USA Today's Richard Benedetto and the Chairman of CBS all agree: the media are biased. 
<P>
With Brit Hume out ill for a few days, Donaldson returned to the campaign trail for the
first time since Reagan's years. And he found things have changed, USA Today's Peter Johnson reported September 23: "Have the boys on the bus lost the fire in their bellies, the one that fueled their cries of `Mr. President! Mr. President!' during President Reagan's years in office? ABC's Sam Donaldson isn't saying, exactly, but suspects something's going on.
<P>
Except for CBS' Rita Braver, `I have heard no reporter trying to ask the President any
question,' Donaldson said....
<P>
"What's this, Sam? Reporters going easy on Clinton? `You're not going to get me in a fight with these guys. They're my friends,' said Donaldson, who covered the White House from 1977 to 1989. `But there seems to a change in attitude or a different attitude toward covering the President.'"
<P>
A USA Today reporter concurs. In his "Politics" column the same day, Richard Benedetto
wrote: "As President Clinton's re-election campaign rolled through six states in four days
last week, it did so virtually unimpeded by a White House press corps known for setting up roadblocks now and then....He was left free to make a string of feel-good speeches that won great play in the media and gave the desired impression that the Clinton campaign is on a roll.... "In 1992, a tough White House press corps rightly kept President Bush's feet to the fire on domestic issues he would rather have downplayed. But the 1996 crew appears less aggressive with Clinton."
<P>
The realization of media bias extends to the top of CBS. Michael Jordan, the Chairman of
Westinghouse, parent of CBS, revealed in a magazine profile that he agrees with CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg's charge that network reporting tilts left.
<P>
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed back in February Goldberg cited a specific CBS story to
support his contention that "the old argument that the networks and other 'media elites'
have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore." CBS
reaction at the time: "It's such a wacky charge," commented a baffled Bob Schieffer. CBS
News President Andrew Heyward called the charge "absurd," took Goldberg off the air for two months and then canceled his bylined CBS Evening News feature, "Bernard Goldberg's America."
<P>
In the Summer Forbes MediaCritic, Terry Eastland found that in a May <i>USAir Magazine</i> profile, Jordan sided with Goldberg: "I think his criticism is fair. I think all the networks can do a better job at providing a more objective and balanced perspective." Now, if only Jordan would put his concerns into action.

<CENTER><H2>Networks Blackout Clinton's Bad News</H2>
<H3>Revelation After Revelation Reported by Newspapers, But Never Make TV News</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
On September 26, the House ethics committee announced it would expand an investigation of Speaker Newt Gingrich's college course "Renewing American Civilization." ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC reported the story, ultimately adding up to eleven broadcast network morning and evening segments in five days. The next morning, NBC's Today led off with an interview with NBC Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert, who proclaimed: "It's awful, it's serious, it's potentially devastating." On October 8, Today's Matt Lauer asked Gingrich six questions about ethics, including two about whether Gingrich would resign. But a MediaWatch review of recent scoops on the Clinton administration's character shows a much different approach to stories which could damage Democrats.   
<P>
<BR>
<B>September 23:</B> The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation's inspector general concluded that Hillary Clinton had drafted a real estate
document with the intent to "deceive" federal regulators. That real estate transaction, a
sham deal selling a property named Castle Grande to a straw buyer, later cost taxpayers $4 million in the bailout of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. The Washington Post put the news on its September 24 front page. Network coverage? Nothing -- until October 4, when NBC's Jim Miklaszewski mentioned it in a Nightly News story on a speech by independent counsel Ken Starr: "Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr was invited to appear by outspoken Clinton critic Pat Robertson and the audience was very conservative. The White House claims that's proof Starr is out to get Clinton for political reasons, but Starr says he'll stay the course."
<P>
(ABC and CNN did report the story last February 29, when the FDIC released a more favorable assessment, recommending the FDIC not seek legal recourse against Mrs. Clinton or the Rose Law Firm.)
<P>
<BR>
<B>September 24:</B> A House committee held hearings on charges that the administration has let criminals become citizens. The Washington Times story the next day began: "Immigration workers yesterday told a House Government Reform and Oversight subcommittee of rampant abuses in the Citizenship USA program that apparently let thousands of immigrants with criminal records become citizens." The networks? Zilch until the October 18 CBS Evening News. Also on September 24, a federal jury convicted Sun Diamond Growers, one of the
nation's largest producers of fruits and nuts, of illegally showering former Clinton
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy with nearly $6,000 in gifts, a conviction for Independent
Counsel Donald Smaltz. The story made The Washington Post front page the next day. Network coverage? Nothing, but The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer on PBS did a brief anchor-read item.
<P>
<BR>
<B>September 25:</B> Sen. Orrin Hatch revealed a six-month gap in the log which listed who at the White House was accessing FBI background files on Republican White House employees. The Washington Times bannered the news across page one the next day. Coverage? A CNN World Today story and a mention on ABC's Good Morning America.
<P>
Also on the 25th, the Times reported that Rep. John Mica (R.-Fla.) sent a letter to
Clinton's "drug czar" demanding release of a four-month-old Institute for Defense Analysis
report that concluded Bush's interdiction policy was far more effective than Clinton's
emphasis on drug treatment. Network coverage? Nothing until a story by David Martin on the October 15 CBS Evening News.

September 26: Three days after President Clinton refused to rule out pardons for Whitewater figures on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, 170 members of Congress, including three Democrats, sent a letter to the White House demanding Clinton promise not to pardon anyone. The September 29 Washington Times reported that House Democrats were prepared to shut down the government if Republicans demanded a vote on a resolution calling for President Clinton to renounce pardons. Network coverage? With the exception of one general question on the 29th about pardons from CBS Evening News Sunday anchor John Roberts to commentator Laura Ingraham, absolutely nothing until Dole raised the subject later.
<P>
<BR>
<B>October 1:</B> The White House claimed executive privilege to withhold from House investigators a memo to President Clinton from FBI Director Louis Freeh said to be highly critical of federal drug policy. Network response? Zero. 
<P>
<BR>
<B>October 4:</B> Sen. Orrin Hatch released the deposition of White House aide Mari Anderson before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Anderson verified that pages of the log used to record the taking of FBI files were missing. Anderson also asserted, in contra- diction to White House aide Craig Livingstone's assurances, that he knew they were procuring the FBI files of Republicans. Even The Washington Post put this story on its front page the next day. Network coverage? Only CNN, in two Linden Soles anchor-briefs on The World Today, mentioned the news. (ABC's World News Tonight didn't report it, but the revelations were raised in an interview on the October 6 This Week.)
 Also on October 4, former FBI Special Agent Dennis Sculimbrene, who was the senior agent assigned to the White House from 1986 to April 1996, told The Wall Street Journal: "There were senior people as well, senior aides and advisers to the President who used drugs recently -- people in policy positions, or say, the director of an office...Some senior
 people even said they had used drugs as recently as the Inaugural." Sculimbrene estimated that "about 25 percent of the incoming administration, about one out of four cases, had a problem with illegal drugs. Not just casual experimentation, but a pattern of usage." Network coverage? Zero. 
<P>
<BR>
<B>October 10:</B> A House panel investigating the Clinton administration's secret foreign policy initiative to encourage the Iranian government to arm the Bosnian Muslims asked the Justice Department to probe administration officials for possible criminal charges for false statements. Since the Iran-Bosnia secret foreign policy emerged in the Los Angeles Times April 5, CBS and NBC have aired absolutely nothing on the evening news about the story. CNN and ABC aired only anchor briefs, only in the first days of the story. Network coverage for the latest development? Zero.
<P>
On CNN's Crossfire Sept. 20, Chicago Tribune reporter Ellen Warren declared: "Reporters want nothing more, this year and four years ago, to have a horse race. That's what we're in love with, is the fight, the close call....So it's in our interest to make it look close, to make Bob Dole look good." The omissions documented here suggest otherwise.

<B>Clinton: Moral Leader</B>
<P>
The chief White House speechwriter got his job because candidate Bill Clinton so liked his
reporting. In the September 23 Weekly Standard, Christopher Caldwell relayed why chief
speechwriter Donald Baer,  who had been Assistant Managing Editor of U.S. News, was tapped in 1994: "Clinton liked the articles Baer contributed to U.S. News during the 1992 campaign" since "Baer wrote with extreme empathy about Clinton's background."
<P>
Caldwell quoted a journalistic colleague: "'Being of the South and still being rooted there,
yet being driven and ambitious enough to prove oneself in the larger world -- the two of
them have a lot in common.' While Baer has always been a loyal Democrat, he's not
necessarily a liberal. Like Clinton, he has an idiosyncratic, instinctive, generally 
progressive politics that winds up at beyond-left-and-rightism."
<P>
Beyond ideology maybe, but not beyond idolizing Clinton. Caldwell learned: "This enthusiasmcan appear like ideological non-commitment or caginess. One New Democrat who met Baer at a dinner last year described him as `bland beyond description, a fount of cliches. `Clinton was the moral leader of the Universe,' and all that.'"
<P>
<B>Up and Out at U.S. News</B>
<P>
James Fallows took the helm at U.S. News in late September. The new Editor promoted one veteran of Democratic politics while another decided to resign. Now in the number two slot as Managing Editor: Harrison Rainie, an Assistant Managing Editor since 1988 when he jumped from the office of New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan where he had spent most of 1987 as the Democrat's Chief-of-Staff.... 
<P>
Deciding to depart: Kathryn Bushkin, Director of Editorial Administration since 1984 when
she put in a stint as Press Secretary with Gary Hart's presidential effort. Bushkin has
joined a PR firm.
<P>
<B>NBC's on the Mark</B>
<P>
A professional flack for a liberal Senator is the newest member of the on-air reporting team
at the NBC News Washington bureau. Alexandra Marks, Press Secretary to Senator John Kerry
(D-Mass.) from late 1993 to mid-1995, signed on in early September. Before joining Kerry and
again since 1995 Marks worked as a Christian Science Monitor reporter. But she's not new to TV. Prior to flacking for Kerry, Marks reported for the Monitor's since-failed cable channel and for the 10 O'Clock News on WGBH-TV, Boston's PBS station.
<P>
<B>Democratic Cable</B>
<P>
Among the on-air talent brought aboard MSNBC, the new NBC News cable channel in partnership with Microsoft, were a Clinton speechwriter and an aide in a Democratic presidential run.
<P>
Political correspondent Eric Liu composed speeches for Secretary of State Warren Christopher in 1993 before becoming, at age 25, the youngest speechwriter for President Clinton. The New York Times reported that Liu moved to the White House speechwriting office in November 1993 where he toiled until June 1994.... Chip Reid, hired to cover the White House and Capitol Hill, was general counsel in 1987 for Democrat Joe Biden's unsuccessful run. For theprevious four years Reid had been chief investigator for the Senate Judiciary Committee's Democratic Senators. After Biden, Reid accepted a producer slot with ABC News and was a reporter for Washington, D.C.'s ABC affiliate, WJLA, when tapped by MSNBC.

<title>Janet Cooke Award April 1996</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>
Janet Cooke Award <BR>
For the October 1996 Mediawatch. 
</h2></center>

<i>The Janet Cooke Award is given to the most outrageously distorted news story of the month. The award honors the Washington Post reporter who won the Pulitzer Prize for a story later proven completely false.</i>
<p>
<CENTER><B>Clinton Doesn't Get Enough Credit
<BR>
PBS Special Argues Media Out of Touch, But Show Proves PBS Out of Touch with Reality</B>
<P>
</CENTER>
Civility was not the rule at PBS when Frontline asserted the Reagan administration had
funneled drugs into American cities to fund the Contras, that Reagan's CIA attempted to kill Contra leader Eden Pastora, or that the 1980 Reagan campaign conspired to delay the release of the Iranian hostages. Congressional investigations later unraveled these conspiracy theories with no apologies from PBS. But now that Bill Clinton is President, PBS has funded --  without any rebuttal -- Hedrick Smith's four-hour documentary on how Washington works, <B>The People and the Power Game</B>.
<P> 
For devoting his first hour on September 3 to his claim that Bill Clinton has been abused by an uncivil news media, Smith earned the Janet Cooke Award.
Smith began: 
<blockquote>
	"By focusing on scandal and conflict over substance, and by our increasingly
	negative tone, the media has distorted the nation's agenda and lost touch with the 	public we claim to serve." 
</blockquote>
But Smith made only two brief asides about coverage of conservatives: how
reporters drilled Steve Forbes with personal or tactical questions on Meet the Press, while
average people asked questions of substance; and Newt Gingrich complaining about the
"childhood games" reporters played at his press conferences. Smith introduced Gingrich: "A politician on the make knows that the sure way to command press attention is with
sensationalism and extremist polemics. Newt Gingrich, as a junior Congressman, built his
power on media fireworks." The rest of the hour brought example after example of scandalous Clinton coverage, from the supposed $200 haircut with Cristophe on Air Force One, to New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd: "President Clinton returned today for a sentimental journey to the university where he didn't inhale, didn't get drafted, and didn't get a degree." 
<P>
<B>Gennifer Flowers.</B>
<P> 
Smith decried the networks "going with a questionable story that almost felled a future President." Smith never investigated the substance of the Flowers
story, choosing instead to force anchors to defend themselves for even touching it. But
Smith's version was at variance with the actual record. He reported ABC's Jim Wooten asked Clinton about the Star's Flowers story on Thursday, January 23, but decided not to air a story. ABC's local affiliates did -- as did Nightline, which booked three guests decrying the story as tabloid trash. Smith claimed: "By the next day, ABC's <I>World News Tonight</I>, lagging behind its own affiliates, decided to broadcast the story." 
<P>
Smith asked Peter Jennings: "In this instance, you tried it [to check the story out] on the first day, and on the basis of that standard, you didn't run it...With not much different facts the second day, you did run it." Replied Jennings: "Yeah. I think that's a fair and slightly painful characterization for me. But the truth of the matter is that by the second day, we were pretty much swept along by events." Smith then interviewed Dan Rather: "I said `Gosh, I don't have the stomach for doing that. And the first day, even the second day, we said `Nah, not for me.' I mean, frankly, I don't care, and I don't think most viewers care. And then somebody came in and said `Look at this. Last night, one of our major competitors, they went with it, they went with it strong,' and that bridges over from the sleazy press into the mainstream." But any look at the tapes of ABC's World News Tonight demonstrates that they aired no story on January 24, the day after Nightline, but waited until the 27th -- after the Clintons had appeared in an exclusive post-Super Bowl interview on 60 Minutes. And for Rather's version of events -- that a competitor "went with it strong" -- seems strange since he waited until 60 Minutes did the story. Only NBC's Lisa Myers made passing reference to the Flowers story before that.
<P>
<B>Brit Hume</B>.
<P>
 Smith claimed: "The once-cozy relationship between the President and the White
House press corps has dissolved into permanent combat...Increasingly, critics argue, the
balance is out of whack, and the traditional skepticism of the White House press corps has slid into cynicism, where a President's thoughtful deliberation is seen as indecision and compromise as backsliding." What kind of cynical question did Smith have in mind? When Clinton appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court after long considering Stephen Breyer, ABC's Brit Hume asked Clinton: "We may have created an impression, perhaps unfair, of a certain zig-zag in the decision making process here. I wonder if you could walk us through it and perhaps disabuse of any notions we might have along these lines. Thank you." 
<P>
Eric Engberg. The CBS reporter may have been criticized by colleague Bernard Goldberg for attacking Steve Forbes' flat tax, but Smith was only concerned about Clinton: "Critics
contend that Engberg's Reality Checks have gone beyond investigative journalism and become saturated with opinion, almost always negative...Just seven days after Clinton's
inauguration, for example, Engberg was on the air with a Reality Check declaring the infant administration a failure."
<P>
But Engberg's actual report never came close to "declaring the infant administration a
failure." Engberg noted Clinton had not followed through on promises to have plans on the
economy and energy available "on the first day" of his presidency. Engberg also brought up news reports that the White House was considering a gas tax, recalling Clinton ruled out raising taxes on the middle class in 1992. Engberg concluded: "Overall, the first week
showed the President willing to jump into controversies that can slice away some of his
early support. The promise to focus on the economy like a laser seemed to come unstuck in the Washington centrifuge."   

CBS's State of the Union. Smith declared: "CBS and others in the Washington media were
criticized for relying on inside-the-Beltway punditry in their coverage of Clinton's State
of the Union address." The program quoted Joe Klein saying: "It was a very, very long
speech. This guy loves to give long speeches." He left out Klein's next sentence: "But it
was also a very effective one."

Smith rebutted Klein: "But polls showed the public loved it." Where would Smith have learned
that polls showed the public loved it? CBS aired its instant poll results showing that 85
percent "approve of the President's proposals," that 74 percent "now have a clear idea what
President Clinton stands for" and 56 percent said Clinton "better understands the major
problems facing the country today" than the GOP. Rather signed off by repeating all the
pro-Clinton poll results.

Taxpayers fund public broadcasting to be offered an alternative to the commercial networks.
Smith's program shows taxpayers aren't getting an alternative, but are paying for PBS to
scold the media on how they're not liberal enough.

<title>Newsbites -- November 1996 Media Watch</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Newsbites from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<b>California's Clock</b>
<BR>
NBC's Maria Shriv-er and CBS's Jane Robelot laid into the California Civil Rights
Initiative, Proposition 209, after it passed by a wide margin on November 5. The measure
banned the state from awarding preferential treatment to anyone on the basis of race, sex,
or religion -- to liberal reporters, an obvious step backwards. Shriver tossed Jesse Jackson
a loaded softball on election night: "Affirmative action was a hotbed issue in this country,
still a big race on that subject going on about that in California. Did you feel at times
like we've turned back the clock on some of these issues?" On CBS This Morning the next day,
Robelot attacked initiative sponsor Ward Connerly for touting an end  to preferences: "But
that's sort of living in an ideal world. I mean it's nice to say it on paper. If you look
around at corporate offices in America and in CEO's offices, you're gonna see very few
minorities and few women. Are we really ready to backtrack on civil rights now, or on
affirmative action?"
<P>
<b>Gore vs. Gingrich</b>
<BR>
Rarely have the media's double standard toward the two parties been more evident than in the
Today show's interviews in the first week in October. On October 8, substitute co-host Matt
Lauer hit Newt Gingrich with six ethics questions, including: "Do you envision any
circumstances, Mr. Speaker, under which you might be forced to resign based on the
investigation?....So if the ethics committee comes back and says Newt Gingrich was not
truthful with us in supplying information?" Gingrich responded: "I don't think they can say
that." Lauer eagerly countered, "If they did, would you consider resigning?" The next
morning, substitute co-host Ed Gordon tossed bouquets at Al Gore: "Many can see that you
have indeed been the most powerful Vice President in our history. You satisfied with the
role that you played for four years?" And: "The debate is coming up. What do you want people
to come away with, after they watch you and Jack Kemp? What should they know about Al Gore?"
Gordon  also asked: "You want to be the best second guy you can. You're there to help the
President. Now having said that, do you want the job in 2000?"
<P>
<b>Cuddling Carolyn</b> 
<BR>
The national media have never been in love with the National Rifle Association, so when
anti-gun Democrat Carolyn McCarthy beat freshman Republican Rep. Daniel Frisa in New York,
media praise soon followed. The morning after the election, McCarthy made the talk show
rounds. On the November 6 Today, Katie Couric went straight to the NRA: "What do you think
the lesson is for the National Rifle Association? Of course, one of the cornerstones of your
campaign was to maintain the ban on assault weapons in this country." Over on Good Morning
America, ABC's Joan Lunden claimed: "McCarthy turned her rage over the availability of
assault weapons into political activism and last night this ultimate outsider, a former
nurse and homemaker, defeated incumbent Daniel Frisa." After McCarthy, who has never held
political office, made some broad comments about various government programs, Lunden praised
her: "Sounds like you really educated yourself too. Are you at all daunted by this task that
lies before you?" On November 8, World News Tonight picked McCarthy as the Person of the
Week because, as anchor Peter Jennings put it: "We have chosen her because the people who
chose her were so impressed by her notion of public service." McCarthy was the first
politician selected as Person of the Week this year.
<P>
<b>Hating Helen</b>
<BR>
GOP freshman Rep. Helen Chenoweth won re-election despite being targeted by the Democrats,
labor unions, environmentalists and...Tom Brokaw. On the October 24 NBC Nightly News, Brokaw
chose Chenoweth's Idaho congressional race as the subject of his "In Depth" report on big
money from special interests. Brokaw opened: "From sunup til late night, the sounds of
politics are in the air in Idaho like a migraine headache with a voice track. And this is
why: Helen Chenoweth, a controversial first term Republican Congresswoman." When Chenoweth
claimed: "I don't have a clue why they would target me. I come from an innocuous state. I'm
just a plain-spoken Western woman," Brokaw countered: "Not exactly. In her first term
Chenoweth was a cheerleader for the New Right. Voting against an increase in the minimum
wage, trashing traditional environmental organizations. She was a hard-liner on gun laws.
So, she is a target of big labor and conservationists." While Chenoweth was labeled as a
"hard-liner" and portrayed as extreme, her Democratic opponent Dan Williams drew no labeling
from Brokaw, nor was he depicted as being beholden to special interests, despite the
thousands of dollars big labor and liberal environmentalists spent on his behalf.  
<P>
<b>Return of the Gorbasm</b>
<BR>
  <DD>NBC's Tom Brokaw has put Mikhail Gorbachev in his personal pantheon of heroes. On the PBS
  talk show Charlie Rose May 2, Brokaw paid homage: "I think Gorbachev is a great man in the
  20th century because he forced his country to look at the hypocrisy and the fraudulence of
  communism and to begin slowly to make a turn away from it.  He can still light up any room
  that he walks into." Brokaw refused to call Ronald Reagan a great man: "You can look at
  the economics of Reaganism, for example, or some of the bombast of his foreign policy, and
  find all manner of flaws in there."
<BR>
Five months later, on MSNBC's InterNight October 29, Brokaw interviewed Gorbachev,
proclaiming: "It's likely that your view of Mikhail Gorbachev depends on your point of view.
From the perspective of the West, the former President of the Soviet Union of course was a
courageous, far-seeing prophet whose reforms set in motion the collapse of the Soviet
dictatorship and the end of the Cold War." At interview's end, Brokaw gushed: "Perhaps one
day we'll see you again in political office in Russia. We know that you've devoted your life
to peace and to changing your country and those of us who have gotten to know you count
ourselves among the privileged."
<P>
<b>Willie Horton Stalks Cyberspace</b>
<br>
For eight years reporters regularly insisted Republicans used racial issues, as symbolized
by the Willie Horton ad, to divide America in order to win the 1988 presidential campaign.
But this year, raising Willie Horton suddenly had become a symbol of toughness for one
politician. In a VP debate preview piece posted October 8 on the CNN website
AllPolitics.com, reporters Bob Franken and Marc Watts applauded the use of Willie Horton by
Al Gore in 1988: "Gore can also fire off the tough question. In 1988, as a Senator, he first
raised what became known as the `Willie Horton issue' with Michael Dukakis during a primary
debate." A dimmer view was advanced by CNN in a February 1992 special on race and the
presidential campaigns. CNN reporter Ken Bode sounded off about the pro-George
Bush independent expenditure ads featuring Willie Horton: "David Duke's exploitation of white
working class fears about blacks echoes a theme from the 1988 election. This is the Maryland
State Penitentiary. Inside resides the most politically notorious convict in America.
William Horton, Jr., the focal point of a major national campaign designed to exploit white
fear of black crime....The Horton case illustrates the readiness of political leaders to
exploit the racial divide."
<P>
<b>Peter's Slippery Science</b>
<BR>
Scientific studies usually get a respectful hearing -- unless reporters disagree with the
results. Take Peter Jennings  on the October 11 World News Tonight: "There was a study
released at Penn State University today that you may hear a lot about this weekend. It
purports to show a connection between women who have had abortions and the risk of
developing breast cancer. And if you see it around, remember this. It is not original
research, but an analysis of 23 earlier studies. And the National Cancer Institute says
those individual studies were actually inconclusive, and  because of that, various other
scientists say today the Penn State report is flawed." Some criticism of the study attacked
the author, Joel Brind, who is personally opposed to abortion. 
<P>
 But in the past Jennings has had no such doubts about the validity of meta-analysis, a
 method of research which draws conclusions by combining data from other studies. In a
 syndicated column, Reason magazine Science Editor Michael Fumento pointed out that a 1991
 report, by Dr. Stanton Glantz, an anti-smoking activist and founder of the American
 Nonsmoker's Rights Foundation, found a "30 percent increased risk," the same factor of
 increase as found in the recent breast cancer study. On January 9, 1991 Jennings had no
 disclaimers for the secondhand smoke study: "A new warning today about the dangers of
 passive smoking, breathing someone else's cigarette smoke. A report in the American Heart
 Association journal Circulation says passive smoking kills an estimated 53,000 people every
 year."
<P>
<b>Civil Rights or Social Programs?</b>
<BR>
 Opening an October 20 New York Times story reporter Steven Holmes declared: "In his nearly
 four years in office, President Clinton has amassed a civil rights record rivaling that of
 any President in the last 30 years." His proof? Clinton "stoutly defended the government's
 affirmative action role." 
<P>
But the newspaper's style manual apparently contains a broad definition of the phrase "civil
rights." Holmes laid out what he considered to be Clinton's 1992 campaign promises
concerning civil rights: "Work to pass the Motor Voter bill" and "support statehood for the
District of Columbia." Plus two items with no relation to discrimination or voting: "Require
every employer to spend 1.5 percent of payroll for continuing education and training," and
"expand the Earned Income Tax Credit." Expanding the definition let Holmes give Clinton
credit for two "civil rights achievements" that passed, Motor Voter and the Earned Income
Tax Credit. 
<P>
<b>Depraved Clinton</b>
<BR>
 Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas  had a change of heart on the credibility of
 Paula Jones. Prompted by former New York Times Supreme Court reporter Stuart Taylor's
 November article in The American Lawyer, on the November 3 Inside Washington, Thomas
 explained: "There are two friends of Paula Jones that she spoke to right after the alleged
 incident....Taylor has gone back and talked to them and they paint a pretty bad tale." Back
 on May 7, 1994 Thomas disparaged Jones as "some sleazy woman with big hair."
<P>
Taylor found that "the evidence supporting Paula Jones's allegations of predatory, if not
depraved, behavior by Bill Clinton is far stronger than the evidence supporting Anita Hill's
allegations of far less serious conduct by Clarence Thomas." In the three weeks after the
article appeared it didn't get a sentence in Newsweek or the other newsweeklies. Other than
a brief citation as an example of media bias by ABC's Jeff Greenfield on the October 31
World News Tonight, it drew not a second on the networks.
<p>
<b>Only One House?</b>
<br> 
Clinton has saved America's cities from the evil Reagan years, ABC News argued before the
election. Over video of a building being torn down, on the October 14 World News Tonight
ABC's Dean Reynolds asserted from Detroit: "Twenty five housing developments have started
here since the Clinton Administration took office." Following a soundbite from Detroit Mayor
Dennis Archer, Reynolds charged, without rebuttal, "A decade ago during the Reagan era,
according to the Mayor, only one new house was built in the entire city."

<h3>Bright Side, from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<P>
<center><h2>Ross Stands Alone</h2></center>
<P>
<DD>With the revelations of questionable contributions to the Clinton campaign and the
Democratic Party, one would assume the media would be all over the story.  Not so. But ABC's
Brian Ross stood apart in October for focusing on Democratic fundraising. On the October 22
World News Tonight, Ross first put Jorge Cabrera, a twice convicted drug dealer who was
invited to the White House after giving $20,000 to the DNC, onto network TV: "As to how
Cabrera got inside the White House, the Democratic Party said today it did not know of his
criminal record and he had been referred to them as a prominent member of the Cuban-American
community in Monroe County, Florida. Tom Cash, the former top drug agent in Miami, says the
only thing prominent about Cabrera is his criminal record." Two days later Ross filed the
first broadcast network piece detailing John Huang's flight: "A federal judge ordered
Democratic Party lawyers into court and told them to produce John Huang to testify in a
civil lawsuit alleging favoritism at the Commerce Department for big Democratic
contributors." Ross showed how Huang could not be found and explained how he "was suspended
by the Democratic Party this week as a fundraiser when some of his contributions were found
to have been illegally given by people who were not U. S. citizens."
<P>
<center><h2>Ignored...Until Sunday</h2></center>
<P>
<DD>The network evening shows largely ignored Democratic financial scandal news, but two Sunday
shows picked up on them. On the October 13 Meet the Press host Tim Russert put VP Al Gore
off balance with his continual barrage of questions: "But isn't character a fair issue to
bring up? Why can't Republicans say, `Listen Bill Clinton promised, quote, the most ethical
administration in history, and it hasn't been that. Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater.'" And,
"But what about the appearance, Mr. Vice President, of a gentleman, John Huang, working for
a Lippo Company, then joining the Commerce Department, where he works on their behalf,
lobbies on their behalf; then goes over to the DNC and raises money for them?" Russert even
noted "there's a perception the President is dangling pardons out there in order to silence
people." CNN's Frank Sesno pressed White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta on the October 27
Late Edition, questioning him about Ron Brown allegedly "selling seats" on his trade
missions. Sesno brought up how Huang "raises $4 to $5 milion from Asian-Americans, some of
it raised illegally. Money that came from South Korean business had to be returned. A
quarter of a million dollars, $400,000 from these Indonesian gardeners who since have gone
away....Where's the outrage from the White House?"

<h3>Page One from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Whatever You Say, Mr. Clinton</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>Network Anchors Carry White House Spin that Voters Hate Investigations</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>Shortly after the election Clinton's aides told reporters that the voters wanted an end to
congressional investigations. They didn't have to convince reporters of anything. They
already agreed. NBC's Tom Brokaw noted on  election night: "There is also a theory, however,
that if the Republicans begin to engage once again in a lot of investigations that it will
not do well for them four years from now. Because the country in all the exit polling that
we're seeing so far is saying, `Hey let's get on with the business of solving the real
problems that we have out there.'"
<p>
<dd>Over on CBS, Dan Rather echoed Brokaw, asking Senator
Trent Lott: "True or false, that part of the Republican agenda is now to try to paralyze the
White House with so-called ethics inquiries?" The next morning, NBC Today substitute co-host
Matt Lauer asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour: "Exit polls show us that the economy was still
the number one issue on people's mind last night. And although character and trust play a
role, people choose candidates based on their handling of the issues. With that in mind,
what do you say to people now who look to Republicans in Congress and say, `Hey, move
forward on key legislation. Don't get bogged down on investigations into the Clinton White
House?'"
<p>
<dd>When Sen. Al D'Amato announced he would back off his Whitewater probe in the
Senate, reporter Jim Miklaszewski concluded on the November 7 NBC Nightly News: "White House
officials are under no illusions and still expect Republicans to vigorously pursue
investigations on other fronts. But they're also encouraged that D'Amato's announcement may
signal an end to any high-profile political witch hunts." Tom Brokaw returned to his theme
on the November 7 Don Imus radio show, but added a new twist: it's in the Republican
leaders' self-interest to halt the investigations. He claimed "A lot of these new Republican
leaders, Trent Lott and others, have their own presidential aspirations four years from now.
They'll want to get things done because I think that's the underlying message from the
country here -- solve the problems. And yes there are some real problems within the
administration that need to be investigated, but there are agencies and ways of doing that
without tying up Congress in these expensive hearings." 
<p>
<dd>A post-election Pew Research Center
poll of voters determined that while thirty percent said Congress had "gone too far" in
investigating Clinton, the majority did not: 31 percent thought Congress had not gone far
enough and 35 percent indicated that "it has handled the matter about right." If only the
media were that evenly split.

<h3>Page Three from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Networks Lay the Blame -- The GOP Shutdown?</h2></center>
<P>
<dd>The networks had a ready answer for why Bob Dole lost, suggesting it happened because the
public bought the Democratic spin that House Republicans were responsible for the government
shutdown. Of course, the media kept repeating that Democratic spin in its own reporting,
neglecting to mention that President Clinton refused to sign any budget resolution to keep
the government operating. It started before the election. On the October 18 World News
Tonight, ABC's Cokie Roberts relayed without challenge: "With the help of millions of
dollars from organized labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind voters that these
freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they shut down the government."
<P>
 <dd>In a roundtable on the November 3 This Week with David Brinkley, ABC's Sam Donaldson asked
 fellow panel member George Will: "Are you going to shut down the government again? Did that
 strategy work?" (Donaldson repeated himself on election night, saying Dole's  loss wasn't
 his fault because Gingrich "helped engineer a shutdown" that "scared the country.") Looking
 back at the 1996 campaign on the November 4 This Morning, CBS's Bill Plante contemplated:
 "You think the campaign began here, at the Democrats' made for TV convention? No way. It
 really began with this year's State of the Union address. The President already knew he'd
 have no opponent in New Hampshire and the Republicans had just stumbled badly by shutting
 down the government."
<P>
<dd>The bias continued on election night. CNN's Bernard Shaw declared: "The Republican Party
actually helped William Jefferson Clinton in that comeback, especially when they voted to
shut down the Congress [sic]. The American people said they Republicans went too far. We did
not send you to Washington to shut down the federal government." On  the morning after the
election, CBS This Morning anchor Troy Roberts theorized: "Often abrasive, Gingrich never
mastered the fine art of compromise. Less than a year after he rode into Washington in
triumph, he was on the defensive. His gambit to shut down the government over the budget
backfired. Seizing the moment, President Clinton quickly became the voice of centrist
reason."

<center><h2>Media Highlight Brinkley -- But What About Them?</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>David Brinkley's election night comments that President Clinton is "a bore" and that his
acceptance speech delivered "goddamned nonsense" generated wide newspaper coverage. Brinkley
apologized to Clinton during a This Week interview, but other reporters have never
apologized or been condemned for comments about conservatives. NBC's Bryant Gumbel called
Pat Buchanan "Mr. Puke-anan" on the Feb. 20 Today. In 1994 he asked House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt: "You called Gingrich and his ilk, your words, `trickle-down terrorists who
base their agenda on division, exclusion and fear.' Do you think middle-class Americans are
in need of protection from that group?" On David Letterman in 1987, Sam Donaldson advised
how to measure President Reagan's success in an upcoming press conference: "I think he is
going to have to pass two or three tests. The first is, will he get there, stand in front of
the podium, and not drool." Just after the 1994 election Donaldson asked Speaker-to-be Newt
Gingrich on This Week: "A lot of people are afraid of you. They think you're a bomb-thrower.
Worse, you're an intolerant bigot. Speak to them." On a January, 1995 Sunday Morning John
Leonard declared: "From the pronunciamentos out of Washington, you'd think the new Congress
were a slash-and-burn Khmer Rouge." NPR/ABC reporter Nina Totenberg issued a death wish on
Inside Washington in 1995 after Sen. Jesse Helms said too much is spent on AIDS research: "I
think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the Good Lord's mind, because if there
is retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will
get it."

<title>In the Media -- November 1996 Media Watch</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>In the Media from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Slow Growth Hailed in '96</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>But Four Years Ago...</h2></center>
<p>
In late October 1992 the government announced the 3rd quarter GDP jumped up to 2.7 percent.
Four years later, on October 30, the 3rd quarter number fell to just 2.2 percent. But what
was bad news for Bush escaped such scorn this year with Bill Clinton in the Oval Office.
Indeed, NBC's Tom Brokaw positively spun this year's drop: "The economy was slow, but steady
going in the last quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means
inflation is under control and interest rates will stay low."    On the CBS Evening News Ray
Brady noted: "There's one irony here. On election day 1992 the economy was starting to pick
up, but voters hadn't felt it yet. Remember that expression, `It's the economy stupid'? And
George Bush went down to defeat. On election day 1996 the economy seems to be slowing, but
not enough so that most voters will be feeling it." Why hadn't voters in 1992 "felt it"?
<P>
Maybe because Brady and his colleagues put a negative spin on 1992 economic news? On October
27, 1992, CBS reporter Susan Spencer filed from the Bush campaign: "He crowed today at
upbeat news of a third quarter growth rate of 2.7 percent, though some economists warned
that may not hold." She was correct, but not in the direction she thought. It was later
revised upward to 3.9 percent. On September 4, 1992 anchor Connie Chung led the show by
explaining: "The nation's unemployment rate is down slightly for the second month in a row.
But the latest decline is a result of a summer jobs program for teenagers. That program is
about to end, and as Ray Brady reports, the picture ahead is bleak." Brady concluded: "After
hitting a high of 7.8 percent for June, then dipping a tenth of a point again last month,
most economists now predict next month's jobless rate could hit 7.8 percent." 
<p>
One month
later, the rate fell from 7.6 to 7.5 percent. On the October 2, 1992 CBS Evening News Brady
skipped his mistake and offered a new reason to dismiss the good news: "Those unemployment
lines did become a bit shorter last month, but economists say that's largely because many
Americans simply stopped looking for work, so they're no longer counted as unemployed." CBS
wasn't the only culprit. On ABC's World News Tonight October 30 Peter Jennings gave equal
weight to both sides: "President Clinton...noted that many economists say a cooling off is
necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, the numbers were good news.
Senator Dole on the other hand was in Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says
the numbers are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected there
could be a recession." 
<p>
But four years ago Jennings insisted the 2.7 percent GDP is "more
than economists had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." Bob Jamieson
then reported that "many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking a
sharp turn for the better." The next day, October 28, 1992, Jennings warned: "The President
may complain about the news media, but the economic growth figures which he is so pleased
about are not that definitive, according to a great many independent economic analysts." All
this matches the Center for Media and Public Affairs finding that "In September, fully 91
percent of sources said the economy was healthy," but "in September 1992, 98 percent of all
sources on the [ABC, CBS and NBC] evening news criticized the state of the economy

<h3>Study from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>A Continuing Pattern of Omission</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>Network Anchors Carry White House Spin that Voters Hate Investigations</h2></center>
<p>
<DD>Six days after the election, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz noted that several
print media outlets had pieces of the Democratic National Committee's foreign fundraising in
hand, but didn't think they had enough for a major story -- until the pieces came together
in the person of John Huang in October. Just as MediaWatch found last month, front-page
newspaper scoops failed to attract much network interest or intensity, even in the final
days of the campaign. A MediaWatch review of October morning (ABC, CBS, NBC) and evening
news coverage (ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN's The World Today) found the networks were slow or
missing in action on critical campaign stories in the last few weeks before the election.
<P>
<DD>The networks aired only 26 explanatory or investigative pieces by non-campaign
correspondents (8 on CNN, 7 on ABC, 6 on CBS, and 5 on NBC). To review the developments:
<ul>
<li><i>October 8:</i> The Wall Street Journal front page introduced the story of John Huang and his resume: the Lippo Group, an Asian conglomerate with ties to Little Rock, followed by Ron Brown's Commerce Department, and then the Democratic National Committee, where he raised large amounts from Asian donors. Network coverage? None. 
<li><i>October 14:</i> Three days after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called for an independent counsel to investigate and one day after Newt Gingrich said the Indonesian story "makes Watergate look tiny," two networks arrived on the story. ABC's Jackie Judd led off World News Tonight with it, while on CBS, Eric Engberg had the newscast's number two story. The morning shows had small mentions in their Clinton stories. 
<li><i>October 17:</i> The Washington Post reported on the front page that the DNC acknowledged a "mistake" in holding an $140,000 fundraiser at a Buddhist temple in April organized by John Huang and attended by Vice President Gore. Neither that nor an October 25 Post front-page follow-up drew a network news story. Also on October 17, ABC's Brian Ross investigated Yogesh Gandhi, a $325,000 donor to the DNC, noting he owed the state of California $10,000 in back taxes. which raised the question if the $325,000 was really his money, or someone else's. No other network developed this story. (None of Ross's reports were replayed on Good Morning America.) 
<li><i>October 19:</i> The Washington Post reported on its front page that the DNC removed Huang from his money-raising duties and asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate the legality of Huang-solicited contributions. All four networks ran about a sentence-long update in the middle of their campaign coverage -- CBS on the 18th, the rest on the 19th. NBC's Today read two briefs on Huang's suspension. That same day, the Democrats returned a $20,000 contribution from convicted Miami cocaine smuggler Jorge Cabrera, admitting they do not systematically check the background of donors None of the networks reported the story that night. ABC's Brian Ross did a full report on October 22, noting that while Cabrera was convicted of possessing more than 5,000 pounds of cocaine in July, the DNC did not give the money back until Newsweek began asking about it. CNN and NBC followed on the 24th. CBS did not. In the morning, Cabrera drew only two brief mentions on NBC's Today. 
<li><i>October 23:</i>  Expanding on Brian Ross, the Los Angeles Times reported that Yogesh Gandhi, the $325,000 donor to the DNC, claimed pauper status in not paying the $20 filing fee for his divorce. Network coverage? None. Federal judge Royce Lamberth issued an order for the DNC to produce Huang. Only NBC Nightly News reported the subpoena. October 24: Lamberth issued another order demanding the DNC produce Huang. Only ABC's World News Tonight reported on the story. After Brian Ross focused on the effort to locate Huang, Asia-based reporter Mark Litke reported on the Clintons' ties to the Riady family, the Indonesians who run the Lippo Group. The morning shows were absent. 
<li><i>October 25:</i> A panel of federal judges asked independent counsel Kenneth Starr to investigate whether former White House  counsel Bernard Nussbaum lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the hiring of Craig Livingstone. Two days later, NBC's Tim Russert insisted on the Sunday Today: "This is dead serious....I don't know how we can dismiss it nine days before an election." But only CNN's Bob Franken filed a full report. ABC and NBC had their anchors read briefs. CBS aired nothing. Other than one anchor brief on Saturday's Today, the morning shows reported nothing. 
<li><i>October 29:</i> The Washington Post published a front-page story reporting the DNC would not file a pre-election contributions report with the Federal Elections Commission, and John Huang surfaced after 11 days in hiding to testify. All four networks arrived on the story that evening. (While ABC's and NBC's morning shows reported the DNC's failure to file in anchor briefs, CBS This Morning aired nothing until the next day.) 
<li><i>October 30:</i> The Los Angeles Times reported that Mark Middleton, "a little-known, 34-year-old ex-White House aide from Arkansas," arranged a meeting between President Clinton and the chief financial manager of Taiwan's ruling party. The Times reported that the official, Liu Tai-Ying, offered to donate (illegally) $15 million to the Clinton campaign. Only CNN and NBC reported the story that night. ABC didn't even report a full campaign story. CBS followed the next day. NBC's Today, with a full report by Andrea Mitchell, was the only morning show on the story. 
<li><i>October 31:</i> "DNC Fundraiser Huang Visited White House Often," reported the front page of The Washington Post, 78 times since July 1995. ABC and CBS reported the story, but NBC did not. ABC's Good Morning America covered the story, but CBS This Morning and NBC's Today did not. ABC's Charles Gibson suggested "if Republicans had done this, the press would be killing them."
<li><i>November 3:</i> The Associated Press reported former Clinton CIA Director R. James Woolsey criticized Democrats for inviting foreign businessman Grigori Loutchansky to a 1994 DNC dinner, where he was photographed with the President. Clinton's own CIA Director, John Deutch, had testified that Loutchansky's company, Nordex, is "associated with Russian criminal activity." Network coverage: None. 
<li><i>November 4:</i> The Detroit Free Press reported on an October 21 Detroit fundraiser that netted $800,000 from  Iraqi Christians who lobbied the President to lift the embargo against Iraq. CBS and NBC threw in brief evening news mentions. ABC and CNN did not. The morning shows were silent.

<title>Janet Cooke Award -- November 1996 Media Watch</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Janet Cooke Award from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Frontline Devotes An Hour to the Press, But Ignores Conservatives -- and Liberal Bias</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>Money is the Root of All Media Evils</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>Earlier this year, journalists bashing journalists became a fad. Atlantic Monthly editor
James Fallows' new book Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine Democracy led a new,
liberal attack on the media: too stardom-obsessed, too enamored of power, too wealthy from
lecture fees, too distant from the common people -- even too conservative on economics. On
October 22, Frontline aired a documentary titled "Why Americans Hate the Press," a
co-production with the far-left Center for Investigative Reporting. Correspondent and
producer Stephen Talbot never really attempted to answer how people feel about the press in
the hour-long program. Instead, he centered his program around Fallows arguing for the
"sedate high church" of journalism, as opposed to the reporters who've lost touch while
cashing in on Sunday morning "food fight" fame. 
<P>
 <dd>This thesis originated from Fallows -- and Bill Clinton. As Bob Woodward explained on
 Frontline: "Clinton makes that point in my book, that he believes that the Washington press
 corps is so out of touch that it is absolutely inconceivable that reporters will understand
 the issues that people are really dealing with in their lives, and Clinton feels a profound
 alienation from the Washington culture here, and I happen to agree with him." 
<P>
<dd>For probing the press from the left without balancing the show with press criticism from the
right, Frontline earned the Janet Cooke Award. Among the questions raised by a viewing of
the program: 
<ol>
<li><i>Where were the conservatives?</i> One thing that makes many Americans, and tens of millions of conservatives, hate the press is its liberal bias, but it went absolutely unmentioned. Questions about bias surfaced in Talbot's interviews with several of the talking heads (presented in full on the PBS website), but they never made the show. With the exception of Fred Barnes (who didn't comment on bias), not a single conservative appeared. Instead, PBS presented a left-wing stable of media scolds. First and foremost came Fallows, echoed by Washington Post reporter/columnist David Broder and media reporter Howard Kurtz, and even far-left critics Christopher Hitchens and Mark Hertsgaard, whose book On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency argued the press was incredibly soft on Ronald Reagan. Curiously, instead of investigating the press in its daily work on print and television, Talbot began the show with Fallows attacking The McLaughlin Group, a PBS program, and its commercial imitators, even interspersing them with footage of professional wrestling. Said Fallows: "That is something I would like to see done away with." Broder argued: "What bothers me is the notion that journalists believe, or some journalists believe, that they can have their cake and eat it, too, that you can have all of the special privileges, access, and extraordinary freedom that you have because you are a journalist in a society that protects journalism to a greater degree than any other country in the world, and at the same time, you can be a policy advocate, you can be a public performer on the lecture circuit or on television. I think that's greedy." Kurtz added: "It's certainly true that the more journalists have  become part of the affluent upper middle class, they have started to identify more with the elite in our society rather than the people who plunk down their quarters at the news stands for newspapers. I think that's a real problem." 
<li><i>Where was the evidence?</i> Talbot decried the influences on reporters who make large sums in speaking fees from corporations, but never provided a single example of content altered by them. As Fred Barnes suggested, "I haven't ever had anybody point out to me where that's happened." PBS didn't either. Fallows complained that corporations and trade associations expect a "subtle immunization," that before "doing you in," a reporter will say: "Oh, gee, I know old Joe from the tobacco lobby, maybe I should call him, see what he has to say." But isn't it the job of any decent reporter to include the business side of a dispute? 
<li><i>What about nonprofit groups?</i> Talbot touted ABC's July 1994 decision to ban reporter speaking conflicts:  "To avoid these potential and embarrassing conflicts of interest, ABC imposed a new policy banning speeches to lobbying groups by its reporters." But the rule doesn't apply to nonprofit advocacy groups. For example, in May 1994, ABC's Carole Simpson hosted a fundraiser for the liberal NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Why is it a conflict of interest to speak to the tobacco lobby but not to raise money for liberal lobbies like the NAACP? ABC told us its policy covered "groups with a political purpose," which they felt didn't include the NAACP. PBS didn't bring this up. 
<li><i>What does the revolving door prove?</i> Talbot decried the revolving door between journalism and politics, focusing on famous revolvers like Tim Russert and David Gergen. But he failed to mention what the revolving  door proves. For years, MediaWatch has documented how almost four times as many liberals and Democrats have revolved into the media as have conservatives or Republicans, which should have raised a question about whether liberal bias results. 
<li><i>Isn't this hypocrisy?</i> Except for Woodward, who Talbot interviewed and then counted on Hertsgaard to bash as an insider, Talbot never challenged his stable of liberal critics. Fallows insisted he despises buckraking revolving-door journalism, but keeps David Gergen at U.S. News. Broder deplored reporters as "policy advocates," but for many years has been a reporter and a columnist. Kurtz proclaimed reporters sympathize with politicians rather than the public, yet Kurtz has regularly complained about Bill Clinton's supposed maltreatment at the hands of reporters, talk show hosts, and comedians. When MediaWatch called the Center for Investigative Reporting in San Francisco for comment, Talbot was in Italy. CIR executive Sharon Tiller, listed as a producer on the Frontline program, did not return phone calls. Perhaps the most interesting sub-theme of the show is how a PBS program could point out media buckrakers like Cokie Roberts (of NPR), Steve Roberts (a PBS Washington Week in Review regular), and David Gergen (of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer), but didn't suggest that PBS is a breeding ground for buckraking -- that the network spawned out of a contempt for commercialism is now awash in profiteering opportunities for those who are chosen to grace its airwaves. The worse hypocrisy of all belongs to Frontline itself. It deplored reporters being too close to power, but after years of leveling discredited allegations at the Reagan and Bush administrations, it hasn't done a single investigative program on the Clintons in four years.

<title>NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING: LOOK WHO'S TALKING</title>
</head>

<Body color="#FFFFFF">

<center>
<h2>NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING: LOOK WHO'S TALKING</h2>
<h3>By L. Brent Bozell III</h3>
</center>
<p>
<dd>The pundits are right. This is the worst year of negative campaigning I've ever seen. These Republican candidates are being torn apart at the seams. Just sample some of the invective that's being thrown at them on television:
<ol>
<li>Before the campaign really got going, Phil Gramm's campaign was being smeared with a negative TV ad featuring on the screen a New Republic headline labeling Gramm "The Porn Broker" for 18 seconds. When the New Republic's source for the allegation that Gramm had funded a "soft-porn" film in the 1970s repudiated the story, saying "there was no pornography at all," there were no apologies.
<li>Steve Forbes saw his flat tax plan attacked in one campaign commercial as likely to produce "hideous deficits." The ad concluded: "The fact remains the flat tax is a giant, untested theory. One economist suggested before we put it in, we should test it out someplace -- like Albania." 
<li>The most vicious negative attacks have been aired against Pat Buchanan. One underlined his endorsement by Russian nationalist kook Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Another one charged: "It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has  created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts or statements by others." Yet another stooped to attacks on his family, charging his father listened to the anti-Semitic radio show of Father Coughlin, and that his little brothers beat up Jewish kids -- "Christ-killers," they were allegedly called -- in the 1950s.
</ol>
<dd>Yet another ad against Buchanan showed racist nut David Duke at a Buchanan rally, and featured an endorsement from Ku Klux Klansman Daniel Carver. The ad concluded: "A man who says what he means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of people who think they know exactly what he's talking about."
<p>
<dd>As you may already have concluded, these aren't really commercials made by the Republican presidential candidates. Anyone who watches politics knows that were candidates to say these things in their commercials they would be universally scorned -- especially by the press -- for doing so. They are, instead, what the networks themselves have offered us in this campaign. ABC smeared Phil Gramm. CBS bombed the Forbes flat tax. ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Bob McNamara hurled bigoted attacks at Buchanan. If we would hound candidates off the hustings for these kinds of attacks, why do we tolerate them from reporters?
<p>
<dd>These are the same networks who shake their heads and decry the corrosive negativity of politics. After the recent South Carolina debate, in which the candidates were required to respond to each other's negative ads, the networks all clucked at how unappetizing the prospect was. One wonders if they have considered how unappetizing watching their own programs can be. If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning throughout this election year, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up. 
<p>
<dd>Koppel, for his part, couldn't even leave his attacks at the low level of questioning the ancient antics of the Buchanan children. (This, from the man who said of Bill Clinton's draft-dodging thank-you letter: "if we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and thought and felt at that time would be germane.") Koppel had help from Time essayist Lance Morrow, who in his magazine likened Buchanan to Joe McCarthy -- "the driving, urgent undershadow of menace." For "Nightline," Morrow added that Buchanan's upbringing at the Blessed Sacrament Church and Gonzaga High School was marked by a "reflexive" anti-Semitism of the "they killed Christ" variety. But others who attended high school with Buchanan flatly deny this outrageous charge. You guessed it: "Nightline" ignored them. 
<p>
<dd>Liberal Boston Globe columnist Tom Oliphant has called the liberal media to account on these charges of bigotry against Buchanan, often employing guilt by association: "For liberals to be silent simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
<p>
<dd>Already, the media are preparing this story line for the 1996 general election campaign. Bill Clinton, the Great Triangulator, is trying to give the country a better tomorrow, while the Republicans, devoid of vision, have nothing to offer but cheap negative attacks.

<dd>It's important to declare that negativity has a place in any campaign in defining why one candidate deserves to be elected over his opponent. But let the candidates do that. Decency is also important. It's time the national media attempt to rise to the level of civility these Republican candidates have shown each other.

<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

<LI>In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

<LI>On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
</ul>
<hr>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
<LI>The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

<LI>While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

<LI>The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>
</ul>
In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3> 
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Two"></a>
<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>
<pre>
   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.

  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>
 
  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
   
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  


   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   


  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
   
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
   
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
  
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
   
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
   
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
  

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
  
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
   
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
  
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
   
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
   
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot; 
</Pre>

<a name="Three"</a>
<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p> 
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>  
The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>

<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<pre>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<pre>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.

<U><CENTER><a name="2flash1-6.html"> <font size="8"><I>Tell the Truth!</I> </font size="8"></A>
</B></I> </CENTER></U>
<BR>
<P>On June 5, Media Research Center Chairman Brent Bozell held a national press 
conference in Washington, D.C. to formally announce our $2.8 million<B> "Tell the 
Truth!"</B> campaign to confront and neutralize the anti-conservative bias in the media during the `96 election season.
<P>At the press conference, Bozell told reporters that surveys confirm what some in 
the media are finally admitting. "CBS's 
Bernard Goldberg said it best: `The old argument 
that the networks and other "media elites" have 
a liberal bias is so blatantly true it's hardly worth discussing 
any more.'
<P>"The MRC is not out to prove an anti-conservative bias. That argument is over," 
Bozell stated. "We want to put an end to this 
non-stop onslaught against the conservative movement. 
This campaign demands the media be fair and balanced, period," 
he continued.
<P>Media outlets covering the press conference included 
C-SPAN, CNN, CBN, Reuters, Cox, <I>The</I> <I>Washington 
Post</I>, <I>National Review</I>, <I>Chicago 
Sun-Times</I>, <I>Investor's Business 
Daily</I>, and others.
"Tell the Truth!" is the most ambitious and technologically 
advanced campaign ever devised to confront leftist media bias. 
Based on test-marketing results, we will expose left-wing media bias to an average 
of 50,000 conservative activists and 25 million voters every week. 
<I><B>The media will not get away with distortions or falsehoods this year.</B></I>
<p>
<BR>
<BR>
 <I><CENTER><font size="5">There are nine components to the campaign:</font size="5"></CENTER></I>
<P>
<BR>
<B>1. Research:</B> The cornerstone of all MRC endeavors, the campaign research will 
be compiled by our eight-member media analysis team which tapes and analyzes every 
network newscast, national newspaper, and news magazine to document trends of 
liberal bias. Using the customized MRC Media 
Tracking
 System, the "Tell the Truth!" 
campaign will show the American people <I>exactly 
</I>how the media are distorting the issues -- 
even spiking the news -- in order to promote their pro-Clinton agenda this year.
<P><B>2. Publications:</B> All of the MRC's 
monthly and bi-weekly publications -- 
<I>MediaWatch</I>, <I>MediaNomics</I>, <I>Notable 
Quotables</I>, and <I>Flash </I> -- will focus almost exclusively on the 
issuesand trends of campaign `96, giving thousands of conservative reporters, subscribers, and activists the unique and timely information which they can use as ammunition in their grassroots activism.
<P><B>3. <I>Pattern of Deception</I>:</B><I> </I>MRC 
Associate Editor Tim Graham's new blockbuster book documents the astonishing bias that has 
bolstered the Clinton presidency in the last four years, setting the stage for a national 
discussion of the media's obvious preference for this President. 
<I>Pattern of Deception</I> has already generated great interest among 
the general public, and become one of our best selling publications.
<P><B>4. Talk Radio:</B> Over the past year we 
have quietly established an informal network of over 100 radio talk shows 
-- which includes every major nationally syndicated show -- 
to provide them with up-to-the-minute evidence of left-wing bias masquerading as 
"objective news" in the establishment press. Using MRC material, talk show hosts can now educate millions of voters about the 
ongoing distortion of the "news" media every 
single day. As well, MRC spokesmen are now conducting daily interviews on these shows 
to further expose the liberal media.
<P><B>5. The Internet:</B> Using the Internet, the MRC will be communicating with 
hundreds of thousands of conservative activists 
while simultaneously providing immediate intelligence to the conservative media. The 
MRC website  <a href="http://www.mediaresearch.org">http://www.mediaresearch.org</a> is up and running for public and media 
use during the 1996 campaign, with a full slate of studies, profiles, and Special Reports. In addition, MRC Executive Director Brent Baker is providing "CyberAlerts" through E-mail several times per week to the nation's most influential opinion leaders to facilitate a rapid response to media bias.  
<P><B>6. Media Outreach:</B> Two-page &quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; rebuttals are 
being sent via &quot;blast fax&quot; to over 1,500 media and political contacts across 
the country on a regular basis. This rapid response technique, honed to 
perfection by the Clinton campaign in 1992, inundated the media with 
counterarguments and rebuttals to anything the Republicans had to say. Now we're 
using it against the leftist media.  
<P><B>7. The National Conventions:</B> During the national conventions, 
the media's left-wing agenda comes shining through. Once again, the MRC 
will be there, publishing a daily newsletter during the two parties' conventions 
to document the ongoing political slant in prime time convention coverage. 
In addition, we will be conducting interviews and press conferences to 
broadcast our findings. This year the MRC is also considering a daily national 
radio feed to provide evidence of reporters' biased coverage. This daily 
commentary will reach tens of millions of voters and activists.
<P><B>8. Conservative Grassroots Activism:</B> To make the so-called 
objective national media an issue in this campaign, the MRC is mass-producing 
and distributing hundreds of thousands of bumper stickers, pens, 
refrigerator magnets, and other novelty items with the tag line &quot;I Don't Believe the 
Liberal News Media.&quot; The national 
distribution efforts are already under way. MRC Members -- 75,000 nationwide -- 
will also participate through letter-writing campaigns and other efforts to 
expose and confront liberal bias at the local level.
<P><B>9. Paid Advertising: </B>The MRC will be advancing its efforts through a 
paid advertising campaign. Conservative newspapers, magazines, and radio 
talk shows will be the vehicles of choice for these efforts. So far the MRC 
has placed several advertisements in <I>Human 
Events</I> and the <I>Washington Times Weekly</I>, and we will be buying 
advertisements in <I>National Review</I> and 
<I>The American Spectator</I>. Funds permitting, ads will air on radio and television 
as well.<BR>

<BR>
<b><center><i><font size="5">MRC Family Hour Campaign Gets Results</font size="5"></i></center></b>
<br>
<br>
<P>The Media Research Center's campaign to bring the spirit 
          of the Family Hour back to prime time television has achieved 
national attention and impressive results. 
<P>At the end of April, the MRC organized a coalition of United States 
Senators and Representatives to issue a bi-partisan challenge to the 
television networks to voluntarily bring back the spirit of the Family Hour. 
Over 70 members of Congress signed a letter urging network 
entertainment executives to voluntarily broadcast only shows advocating 
positive family values during the first hour of prime time. The letter appeared 
as a full-page ad purchased by the MRC in the show-business newspaper 
<I>Daily Variety</I>.
<P>MRC Chairman Brent Bozell followed up with a lobbying effort 
directed at ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert asking him to renew the 
highly acclaimed family drama <I>Second Noah</I>, which debuted this past February 
and whose survival hung in the balance.The advertisement and lobbying effort had demonstrable results.
 <P>On May 20, ABC announced that <I>Second 
Noah</I> would be included on its fall schedule, to air Saturdays at 
8 p.m. EDT. Subsequently, the show's creator and executive producer, 
Pamela Long, enthusiastically thanked Bozell and the MRC, writing that 
the <I>Daily Variety</I> ad &quot;struck just the 
right chord. And Ted Harbert...heard you loud and clear.&quot;       
<P>Bozell's &quot;eloquent letter to Mr. Harbert had a definitive impact on 
the decision-making process at the network,&quot; echoed Jacqueline 
Lovejoy, the show's publicist. &quot;[His] voice 
was powerful, and it was heard.&quot;
<P>Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of New World Television, 
<I>Second Noah</I>`s production company, has also 
recognized the MRC's work on the program's behalf. Tartikoff told 
<I>Flash</I> that &quot;support by Brent Bozell and his 
joint efforts with members of Congress... not only influenced ABC's decision 
to pick up the show, but also influenced the placement of 
<I>Second Noah</I> on Saturday nights, among the best times 
for family viewing.&quot; <BR>
<center><h2><I>The Top Ten Least and Most Family Friendly Shows of 
1995-'96</I></center>
</h2>
As MRC studies have shown, while the number of youth-targeted prime time series incorporating pernicious content has increased, wholesome shows are also gaining strength. The MRC's Entertainment Division recently released its &quot;Top Ten&quot; list of the least family-friendly prime time shows, but also saluted several programs which respect and uphold traditional values.
<P>
<P><I>The Top Ten Least and Most Family Friendly Shows of 
1995-'96</I>, which has been distributed to thousands of 
journalists, is the culmination of thousands of hours of television analysis. As 
of press time, this annual season-end tally has received widespread coverage 
in several major media outlets, including <I>USA 
Today</I>,<I> The Washington Post</I>, and the<I> Los Angeles 
Times</I>. It was even mentioned on the<I> Tonight 
Show</I>. 
<h3><P><B><center>The Top Ten Worst Shows:</center></B></h3>
<P>1.<B><I>Married...with Children</B></I> (Fox) Sunday 
9:00 p.m. EST
<P>The crudest comedy on prime time television, 
<I>Married</I> routinely ridicules the family. Every 
week members of the &quot;Bundys&quot; trade insults, 
celebrate promiscuity, and revel in bathroom 
humor; this raunchfest's dialogue is peppered with 
lewd punch lines about sex, masturbation, the gay 
lifestyle, and the lead character's fondness for pornographic magazines 
and strip clubs.
<P>2. <B><I>Friends </B></I>(NBC) Thursday 8:00 
p.m. EST
<P><I>Friends</I> has not toned down its adult content 
despite the show's shift to the earlier 8 o'clock hour. 
Virtually every episode revolves around sexual themes and contains 
inappropriate language. Each of the six central characters, 
all single twentysomethings, is sexually active. 
Additionally, the sitcom promotes gay parenting and same-sex marriages as viable options.
<P>3. <B><I>Roseanne</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>Like<I> Friends, Roseanne</I>'s move to the 8:00 p.m. time slot has done 
little to mitigate the show's obnoxious content. The series' central characters 
are openly derisive of their parents; religion and the 
religious are mocked; foul language is frequent; 
premarital sex is condoned; and  gay marriage is championed.
<P>4. <B><I>Melrose Place</B></I> (Fox) Monday 
8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Melrose</I>'s randy regulars are constantly 
in and out of one another's beds, engaging in premarital and extramarital sex. 
Prime time's sexiest soap also showcases the gay lifestyle, with one gay 
character gaining a live-in lover this season.
<P>5. <B><I>A Season in Purgatory</B></I> (CBS) 
Mini-series
<P>Based on a Dominick Dunne novel, <I>Season</I> showcased members of 
a supposedly devout Catholic family promoting their faith in public 
while privately engaging in a vast array of premarital and extramarital 
affairs, rape, murder, and scandalous cover-up schemes. 
<P>6. <B><I>Central Park West</B></I> (CBS) 
Wednesday 9:00 p.m. EST (Canceled)
<P>One of the most hyped entries on last fall's schedule, 
<I>CPW</I> condoned premarital sex and adultery, 
and aired scenes containing foul language and explicitly sexual 
content. Fortunately, the acting and writing were so poor that very few viewers tuned in to its 
sordidness, and it was canceled.
<P>7. <B><I>The Dana Carvey Show</B></I> (ABC) 
Tuesday 9:30 EST (Canceled)
<P>The popular comedian shocked viewers and sponsors with 
obscenity-laden skits and extremely crude content. After many advertisers 
withdrew their support and ratings began to wane, ABC pulled the show off the air.
<P>8. <B><I>Cybill</B></I> (CBS) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Cybill</I>'s storylines frequently test the limits of decency. Dialogue is 
littered with foul language, sexual innuendo, and suggestive scenarios. 
The sitcom's regulars frequently belittle the institution of marriage. Casual sex 
-- even among teenagers -- is condoned.
<P>9. <B><I>Beverly Hills, 90210 </B></I>(Fox) 
Wednesday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>While one character has steadfastly refused to lose her virginity, 
other members of <I>90210</I>'s tanned and trendy cast have been more than happy 
to promote premarital sex as a natural -- and completely inconsequential --  
fact of college life. The teen-targeted soap sends mixed messages on drugs. 
Some protagonists deride substance abuse, but rarely do they ever address the illegality of drug use.
<P>10.<B><I> Martin</B></I> (Fox) Thursday 8:00 
p.m. EST
<P>The sex lives of the two newlywed protagonists and their single 
friends serve as fodder for the raunchy humor pervading this sitcom. Most 
of <I>Martin</I>'s episodes contain dialogue fraught with sexual references and 
obscene language.

<br>
<h3><P><B><center>The Most Family-Friendly Shows of 1995-`96:</center></h3></B>
<P>
<br>
<B><I>Touched by an Angel</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 9:00 p.m. EST
<P>One of CBS' few success stories of the season, 
<I>Touched By an Angel</I> is the most outspoken proponent of 
traditional values on the prime time schedule. The inspiring drama 
showcases God's message of unconditional love, illuminates the power of 
prayer, and promotes compassion and strengthening family ties. 
<I>Touched By an Angel</I>, almost canceled last year 
by CBS, was the fastest growing series on the network and the second 
fastest growing show on prime time during the 1995-`96 season. 
<P><B><I>Second Noah</B></I> (ABC) Saturday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>This mid-season replacement about a novelist, his veterinarian 
wife, and their eight adopted children is one of prime time's most 
pro-family offerings. Storylines depict respect for parental authority as the key to 
a strong family unit, and advocate premarital chastity, individual 
responsibility, and faith.
<P><B><I>Kirk</B></I> (WB) Sunday 8:30 p.m. EST
<P>The cornerstone of WB's family-friendly line-up, every episode 
of <I>Kirk</I> reiterates the importance of family. The title character, a 
young man suddenly charged with the upbringing of his three younger 
siblings, willingly makes many personal sacrifices to ensure 
that the children are receiving a sound moral upbringing. The show 
imparts the merits of hard work, faith, patience, and taking 
responsibility for one's actions.
<P>   <BR>
<B><I>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</B></I> (CBS) 
Saturday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Dr. Quinn</I>'s promotion of family values has 
endeared it to audiences of all ages. Marriage and 
family are staunchly promoted, as are honesty, compassion, and 
respect for parental authority. The drama boasts one of 
prime time's most positive clerics, &quot;the Reverend.&quot; A 
series regular, he is depicted as an intelligent, 
caring, and dedicated member of the community.
<P><B><I>Home Improvement</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday  9:00 p.m. EST
<P>This popular sitcom remains a reliable family staple. Focusing 
primarily on the relationships between a cable TV host, his wife, and their 
children, <I>Home Improvement</I> has taught valuable lessons about teenage 
drinking, honesty, respect, and the importance of education. One of prime 
time's foremost advocates of the institution of marriage, the show frequently addresses the 
challenges faced by the husband and wife and the 
steps they take toward strengthening their relationship. 
<P><B><I>Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of 
Superman</B></I> (ABC) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Lois &amp; Clark</I> abandoned the suggestive 
dialogue and sexual references of its 1993-'94 inaugural season, and, 
in the words of series star Teri Hatcher, is now &quot;the family show 
to watch.&quot; The show's cleverly scripted storylines prove that 
television needn't appeal to the lowest common denominator to provide 
quality entertainment. Dialogue and fast-paced action sequences are free 
of offensive language and sexual innuendo, and the newly engaged 
protagonists promote premarital chastity.
<P><B><I>The Parent `Hood</B></I> (WB) Sunday 7:30 p.m. EST
<P>Another winning offering from WB, <I>The Parent 
`Hood'</I>s central characters provide positive 
role models for viewers of all ages. The happily married black 
couple, both successful professionals, teach their children 
that education, self-discipline and integrity are keys to 
success. The positive impact of a father in the household, 
family loyalty, and postponing sex until marriage are 
also underscored.

<h2><center>MRC CyberAlerts Conservative Journalists</center></h2>
<P></B><BR>
<P>In response to the growing demand for MRC research, we are using 
state-of-the-art technology to reach conservative leaders instantaneously. Several 
          times a week MRC Executive Director Brent Baker sends &quot;CyberAlert&quot; 
messages via electronic mail to a network of talk radio hosts and key 
conservative leaders in the media. 
<P>Each conservative journalist receives the latest intelligence on the leftist 
media. CyberAlerts' subjects have included the findings from the recent 
Roper Center poll for the Freedom Forum, which showed that 89 percent of 
Washington journalists voted for Clinton, and that only 2 percent considered 
themselves conservative. 
<P>The CyberAlert membership list has grown to include heavy hitters like 
talk show hosts <B>G. Gordon Liddy</B> (nationally syndicated), 
<B>Neal Boortz</B> (WSB, Atlanta), <B>David 
Brudnoy</B> (WBZ, Boston), <B>Mark Davis</B> (WBAP, Fort Worth), 
<B>Jim Eason</B> (KGO, San Francisco), <B>David 
Gold</B> (KLIF, Dallas), <B>Jason Lewis</B> (KSTP, St. 
 Paul), <B>Jan Mickelson</B> (WHO, Des Moines), 
<B>Wes Minter</B> (KCMO, Kansas City), <B>Mike 
Rosen</B> (KOA, Denver), and <B>Barry Young</B> (KFYI, Phoenix). Newspaper 
columnists like <B>Evan Gahr</B> from the <I>New York 
Post</I>, <B>Dick Williams </B>from the <I>Atlanta 
Journal</I>, <B>Don Feder</B> from the <I>Boston 
Herald</I>; and nationally syndicated columnists 
<B>Cal Thomas</B> and <B>Arianna Huffington</B> also use these alerts in 
their stories. Others receiving CyberAlerts include 
<I>The American Spectator</I>'s Editor-in-Chief  
<B>R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr.</B>, and Executive Editor 
<B>Wladyslaw Pleszczynski</B>; <B>Tony Snow</B> from 
<I>Fox News Sunday</I>; and <B>Fred Barnes</B>, the Executive 
Editor of <I>The</I> <I>Weekly Standard</I>.
<P>Overnight these CyberAlerts have become an essential tool for 
conservatives in the media fighting the blatant liberal bias that pervades the mainstream 
media. <br>
<p>
<br>
<b><i><center>And here's some feedback we've received from our CyberAlerts:</center></i></b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<P>Today's &quot;Media Reality Check&quot; is unbelievably 
<U>great</U> (did it on my radio show). 
You're doing great work.
You were great on Rush , too.
<blockquote>-- A personal note from Mary Matalin, CBS radio talk    
 show host.</blockquote>
<p>
 "As always you are doing a simply superb and bang-up job! I use your material on my show almost every day. Needless to say, your daily updates are 
excellent...&quot; <blockquote>-- Barry Young at KFYI in Phoenix.</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;Thanks...these things are great.&quot; <blockquote>-- Doug Kellett at 
WRCG in Columbus, Georgia.</blockquote>
<P>&quot;You're sending great stuff. Could you add 
<I>World</I>'s Managing Editor Nick Eicher to your distribution list?&quot;  
 <blockquote>-- Marvin Olasky, Editor of <I>World</I> magazine.</blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Vice President Dan Quayle was very intrigued about the 
press' coverage of the Israeli election. He may 
write his weekly column on this subject next week. Do you have 
any more information?&quot; <blockquote>-- Brad Newby from the office of Dan Quayle.</blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Thanks always, for the terrific job and resource you're providing.&quot; 
<blockquote>-- Wes Minter at KCMO, in Kansas City.</blockquote>   
<P>&quot;You're doing a fabulous job! Keep up the 
pressure.&quot; <blockquote>-- Cal Thomas, syndicated columnist.</blockquote>
<P>&quot;I think this fax and E-mail system will spread your 
message more quickly and effectively. Speaking of that, could you add 
my TV colleague, Bill Shipp to your list? [He] now lives in 
Newt's district, puts out a newsletter, and sends his very 
conservative column to 43 newspapers in Georgia.&quot; 
 <blockquote>-- Dick Williams.</blockquote>

<p><br><br>
<h2><B><center>MRC Editor on Entitlement Reform</center></B></h2>
<P>Did you know that if Social Security and Medicare are not reformed, future generations may face tax rates as high as 84 
percent? Or that more young people believe in UFOs than believe they 
will ever get any money from Social Security? You may not have known 
of these unpleasant facts because no one in the media reports them.
<P>But entitlement reform is becoming an increasingly important issue 
in conservative circles, and the MRC is part of the dialogue. Recently 
Tim Lamer, director of the MRC's Free Market Project, participated in a 
panel discussion hosted by the Heritage Foundation's Third Generation 
Program, a series of lectures for young conservatives. Representatives from the Cato Institute and the 
Heritage Foundation also served on the panel while many young conservatives 
from various think tanks and Capitol Hill attended 
the discussion.
<P>All four panelists reflected on why, with the 
impending retirement of the Baby Boom generation, 
entitlement reform is the most important econ-omic 
issue facing young people. Lamer addressed why reforming these programs should be a major concern for all wings of 
the conservative movement and how the movement can bring media 
attention to bear on the issue.<BR>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2><B><center>Broader Project Replaces FEMI</center></b></h2>

In order to reflect its new, broad-
      ened focus, the MRC's Free 
      Enterprise &amp; Media Institute (FEMI) has changed its name to 
the <B>Free Market Project</B>.
<P>Beginning this year, the Free Market Project is undertaking 
joint projects with other conservative public policy or business organizations 
to help them educate reporters about their particular concerns. 
Currently, the Free Market Project is engaged in a joint project with Consumer Alert, 
the free-market consumer group, to study how popular consumer 
publications cover business and free enterprise. These projects give the 
conservative movement and the business community the scientific research they need 
to educate the media regarding their biases, and to confront them directly 
if necessary.
<P>In addition to the new joint projects, the Free Market Project 
will continue to publish the newsletter 
<I>MediaNomics</I> on a monthly basis, and FEMI's Quarterly Breakfast Forums, 
designed to educate the media about free enterprise issues, will continue 
to be held every few months.

<p>

On May 28, millions 
          of Americans 
          learned exactly how the left-wing press 
are distorting the news thanks to Media Research 
Center Chairman Brent Bozell's stint as guest host of 
Rush Limbaugh's nationally syndicated radio show, 
the most popular program in history. 
<P>Bozell briefed the audience (over 20 million 
listeners, cumulatively) not only on the leftist political 
slant in the news media, but on the cultural war being 
waged in Hollywood as well.
<P>During the show's second hour, Bozell interviewed Hollywood 
legend and fellow conservative activist Charlton Heston, 
who has done more than any other Hollywood figure, aside from Ronald Reagan, to help elect 
conservatives while advancing our cause. Heston is currently 
raising money for the newly formed Arena PAC, 
which was created to elect conservative candidates to 
federal office and to mobilize conservatives in the 
entertainment industry.
<P>One of the highlights of the final hour of the 
radio show was an interview with Republican National 
Committee Chairman Haley Barbour. In addition to addressing the liberal 
media's effect on politics and American culture, 
Bozell asked Barbour what conservatives should do to 
further their ideas and programs. &quot;You have to 
understand that you can't rely on the mainstream media,&quot; 
replied the RNC Chairman. &quot;One of the reasons talk radio 
has exploded in popularity in this country in recent 
years, is that people see that the media elites are liberal, 
and they come at things from their perspective and 
people are looking for another source.&quot; 
<P>Bozell later offered his insights on the 
current campaigns, giving this advice to Dole and other 
conservatives: &quot; They ought to be distinguishing 
themselves from the Democrats. They ought to be 
playing hardball politics with the Democrats. They've got 
the truth on their side. They ought to stop reading 
the <I>Washington Post </I>and listening to the networks 
and thinking that they reflect reality. They ought to 
listen to the voters out there. Look at the surveys -- 
the surveys are all on their side.&quot;
<P>Limbaugh has asked Bozell to return as a guest to discuss the media's 
left-wing agenda -- a welcome invitation given that 
such exposure would normally cost millions of dollars 
if purchased as advertising time.

How can David Kessler say he leaves the Food and Drug Administration with his objectives accomplished when someone, somewhere, is still enjoying himself?
<P>
<hr>
<P>
Get ready to see hordes of starving children on the screen, if not the streets. Liberals are gearing up to ``fix'' the welfare bill passed this summer. They want to let noncitizens (and, in their more fanciful moments, single men under 50 who don't work) collect food stamps. Similarly, they want to ease eligibility rules for noncitizens seeking Supplemental Security Income -- currently the fastest-growing welfare program. All told, they would snatch back $13 billion of the $55 billion the welfare bill saved. The First Lady wants to lead this charge. Sounds good to us; maybe she can bring back Ira Magaziner to assist. Republicans in Congress should be looking forward to fighting on this territory. But the liberals are right on one point: the welfare bill <I>should</I> be revisited. Work requirements should be strengthened; under the law only a quarter of recipients have to work by 2002. Medicaid should be cut and block-granted to the states. And the Legal Services Corporation should be prohibited from using federal funds to challenge welfare reform -- or to do anything else, for that matter.
<P>

From the <I>Washington Post</I>: ``President Clinton faces a choice as he returns this week to the business of staffing his Administration for a second term: He will either make history by appointing a woman to one of the two spots on his national-security team, or risk sorely disappointing many of the very voters who provided his margin of victory in last month's election'' (John J. Harris, Dec. 3). Does that mean Mary Landrieu has to staff her Senate office with dead black people?
<P>
<hr>
<P>


Resigning FDA Commissioner David Kessler claims to have been asked by the Clinton Administration to stay on, but that seems unlikely, in view of his recently revealed cheating on job-related travel expenses. According to the published accounts of <I>l'affaire</I> Kessler, he has virtually admitted the misdeeds -- falsifying travel vouchers, double-billing travel expenses and the like -- by returning money to the government. Clearly this commissioner needed a warning label. The most-often-mentioned candidate to replace him is Lynn Goldman, now Assistant Administrator for Pesticides and Toxic Substances at the Environmental Protection Agency. A solid Clinton choice: she's scientifically challenged, has conducted a virtual war on innovation in the biotechnology and pesticide industries, and presides over an organization known for chaotic incompetence (it recently lost two hundred files containing industrial trade secrets). The good news is that she should be unconfirmable by the Republican-controlled Senate.

A devastating front-page headline in the November 18 <I>Washington Post</I> shattered the illusions of the bi-partisan Beltway Establishment: ``IMMIGRATION ISSUES AWAIT NEW CONGRESS: Surging Legal Influx Will Be among Topics of Renewed Debate.'' Rushing to restore these illusions in a December 2 letter to the Editor: Stuart Anderson (alas) of the Cato Institute (alack). Anderson's claim: the current increase (to about one million in 1996) somehow doesn't count, because it's due to the fact that the three million-odd beneficiaries of the 1986 amnesty are now becoming citizens and sponsoring their relatives. Unmentioned corollary to Anderson's claim: eventually this new immigration boom will produce another boom, as these sponsored relatives get to sponsor their own relatives. Unindicted culprit: the misnamed ``family reunification'' principle, which treats immigration as a civil right extended to a randomly selected class of foreigners -- the relatives of recent immigrants -- and divorces it from any American interest. In fact, no serious analyst denies that the 1990s will see record immigration, probably in excess of ten million, bringing with it everything from overcrowded schools to female circumcision. Immigration enthusiasts are committed to a policy that brings them into increasingly desperate conflict with the facts, and common sense.

<P>

As Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee in the last Congress, Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) led the unsuccessful Senate fight to reduce legal-immigration levels. Simpson's retirement means that the torch must be passed to a successor. Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.), who firmly supported moderate cuts in immigration, has seniority on the subcommittee, and so the chairmanship is his if he wants it. But Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.), the man most responsible for killing reform of legal immigration in the Senate last year, has been lobbying for the position. While <I>NR</I> admires Sen. Abraham and supports him on most issues (indeed, <I>NR</I> backed him for Chairman of the Republican National Committee four years ago), his misguided views on immigration have consequences too grave to be ignored. <I>NR</I> hopes that Kyl, who understands the urgent need for immigration reform, will take the chairmanship. If he doesn't, appointing Abraham would continue an immigration policy utterly disconnected from our national interests. It would also represent contempt for rank-and-file Republicans, who in an RNC survey supported lower levels of immigration by overwhelming margins. If their views are to be so casually ignored, the RNC should feel the pinch in its next fund appeal. 

<P>
<hr>
<P>

Meanwhile, Haley Barbour's successor as RNC Chairman will be chosen by the RNC's 165 voting members at next month's winter meeting. There is no clear frontrunner among the current candidates, who include RNC General Counsel David Norcross of New Jersey, ex-RNC Co-Chairman Jeanie Austin of Florida, Chuck Yob of Michigan, and Bob Bennett of Ohio. Former New Hampshire Gov. Steve Merrill has also entered the race. Committee conservatives haven't endorsed a candidate but there is no doubt who would be unacceptable to them. National Committeeman Morton Blackwell sees Jeanie Austin as ``actively hostile to traditional conservatives'' and says, `` David Norcross's principal credential is that he has always done exactly what he has been told to do.'' Conservatives hope that Texas GOP Chairman Tom Pauken will join the field. In an ideal world a principled conservative like Pauken, with a thirty-year record of commitment to the movement, would win by acclamation. But until the party's establishment is as conservative as its grassroots, Pauken's supporters can only hope to form a coalition to ensure that a candidate not openly hostile to traditional conservatives wins. Applications from other conservative heavyweights would be welcome. (Confidential to Vin Weber -- now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.)

The FBI announced that it would investigate contributors to the Democratic National Committee for ``potential criminal misconduct.'' Coming soon to a T-shirt near you: ``I sent a huge check to the Democrats and all I got was a lousy subpoena.''

Turnabout is more than fair play -- sometimes it's positively therapeutic. Now that the Clinton Administration is feeling the lash of the independent-counsel law (latest installment: the Landmark Legal Foundation calls for an independent counsel to investigate Vice President Gore's Buddhist temple fundraising) liberals and Democrats are beginning to question its wisdom. They are right, if tardy. The statute turns political battles, which would be best decided by the public, into legal disputes resolved by grand juries. And it has always been a constitutional bastard, an invention of congressional Democrats to increase their leverage over the Executive Branch. The law expires in 1999, at which point it should be left for dead. Until then, however, Democrats, like Frankenstein, must live with their creation.

For the last five years Bill Clinton has labeled Presidents Reagan and Bush the ``free lunch crowd'' -- the people who ran up the national debt by more than $3 trillion. And for nearly a decade Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia -- pork-barreler extraordinaire -- has proclaimed that the budgets passed by Congress in the 1980s spent less money than the Reagan Administration requested. Byrd and his colleagues were allegedly the tightwads, Ronald Reagan the big spender. A new report by the Institute for Policy Innovation in Lewisville, Texas, entitled, ``Whose Free Lunch? The Truth about the Reagan Deficits,'' balances the books: Reagan's budget requests were lower in every single year that he submitted a budget than the actual amount Congress spent. The total excess spending by Congress over those years was $209 billion. Congress spent $80 billion less than requested on national defense in fiscal years 1982 - 89, but $300 billion more on domestic programs -- mostly entitlements. Yes, we would still have had large budget deficits in the 1980s even if all Reagan's budget requests had been enacted. But those deficits would have been about $25 billion a year <I>lower</I> than the red ink Congress actually spilled. Footnote: the IPI study also shows that every President since Gerald Ford has wanted to spend less money than Congress has. Except for one: Bill Clinton.

Russia's General Aleksandr Lebed paid his first visit to the U.S. in mid November, seeing senior State, Pentagon, and NSC officials and wowing policy wonks in New York and Washington. He was charismatic, articulate, candid -- and shrewd in the moderate impression he fostered. He was eager for good relations with the U.S., he said; Americans and Russians have so much in common (unlike the Europeans). He claimed to be relaxed about NATO enlargement and uninterested in reintegration of the former Soviet republics (``Russia is tired of being the cow that everyone milks'') -- the two usual hobby horses of Russian nationalists. He dined with the Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian ambassadors and pledged his respect for their independence. Lebed's preoccupations are clearly domestic -- restoring the dignity of the army; purging the kleptocracy that runs the country; freeing up the economy by reducing government interference. He is a nationalist, devoted to restoring Russia's glory, and a  force. While he avowed his loyalty to Boris Yeltsin, he seems capable of filling any vacuum that should appear. Whether he is ultimately a threat to the West remains to be seen, but he is clearly a more complex -- and perhaps more formidable -- phenomenon than he was originally perceived to be, by <I>NR</I> among others.

Hillary Rodham Clinton stirred up the social scene Down Under, according to the <I>Sydney Morning Herald</I>. Invited to a glitzy reception, she was ``so dissatisfied'' with the guest list that she arranged to have several prominent leftists crash the private party. She explained that she had an important speech to make and wanted somebody there who could ``appreciate'' it, as, presumably, the hostess and the invited guests could not. And Americans think Australians are rude and crude.

Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are the 18-year-old college freshmen who went to a motel in Delaware so that Amy could give birth to their child, whom they then tossed in a dumpster, where he was found, dead, the next day. The pair have been charged with first-degree murder, which could carry the death penalty. But why is what  they did so much more heinous than what a doctor might have done a few hours earlier, in a partial-birth abortion? The best line on this ugly affair belongs to George Will. ``Could Delaware choose to execute the two by inserting scissors into the bases of their skulls, opening the scissors, inserting suction tubes, and sucking out their brains? Of course not. The Constitution forbids choosing cruel and unusual punishments.''

The Oakland, California, Board of Education is looking into the claims of the Task Force on the Education of African-American Students that ``most black students need to be classified as bilingual'' because they speak Ebonics.

For several years Joseph Epstein, one of the finest essayists of our time, has been a bone in the throat of the academic establishment. At last they have managed to get rid of him as editor of <I>American Scholar</I>, the quarterly journal of the Phi Beta Kappa society. He had edited that magazine without partisanship, and his own regular essays had been a principal reason for reading it. He despised Victimology, the current academic religion, which earned him the hatred of such usual suspects as the novelist Joyce Carol Oates and feminist Rutgers dean Catherine Stimson. The war against Epstein was conducted on the op-ed page of the <I>New York Times</I> and on the academic grapevine. As Baudelaire remarked to Manet, ``You have the honor of being hated.'' The name of the journal <I>American Scholar</I> recalls Emerson's August 31, 1837, address, which became one of his major essays. Emerson attacked the complacency of the Harvard intelligentsia of his day, and spoke sternly of independence of mind as the duty of the American scholar. Joseph Epstein will continue to write in that spirit, even though he has been fired by a gang of conformist philistines.

<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT><font size=+1>OR</font>  the first time in 36 years, there is nobody in line for the next Republican presidential nomination. In fact, nobody has stepped up to become the clear political leader of the conservative movement since Ronald Reagan left the White House.
<P>
But these are not dismal tidings for conservatism. The Right has impressive bench strength -- new figures without national reputations and unlikely to be presidential contenders in 2000, but effective and principled potential leaders for the future.
<P>
At the suggestion of <I>NR</I>'s editors, I have selected five conservatives to keep an eye on. Since their selection is nothing if not arbitrary, I set four arbitrary rules for picking them.
<P>
1) No household names; they must not be people widely recognized. 2) No noble losers, but rather people who win elections. 3) No moderates; bona fide conservatives only. 4) No political correctness mandating diversity (which regrettably ends up with no women on the bench).
<P>
Michigan Gov. John Engler, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, and Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft have been around a shade too long to qualify. Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson are attractive and effective, but the conservatism of each has yet to be proved. George's brother Jeb is surely conservative enough; both he and Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith would qualify had they not lost races for governor, in Florida and Indiana, respectively.
<P>
Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, Michigan Sen. Spence Abraham, and Oklahoma Reps. Steve Largent and J. C. Watts were just nosed out by these five:
<P>
Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas; University of California Regent Ward Connerly; California Attorney General Dan Lungren; Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania; Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana.
<P>
And here is a ``junior varsity'' of promising conservatives at state and local levels:
<P>
Raleigh (N.C.) Mayor Tom Fetzer; Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher; Colorado State Treasurer Bill Owens; Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate; Illinois State Sen. Steve Rauschenberger.
<P>
<b>Sam Brownback, 40, Garnett, Kan.:</b> Thanks to Robert J. Dole's resignation, Brownback became the first of the famous House freshman class of 1994 to advance to the Senate.
<P>
The road was not easy. Kansas may have been the most consistently Republican state over the past generation, but it did not send movement conservatives to Washington -- until Sam Brownback.
<P>
A farmboy turned lawyer, Brownback served for six years as secretary of the Kansas Board of Agriculture and as a White House fellow in 1990 - 91 -- long enough to convince him the Federal Government is much too big.
<P>
His 1994 run for Congress, his first attempt at elective office, was against Democrat John Carlin, a former two-term governor. Embracing the Contract with America, Brownback won 66 per cent of the vote and carried every county in his district.
<P>
Brownback ignored Sam Rayburn's advice that House newcomers should be seldom seen and never heard. He quickly formed the New Federalists, 14 rookie Republicans dedicated to slashing government.
<P>
By the time Dole resigned from the Senate this June, Brownback had become disillusioned with House Republican leadership. He now had a shot at a Senate seat in a new kind of Senate -- with Trent Lott as Majority Leader and conservatives such as himself replacing the Doles and the Hatfields.
<P>
But first he had to face what he calls ``The Machine'' -- the Kansas Republican establishment. Gov. Bill Graves, a moderate, pro-choice Republican, filled the Dole vacancy by naming his lieutenant governor, Sheila Frahm, a dependable organization politician who is pro-choice and anti-term-limits, and who refused to sign a federal no-tax-increase pledge.
<P>
Mrs. Frahm began the primary campaign with a huge lead over Brownback. But Brownback, strongly supported by religious conservatives, tapped voters newly converted to the Republican Party and won -- easily.
<P>
Next he faced a formidable opponent with the most prestigious Democratic name in Kansas: Jill Docking, who ran as a fiscally conservative businesswoman appealing to establishment Republicans who were turned off by Brownback's support from the Religious Right.
<P>
When Mrs. Docking led in some polls, a number of political reporters were prepared to deplore the Republican folly of losing a safe seat by turning to an extremist. But Brownback won -- again, easily. Kansas has its first bona fide conservative senator in four decades.
<P>
<b>Ward Connerly, 57, Sacramento, Calif.:</b> Connerly is in a different category from the others. Although he is undoubtedly a Republican and a conservative, whether he will be a national leader is a matter of considerable doubt.
<P>
The doubt does not stem from Connerly's appeal. This black businessman awed conservatives with his courage and eloquence in leading the fight for the California Civil Rights Initiative. The question is whether, having experienced the rancid swamps of politics, he wants to get in any deeper.
<P>
Connerly, born in rural poverty in Louisiana, became a Republican 28 years ago. He was working for the California state housing department when he was lured away to become chief consultant to a new State Assembly Committee on Urban Affairs by its chairman, a liberal Republican named Pete Wilson.
<P>
Following Wilson's advice, Connerly later went into the private sector to forge a successful career as a land consultant. He declined a full-time position in Gov. Wilson's administration, but he did accept a 12-year term as a University of California Regent.
<P>
From that normally obscure base, he led the way in rolling back race and gender preferences in the giant university system. Next came his leadership in the turbulent battle for passage of CCRI. In its course, he was vilified by black leaders (one advertisement depicted him as a robed Klansman) and given the cold shoulder by corporate leaders fearful of upsetting the status quo.
<P>
That experience has led Connerly to reject appeals to run against liberal Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer next election, and indeed to say he will never again enter the political arena. But he is expected to continue his fight for an even playing field.
<p>
<B>Daniel E. Lungren, 49, Sacramento, Calif.:</B> Articulate, handsome, Catholic, a proven vote-getter, and a native Californian, Lungren is a presidential candidate of the future -- but only if elected governor in 1998. That would mark the fifth straight successful Republican campaign for governor, but the first time an arguably legitimate conservative had been elected since 1970.
<P>
Lungren is pro-life, a supply-sider, and tough on crime and immigration. His position in the California GOP was underlined at the party's platform-committee proceedings in San Diego last summer. While Lungren was inside drafting a socially conservative platform, Pete Wilson was outside in a press conference denouncing it.
<P>
Lungren spent five terms (1979 - 88) in Congress, where he became a leader on crime and immigration legislation. So well was he regarded by former colleagues that he was pushed by Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey to be Dole's running-mate.
<P>
He had joined with Gingrich to form the ``Conservative Opportunity Society,'' and was among those who sought to oust Bob Michel as Republican minority leader in 1980. But by 1984, Michel had tapped him to manage the Republican anti-crime legislation.
<P>
Lungren left Congress in 1988 to accept appointment as state treasurer but was rejected by the Democratic-controlled State Senate. However, in 1990 he was elected state attorney general, and he was re-elected in 1994 with a 4.4-million-vote landslide.
<P>
<b>Rick Santorum, 38, Pittsburgh, Pa.:</b> He is the first genuinely conservative Republican senator from Pennsylvania in half a century and a rising star in the Senate. At a time of Republican - conservative decline in the Northeast, Santorum swims against the tide.
<P>
After four years with a law firm in Pittsburgh, this second-generation Italian - American ran for Congress in 1990 against a seven-term Democrat. Santorum was outspent nearly 3 to 1, but knocked on 25,000 doors promising reform and change. He barely won.
<P>
He was one of the ``Gang of Seven'' freshman Republicans who exposed the House Bank scandal -- a foundation of the 1994 GOP takeover of the House. But by that time Santorum was running for the Senate against Sen. Harris Wofford, the national Democratic poster boy after his 1991 upset win.
<P>
Santorum, strongly supported by religious conservatives, did everything a candidate is not supposed to do in the Northeast. He was pro-life, challenged Wofford on health care, and opposed gun control. He barely won.
<P>
Once in the Senate as its youngest member, he did not hold his tongue. On the Balanced Budget Amendment, he challenged the venerable Sen. Robert Byrd in floor debate, and he called for Sen. Mark Hatfield to step down as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee after Hatfield cast the decisive vote against the amendment.
<P>
Asked in early 1995 to name the most outstanding new GOP senators, Trent Lott mentioned Santorum first. Now, Santorum is a trusted personal lieutenant of the new Majority Leader in the new activist Senate.
<P>
<b>W. J. (Billy) Tauzin, 53, Thibodaux, La.:</b> A House member for 16 years, he is an infant in Republican years. He began the 104th Congress saying he would stay a Democrat ``for now,'' but that did not turn out to be too long. His walk across the aisle was signaled when he subscribed to all ten items in the Contract with America.
<P>
As a Democrat, he fought for private-property rights, with demands for compensation of citizens deprived of their property by government action. That often put him on a collision course with the imperious House Commerce Committee chairman, John Dingell.
<P>
Tauzin was elected to Congress nine times as a Democrat, closely allied with Louisiana's notorious former governor, Edwin Edwards. Yet last summer, he was selected to deliver the keynote address to the GOP platform committee by its chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde. Concerned by reports that the platform writers were getting wobbly, Tauzin urged the committee to hold firm.
<P>
He had been expected to run for the Senate in 1996 but stayed in the House instead, earning his tenth term without opposition -- the first time that has ever happened to a party-switcher. He is an integral part of the Republican inner circle, representing the migration of conservative Democrats in the Deep South to the GOP.
<P>
Now, here are five conservatives to watch at the state and local levels:
<P>
<I>Tom Fetzer, 41, Raleigh, N.C.:</I> A former staffer for Republican Gov. Jim Martin, he was the upset winner in the 1993 non-partisan elections in a city considered a Democratic bastion. As mayor, he has cut taxes and personnel.
<P> 
<I>Mike Fisher, 52, Pittsburgh, Pa.:</I> A veteran state legislator, Fisher bucked the 1996 Clinton tide in Pennsylvania to eke out a victory for attorney general. A law-and-order conservative, he owes his victory to support from religious conservatives assailed by the state's senior senator, Republican Arlen Specter.
<P>
<I>Bill Owens, 46, Aurora, Colo.:</I> A businessman/state legislator, Owens was elected to his first full-time government post as state treasurer in 1994. He champions taxpayers and private enterprise. His eight visits to Russia, including a 1995 stint as an election observer, suggest he has more on his mind than Colorado state investments.
<P>
<I>Paul Pate, 38, Marion, Iowa:</I> Owner and operator of a paving and construction company, Pate served six years in the State Senate before his election as secretary of state in 1994. He has pressed for deregulation of business and is the hope of Iowa conservatives for governor in 1998.
<P>
<I>Steven J. Rauschenberger, 40, Elgin, Ill.:</I> A furniture retailer, he was elected to the State Senate in 1992 and is now chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He has specialized in tax relief and welfare reform and is a prospect for the future in a state where conservatives have fared poorly the past two decades.

<H2>The California Marijuana Vote</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 15<br>







The vote in California (forgetting, for the moment, the startling vote in Arizona) on the marijuana question mobilizes opponents on divers grounds. 
<P>
Proposition 215, voted in by a heavy majority (56 per cent), imposes new laws respecting marijuana. It is probably unsafe to say that the law was ``designed'' to make marijuana available to sick people whose doctors recommended it as a tranquilizer or stomach settler, or whatever. Unsafe, because it is entirely possible that something else was intended by the voters, namely general judicial relief. Proposition 215 is as indefinite in the authority given to doctors to authorize marijuana as <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I> turned out to be to doctors who recommend abortion ``for the safety of the mother.''
<P>
Dazed opponents of 215 are prepared to fight on several fronts. The excitable California attorney general, Dan Lungren, has sent out the word that 215 is to be interpreted very strictly as something a doctor has to recommend on a case-by-case basis. Some opponents are citing federal laws. There is one such against the use of marijuana, and no doubt there will be a legal battle over the question. If so, we will hear from the solicitor general that although individual states may decide whether the sale of alcohol is legal, the Federal Government exercises preemptive rights when marijuana is at issue.
<P>
The California Medical Association has received 215 as a mandate to the National Institutes of Health to grow up. Many California voters were presumably soured into voting Yes by the notorious decision of the NIH a year or so ago to refuse to conduct studies on the medical value of smoked marijuana on the grounds that to do so would require experimentation on live people. Such was the reasoning, up until not so long ago, of some theologians, who stood in the way of men seeking to ascertain whether they were fertile on the grounds that to produce examinable semen would require masturbation. In fact, likely findings from the NIH could hardly confute the direct evidence of hundreds of witnesses to the effectiveness of marijuana in certain circumstances as a palliative. The Food and Drug Administration approved the active ingredient in marijuana (THC) years ago, to counteract the wasting effect of cancer. ``But,'' the <I>Orange County Register</I> reminds us, ``it's legally available only in pill form, which is criticized as expensive and of little help to patients too nauseated to swallow.'' It isn't likely that any judge in California will find means of freezing Proposition 215 until the NIH comes in with its finding. 
<P>
Mourners over the success of 215 point out that opponents were vastly outspent. Yes, but we are talking nickels and dimes. Supporters of the reform raised $1.8 million, which in California politics is barely enough to squeeze in your middle initial. Opponents spent $28,000. But the plebiscite was noticed primarily by attention given to it in editorial and news coverage. You don't need a lot of paid time to advertise a conclusion a) that people who are sick and are helped by marijuana should be free to take it; and b) (if only indirectly) that it is time to say no to the Narcs who want to arrest and imprison anyone who uses the stuff.
<P> 
It was so also in Arizona, where Proposition 200, the Drug Medicalization, Prevention, and Control Act, won 65 per cent of the vote. It says that Arizona's doctors can prescribe marijuana, heroin, and LSD for patients when there is ``medicinal value.'' The proposition goes further, giving grounds to free some thousand prisoners provided that their only crime was drug possession. It eliminates criminal penalties for first-timers caught with small amounts of drugs, so long as they were not involved in violence (simultaneously, Proposition 200 stiffened penalties for violent crimes done under the influence of drugs).
<P>
At moments like this one really has to cheer the federal system. Ten years from now one should have the data with which soberly to assess the difference between life and health and justice in California under the new law and, say, New York under the old law. It is vital for those who welcome Proposition 215 to bear in mind that effectively eliminating the legal penalty against nonchalant pot is no reason to abandon educational warnings against its use, and medical warnings against its abuse.

Of course there's a mandate from the election, all the poohbahs of punditry tell us: for campaign-finance reform. There are just a couple of problems with this notion. 1) Voters don't care about finance reform, as they proved once again by handily re-electing Sen. Mitchell McConnell (R., Ky.), who regularly kills reform bills (and is promising to do so again this year). 2) The Democratic National Committee shenanigans that sparked the latest calls for reform are <I>already</I> illegal. What advocates of reform like Bill Bradley and the <I>New York Times</I> really want is a stifled public debate in which their voices will have less competition from grubby special interests like, say, small businesses, homeowners, political parties, etc. Their favorite vehicle is the bi-partisan McCain - Feingold bill, which would ban PACs, eliminate issues advocacy (e.g., Christian Coalition voter guides), and impose ``voluntary'' spending limits on Senate campaigns. Huge chunks of the bill are plainly unconstitutional. And its effect would be to shut out ordinary citizens -- who band together in groups like the National Right to Life PAC to increase their clout -- from the political process. Senator McConnell, over to you.

An AP poll conducted between October 18 and 22 asked six questions, one of them being whether Republican actions on cutting taxes, balancing the budget, reforming welfare, and shifting power from Washington to the states had gone too far, struck the right balance, or not gone far enough. Responses were as follows: 24 per cent, gone too far; 15 per cent, struck the right balance; 46 per cent, not gone far enough. In the AP summary report, the results of this question alone were (predictably?) excluded.

New Hampshire, the Granite State, has long been, well, a rock and a stronghold of a certain kind of conservatism, and so, on election night, the question was widely asked, ``What is happening to New Hampshire?'' For the first time in a quarter-century a Democrat, Jeanne Shaheen, had won the governorship, and a Democrat, Dick Swett, was erroneously projected by the TV networks as upsetting incumbent Republican conservative Sen. Bob Smith. In fact, Smith won, and New Hampshire retains two conservative senators (Smith and Judd Gregg) and two conservative representatives (Charles Bass and John Sununu Jr.). Yes, Clinton beat Dole. But Dole has never, ever won in New Hampshire. He had lost primaries to Reagan, Bush, and even Buchanan. Then he lost to Clinton. The gubernatorial race is instructive. Jeanne Shaheen ran as a conservative, taking the ``pledge'' not to try to introduce a state income or state sales tax. New Hampshire remains conservative, with a strong libertarian streak.

When the Supreme Court, in <I>Bush</I> v. <I>Vera</I> and <I>Shaw</I> v. <I>Hunt</I>, declared racially gerrymandered congressional districts unconstitutional, Jesse Jackson screamed, ``Ethnic cleansing!'' America is so racist, went the Jackson logic, that black congressmen would lose their seats if forced to run in predominantly white districts. When Abigail Thernstrom of the Manhattan Institute dissented, liberals assailed her suggestion that we should have a color-blind society as further evidence of bigotry. Mrs. Thernstrom was vindicated on November 5, when all five black representatives who sought re-election in new, white-majority districts in the South won handily. The results are impressive, most notably in the cases of Cynthia McKinney (D., Ga.), who took 58 per cent of the vote in a district that is 35 per cent black, and Sheila Jackson Lee (D., Tex.), who took 77 per cent against multiple opponents in a 42 per cent black district. What's surprising is not that so many Americans voted for blacks, but that they voted for Democrats.
n Mr. Clinton took the leadership on a Balanced Budget Amendment, announcing that he's for it and that he's against it -- in that order, we think, but maybe the other way around.

In <I>NR</I>'s November 11 issue, Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Doris M. Meissner denied that there was anything wrong with letting the White House use her agency to create armies of Instant Democrats in time for the presidential election, as reported by Thomas McArdle (<I>NR</I>, July 1). Meanwhile, an uncritical profile of Mrs. Meissner appeared in the <I>New York Times Magazine</I> on October 27. ``We are a society committed to equal opportunity,'' she told the <I>Times Magazine</I> reporter, ``and in 1965 we rejected national origins as a basis of immigration.'' It is significant that Mrs. Meissner would justify the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act by projecting America's domestic civil-rights struggle onto the logically quite distinct issue of immigration policy. Shakespeare's soldier famously sought ``the bubble reputation/Even in the cannon's mouth.'' But where does Mrs. Meissner propose to pursue the demon Racism -- and can America survive her fixation?

With the election past and relations with a Republican Congress ahead, President Clinton allows that the two parties are close in their ideas for reforming Medicare.

Carl Lischeske of the California Health Department was astonished to read a ``Fact Sheet'' from the U.S. Interior Department on low-level nuclear waste. It said that 98 per cent of radioactive materials needing disposal came from nuclear-power plants. In fact, the majority of nuclear waste comes from hospitals, the end product of radiation therapy. Lischeske traced the 98 per cent figure to a protest group which cited no source. He then found that the U.S. Department of Energy database on low-level waste showed that less than a third of wastes are from nuclear utilities. He wrote the U.S. Interior Department: ``Rather than accepting information provided by anti-nuclear activists without question you may want to consider utilizing instead the information services provided by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission . . .'' No answer yet. It's a new resource-use program: recycling Green propaganda.

The President further allows that there are no big differences between the parties on such issues as the environment, education, and welfare. Fine. It's about time the Democrats pitched in and did their share of poisoning the land and sea, trampling women's reproductive rights, throwing welfare moms into the gutter, and making starving schoolchildren memorize the multiplication tables.

The great power-line debate is over. The National Academy of Sciences has released a report on a review of 500 studies done over the last 17 years; the report concluded that there is no evidence that power lines, or electromagnetic fields, cause cancer. A 1979 study indicating a link between childhood leukemia and power lines launched the debate; in the early 1990s <I>New Yorker</I> author Paul Brodeur whipped up a public frenzy which resulted in million-dollar reconfigurations of power lines, lawsuits against cellular-phone companies, and a moralistic film comedy on the subject by Eddie Murphy. But sacred cows die hard, and doomsayers have now pinned their hopes on power surges. While scientific evidence does indicate a marginal correlation between childhood leukemia and proximity to power lines, the causes for this could be as diverse as traffic levels near power lines, older houses near power lines, less affluent families near power lines, and so on. But exhaustive research has concluded that the one thing that does not cause cancer near power lines is power lines.

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><font size=+1>HAT</font> more can be said about a campaign which, in its waning days, had Ross Perot calling it ``weird and inconsequential'' and its own candidate going negative, finally, but against the voters? ``Wake up, America!'' said Dole, adding a characteristic twist to Reagan's 1984 ``Morning in America'' theme. Asked what went wrong, a former RNC official sighs. ``It's kind of like asking when your dad dies of cancer, which cigarette did it? Bury the body and move on.''
<P>
OK, but not before piling on a few more shovelsful of dirt. Plenty of Republicans blame Dole for digging his own grave. He treated his nomination like a gold watch given by the company on his retirement. Even the most gifted staff would have had a tough time selling a candidate who spoke in Dole's trademark ``telegraphic'' style, and who blurted out remarks his aides had made to him about NAACP ``set-ups'' and ``wedge issues.'' And of course an incumbent presiding over a nation at peace and with a tolerable economy was likely to win re-election. But neither uncontrollable circumstances nor Dole's (well-known) weaknesses as a candidate should obscure the fact that this campaign was the most abysmal one Republicans have mounted in modern times. It was worse even than Bush - Quayle '92, which most observers would not have thought possible.
<P>
President Clinton's re-election team was sophisticated, coordinated, and aggressive. Dole's staff matched them in cynicism but little else. <I>Their</I> aggression was chiefly directed at each other. Mike Murphy, who was dismissed in September as Dole's media consultant, later wrote that distrust and secrecy made the campaign ``like the Kremlin.'' Former staffers and hangers-on paint a similar picture. ``There are departments that don't speak to other departments,'' said one. ``The press shop won't speak to the rapid-response shop. . . . People are too turf-conscious.'' Campaign manager Scott Reed exacerbated the problem by running the campaign like Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon: he knew what each department was doing but they couldn't follow each other.
<P>
It's not surprising, then, that staffers would air their internal strategic disputes in public. For two weeks the campaign debated whether to attack Clinton's character, using the <I>Washington Post</I>'s front page as an intermediary. This was of a piece with the campaign's general leakiness, which tended to undercut campaign tactics. Putting Billy Dale in the front row of the audience for the first presidential debate was a clever touch, for example, but it would have been more clever if Clinton hadn't been warned of it in the newspaper the day before. Other leaks demonstrated staffers' disloyalty. The week of the election, <I>The New Yorker</I>'s Michael Kelly quoted Reed as absolving himself from any responsibility for the coming defeat. (Reed's lame defense of his remarks: ``The piece was supposed to be written after the election.'')
<P>
The campaign's rocky press relations caused other problems too. The campaign, particularly John Buckley's communications operation, was obsessed with getting good coverage in the elite media (the networks, the <I>Post</I>, the <I>New York Times</I>). Previous, successful Republican campaigns had gone around the establishment media, appealing directly to the American people and exploiting alternative media outlets. Dole's campaign did neither. It avoided talk radio, much to the consternation of the Republican National Committee. In order not to offend elite-media sensibilities, the campaign, in effect, internalized the media's standards.
<P>
So, the San Diego convention was designed to prevent the media from being able to repeat their demonization of the 1992 Houston convention. It was soft and fuzzy, like cotton candy, and the ``bounce'' it generated melted just as quickly. Or take the first presidential debate. The talking heads said Dole had to show that he wasn't mean and that he had mastered the complexities of public policy. So he did both, having been coached on the latter by Sheila Burke, and the pundits patted him on the head for being a graceful loser.
<P>
If the campaign overemphasized media reactions, it was obsessed with polls. Nobody questions the competence of campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio or the accuracy of his findings; those findings just weren't translated into practical advice. Pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick criticizes ``the use of focus groups and polls as a source to base Dole's convictions rather than a tool to develop strategy. You've got to <I>move</I> polls, not just measure them.'' The fixations on polls and the press combined to make Dole hesitant to ``go negative.'' Yet a successful campaign had to be ``negative,'' i.e., to persuade voters to fire the incumbent. Voters don't like negativity, but attacks stick in their minds and affect their decisions. Clinton started his anti-Dole ads early, got the message to stick, and was able to end his campaign on a positive note. When the Dole campaign finally started attacking Clinton it was too late, and what stuck in voters' minds was the negativity.
<P>
Meanwhile, the campaign bounced from tax cuts to drugs to tax cuts to school choice to character to . . . whatever. From the voters' perspective, it was all so much white noise. The campaign displayed a pathological aversion to staying on message. It never even ran a decent ad on the 15 per cent tax cut which was its supposed centerpiece. Dole muddled other messages. When he proposed a modest set of political reforms to highlight the Indogate scandal, for instance, he reinforced the Democrats' line that the problem was current law, not Clinton's failure to abide by it. In indicting the political system in general, he implicitly excused Clinton in particular. Dole's ``better man for a better America'' slogan was never given political content; like Bush before him, Dole clung to the hope that the public would prefer him as a person to Clinton.
<P>
Dole's worst strategic mistake was to heed Richard Nixon's advice to run right in the primaries and then run to the center for the general election. Dole alienated social conservatives and gun-rights supporters and took other conservatives for granted. He distanced himself from the supposedly ``extremist'' Republican Congress, even though congressional candidates, the Congress as a whole, and the party were always more popular than Dole. At a gathering of Washington conservatives this summer, Fabrizio, acting as the campaign's emissary, brusquely dismissed their complaints with the explanation that they didn't have anywhere else to go. He said they should go along with Dole the way the gay lobby was putting up with Clinton's political infidelities.
<P>
Nixon's proposed strategy -- which, by the way didn't really describe his own m.o. -- presupposed the other candidate's total unacceptability to conservatives. As the exit polls show, that wasn't the case with Clinton. The strategy also poisoned the campaign's relations with Congress. They never were good: House Majority Leader Dick Armey had trouble getting calls returned. But Dole's abandonment of congressional Republicans on the assault-weapons issue was the last straw. They abandoned him by sending Clinton bills he could sign and for which all incumbents could take credit. Dole staffers' bitter complaints about the ``betrayal,'' particularly on welfare, fell on deaf ears. Republicans, in short, did not run as a team, as they had in 1994. The Dole campaign viewed outsiders -- even, at times, the RNC -- as threats rather than resources.
<P>
The campaign's second worst strategic mistake was the neglect of social, moral, and cultural issues. The California Civil Rights Initiative was held at arm's length, then embraced at a point when Dole could only drag it down. Partial-birth abortion was addressed sporadically. ``I wish that we had gone to Notre Dame and given a major speech on partial-birth abortion and made a major play for the Catholic vote,'' says speechwriter Mike Gerson. Drug use was the only social issue Dole dwelt on, and it's the sort of consensus issue that doesn't move many votes. Peter Roff, political director of GOPAC, says, ``They decided to run a campaign based largely on economics, which was an interesting experiment and we now see it didn't work.''
<P>
The list of legitimate criticisms of the campaign is practically inexhaustible. Dole addressed the gender gap by touting his support for the Violence Against Women Act and visiting a shelter for battered women. The campaign didn't court Reagan Democrats. Various states were written off and then put back in play. There was never any follow-through on dramatic events like Dole's resignation from the Senate. In retrospect, the vice-presidential selection was also a mistake. Dole should have picked someone who could deliver a swing state and help with a swing demographic group, someone with a track record of winning votes. A Midwestern Catholic governor like John Engler of Michigan would have met all those tests; Jack Kemp met none of them. As a final indignity, Dole closed the campaign alongside Gerald Ford and George Bush -- forming a trio with an impressive seven failed White House bids.
<P> 
Can anything be salvaged from all the self-serving leaks, back-biting, and embarrassments of this campaign? If it results in a reform of the primary process that led to Dole's nomination, some good will have come of it. One conservative activist in Washington proposes another reform. Referring to Dole -  Kemp HQ, he says, ``Nobody who walked into 810 First Street should ever work for Republicans again.''

<H2>On Needed Extremism</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 8<br>


A very bright professor, on Wednesday, trying to give cheer to his despondent companion, summed it up in this way: ``Look. The guy who was elected President is a Republican Democrat. He got 49 per cent of the vote. He was running against a Republican Republican, who won 41 per cent of the vote. The third candidate was a conservative with 8 per cent. The House stayed Republican by about 19 seats, with 80 per cent of the 1994 freshman Republicans winning re-election. The Senate stayed Republican by 10 seats, and the majority of governors are Republican. So what's the gloom all about?''
<P>
Nicely done, if conservative uplift is the order of the day. But the air seemed saturated, on D-Day+1, with strains of the old melody: The middle road. One commentator said it bluntly: The Lord has spoken, and what we have seen is a repudiation of extremists, of both the Left and the Right. The way of the future is down the middle of the road. 
<P>
The Lord wasn't all that plainspoken, some of us conclude. Bob Dornan of California -- ``B-1 Bob,'' as his dazzled critics think of him -- is hanging in there, with a tiny lead. Strom Thurmond, at the end of his freshly renewed term, will be one hundred years old. And Jesse Helms had his customary victory. On the far Left, Mr. Bonior of Michigan squeaked through, as did several members of the Establishment Left like Charles Rangel, who was quoted as saying he intended to be buried in Chicago, so that he could continue an active political career posthumously. 
<P>
We are left, of course, with the question: How do you define an extremist? The thesaurus gives fanatic as a synonym, and the <I>American Heritage Dictionary</I> contributes a Usage Note: ``synonyms: <I>fanatic</I>, <I>zealot</I>, <I>enthusiast</I>. These nouns denote persons who are ardently and usually excessively devoted to a particular cause, subject, or activity. <I>Fanatic</I> implies the pursuit of a given interest to inordinate and even irrational lengths, often to the exclusion of all other interests: <I>'A fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change the subject'</I> (Winston S. Churchill). A <I>zealot</I> is immoderately devoted to a cause or goal and seeks to advance it with passionate fervor: <I>'those furious zealots who blow the bellows of faction until the whole furnace of politics is red-hot'</I> (Washington Irving). <I>Enthusiast</I> can denote a religious zealot holding visionary opinions. More commonly, however, it merely implies strong interest in something such as a hobby, and lacks the unfavorable connotations of the other terms: <I>"a hockey enthusiast"</I>.
<P>
We see, then, that the term <I>extremist</I> can readily be used to stigmatize a position different from one's own. The professional politicians still reel from the pronouncement by Barry Goldwater in 1964 that moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue, extremism in defense of liberty is no vice. You get an absolute and plausible consensus on extremism only when it is used to designate riflemen who wander about (in isolated numbers) mumbling about the need to take the law into their own hands. Extremism can be used, and has been, to denounce people who kill without judicial authority, as also those who execute in state prisons. There is a difference, and that difference teaches us to use words with caution. And the beginning of wisdom here is to decline to retreat from a desired political objective simply because it is anathematized as extremist by True Believers, or opportunists. 
<P>
The most prominent of the issues in question is of course abortion. Although the great majority coast in and out of the polling booth unaffected by the issue, abortion is as divisive as any question in the public square. What surely is needed is the rejection of the finding in <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I>, to the effect that the right to abort is fundamental and constitutionally given. This space is not given over to the one-millionth consideration of the opinion of the majority, rather to a legitimate objective of the GOP, which should not be denounced as extremist. It is to return the authority to govern abortions to the states. We already know (Connecticut is an example) that there are states anxious to write into their laws guarantees of abortion rights. The quarrels then would be inside marginal states, easing away the question as a national issue. 
<P>
The GOP leadership should frame a new and non-extremist position: We abandon the goal of constitutional reform, you abandon opposition to ditching <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I>.

Is it me, or did we win? 
<P>
I'm not trying to be huffy here, but we did win, right? I mean, I guess my question is, if we won, then why do we need to have quite so many discussions about ``reaching out'' to Colin Powell and ``building bridges'' with Dick Gephardt?
<P>
In the first place, I'm not sure why we're making so many changes in the Administration. Forgive me, but I think the one we had was pretty darn good. Donna Shalala was a killer over at HHS; Henry Cisneros did a bang-up job at HUD; and Warren Christopher was one of the best Secretaries of State we've had, considering his age and the fact that he has no presidential ambition. 
<P>
Americans voted for the status quo. Why in heaven's name aren't we giving it to them? 
<P>
If I sound angry, Rusty, it's because I am. The Gore family is knocking itself out trying to prepare for the next election. For the next three years, the girls have promised to stay away from creepy boyfriends and avoid big desserts; and little Al, bless his heart, is taking up soccer. ``Now you're a soccer mom!'' he shouted with glee, and Tipper promised to drive him to every game from September 1999 to November 2000 and to publicly complain about her ``crazy schedule.'' Karenna thinks she may be ready to get married, so we're on the lookout for a) a suitable groom, and b) the right Saturday in May 2000 for a Rose Garden wedding, with receptions to follow in Florida and California.
<P>
And Mom and Dad, troupers to their very last breath, have promised not to breathe it until the eve of the Democratic National Convention. 
<P>
So in the face of that all-out Gore effort, it doesn't seem like too much to ask that the rest of the Administration pitch in and lend a hand. 
<P>
That's why this Colin-Powell-as-Secretary-of-State business has me so nettled. 
<P>
``What about sweet old George Mitchell?'' I asked.
<P>
``Too partisan,'' was the reply.
<P>
``Then what about Dick Holbrooke? After all, he's not running for President.''
<P>
``Don't be too sure. He's set up an exploratory committee and a fund-raising arm called 'America Deserves Dick Holbrooke.'''
<P>
``Does he really think he's qualified to be President?'' I asked.
<P>
``No, but he's willing to stoop a little.''

With Colin Powell at State and William Weld as a possible Attorney General, I joked to Bill that he may as well get Christie Whitman in here to replace me.
<P>
``Good idea,'' he said, and reached for the phone. 
<P>
``Whoa whoa whoa,'' I said. ``What gives? We won! Let's act like winners. Maybe throw our weight around a little. Not return a few phone calls. Forget to invite Dick Gephardt to the White House Christmas Tree Lighting.'' 
<P>
``Al,'' Bill said, ``we've been through this. You know what we have to do. Look, if I were you, I wouldn't be so concerned with what goes on around here. Think of it this way: every meal you eat at home is a meal you're not eating with two thousand Buddhist monks.'' 
<P>
I thought about this long and hard. In my heart, I knew Bill was right. We do need at least one Republican around. But which one? 
<P>
That night, as we got ready for bed, I laid out the situation for Tipper. ``Tip,'' I said, ``Bill makes a pretty convincing case that if I want to be elected in four years, we've got to show some real accomplishments. And the only way we're going to accomplish anything is if we have a bipartisan Administration. But which Republicans do you think I should accept?''
<P> 
She fluffed the pillows for a second. ``Jack Kemp at HUD and Pat Buchanan at Commerce.''
<P> 
``What?'' I shouted. ``Both of those guys are planning to run in the primaries! Putting them in a Clinton Cabinet would only elevate them to front-runner status!'' 
<P>
She fluffed some more. 
<P>
``Plus,'' I went on, ``won't we look ideologically schizophrenic?'' 
<P>
She shot me a raised-eyebrow look. ``That ship,'' she said, ``has sailed.''
<P> 
``But -- '' 
<P>
``Al, if you could help two Republicans win the nomination in 2000, which would they be?''
<P> 
I thought for a second. ``Oh,'' I said. ``Gotcha.''
<P> 
It was the first good night of sleep I've had since the election. 
<P>
Gotta go. Tipper and I are pricing minivans today. Soccer moms don't use armor-plated Town Cars!

Fifty-three per cent of smokers, according to polls, voted for Bill Clinton. It's a helluva way to quit.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

Results from ballot initiatives around the country confirm the electorate's anti-government tilt. In nine states, voters approved congressional term limits; in two more the vote was too close to call at press time. Florida voters approved the toughest anti-tax initiative in the land, requiring a two-thirds vote of the people for any new tax. Nevada and South Dakota passed only slightly less stringent measures. (In Arizona, where such a super-majority law already exists, the legislature doesn't even bother to request new taxes.) Meanwhile, most of the Left's initiatives went down in flames. The trial lawyers lost their bid in California to overturn the federal law barring frivolous shareholder suits. Two separate initiatives to take over the California health-care system lost by 2 to 1. Big Green took a pounding too: a sugar tax to pay for Everglades clean-up, a ban on clear-cutting in Maine, and a bottle-tax proposal in Oregon all went down. One hopes the elected show as much common sense as the voters.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

What do these people have in common: the Republican governors, Jack Kemp, Bob Torricelli, and Charles Rangel? They are all tipped in Jude Wanniski's post-election fax as ``promising possibilities [of] optimism.'' FYI.


<P>
<hr>
<P>
Republican giddiness over the possibility of President Clinton's being hobbled by scandal, and maybe even impeached, is understandable. But congressional Republicans, while investigating the Indogate affair (and other outstanding Clinton scandals), should keep in mind a few cautionary words. First, impeaching a President should not be foreseen with glee. While President Clinton may deserve his fate, the country does not deserve the upheaval that would attend his comeuppance. Nor is it certain that Kenneth Starr will indict the First Lady or that the President will be implicated in Indogate. To assume so is escapism: let scandals take care of Clinton, then the GOP won't have to decide how to beat a slippery Democrat who foils them at every turn. The GOP can't expect Kenneth Starr to do its work for it.

<P>

Still, the week was enlivened when John Huang, top Democratic Party fund-raiser, took it on the lam rather than answer questions. An eyewitness even saw a man of Mr. Huang's description sprinting out a back door of Democratic National Committee headquarters as U.S. marshals came in the front door with a subpoena. Hillary Rodham Clinton nonetheless managed to send a note to the fugitive saying, ``We all support Mr. Huang.'' Nobody knew where he was, but Mr. Huang received that message. It is a miracle unless -- <I>yes!</I> -- Eleanor delivered it.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

A desperate <I>New York Times</I>, trying to explain why the President's bad habits are reasons to vote for him: ``Scandals present an opportunity in the second term for Bill Clinton to get back in touch with integrity and honesty.'' Why stop there? A series of axe murders in broad daylight would be reason to scrap the Twenty-Second Amendment and keep the guy till 2004.

<P>

As the campaign for the California Civil Rights Initiative came down the home stretch, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> ran an article citing late writings of Martin Luther King in support of racial preferences. Charlton Heston, who had joined King's 1963 March on Washington, wrote a letter to the editor recalling that he had stood in the Senate gallery in 1964 as Hubert Humphrey argued for the Civil Rights Bill. Asked if it might lead to quotas and preferences, Humphrey vehemently denied it. ``I can't know what was in Dr. King's heart,'' Heston concluded, ``but Hubert Humphrey was a man of honor. The language of preference was not in the bill. That grew gradually over the next twenty years, under the monstrous bureaucracy that still fights to keep the injustice it has wrought.'' The <I>Times</I>, evidently pressed for space, did not run the letter.

The White House, pulling an old soap-opera trick, claims there was another John Huang (perhaps a long-lost amnesiac twin) making all those visits to the inner circle. Nice try, but two Huangs still don't make a right.

The Clinton Administration refused to come clean -- before the election -- on its plans for the 35,000 U.S. troops in Bosnia. They would complete their peacekeeping mission in ``about one year,'' the President promised the nation in a televised address on November 27, 1995. Now, the Administration is reportedly considering two options for an extended tour: 1) a ``withdrawal'' option, which actually involves sending 5,000 new GIs to cover the withdrawal of the 35,000 by March 1997, after which an air-assault brigade and fighter aircraft would remain nearby (``over the horizon'') indefinitely; 2) a ground-force presence, smaller than the present one, to remain in Bosnia through late 1997 and possibly beyond. Defense Secretary Perry told Congress in October that no decision has been made. But the one option not likely to be chosen is what the President originally promised. Meanwhile, as the political provisions of the Dayton Accords unravel, American training and equipping of the Bosnians is stalled -- another Clinton promise blowing in the wind. This is why the U.S. and NATO have to worry about using their troops to do what the Bosnians should be doing for themselves.

Barbara Coe, a leader of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform and an architect of California's Proposition 187, is being threatened with legal action by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, California's Secretary of State, the Orange County Registrar's Office, and the U.S. Department of Justice. Miss Coe's offense? ``Intimidating voters'' by posting and distributing flyers stating the law: ``Only Citizens Can Vote! Violators Will Be Prosecuted!'' Opposing election fraud is now apparently a crime in California.

Under the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act, the FBI classifies victims of hate crimes by race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, but identifies perpetrators only by race. Hispanics, therefore, are recognized as victims, but not as perpetrators. Since most Hispanics are officially identified as ``white,'' if a Hispanic attacks a black, it is typically counted as a white-on-black hate crime. Similarly, if a Hispanic attacks an Asian, it is a white-on-Asian hate crime. And if a Hispanic attacks a Hispanic, it is a white-on-Hispanic hate crime. No word yet on how the FBI classifies those who attack common sense, or the principle that all men are created <I>iguales</I>.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>T HALF</font> past nine on election night, the Dole campaign conceded defeat. ``Bob Dole has completed his last political mission with courage and honor,'' said press secretary Nelson Warfield in a press release. Half an hour later, Warfield was backtracking in another release marked ``URGENT'': ``Due to an error, a statement from the Dole campaign was prematurely released to some news outlets this evening. The fact is Bob Dole has conceded nothing.'' An hour or so later, the campaign conceded that its original concession was correct.
<P>
It was a fitting end for a campaign that rarely made a tactical move without protracted bouts of public agonizing, oftentimes only to reverse field again within a few weeks or even hours. Attack or take the ``high road''? Contest California or not? Pound home the tax-cut message or abandon it? The Dole campaign never had the same answer for long, and so it's little wonder that in the final hours it couldn't even decide whether or not it had lost. The election just couldn't end without one more Dole campaign fiasco.
<P>
It was a status-quo end to a status-quo campaign. If the Dole camp thought it may have conceded too early, other Republicans had been ready to throw in the towel months before. Dole never was able to gain a foothold against his agile opponent. The ads, initiatives, and campaign trips of the last three months did little to alter the basic shape of the race. Nor have they changed the State of the Union. The White House remains Democratic, the Congress Republican. Even the line-up of states in the Electoral College remains essentially the same as in the Bush - Clinton election of 1992. It was an incumbents' night.
<P>
The last two years have featured a continued tug-of-war over the proper role of government in American life. The liberal vision of a government growing by leaps and bounds has been, it can by now be confidently stated, firmly repudiated; but the conservative vision of a relimited government has not been fully accepted by the public. The 1996 elections were widely expected to resolve the issue for the next decade. Instead the voters left matters unsettled. Not that the candidates did much to help them decide. The Democrats all talked about their support of the balanced budget; the Republicans boasted of increasing spending on Medicare.
<P>
It was Clinton's good fortune to run for re-election in a generally satisfied country. As one would expect, those who thought the economy was ``good'' or ``excellent'' went heavily for the incumbent, while those who viewed it as ``not good'' or ``poor'' opted for the challenger. Unfortunately for Dole, there were more of the former (56 per cent) than the latter (42 per cent). Similarly, the 53 per cent of voters who think the country is headed in the right direction strongly favored Clinton while the 43 per cent who worried that it is on the wrong track broke, albeit less heavily, for Dole. 
<P>
Even if circumstances had been more propitious for a Republican presidential candidate, Bob Dole's liabilities would have made him a tough sell. In a fit of overconfidence, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> once editorialized that any Republican who didn't drool could probably beat Bill Clinton. It turns out that voters demanded more than that, like a candidate who could complete a sentence. Not only did Dole garble his arguments and baffle his audiences with references to Beltway arcana, when he did manage to make a point he would often undercut it with self-deprecatory irony.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>O</FONT> wonder voters concluded that this difficult, remote figure didn't understand their problems or have a vision for the future: 51 per cent of voters doubted that Dole understood their problems; only 12 per cent of those who thought ``vision'' the most important quality in a candidate voted for Dole; 56 per cent of voters said Dole hadn't given them a reason to vote for him. And then there was Dole's age. Most voters (64 per cent) professed not to be concerned by Dole's age, but the minority that thought it would affect his performance gave a whopping 79 per cent of their votes to Clinton. If their votes had been excluded, Dole would have won the election.
<P>
But the most important factor was that Dole drove away the Republican base. From the outset conservatives had, at best, little enthusiasm for the senior senator from Kansas. Yet instead of trying to woo them, once the primaries were over the campaign went out of its way to offend them, seemingly confusing this accomplishment with winning over swing voters. The combination of an unattractive messenger and a misbegotten message kept Dole from taking votes that should have been his.
<P>
Thirteen per cent of the voters who selected George Bush in 1992 defected to Clinton this year. So did 20 per cent of self-identified conservatives and 26 per cent of the ``white Religious Right.'' Dole only tied among married people, and Clinton actually took a plurality of parents of minors. As for the notion -- sure to be bruited about as frequently after the election as before -- that an unpopular Congress dragged Dole down, it's worth noting that 16 per cent of voters who approved of the Republican Congress left Dole in the lurch. This shouldn't have been a surprise: during the campaign Dole consistently polled below congressional candidates, the Congress as a whole, and the Republican Party.
<P>
Other Republicans were able to appeal to the party's base and fashion winning coalitions. Phil Gramm, no ideological wallflower, ran 6 points ahead of Dole in Texas. Conservative Tim Hutchinson was able to win election to the Senate in President Clinton's home turf of Arkansas, running 15 points ahead of Dole. A number of Senate candidates who lost probably would have won without the Dole drag. Dole lost Louisiana by 13 points; Woody Jenkins lost the chance to become the Senate's most conservative member in a squeaker.
<P>
Indeed, Dole probably hurt his side more than Clinton helped his. The crowning victory of Clinton's career is hardly a resounding affirmation of his Presidency. He is the first President since Woodrow Wilson to win two consecutive elections with a minority of the vote. Most Americans continue to harbor serious reservations about the President's character: 52 per cent said they were ``concerned'' or ``scared'' about the prospect of a Clinton victory; 54 per cent consider him untrustworthy or dishonest; 59 per cent doubt that he has told the truth about Whitewater. Dole won heavily among the minority of voters who listed a candidate's ``character'' as more important than his stands on issues. Despite Clinton's constant calls for national unity, he is a deeply divisive figure: most of the people who voted for him think he tells the truth, but an incredible 91 per cent of Dole supporters put him in the ``dishonest/untrustworthy'' category. A smaller slice of voters (18 per cent), which might be dubbed the ``character swing vote,'' voted for Clinton despite their distrust.
<P>
Given these ambivalent attitudes toward Clinton it's not surprising that no Democratic sweep materialized despite Clinton's Electoral College sweep. This year saw no partisan tide for the Democrats of the kind that brought Republicans to power in Congress in 1994, no public yearning for a return to a united and purposeful Democratic government. Crucial in stemming any nationwide Democratic resurgence in the campaign's final days were ads bought by the National Republican Campaign Committee warning of the dangers of a ``blank check'' for President Clinton that would allow him to return to his tax-and-spend ways. Republican candidates took similar tacks in their individual races, tagging their opponents as ``liberals'' and trying to associate them with the Democratic majorities of old.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT> was really a two-pronged effort. As Republican candidates hardened the perception of their opponents' ideological edges they sought to soften their own. Even an aggressive conservative like Tim Hutchinson spoke proudly of his vote for the minimum wage. The universal refrain of Republicans from coast to coast was that they had <I>increased</I> spending for education, for student loans, for environmental programs, and of course, for school lunches. Leader of the revolution Newt Gingrich demonstrated the method himself when he cut an ad attacking his opponent, cookie maker Michael Coles, for paying some workers only the minimum wage. (Make that the cookie monster.)
<P>
Democrats hoped, of course, to make Gingrich the focus of every race in the country. That strategy clearly failed. The public's hostility to Gingrich is personal, not ideological. Republicans could thus inoculate themselves from the charge of being Gingrich clones simply by convincing voters that they were nice guys with the best interests of their districts at heart; they didn't have to dissociate themselves from the substance of the Republican revolution. In only one House race did the nuke-Newt strategy clearly draw blood: the surprisingly tough run liberal Republican Nancy Johnson had in her usually safe Connecticut district. At press time Rep. Johnson's race is still in doubt. Shocks like that happen when the party's presidential candidate loses a state by 16 points, but a crucial factor in Mrs. Johnson's race was the hits she took for allegedly covering for Gingrich in her capacity as chairman of the House Ethics Committee. The ethics charges against Gingrich may yet hurt other Republicans in coming months, but for now it is far more significant that he was the architect of Congress's rise to its highest approval ratings in ten years.
<P>
Also a flop was the labor-union charge against Republican freshmen. Only 14 (out of 73) were defeated. A couple of factors were at work. First, all the Democrats' spending a year ago did help ``burn in'' the impression that Republicans were an intemperate majority willing to embrace ``extremist'' means -- i.e., shutting down the government -- to achieve the ends of special interests. The Medicare issue also was effective against some Republicans (although Clinton actually did worse among seniors than in 1992). In the end it seems the labor unions overreached; they ran their ads so early and many of them were so ham-handed that by the stretch run they had lost their force. The special $35 million in forced union dues spent to elect a Democratic Congress works out to $2.5 million per defeated Republican freshman, some of whom would have lost even if the unions had left every dime in the bank. The morning after the election, GOP pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick remarked that a CEO who made an investment like that would be fired.
<P>
In the run-up to the elections, ``union bosses'' had to compete for news coverage with ``soccer moms.'' The oft-discussed gender gap was real and harmful to Dole and other Republicans. If men were the only ones who had voted, Republicans would probably be striding toward a veto-proof majority in the Senate: Lightfoot and Harkin tied among men, Woody Jenkins narrowly beat Mary Landrieu among men. The ultimate causes of the gender gap are unclear, and Republicans are sure to argue over it in coming months. In a pre-election interview Republican analyst Jim Pinkerton lamented ``the horrible gender-gap problem that, excuse me, the pro-life issue gives Republicans. I'm sure you're not going to print that but it's true.'' That's sure to be the conventional wisdom we'll hear for weeks. Yet the Massachusetts Senate race provides evidence against that contention. Republican Gov. William Weld is an impeccable social liberal -- he even sided with Clinton's decision to keep partial-birth abortion legal -- and he still trailed among women by 21 points while tying among men. 
<P>
If Republicans are from Mars, Democrats are from Venus. Dole's margin among suburban dads was twice as high as Clinton's margin among suburban moms. And the Democrats do not have quite the hold on women they might hope. The President, whose way with women has been the focus of extravagant praise from the press, got slightly less of the women's vote than Reagan did in 1984. And quite a few Republicans had no particular trouble appealing to women. New Arkansas Sen. Tim Hutchinson, a principled conservative but a soothing personality, tied among women in Arkansas. Even Phil Gramm, a not-so-soothing personality, won among all women by 9 points and among white women by 30 points, after running a hard-hitting, issue-driven campaign in the Lone Star State. 
<P>
The magic bullet that was supposed to get Dole out of all his troubles, with women and everyone else, was his 15 per cent tax plan. It was a well-crafted proposal that should have been politically appealing; under the plan a couple making $35,000 a year with two children would have seen their tax burden reduced by <I>one-third</I> (a datum that the Dole campaign didn't push nearly hard enough). Deficit-phobia wasn't the problem: 58 per cent of voters recognized that it is possible to cut taxes <I>and</I> the deficit. But two-thirds of voters didn't think <I>Dole</I> could do both. To voters his about-face on tax cuts seemed (like so much of his campaign) a matter of mere expedience.
In retrospect, if Dole was going to ignore his political instincts and pick a conservative theme to make the centerpiece of his campaign, that theme should have come out of the cluster of social and cultural issues. Exhibit number one is the California Civil Rights Initiative, banning race and gender preferences by government entities in California. All year long, CCRI outran Dole. Its momentum withstood a vicious late blitz of demagogic attacks and outright lies. The Dole campaign eschewed the issue for fear of alienating those soccer moms (soccer is a multi-cultural game, after all). But early exit polls indicate that CCRI won 51 per cent of the women's vote, a performance of which Bob Dole could only dream.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>HAT</FONT> does this mean for the next two years? The Senate will be marginally more Republican and appreciably more conservative. Liberal-to-moderate Republicans Mark Hatfield (Ore.), Nancy Landon Kassebaum (Kan.), Alan Simpson (Wyo.), and, of course, Bob Dole are all out the door. Replacing them is a freshman class of Republicans that will move the body to the right in philosophy and attitude: Sam Brownback (Kan.), Tim Hutchinson (Ark.), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Wayne Allard (Colo.), and Jeff Sessions (Ala.). Instead of being slowed down by the Senate, House Republicans could find themselves straining to keep up.
<P>
Gingrich himself, of course, will start from a position of diminished power. Many members have had to dodge bullets with Gingrich's name on them and will be less willing to follow his lead than two years ago, and committee chairmen were already getting restive in the waning days of the last Congress. Gingrich is likely to be eager to embrace an aggressive bi-partisanship to win media goodwill. Indeed, the White House spin, adopted by the major media, is that the election results were a mandate for co-operation in Washington, for getting things done. House members who saw their early poor poll results turn around after they passed the minimum wage, welfare reform, and health regulation will be especially susceptible to this interpretation.
<P>
But voters <I>never</I> favor partisan confrontation; they don't want ``gridlock.'' And yet, they prefer some policies to others, and a majority prefer Republican policies. The fact that a majority of voters voted against Clinton should register with savvy Republicans even if the news doesn't reach the press. Republicans needn't accept whatever Clinton throws at them. On tax cuts, for instance, it's not at all clear that Clinton's tiny, targeted tax credits have won a mandate over broader tax relief. And Republicans should take heed of the fact that it was cleverly packaged partisan confrontation, over issues of Clinton's choosing, that paved the way for his comeback.
<P>
Measured against what might have been, the Republican showing on November 5 was disappointing: two years ago they thought they ruled the world and laughed at the possibility of a second Clinton term. They shouldn't have. But there are signs that the secular trend is still toward increased Republican dominance of American politics. Economic conditions fluctuate, and so does the quality of candidates and campaigns. If those factors had been different this year, Republicans would probably have had another sweep like 1994's. So, while the Dole campaign lost long before 9:30 P.M. on November 5, it's still too early for Republicans with designs on a historic realignment to concede defeat.

<H2>What to Do About the Expatriate?</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, OCTOBER 22<br>
The question, from a member of the Democratic panel, was intended as hostile. What did we Republicans think of American citizens who, in order to save taxes, give up their citizenship?
<P>
I answered to the effect that protest against taxation is a venerable American habit, thought to be axiomatic by those of our ancestors who emptied a boat laden with tea into Boston Harbor. 
<P>
Well, what did we think of the proposal to bar such expatriates from living here for more than four months every year? 
<P>
That question sends us back to the thought-library. When is expatriation commendable? 
<P>
We begin by acknowledging that all Americans are the fruit of expatriation. We have never cultivated harsh thoughts for those who left England or Holland in search of greater religious freedom than they had at home. Certainly we do not resent those who came to America fleeing persecution. And, on reflection, we do not resent those who came here looking for commercial opportunity, do we? If Andrew Carnegie left Scotland intending nothing more than to make a fortune in the New World, what is the proper attitude of the Scots he abandoned?
<P>
During and after the Revolutionary War there was some resentment of the ``loyalists'' who went to Canada. But the bitterness was not long lasting, and it isn't hard to understand that there should have been those for whom the tug of loyalty to the Crown transcended contemporary revolutionary ardor. The Southerner who abandoned his ``country'' (there were very few) because he did not wish to identify himself with a war the apparent purpose of which was to establish the South's right to continue to allow slavery would not, in retrospect, be thought cowardly, or disloyal, though his timing was questionable.
<P>
What about the rich American who gives up his flag in order to shield himself from taxation? 
<P>
The spastic answer is that of course such a man is to be despised. But it's also true, isn't it, that we are, as Americans, tolerant of deviant behavior? The most engaging recent example of expatriate canniness is the man who gave up his citizenship, pulled out his money, went off to live in some little island country, and persuaded the government to appoint him Ambassador to the United States. A really nifty arrangement, because now he has rejoined his family and lives in his native land, tax free. Somebody somewhere got in the way of that little maneuver, and now the question raised in Congress is how far to limit expatriates' visits to the United States. After 182 days, you become a U.S. resident for purposes of taxation; so that anyone primarily engaged in evading taxes would not expect to live more than six months a year here. But there is sentiment in Congress for limiting this time further, even drastically.
<P>
One seeks perspective. Sure, anybody ought to have the right to go anywhere to take up residence, subject of course to the right of every country to regulate immigration. The question we are considering is whether the man who undertakes alienation in order to protect his property is beneath contempt. 
<P>
Certainly that would be so if such a person left his country when it was in distress. We have read of Germans who thought it disloyal to leave when Hitler assumed power, on the grounds that their duty now was to unseat Hitler. Others, despairing of this possibility, fled to protect themselves and family. 
<P>
An American who left the country in wartime can properly be thought of as a deserter. But what about an American who decides that the property he has accumulated he wishes to retain for himself and his family? How heavily should he be punished? Should we allow him only thirty days in his ex-country? Three days? No days? 
<P>
Loyalty has always got to be contingent. The current issue of <I>First Things</I> publishes five deeply philosophical essays wondering whether loyalty has been forfeited to a government whose judiciary arrogates authority over life and death, as the Supreme Court has done in the matter of abortions, and threatens to do on euthanasia. A belief in equal treatment under the law is not frivolous; and the citizen made to pay at class-warfare rates, current or prospective, can presumably be thought of as an Andrew Carnegie in reverse. We must remember what Burke taught us, that a country to be loved must be lovely.

November 5, 1996
<P>
Dear Rusty
<P>
We win! Again! Almost. 
<P>
I'm sitting here with Tip and the kids watching the early returns -- things are looking pretty good right now. And although it's still too close to call, the phone has been ringing off the hook. 
<P>
Dick Holbrooke called to say he was rested and ready for whatever Cabinet-level foreign-policy post we might need to fill. I thanked him. 
<P>
The second call was from Dad. 
<P>
``Congratulations, my boy,'' he said over the sound of ice in a tall glass. ``Now tell me, how did all those monks get all that money?'' 
<P>
``It's complicated, Dad,'' I said. 
<P>
``You'd better hope it is, boy. You'd better hope it's too complicated for the American people to figure out, too.'' 
<P>
``Dad,'' I said, with a warning tone to my voice, ``don't start with me.'' 
<P>
``Well anyway, congratulations.'' 
<P>
``I haven't won yet, Dad. The polls are still open.''
<P>
``Not for your mother and me,'' he answered. ``We're going to bed.'' 
<P>
And then he hung up. To be honest, Rusty, I was disappointed. His favorite President will always be LBJ for, among other reasons, his incredible fundraising prowess. I thought maybe this was an area in which I could claim some small right to say, ``Look how much I raised, Daddy.'' 
<P>
It's complicated, this father-and-son business. 
<P>
Dick Holbrooke called again, to remind me that in the ``Washington Whispers'' column of U.S. News & World Report his photograph ran with the caption ``Warren Christopher's likely replacement.''
<P>
The next call was from Dick Gephardt. Tipper made me take the call in my study so she could listen in and make gagging faces. 
<P>
``Hello, Dick,'' I said. 
<P>
``Hello, Mr. Vice President,'' Dick responded. ``As you know, it isn't clear yet whether our party has regained control of the House or Senate. But if we do, I will urge the various committee chairs to stop hounding your Administration with groundless investigations.'' 
<P>
``Well, thank you, Dick.'' 
<P>
``The press will have a field day. You know, obstruction of justice, cover-up, that sort of thing. So in an effort to be evenhanded, I think we'll let one investigation go forward. Just for appearances' sake, you understand.'' 
<P>
``I guess I do, Dick,'' I said sadly. ``So which one will continue? Whitewater? Castle Grande?'' 
<P>
``Nope.'' 
<P>
``The billing records? Filegate?'' 
<P>
``Nope.'' 
<P>
``The Travel Office? John Huang?'' 
<P>
``Nope. I think we'll just focus on that Buddhist monastery. Really pick that one apart.'' 
<P>
``Gosh, Dick,'' I said. ``I was at that fund-raiser.'' 
<P>
``You were?'' he asked. ``Really? I guess I hadn't read that. Oh well.'' 
<P>
He's a curious guy, Rusty. I think some of his personal hostility to me comes from the fact that I'm much taller and have eyebrows. The rumor going around town is that he's going to run against me in '00, but I think, in the end, he won't. In fact, I think I'll run unopposed. People just can't seem to get enough of Al Gore. 
<P>
Dick Holbrooke called again, to remind me that his cholesterol was in the lowest percentile. 
<P>
Then Bill called. He was very ``up.''
<P>
``Congratulations, Mr. President,'' I said. ``Although in four years, I guess you'll be saying that to me.'' 
<P>
``Yeah, yeah. About that,'' Bill said. 
<P>
``What's up?'' I asked. I could sense concern.
<P>
``Well,'' he said, ``it's this scandal stuff. I have a feeling it might hamper our agenda.'' 
<P>
``Are you thinking about a pardon?'' I asked, with some trepidation. 
<P>
``Oh yeah,'' he said. 
<P>
``Who?'' I asked. 
<P>
``You,'' he said. 
<P>
``Me?'' I asked. ``Why would you need to pardon me?'' 
<P>
``Not me pardon you, Al. The other way around,'' Bill replied as he hung up.
<P>
Holbrooke called again to discuss his ``Grand Strategy for America in the 21st Century.'' I must have drifted off and started snoring, and he hung up rather abruptly.
<P>
It's still too early to call the election, but it's got all the earmarks of a landslide -- just like in 1972! 
<P>
Gotta run. Ken Starr is on the line. I guess he wants to congratulate me.

Vice President Gore says he ``didn't know'' he was in a Buddhist temple when he picked up a check for $140,000. Contributions from tax-exempt organizations are illegal, so it helps not to notice the incense, saffron robes, shaved heads, and gongs when collecting from priests who have taken a vow of poverty.

It's a story that, for the Clinton Administration, sounds quite familiar: Little Rock connections, Webster Hubbell, casual contempt for the law, Ron Brown wheelings-and-dealings. But it has a host of bizarre twists: a fundraiser held at a Buddhist temple, a multi-billion-dollar Indonesian conglomerate called the Lippo Group, a guy named Gandhi giving more than $300,000 to the Democratic National Committee. None of this tangle, already known as Indogate, will be sorted out before the election, a fact that White House spokesman Michael McCurry openly laughs about. What we do know is that almost certainly money from Indonesian sources has been laundered through Democratic coffers, and that one of the rainmakers, fundraiser John Huang, was rewarded with an influential spot in the Commerce Department; it may well be that the free-flowing Asian cash has influenced the Administration's trade and human-rights policies. However, the scandal probably is of little benefit to Bob Dole in the short term, and in the long term it will only create more pressure for misguided Perot-style campaign-finance reform. So, attention, goo-goo reformers: it doesn't matter what the law is as long as the Administration has no interest in obeying it.

Jack Kemp's aspirations were set back by his lackluster performance against Al Gore. Kemp did not clearly win a single exchange with the Vice President. He talked about growth and tax cuts, without making the case for the 15 per cent tax cut that is the centerpiece of the Dole campaign. On questions of foreign policy and American mores, he let Gore position himself to his right. Gore left the Administration wide open for an attack on its policies on race and sex preferences; Kemp fumbled. Worst of all, he seemed to accept Gore's contention that every Republican other than Kemp is a racial troglodyte. Since he doesn't believe that, why didn't he say so? Jack Kemp needs a bridge to his base.

Democrats were recruiting their congressional candidates during the dog days after the 1994 elections -- and it shows. Here are seven of the wackiest: 1) Maria Elena Milton (running against Rep. John Shadegg, Ariz.), a LaRouche Democrat who supports, ahem, ambitious infrastructure projects like a Eurasian Land Bridge (can that be what they mean by a ``bridge to the future''?); 2) Bill Yellowtail (against Rick Hill, Montana), running despite two felony convictions for knocking off a camera store and stealing $2,000 worth of equipment (hey, if he doesn't win, there's always the White House Security Office); 3) Walter Capps (Rep. Andrea Seastrand, Calif.), who at the Democratic National Convention invoked ``global leaders'' like ``Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Maya Angelou . . .''; 4) Gerald Houseman (Rep. Mark Souder, Ind.), running in a district dependent on the auto industry after serving as chairman of the Committee for Zero Automobile Growth; 5) Ron Dinicola (Rep. Phil English, Pa.), a Hollywood lawyer with a client list of sleaze balls that puts Johnnie Cochran to shame; 6) Dennis Kucinich (Rep. Martin Hoke, Ohio), whose chief credential is presiding as mayor over the default of the city of Cleveland (hmm, maybe he is qualified); 7) Kevin Quigley (Rep. Jack Metcalf, Wash.) caught laundering campaign funds (and he wasn't even working at the DNC). If all this sounds bad, just wait to see whom the Democrats have lined up for committee chairmanships . . .

``The last time I checked, the Constitution said 'of the people, by the people, and for the people.' That's what the Declaration of Independence said.'' Read it again, carefully. This was President Clinton refuting Republican ``anti-government'' views to a crowd of supporters after the debate. The last time we checked, the phrase was in Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. No wonder Mr. Clinton sneered at Mr. Dole's ``old'' ideas. He has never encountered any of them.

Be careful what you ask for. Two of California's largest companies, the electronics giant Hewlett-Packard and the mammoth HMO Kaiser Permanente, asked voters for their opinions on racial favoritism (they didn't phrase it quite like that, to be sure). Their intent in paying for the poll -- and scheduling its release for a few weeks prior to the November elections -- was apparently to slow momentum for the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would consign race and gender preferences in government programs to history's ash heap. But respondents didn't cooperate. The pollsters forsook candor for euphemism, asking for views on ``affirmative action'' rather than ``reverse discrimination,'' but those surveyed still turned thumbs down -- favoring an end to such unfairness in the private sector by 51 per cent to 36 per cent, and in government programs by 49 per cent to 40 per cent. At the same time, 76 per cent supported remedial courses to bring disadvantaged minorities up to speed, so the opposition to preferential hiring can't be caricatured as ``mean spirited.'' All in all, the results were pronounced ``very troubling'' by representatives of the two companies. It does help explain why support for CCRI, at least as of this writing, has proved impervious to every demagogic attack (and there has been no other kind) launched against it. Good sense lives, even in the state that gave us Jerry Brown, Valley Girls, the Summer of Love, Hewlett-Packard, and Kaiser Permanente.

Serious criminals have been ineligible for naturalization since 1802 -- or were, until the Clinton Administration got into the act. Early this month Rosemary Jenks of the Center for Immigration Studies gave the Senate Immigration Subcommittee documents showing that the Administration took unethical -- perhaps illegal -- steps to, in the words of one Gore aide, ``produce a million new citizens before election day.'' The White House pressured the Immigration and Naturalization Service to meet hefty ``production goals.'' INS employees rubberstamped applications, ignoring evidence of fraud on the required English and civics tests. Worse, the INS evaded or ignored the results of FBI fingerprint checks. ``One of these days,'' an INS employee complained in a memo, the INS ``is going to naturalize an axe-murderer.'' FBI and INS records show that hundreds of violent criminals have received citizenship over the last year. Maybe <I>they</I> can replace Craig Livingstone.

New York City voters will unfortunately find it necessary to repeat themselves November 5, when they will vote No on a ballot proposal softening the term limits imposed on the City Council, the mayor, and other officeholders in 1993. The original law, which imposed a two-term limit, would force New York's most limpet-like politicians out of office by 2001. But the City Council has offered a new measure that would raise the limit to three terms and restart the clock, so that many would not have to leave until 2007. The battle pits New Yorkers for Term Limits and Ronald Lauder, who favor the original measure, against Council Speaker Peter Vallone, Mayor Giuliani, and a horde of special interests that have ponied up hundreds of thousands of dollars to pass the new ``reform.'' Their ads say the city will be at a virtual standstill without the Council elders, but polls show that even liberal New Yorkers don't mind that. And if term limits can make it <I>there</I>, they can make it anywhere.

Russia's charismatic hardliner, Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, was the victim of a pre-emptive strike on October 17, when Kremlin rivals forced his ouster as Boris Yeltsin's national security advisor. It was bound to happen sooner or later; only the timing was a surprise. Lebed's rivals feared his free-wheeling diplomacy, his self-promotion, and his growing popularity. The idea of Lebed wielding power inside the Kremlin while Yeltsin was in the hospital for heart surgery seemed too dangerous. But he will be a formidable political force wherever he is. The Russian people, reeling from corruption and mafia/ nomenklatura rule, view Lebed as their potential savior. It is the classic formula for a man on horseback. The Clinton Administration's Russia policy hangs by a (surgical) thread.

God is love, and, during their upcoming conference in Zimbabwe, clergymen from the World Council of Churches want to be allowed to practice godliness on all fronts. They have persuaded Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, to relax his views on one type of love. Mugabe calls homosexuals ``worse than dogs and pigs'' and punishes homosexual acts with 12-month jail terms. While they're in Harare, though, the gays of the WCC will be free to love each other, and any willing Zimbabweans, as their Christian consciences dictate. Of course this kind of thing -- pressuring Third World nations to alter their traditional folkways to suit Western tastes -- used to be called ``cultural imperialism,'' especially by the WCC. But, ``Behold, I make all things new.''

When she was a 19-year-old student in Birmingham, England, Claire Short got pregnant out of wedlock and gave the baby up for adoption. Miss Short grew up to be a left-wing Member of Parliament. The baby grew up to be Toby Graham, a conservative lawyer who once ran for Parliament as a Tory. Recently Mr. Graham sought out his birth mother and, in a joyous moment for both mother and son, found her. On Mr. Graham's first visit to Miss Short's office, she worried that his ``posh accent'' might alarm her lefty colleagues. It didn't. Since their reunion, Tory son and Labour mom have got along beautifully. Indeed, there is something for everyone in this tale: environmentalists will note that Tory Toby was raised by a rich family; fans of <I>The Bell Curve</I> can see that a mother and son from two different worlds both show ambition, drive, and political skill. Well, for almost everyone. As Miss Short explains, at moments during her pregnancy she contemplated an abortion, but it would have been illegal, and her parents would not have consented to any abortion, legal or otherwise. How many unmarried women who unintentionally get pregnant today will experience such joyous reunions?

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> year's most wooed voter waited outside the Louisville Slugger Museum on a chilly Kentucky evening three weeks before the election. In front of this monument to baseball, she sported a blue sweatshirt that declared incongruously ``Soccer Mom For Clinton.'' Still, her patience and clothing investment paid off. A delighted Bill Clinton greeted her with his biggest grin of the day as he worked the crowd following his speech. 
<P>
Clinton supporters with that kind of dedication were thin on the ground. The President with a need to be loved was encountering crowds that mainly wanted to see a celebrity. On his 17-hour campaign trip to Tennessee, Ohio, and Kentucky -- to woo, respectively, partisan Democrats, blue-collar workers, and moderate suburbanites (especially those elusive Soccer Moms) --  most voters were friendly enough. But they had apparently turned out for the meetings without any particular enthusiasm for Mr. Clinton's politics, or indeed any politics. How they went home is quite another matter -- and an alarming one for the GOP.
<P>
The press was, well, too inert to really notice. On the media plane accompanying Air Force One, White House press secretary Mike McCurry cheerfully complained that he was unable ``to raise a pulse'' from the seventy or so regular passengers. ``They just don't think it's a race,'' he explained, checking to make sure my heart wasn't pounding under the illusion that a real political fight might be under way. The seasoned Clinton-watchers balanced their checkbooks and talked baseball between stops.
<P>
Was there, indeed, a presidential race to be interested in? This campaign swing yielded little evidence of one. No local GOP forces bothered to show the flag -- an onlooker at the Knoxville airport whose cap was emblazoned ``Busch'' came near to expressing the only Republican sentiment of the long day. And though Clinton - Gore lawn signs were scattered along the motorcade route, not a single bumper sticker was evident for either ticket. Spirited opposition erupted only once, when people lining the sidewalk in Dayton booed the buses marked ``Media'' -- clearly a bipartisan sentiment.
<P> 
Joe Lockhart, the campaign's press secretary, explained to the few reporters willing to listen that the day's trip was devoted to shoring up the President's lead. And Clinton is clearly energized by the crowds he wades into -- shaking hands, hugging the people closest to him. When it comes to speaking, he calibrates his message to his audience, barely glancing at notes during lengthy, detailed speeches. Judged technically, it is the performance of a professional politician at the top of his form. But does it ``connect'' with his audiences?
<P>
At the first stop, in Knoxville, a friendly audience of partisan Democrats waited more than two hours to hear Al Gore and Bill Clinton. The candidates were there ostensibly to announce an initiative to hook up every classroom in the country to the Internet (not to mention a $100-million subsidy to Silicon Valley) -- what Lockhart calls the ``wonk stuff.'' A large banner on the stage proclaimed: ``Building America's Bridge to the Twenty-First Century.'' Gore, oddly the more animated of the two, raised his arms and waved to the crowd in his awkward schoolboy way, while Clinton merely delivered a small, curt salute.
<P>
It was Gore's job that day to slam the Luddites in the Republican Party (a bold tactic from a foe of the internal-combustion engine). He duly warned against a ``digital divide'' between the haves and the have-nots if every classroom in the country is not on the Internet. He prophesied that nearby Oak Ridge Laboratory would be closed by the Democrats' congressional ``opponents'' who had attempted to cut the science and technology budget by a third. And he reminded the audience that he first started talking about the Information Superhighway twenty years ago. (It seems longer.) In those days he had ``dreamed'' of a girl in Carthage, Tennessee, who could plug into the Library of Congress from her home. (Poor Tipper -- married to the only man for whom a girl is merely a peripheral to a computer.)
<P>
Clinton wisely stuck to computer software, but he communicated real enthusiasm for the wonders of technology. ``There is more computer power in a Ford Taurus you drive to the supermarket,'' he declared, ``than there was in Apollo 11 when Neil Armstrong took it all the way to the Moon.''
<P> 
This was no innocent fascination with applied science -- the President's point was that government deserves the credit for such advances: ``Of the 12 Americans who won the Nobel Prize last year, all 12 had received government support for their research,'' he said. His enthusiasm for technological advance was really an optimistic vision of what the future holds as long as government leads the way. ``I know that you all believe in this,'' he told his Democratic listeners, advising them to fight the current antipathy to government by having at hand ``three or four examples that people can identify with'' of how their tax dollars are being profitably used. 
<P>
He was talking to the right audience. A year ago, the party faithful in Knoxville had little to celebrate. Today they were excited by a rosy future -- not that of technology but that of the Democratic Party under Bill Clinton. They could see public-sector jobs dancing before their eyes.
<P>
It was a different audience that afternoon in Dayton, an enthusiastic blue-collar crowd with young children in tow who gathered in a small square downtown not to cheer a candidate but to see their President. When Air Force One touches down and the President's twenty-car motorcade winds through the streets, a serious kind of carnival comes to town. Sharpshooters prowl the roofs, Secret Service agents in black jumpsuits flank the stage, and ``Hail to the Chief'' heralds the main attraction. All the king's horses and all the king's men provide an excitement missing from the politics of the race.
<P>
Before this bi-partisan audience, Clinton was restrained, self-consciously ``presidential.'' He joined the local politicians on stage with his small salute for the cheering crowd. But he seemed uncomfortable in the lead role. Does he sense that he lacks something, some mysterious presidential gene, some measure of dignity that the office demands? Bill Clinton provokes such questions at regular intervals. At one moment he is all smooth self-confidence; the next moment a nervous little boy peeps out, wondering if the imposture has been detected. This could just explain the gender gap: half the women's vote has been seduced, the other half persuaded they are his mother.
<P>
That day's only mention of foreign policy is also a local reference. Clinton thanked the audience for their role in the Dayton Accords. Special mention went to a woman whose restaurant fed the Bosnian negotiators.
<P>
Having solved the Bosnian question, the President ran through the litany of good news that doubles as his record. Over the past four years 10.5 million new jobs created . . . household income up $1,600 . . . the highest home-ownership rate in 15 years . . . 1.9 million fewer people on welfare . . . the biggest drop in child poverty in twenty years . . . the lowest poverty rate among seniors ever recorded . . . the minimum wage up . . . crime rates down. As he soared to a climax, the President became the very incarnation of Progress. ``We have doubled life expectancy for people living with HIV . . . we have discovered two genes that cause breast cancer.'' Really? Bill on his own? Or Bill, Al, and Hillary? 
<P>
After this list of accomplishments, Clinton declared, ``We are better off than we were four years ago, but we've got a long way to go to build that bridge to the twenty-first century.'' The bridge metaphor is stolen from Bob Dole, and the agenda it represents stolen in part from Newt Gingrich. But these voters, applauding and impressed, have not been persuaded by Dole and Kemp that they could do better.
<P> 
During a bus trip from the airport to a rally site, one reporter tells a colleague that he hadn't been on a campaign trip in a while. ``You're not missing anything,'' he is assured. ``It's still that f --  --  bridge.'' The reporters are merely irritated by the repetition; its significance is either ignored or not grasped. This is a serious lapse -- because if Clinton wins on November 5, the bridge will be transformed into a mandate for enlarging the scope of government.
<P>
<font size=+3>L</font><font size=+1>ockhart</font> admits that the bridge metaphor suggested itself to Clinton after Dole's San Diego speech. Symptomatic of his butterfly-minded campaign, Dole dropped his ``bridge to the past,'' and with it his defense of the virtuous communities of yesteryear, as soon as questions were raised about it. But he had inadvertently provided Clinton with an effective symbol for his second term. Audiences are drawn to the imagery of a bridge that leads to an exciting new century of untold wonders. 
<P>
But they also feel an undercurrent of foreboding, which Clinton encourages. He speaks with urgency about the need to be as prepared as he is for the new millennium. Listeners are meant to conclude that without Clinton to guide them, they might be left behind in this tired old century. Of course, if his audiences were to sit idly in lawn chairs along Knoxville's Interstate 64, the new century would still come upon them. But the President inspires them to want to join him in preparing for the crossing.
<P> 
And what they must do is help him expand the reach of government. Clinton punctuates each mention of a new federal initiative with his raised fist and the plea, ``Will you help me build that bridge to the twenty-first century?'' Audiences invariably applaud.
<P>
The agenda that would usher in the new millennium in a Clinton second term includes tax breaks for education, child care, home-ownership, and health care; an expansion of the Family Leave Act; expansion of health insurance for the unemployed and ``respite benefits'' for families of Alzheimer's patients; federal support for school remodeling; tax credits for college tuition; a corps of tutors to teach reading; a ban on certain bullets; more federal cops on the beat; and Internet access in every classroom. 
<P>
All these programs are meant to appeal to the middle class, and each is modest in itself. The public refused to swallow a whole beaker of federalized health care, but recent audiences appear eager to take the small sips Clinton now offers from the federal trough. 
<P>
As yet, Republicans have not found an effective response to these tactics. Apparently fearful of the post-partum fury of millions of soccer moms, they supported the mandate that insurance companies cover 48-hour hospital stays for mothers and babies after normal deliveries. (When this soccer mom's fingers had to be pried off the bedpost for me to be sent home three days after the birth of my youngest son, it didn't occur to me that my pique should be of concern to the Federal Government.)
<P>
A ragtime band played for the expectant suburban crowd that waited for the President in downtown Louisville. Mike McCurry explained that Clinton was hoping to help freshman Congressman Mike Ward, who is in a tough re-election fight. And the campaign provided him with a pleasant local backdrop for doing so. A 120-foot Louisville Slugger bat stood behind the President as he sat through the local politicians' exploitation of all the obvious metaphors. ``We have 26 'Clinton cops' on our streets because the President went to bat for us,'' declared Louisville's mayor. The President was being invited to hit his message out of the ballpark.
<P>
But in front of the suburbanites he is coolly winning over, Clinton risked no partisan appeal. He implausibly noted the remarkable ``influence'' that Ward had wielded in his one term, but noticeably refrained from a pitch for a Democratic House. The Democratic challenger to Senator Mitch McConnell was praised as a ``fine man,'' but the balance of power in the Senate went unmentioned. It was above-the-battle, soothingly presidential, not about politics at all.
<P> 
And Clinton didn't make the typical liberal case for the welfare state, but rather explained how the Federal Government can step in to reduce the tensions and inconveniences of everyday middle-class life. This notion of a family-friendly Federal Government went down well with this audience.
<P>
A relaxed Mike McCurry stood in the evening chill watching the cheering crowd. He expressed surprise that he had enjoyed such a quiet day just three weeks before the election. Bob Dole, campaigning with Colin Powell in Ohio, had simply not been heard from. ``We had expected an attack on our foreign-policy record, or on ethics, something like 'I'd have people of Colin Powell's caliber in my Cabinet.' But nothing,'' he marveled.
<P> 
The secret of this campaign is that under the guise of non-partisan presidential appearances, politics <I>is</I> going on. As he coasts to re-election, Bill Clinton is fashioning a new Democratic coalition. The partisan liberals who welcomed him to Knoxville are energized by the prospect of victory -- while Dayton's blue-collar voters and Louisville's suburbanites are seduced into increasing their dependence on a government that responds to their ``needs'' one at a time. 
The GOP comforts itself that over 60 per cent of the public believes ``the Federal Government is too big and does too much.'' But how much does that matter when the President is putting in 17-hour days to make that belief a pious irrelevancy -- as irrelevant as his admission that ``the era of Big Government is over''? 
Too many Republicans have convinced themselves that a Clinton victory will be merely an interregnum between idea-fuelled GOP victories in 1994 and 1998. But if Bill Clinton builds a new coalition that includes suburban voters, the GOP will discover that ideas are not everything. Coalitions too have consequences.

<H2>A Question of Character?</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, OCTOBER 4<br>
In anticipation of the debate, the focus was hard on the presidential contest. What surprises is the universality of comments and even jokes at the expense of Mr. Clinton. A prominent Canadian publisher was saying last summer, ``Most Americans are non-ideological. When all is said and done, they're not going to vote for Clinton against Dole.'' But of course if that were true, why are these non-ideological voters having the pollsters on? If they are disgusted with Clinton because among other things he lies, how do they excuse their own lying to the pollsters?
<P>
Another publisher whispered the joke going the rounds, that Mr. Clinton would turn out to be the first president whose wife made his license plates. The Speaker of the House brandished a $20 bill at a private dinner hosted by Rush Limbaugh. ``Here it is -- that Dole will win.'' ``Aren't you asking for odds'' the taker asked. ``No odds. Even money.''
<P>
There is much buzz about town over the editorial in the weekly <I>New York Observer</I>, a highbrow leftist inner-New York concentrate of political and social passions. It is the creature of Arthur Carter, an engaged multi-millionaire who gets his kicks from opinion, so much so that for quite a few years he owned The Nation magazine, which is where the Bureau of Weights and Measures visits to define hard-left.
<P>
Well, Mr. Carter astonished his audience by running a front-page editorial in the current issue headlined ``Bob Dole, the Right Choice in '96!/A Vote for Character Over Sleaze.'' The editorial goes through the necessary disavowals (``the religious right and the right-to-lifers are wild-eyed fanatics who threaten our hard-won liberties'' to conceive children and then kill them) but quickly comes to the point. ``In this election year, character is not merely one of several issues demanding our attention. It is the only issue. That makes our decision easier. Bob Dole has character, and Bill Clinton has none. So Bob Dole is our choice.''
<P>
The cosmopolitan editor then lets loose. ``We have been embarrassed for nearly four years. We have suffered too long the sins of those yahoos Mr. Clinton transported from Arkansas, so many of whom seem to have spent the entire term answering prosecutors' questions . . . Instead of a role model, we have a floozy who will consort with anyone if it means a bump in the popularity polls . . . His governing style is a product of his generation's self-indulgence and Little Rock's loose political morals. He knows nothing of sacrifice and little of the real world, for he has been talking, and talking, and talking, for the last quarter-century. Historians will one day note that in 1996, the oldest Presidential nominee in U.S. history was a man of action, while one of the youngest incumbents was a sedentary yapper . . . We used to ask our Presidents about great issues of war and peace. We ask President Clinton about his underwear. Worse, he gives us an answer . . . [Hillary is just as bad] Now we have a chance to rid ourselves of both. A perfect twofer.''
<P>
In anticipation of Sunday's debate, much time was given over to advising Sen. Dole. James Carville, the Democratic strategist and overseer of Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign, was amiable enough to give the other side some advice in <I>Newsweek</I>. He stressed the need for Bob Dole to appear as the underdog, not the loser. And he admonished him not to go after Mr. Clinton personally. ``You know he's going to come back smiling. It'll only feed into the worst perceptions of you (that you're mean-spirited) and best perceptions of him (that he can take a punch).'' Robert Novak advised the candidate to stress Dole's advocacy of a tax cut. The Speaker likes to point out that the average family should reflect that at the end of the first Dole year in office, it would pay $1,300 less to Internal Revenue than under Clinton one more time. The gains would be not only material but political, forcing the shrinkage of a government groaning with the bureaucratic burden.
<P>
Yes, but it isn't easy to get into the ring and draw attention to your fine character, as distinguished from the base character of your opponent. Mr. Carville, in his friendly piece, added, ``Another thing: Don't mention your war wound more than twice. Understand that your injury entitles you to the gratitude and respect of the nation. But not a vote for president.''
<P>
Well, we'll soon see. A lot rides on it, including twenty of Newt's dollars.

White House aides are split over the issue of pardons for Whitewater felons. Some want them announced at the beginning of President Clinton's inaugural address, while others think they should wait until the end.
<P>
<hr>
<P>


Among the Clinton Administration's lucky breaks this year is the timing of investigations into its misconduct: no Whitewater- or Travelgate-related indictments before November, and now no serious second look into Filegate either. In a recent sworn deposition to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mari Anderson, assistant to Georgetown bouncer <I>cum</I> White House security chief Craig Livingstone, says that contrary to their sworn testimony, Livingstone and other security-office employees knew all along that they were improperly obtaining the files of former GOP officials. She also sheds light on a mysterious six-month gap in a log recording when FBI files were removed from the security office: Livingstone et al. have suggested that the log just wasn't kept during this period, but Miss Anderson says it was, raising the possibility it was removed as part of a cover-up. (Can you say ``18-minute gap''?) Incredibly, Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch agreed to hold no more hearings on the matter before the election in order to win Democratic cooperation on a parks bill. See you next year.

Is it still the economy, stupid? Bill Clinton says so. But in an illuminating cover story in the October 7 <I>Forbes</I> magazine, <I>NR</I>'s Peter Brimelow and Ed Rubenstein examine problems in the current cyclical recovery that Clinton doesn't talk about. For one thing, the recovery is much weaker than the three preceding ones: an expansion of only about 13 per cent since it began (under George Bush, let the record show). And this recovery is now so old that a recession in the next presidential term is almost a statistical certainty. The federal deficit, about 2 per cent of GDP in 1996, is down, as it was at this point in the 1983 - 90 upswing. But that is because defense spending has collapsed (3.6 per cent of GDP today, down from 5 per cent in 1992) and because the Federal Government's tax take (19.4 per cent of GDP, up from 18.4) has risen to a level unprecedented in peacetime. Indeed, counting state and local taxes -- increased largely because of Washington's new habit of mandating programs -- Americans are paying more in taxes than at the height of World War II. Ironically, the bugaboos of the Reagan recovery -- federal borrowing, especially from foreigners; income inequality -- are actually worse under Clinton. Bottom line: Personal income has stagnated throughout the Clinton years. And it seems likely that per capita disposable income in the four quarters prior to the election will turn out to be below its long-term 2.1 per cent growth trend, despite an above-expectations 1996 so far. Since 1952 no incumbent party has held the White House with such wan numbers. This economy would not be a political problem -- for an aggressive opponent.

What Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gore ``really want to do'' is alarming to contemplate. Can you imagine Health Care Reform for every tree, bird, beast, and bug on the planet?

Under pressure from the Department of Education's Civil Rights office to boost girls' scores on the PSAT, the College Board announced that it would add a multiple-choice section on writing and language structure to the test. It has long been known that boys do better than girls on standardized tests, particularly on the math sections. (On the PSAT math section last year, boys averaged 50.8, on a scale of 20 to 80, compared to the girls' average of 47.4. On the verbal section the scores were 48.8 for boys, 48.6 for girls.) This is a ``problem'' because these tests play a large role in determining National Merit Scholarships, and as a result boys have an ``unfair'' advantage in the competition for these awards. The ``solution'' is to de-emphasize the math section. This is already accomplished by counting the verbal score twice in the Merit selection process; the new verbal section will further decrease the importance of a high math score. Women's groups, such as the Women's Rights Project, justify such tampering on the grounds that the tests <I>must</I> be ``biased'' against girls, since girls tend to receive slightly higher grades than boys in both high school and college. However, it seems more likely that any bias resides in the grades, which are subjectively awarded, than in the tests, which are scored by a machine. If we want to award equal numbers of scholarships to boys and girls, fine: make that the policy (keeping in mind that to do so tarnishes the actual achievements of girls). But stop pretending that these tests are standardized and these scholarships are based on merit.

A man wearing a Bob Dole mask and a ``really ugly yellow tie'' robbed a bank in Wheaton, Illinois, and, as he left, reminded everyone to vote. Mr. D. Craig Livingstone refuses to disclose how he is paying for his quickly mounting legal bills in the Filegate affair. These two items may be unrelated.

Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.) is a standard-issue down-the-line liberal. His opponent, Republican Gov. William Weld, styles himself an economic conservative and a social liberal. That's half true. Weld supports every item on the agenda of left-wing homosexual activists. But state spending has increased in his tenure and income-tax rates remain essentially at Dukakis levels. Weld favors discrimination against white males, environmental regulation, and industrial policy. He would provide crucial reinforcement for the dwindling ranks of liberal Republicans in the Senate. Worse, he is smart and affable; in the old boys' club of the Senate, he would tug the Republican caucus to the Left, damaging conservative causes far more than a re-elected Kerry. It's quite a dilemma. Weld's appalling rush to defend President Clinton for vetoing the partial-birth-abortion ban, however, tips the scale. To oppose first-trimester abortions requires an act of intellection which not all well-meaning people will make; to approve killing a baby in the process of being born indicates a deep failure of moral sentiment. Under the circumstances, we must urge conservatives to cast their votes for Conservative Party candidate Susan Gallagher.

California Attorney General Dan Lungren, an attractive young GOP figure, has been kicking up his heels. In August, he raided the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club -- which sells marijuana to people suffering from cancer, AIDS, and glaucoma -- on the grounds that pot-heads were getting it for recreational use (the Cannabis Buyers Club disputes the charge). This month, when characters in <I>Doonesbury</I> lamented the move, Lungren urged California newspapers to cancel the strip, saying it would ``lend credibility'' to Proposition 215 -- a referendum to legalize medical marijuana. We say Mr. Lungren loses credibility by fighting the drug war on its least defensible front. Will he ask California newsstands not to carry this issue?

In response to the new law restricting welfare for immigrants, George Soros, the Hungarian-born money manager, has announced that he will put up $50 million to start the Emma Lazarus Fund, which will aid legal immigrants by financing their citizenship applications and efforts to learn English. We applaud Mr. Soros's initiative. Appropriately, he is using his own money -- there was no welfare in Emma Lazarus's day -- and that money will (reportedly) go to immigrants themselves, rather than to professional lobbyists using immigrants to extort money from ordinary Americans, as is notoriously the case with Ford Foundation grants. But Mr. Soros must not stop here. In fairness, he should finance another fund to aid native-born Americans facing lower wages, job displacement, overcrowded schools, and the cost of relocation from their overwhelmed communities. He could even name it after someone who is being phased out of the American pantheon to make room for new heroes and heroines like Emma Lazarus -- someone who thought America did not need immigrants at all except perhaps for a few ``useful mechanics'' -- old whatshisname -- we've got it! -- George Washington.

The Afghan Taliban are getting a bad press in the West but, in fact, their rule could prove quite popular if they conquered Washington, D.C., as well as Kabul. True, some aspects of their Islamic political correctness might raise an eyebrow or two. For example, not everyone would enjoy having to grow a beard. Not everyone would gladly rise before dawn for the first of five daily prayers. The Taliban's encouraging women to stay (literally) at home might also be considered in some quarters to be a little over the top. But there would be compensations. The Taliban have banned television, music, and co-ed public transportation. In other words, three scourges of modern life -- mindless TV junk, the cacophony which passes for music these days, and overcrowded public transport -- would be eliminated at one bold stroke. Washington in particular would also benefit from the Taliban's crime-fighting tactics. After the first few hundred thieves started walking about the city without right hands, our crime rate would surely drop too. Most importantly, the Taliban would reduce inflationary pressures that might be building up again. A Kabul butcher who tried to sell his products above the official price had two of his fingers chopped off, which, while not monetarist in spirit, should surely be acclaimed by the bond market for anti-inflationary zeal. After the latest developments in Kabul, who can now say that the Clinton Administration, which has made friendly overtures toward the Taliban, supports only liberal causes?

As the house organ of the international New Class, fiscally conservative but socially liberal, <I>The Economist</I> has long felt highly modified rapture toward Margaret Thatcher. All the more significant, therefore, is its considered judgment on the balance-sheet of Thatcherism in a recent survey of Britain's new politics. After scrupulously examining the economic statistics on growth, productivity, and much else (and dispelling scores of much-loved left-wing myths in the process), it concludes: ``Until about 1979, Britain's economic decline relative to other countries was precipitous; since then, the decline has been arrested, and there are now signs that Britain is improving its position. If so, no other British government in modern times can claim as much.'' Within this broad conclusion, it cites dramatic achievements for the Iron Lady in labor-market reforms, privatization (in 1979 the cost of state support for nationalized industries ``was equivalent to e300 [$480] a year for every taxpayer. The privatized companies now . . . pay taxes on profits that amount to e100 [$160] a year for every taxpayer''), and competitiveness (in the 1980s, ``of Europe's ten most successful firms, seven were British''). All in all, the <I>Economist</I> survey reads like a British equivalent of NR's own ``The Real Reagan Record.'' But perhaps Mrs. Thatcher's greatest achievement is the modern Labour Party, which, under the shrewd leadership of Tony Blair, denounces her policies but promises not to reverse them.

The following letter to the editor appeared in the <I>New York Times</I>. We reprint it, admiringly. ``Congratulations for giving voice to the victims of the latest assault on the women of America ('Harassment in 2nd Grade? Queens Kisser Is Pardoned,' front page, Oct. 3). Reported incidents of second-grade kissing, the nation's most underreported crime, have doubled in the last week alone. Furthermore, studies have shown that most second-grade kissing occurs during recess, thereby detracting from the quality of the milk-and-cookies experience. As a result, many schoolgirl victims go on to develop anorexia and are therefore unable to protect themselves when they receive the traditional Super Bowl beating. For too long the tragedy of second-grade kissing has been ignored by the political and educational power structure. Careful research has shown that if boys kiss girls in the second grade, they will kiss them again in the future. Clearly these are not isolated incidents; they form a pattern. It is the pattern of a serial kisser. There is still time before the November elections for the presidential candidates to present their plans for dealing with this horror before more lives are ruined, so that we can go back to the important work of building on the successes of our public school system. [Signed] Joe Benning, Summit, N.J.''

The skeleton of a 9,300-year-old white guy has been unearthed at Kennewick, Washington, supporting a theory that Europeans crossed the Siberian land bridge around the same time Indians did -- or, who knows? maybe before. What happened to these white Native Americans at the hands of their red-skinned neighbors remains unclear, but the word ``genocide'' comes to mind. A committee of Shriners and Rotarians, acting as the modern-day descendants of the prehistoric white tribes, should draw up a list of demands, including reparations plus 9,300 years of interest, casino rights, and any ancient loafers or martini shakers that turn up.

Union, N.J.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>T'S</font> a sparse crowd at the Dole -  Kemp rally in Union, N.J., on this morning, the first cold snap of the season. I'm standing next to Buttman, wondering if I can bum a cigarette off him. The chill hasn't cooled Jack Kemp's ardor; his only concession to it is to promise a brief speech, which he accomplishes not by abbreviating his remarks but by talking even faster than usual. America is ``on the eve of the twenty-first century, a new millennium'' which will see ``a rebirth of freedom,'' ``an economic and social renaissance.''
<P>
When it comes to rebirth, Kemp knows whereof he speaks: his own political career has only recently emerged from a deep freeze. After 1992 he became the front-runner for presidential nomination. But in the intervening years Kemp lost a lot of support from party leaders, who tired of his indiscipline, and from conservative activists and intellectuals, who complained about his apostasies on labor, on spending, on immigration. The first group has been pleasantly surprised by the discipline Kemp has exhibited on the campaign trail. He has moved rightward on affirmative action and state benefits for illegal immigrants; his violent opposition to school choice during his 1988 presidential campaign is a distant memory. Otherwise, he has done little to appease his conservative critics.
<P>
Distant galaxies can receive light from dead stars. There is still an enormous reservoir of good will toward Kemp among rank-and-file Republicans. Republicans like having a spokesman who can't be trashed as mean-spirited or bigoted. When Kemp's selection was announced in Russell, Kan., he said, ``Bob and I are going to be asking for the support of every single American from the boroughs of New York to the barrios of California. . . . No one will be left behind and no one will be turned away.'' They're such simple little words, it's a wonder so few Republicans have the wit to say them.
<P>
In Union, Kemp said, ``This country has a great philosophy in both Jewish and Christian tradition that you do not leave the wounded behind, that you do not leave the weak behind, that you do not leave the elderly behind, that you do not leave the unborn behind.'' And then he segued into a defense of legal immigration. What links Kemp's positions on immigration, abortion, and economics is the view that people are potential assets, not liabilities. Whether or not he's right on the particulars, it's an appealing mindset and a compelling vision.
<P>
Kemp displays an unfailing dignity and civility, even when dealing with truly obnoxious protestors. (Such as the ones whose cries of ``Chicano power!'' were drowning out his wife's talk in her hometown of Fillmore, California.) He insists that Bill Clinton and Al Gore are ``our opponents, not our enemies.'' FDR, JFK, Hubert Humphrey: Kemp conjures up more dead liberals than the First Lady. At his best, this irenicism elevates politics. But it can easily degenerate into the Rodney King school of conservatism (``Can't we all just get along?''). He won't ``go negative'': he told the <I>Today</I> show, ``Nobody can tell me to do something I cannot do.'' The traditional metaphor for politics has been warfare, not football. (No, fans, they're not the same thing.) But the notion of politics as civil combat is lost on Kemp.
<P>
Kemp's stump speech includes the line, ``Out of many we must become one.'' Taken seriously, as a hardheaded project rather than an airy sentiment, that ambition would require rigorous thought and action. Is Kemp willing to act on the implications? He has been notably unhelpful to the California Civil Rights Initiative for the repeal of race and gender preferences, offering lukewarm support coupled with stern warnings not to ``tear up the state of California.'' Ward Connerly, chairman of the campaign for CCRI, notes that the civil-rights movement of the Fifties and Sixties was also ``divisive'' (which doesn't stop Kemp from chiding conservatives for having been on the wrong side).
<P>
One can sometimes detect a whiff of racial condescension in Kemp's rhetoric. Take his praise, however qualified, for Louis Farrakhan: it's impossible to imagine him speaking similarly about a white bigot who supported ``family values.'' (To judge from his speech in Union, Kemp may share Farrakhan's fascination with numerology: ``Four children, and 11 grandchildren, which adds up to 15, and I wore 15, and that's the size of the tax cut you will get.'') Yet there is a rough equality to his condescension: it embraces black and white alike. His pose as <I>the</I> racially enlightened Republican can exasperate his allies.
<P>
<font size=+3>N</font><font size=+1>OTABLY</font> absent from Kemp's rhetoric is any tragic sense of life, any sense of evil -- which is another way of saying that he lacks a conservative sensibility. He told the crowd in Union, ``That's what it means to be an American: to have nothing stand in your way, no barriers.'' Fr. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of the religious conservative journal <I>First Things</I>, finds in Kemp's politics traces of Christian Science, the faith of his youth, with its emphasis on the positive disposition of the will rather than on Original Sin. ``Jack's a throwback -- and I mean that in a positive and complimentary sense -- to a strain of can-do Americanism that believes that there is an answer to every problem, and that the answer is basically in the human will and the human mind.'' So, for Kemp, sustaining a free society is easy. All capitalism takes is access to capital; the inner city will bloom once we crack down on redlining. And faster economic growth is an adequate substitute for welfare reform.
<P>
Yet the standard charge that Kemp is too economistic -- that, as Pat Buchanan says, he believes in <I>Homo economicus</I> -- isn't entirely true. ``He's way ahead of the pack of other politicians in his understanding of religion and public life,'' says Neuhaus. His thoughtful speech on that subject at this year's Christian Coalition conference has won him (and its drafter, Mike Gerson) plaudits. More than any other public figure besides William Bennett, Kemp talks about the importance of the ``mediating structures'' of church, family, and civic groups. Within the Dole campaign, Kemp has been pushing for more attention on the horror of partial-birth abortion.
<P>
Kemp's intellect, too, gets unfairly knocked behind the closed doors of Republican insiders. True, he has the rough edges and ungainly enthusiasms of the self-taught, and he heeds to the sometimes-eccentric counsel of Jude Wanniski. But, as James Pinkerton points out, ``Kemp was smart enough to identify the single biggest intellectual movement to hit the Republican Party in the last half-century, which was the supply-side movement, and lead it.'' Supply-sider Alan Reynolds says, ``I think Jack is a little more serious than people give him credit for being. This isn't to say that he can handle every possible criticism -- he can handle most of them -- or that he can't be led astray by an argument that sounds good on the face of it but really isn't.'' He was the only major politician to provide a largely accurate critique of the Mexican devaluation and bailout of late 1994, and he appears to have arrived at it on his own.
<P>
His campaign does, however, leave him open to the charge of self-indulgence. His ostentatious refusal to go negative -- the normal job of a vice-presidential nominee -- is one example. Another is his disinclination to talk about the centerpiece of Dole's platform, the 15 per cent tax cut: instead of quantifying its benefits, Kemp mentions it as ``a down payment'' on radical tax reform (reviving an argument he lost, and probably deserved to lose, within the campaign). And then there's Kemp's failure, novel in his career, to court Reagan Democrats. One former Kemp staffer says, ``What I hear everywhere I go is, When are they going to unleash Kemp? Where's Jack?'' The answer: He's at the New Jersey Black Issues Convention in New Brunswick, a resolutely liberal gathering. Or he's in Harlem, or somewhere else where the Republican ticket won't win many votes. These visits may be reassuring to moderate suburbanites. Still, says longtime Kemp advisor Lawrence Kudlow, ``He needs to hang out with more football fans in near-in suburbs of Pittsburgh and Detroit and places like that where this election will be won or lost.''
<P>
Neither Kemp nor Dole has ever won a campaign involving a large, competitive electorate. This year probably won't change that record. Regardless, Kemp will still have a claim on conservative attentions. David Frum, who critiqued Kemp vigorously in <I>Dead Right</I>, says that Kemp is ``an old flame'' for conservatives: when he reappears after some years, they remember his attractions and forget what made him so impossible. Both traits were on display at the Black Issues Convention. In the midst of his rambling peroration, he declared, ``This is the <I>most</I> . . . <I>exciting</I> . . . <I>world</I> . . . <I>in history</I>'' -- raising, not for the first time, the question of what planet he is living on. Wherever it is, no doubt it's an inviting place.

<P>
NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 27<br>







The man on my right was Mr. Civic-Minded Citizen, and soon conversation closed in on the problem of education. In his hometown of Midland, Texas, he told me, the black population is about 5 per cent. But some years ago a federal judge ordered busing in an attempt to bring about integration by the checkerboard approach. What happened, he says, is that in grades 1, 2, and 3, Midland children do exactly as well as their peers elsewhere. ``But when they get to fourth grade, they are moved into a pool,'' from which the individual student is sent to this school or that, designed to effect what in the Sixties was called ``scatteration.'' From that point on through the rest of their primary education their academic achievements move down. Why? ``Because they are separated from the children they have been associated with, their teachers are mostly concerned with goals other than education. Anyway'' -- his hands moved up, resignedly, ``that's what happened.'' Was there no way to placate the judge with another plan that retained the neighborhood school and effected integration? ``Nothing we've come up with.''
<P>
Elsewhere, the education issue focuses strongly on ``Catholic schools.'' The term is in quotation marks because the Catholic schools under consideration are hardly seminaries designed to introduce young students to recent papal encyclicals. The schools in question -- in New York, in Washington, D.C., in Milwaukee -- aren't restricted to Catholic students. One high school in New York, with which I am familiar, is preponderantly black and Hispanic, its students primarily from single-parent households. One course in religion is taught, as one might expect. It has never been asserted about the school that it is primarily a religious institution. But in order to attend it, students' families, or friends, have to come up with $3,000. The cost per student in the public schools is $9,000. In the public schools, 15 per cent or fewer of the graduates go on to college. In the Catholic schools, the figure is 85 per cent.
<P>
Mr. William Bulger, formerly the undeniable boss of the city of Boston, and president of the Massachusetts Senate for almost 18 years, fought hard against the ideological bureaucracy, whose militant right hand has been the <I>Boston Globe</I>. In his book, <I>While the Music Lasts: My Life in Politics</I>, Mr. Bulger, now a professor at the University of Massachusetts, recalls the havoc brought on by the grandees of social architecture whose first (and only) mandate has been integration. But a side interest, fanatical in other quarters, has been a reading of the First Amendment that tells us that it is unconstitutional to ``use public money'' for ``religious schools.'' The teachers' unions are mobilized on the issue, and, as with busing, nothing very much happens except illiteracy, which prospers.
<P>
On another bent, a street-wise Democratic office-holder spoke about what one might expect from President Clinton in Term Two. ``Of course, he will do something about Medicare expenses. Why? Because he has to.'' Indeed. Unless by the year 2001 somebody invents a pill that abolishes every affliction from aneurysms to whooping cough, permitting Americans at an agreeable old age to wake up dead one morning, we are heading for an unbearable fiscal problem. My acquaintance reminded me that Mr. Fiscal is greatly profiting from the Depression of the Thirties. How so? Well, Americans walking into the retirement ages of 62 - 65 aren't very numerous, because back in 1931 - 34 Americans were not having many children. But as morale mounted, in mid-decade, the birth rate rose. Its effects will be felt at the end of the century. 
<P>
It is sad, really, that no major political candidate is facing these issues head on. A successful Catholic school is no more offensive to general social objectives than a Catholic hospital that has crosses in patients' rooms. Under-educated black children are not benefited by under-educated white children. A slight stall in public spending on Medicare and Social Security does not make the looming crisis disappear. But our democratic system tends not to give us the major issues to confront. What if Mr. Dole had said that the Medicare program simply had to be rewired; that if the Constitution is really telling us that busing is required and religious schools are ineligible for public support, then let's revise the First Amendment, to make it mean what we lived with quite comfortably for a hundred and fifty years.
<P>
What a rush such proposals would bring to Inert America. And if this time around he failed, Mr. Dole would have the satisfaction felt by Winston Churchill, the first few times around.

Dear Rusty
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>







We win!!
<P>
Well, almost. Bill had a terrific first debate with Bob Dole. ``Four years ago, you took me on faith. Now, there's a record.'' Pretty good, huh? 
<P>
So now it's up to me to give Jack Kemp the old Gore one-two, and let me tell you, I am raring to go! I've spent the past few days boning up on Kemp's record, and I am prepared to play hardball. I'm not proud of it, but I do understand the essential role of the Vice President, which is, besides preparing to run for President myself, to get tough on the opposition. 
<P>
``If you liked Ronald Reagan, you'll love Jack Kemp!'' How's that for withering? And trust me, there's more where that came from.
<P> 
I'm sitting in the green room right now, Rusty, waiting for the red light to go on and for the debate to begin. And I'll be honest with you: I'm not at all nervous. I banished Tipper from the room a few minutes ago -- she was pretty helpful getting me ready for tonight, but I got tired of hearing her ask me every five minutes to ``do the Macarena one more time.'' I mean, I'm no show-business expert -- although I believe that Bill Clinton and I have contributed significantly to reducing the amount of violence that reaches our children through television, and we've been highly active in preparing our nation for the future of telecommunications (How does that sound? Too stiff? Let me know) -- but my understanding of show business is that you always leave them wanting more. So no, I don't plan to ``do the Macarena'' again, no matter how much Tipper asks.
<P>
In a way, Rusty, tonight is just a warm-up. Let's be honest: Bill and I are cruising to victory in November. After that, it's basically four years of prosperity, a couple of cold days in Iowa and New Hampshire, and then it's me and Jack Kemp, back again behind a couple of lecterns. 
<P>
So, tonight, I have to establish my strength. Let me give you a sample of my battle plan: 
<P>
If Kemp talks about his nutty tax-cut idea, my response is going to be: ``As I cradled my dying sister in my arms, held her for the last time, as the tears streamed down her cheeks, mingled with mine, she looked up into my eyes and said, 'Al, promise me that you won't take the country back to the supply-side Reagan Eighties, which gave tax cuts to the rich and ballooned the deficit, saddled our children with debt and widened the gap between rich and poor.''' 
<P>
If Kemp talks about the environment, my response is going to be: ``As my son, bleeding and unconscious, lay in the street -- I could hear the sirens wail as the ambulance drew near, and Tipper was silently praying -- and I noticed that his little body was slumped against a storm drain, a drain that empties directly into the ocean, I made a silent vow that I would do everything in my power to clean up the environment.''
<P>
If Kemp makes a comment about drug use going up, my response is going to be: ``When my daughter -- whom I love more than anything -- ate ice cream too quickly, she suffered from a tremendous headache. And as she clutched at her head, exclaiming loudly at the pain, Tipper and I both put down our spoons, looked at each other, and made a solemn vow to fight this deadly scourge that afflicts our children.'' 
<P>
If he brings up Bosnia or Haiti: ``My father, who was himself a senator from Tennessee, is almost ninety years old. He won't live very long. Even now, he sometimes has trouble remembering which of my daughters is which. He calls Tipper 'Flipper' occasionally. He's a prime stroke candidate, and to be honest, if the phone rang right now with the news that he had had a nasty fall in the bathroom, well, I wouldn't be surprised. But even in his somewhat addled state, he knows that our policy in Haiti has brought some stability to that troubled island nation, and that our actions in Bosnia, while they do involve the massive deployment of American military personnel, are necessary, and anyone who doubts this is insulting his life's work and smearing his memory, even though he isn't dead yet. But he will be soon. And when he is, I'll make a solemn vow.'' (I think that one needs a little work, so I'm hoping that Kemp steers clear of foreign policy.)
<P>
On welfare reform: ``This morning Tipper noticed a milky discharge from her left eye. We think it could be serious. I'm very worried. She's been sluggish and run down lately. The doctors don't give her much chance of recovery.'' 
<P>
On Bill's character: ``I have a lump in my breast. Male breast cancer is rare and very deadly.'' 
<P>
Talk about rapid response! On to victory! 
<P>
See you at Inaugural II!

Democrats led by Rep. David Bonior (D., Mich.) are demanding that the House Ethics Committee waive its usual procedures and immediately release a preliminary fact-finding report in which the committee's outside counsel purportedly discusses the use of tax-deductible funds to support a history course Newt Gingrich taught in Georgia. Under committee rules, ethics complaints cannot be filed within sixty days of a general election, so as to avoid the very politicizing Bonior et al. are attempting here. Almost all Bonior's many ethics complaints about Gingrich have been dismissed or found to be minor or technical infractions. The Ethics Committee should not release its final report until it's ready. Meanwhile, it should commission one on the allegations of bank fraud, tax fraud, and financial-disclosure fraud wafting around Minority Leader Richard Gephardt.

Dick Morris wasn't on the cover for once, so in case you didn't automatically reach for the <I>Star</I> this week, you missed: DICK MORRIS PLOTTED GAY SMEAR ON JACK KEMP. ``President Clinton's disgraced political guru Dick Morris revealed over pillow talk with Sherry Rowlands that Democratic operatives were running a dirty-tricks campaign against Bob Dole and Jack Kemp. . . . The sleazy tactics by Clinton's top political strategist are the latest bombshells in Rowlands's diaries of her year-long kinky sex-for-cash affair with Morris.''

In just the last two weeks, 6,000 people in Houston, 10,000 in Dallas, and almost 15,000 in San Jose have taken the oath of citizenship. In Chicago, an estimated 70,000 new citizens have been minted in 1996. The country has opened its arms to nearly 1.3 million new Americans this year -- nearly triple the 450,000 welcomed in 1995, which itself was an all-time record, the previous high having been set in 1944. The Administration maintains that the mass swearings-in were designed to eliminate the backlog of applicants who became eligible for citizenship in 1994 by establishing legal residency under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. But only 600,000 applicants were trapped in the INS bureaucracy. In fact, the $77-million program called Citizenship U.S.A. is a Democratic campaign operation. According to Immigration and Naturalization Service records, local Democratic politicians and community groups were charged with shepherding applicants to the INS, where they would receive accelerated treatment. Background checks for police records have been sloppily performed, fingerprinting has been assigned to untrained volunteers, English-language tests have been administered in Spanish, and green cards (with a street value of nearly $30,000) have not been collected after new citizens take the oath. The House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight is now investigating how many unqualified applicants slipped through the system. What about the unqualified citizens responsible for this affront to our laws and our society?

Remember the ban on HIV-positive immigrants? In 1992, Bill Clinton, trolling for gay votes, announced he would lift it if elected. In 1993, Congress replied by enacting the ban into law -- and Clinton, reversing himself, signed the bill. Now Paul Mulshine, an enterprising columnist for the <I>Newark Star-Ledger</I>, has discovered that Clinton has quietly reversed himself again. This summer, the Administration told the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV - AIDS that infection with the virus is to be considered a ``characteristic'' that makes the victim eligible for political asylum. Already, an HIV-positive illegal alien has won asylum partly by claiming that there is no medical treatment for AIDS in Togo. ``The Clinton Administration has in this instance outdone itself,'' comments Mulshine. ``[It] took a law that made HIV-positive status a bar to immigration, inserted it into the intellectual meat grinder and produced a ruling that makes HIV-positive a bonus.'' Over to you, Mr. Dole.

Since Jack Kemp will be around for several election cycles to come, what he said about Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam should be tacked firmly into place. Kemp has made it his mission to bring the GOP to blacks. A million men is a bigger crowd than any other leader, black or white, could summon. Even in his original <I>Boston Globe</I> interview, Kemp began by placing his remarks in a general context: ``In the black community, more and more black church leaders are telling men to be responsible fathers.'' Perhaps the most naive thing Kemp said was his subsequent backtracking call on Farrakhan to renounce bigotry. Of course Farrakhan won't renounce bigotry -- it is integral to his faith (which holds that whites are demons bred in prehistoric times on the island of Patmos). Kemp will show the greatest respect for blacks by giving them his message straight up -- and since he won't be invited to any Million Man Marches, he'll have to keep doing it one man at a time.

When Bill Clinton vetoed the partial-birth-abortion ban last spring, he argued that the procedure is necessary to protect the health of expecting mothers in the third trimester of a complicated pregnancy. Women's health is very important to the President -- but not more important than the right to abortion on demand. The Administration has rushed to bring the French abortion drug, RU-486, to domestic markets, recently declaring it ``safe'' for public consumption, even though there are clear signs that it is dangerous -- and not just to the baby it starves and then ejects from the womb. Many of the women who take the pills complain of intense pain, nausea, and prolonged bleeding for up to 44 days; 2 per cent hemorrhage and require surgical intervention to save their lives. In the French RU-486 trials, one woman died, and others suffered heart attacks. Clinton has long maintained that he wants abortion to be ``safe [and] legal'' (forget ``rare'') -- but evidently not in that order.

On September 19, prominent heart patient Boris Yeltsin signed a decree instructing the Russian ``power ministries'' (Defense, Interior, Security, and Foreign Affairs), which normally report to the president, to ``coordinate their activities'' with the prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. During any actual surgery, the nuclear button would be temporarily entrusted to the prime minister as well. But within a few days, Yeltsin's doctors were speaking of a one- or two-month delay of the operation, due to the damaged condition of the presidential heart. (They waffled on earlier reports that Yeltsin had suffered a full-fledged but well-covered-up heart attack in late June, between the first and second rounds of the presidential election. There are limits to <I>glasnost</I>, apparently.) Whatever happens in the Kremlin operating room, Russia is in for an extended period of unstable government -- and the Clinton Administration's Russia policy, which has gambled everything on the personality of one man, hangs by a suture.

North Korea, with which the Clinton Administration so proudly forged a ``new relationship'' by the nuclear accord of October 1994, still carries on relations with South Korea in a very old spirit. Some 25 well-armed North Korean commandos sneaked ashore from a submarine near Kangnung on South Korea's northeast coast. Eleven crew members were found dead, either by mass suicide or murdered by their leaders; seven commandos were intercepted and killed by South Korean forces; one was captured. Others were missing and the object of an intensive manhunt, with the exact purpose of their mission as yet unknown. What is known is that the Clinton Administration will continue to prop up the decrepit but dangerous North Korean regime with food, aid, and diplomatic legitimacy.

Newly declassified government documents suggest that nine hundred American servicemen remained captive in North Korea after the prisoner exchange of 1952. That grisly medical experiments were performed on them sadly comes as no surprise -- unlike the suggestion, backed up by incriminating documents, that President Eisenhower and his Administration knew of the fate of the missing servicemen from the beginning. The Defense Department estimates that there are 15 Americans alive in captivity to this day. Pyongyang's denunciation of the charges, of course, is meaningless, and Congress is right to ask questions until the question is resolved.

Iranian authorities have announced they will soon be producing ``Islamic'' CD-ROM video games, to counter ``corrupt Western computer games.'' According to Mohammad Hussein Ali-Mohammadi, head of the Islamic Revolution Cultural Documentation Organization: ``The enemy is targeting us with ominous and anti-cultural software.'' Coming soon: a video game inspired by the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war, with texts in Farsi, Arabic, and English. Order yours now!

Freedom House, a secular human-rights group, has just issued a study called <I>In the Lion's Den</I>, which details widespread -- and largely unreported -- persecution of Christians around the globe. Among the report's findings: 1996 has been ``the most repressive period'' since the 1970s for Christians in China, where police are circulating warrants for over 3,000 evangelicals; in Sudan, Christian children are spirited from their families and sold in open-air slave markets; and in Saudi Arabia, it is illegal to wear a cross, read a Bible, or even pray in one's home. Those who ignore such oppressions while claiming to speak out for human rights will be condemned by their silence. The book can be ordered by calling 1-800-451-READ.

Did President Reagan, CIA Director William Casey, and Pope John Paul II conspire to ruin the Soviet Union? <I>His Holiness</I>, by Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein and Vatican expert Marco Politi, says the Kremlin viewed the accession of the new Polish Pope with fear and anger (and, it should be added, probably was behind the assassination attempt upon him). The Reagan Administration put $50 million into the anti-Communist Polish Solidarity movement, in return for which the Pope refused to criticize the deployment of a new generation of missiles in Europe, thus ditching the European Catholic Left. CIA Director Casey and former deputy Director Vernon Walters met secretly and repeatedly with the Pope, the three of them agreeing that Poland was the nationalist and Catholic weak point in the Evil Empire. In all of this, William Casey appears to have been the strategic thinker. His successful scheme to manipulate the international oil market in order to damage the main Soviet source of hard currency has yet to be fully explored. His support, legal and illegal, for the Contras issued defeats for the Communists in Central America. Casey's story may never be told  -- such was the nature of his role -- but he looms still larger in <I>His Holiness</I>.

One, ah, footnote to the Dick Morris story. Even as he closed his $2.5-million book deal, he was feted at a newsmaker's luncheon at <I>The New Yorker</I>. Such freak shows are typical of the tenure of editor Tina Brown (whose husband, Harold Evans, signed Morris's book contract). But how do her colleagues feel about them? Henry Louis Gates Jr., the respected Harvard professor? Henrik Hertzberg, the deft political essayist? Stylish James Wolcott? Earnest Ken Auletta? Any pangs, twinges? The averted face, the furrowed brow? Gentlemen?

The lead character of the Disney/Touchstone-produced sitcom <I>Ellen</I>, played by comic Ellen DeGeneres, will probably come out of the closet this season, becoming the first homosexual starring character on TV (there are already a number of minor homosexual characters on other shows). Already the air is dark with flying platitudes. ``Ellen is trying to break new ground,'' says the actress's agent. ``It reflects Hollywood's commitment to diversity,'' says a gay activist. On the other (our) side, some Religious Right types will boycott Disney, and some pundit types will uphold their right to do so. But is that any less boring? The only way for conservatives to fight the culture wars in the long run is to become screen writers -- and novelists, and poets. Poets <I>are</I> the unacknowledged legislators of the world. Men live by bread, and they live under laws, but they live for stories. If there are better stories than the ones liberalism tells us (and there are), someone must tell them.

The Board of Visitors of the Virginia Military Institute voted 9 to 8 to admit women for the first time in the school's 157-year history. Facing dim prospects for raising enough money to go private and maintain VMI's all-male identity, the Board took the only course left, a result ordained at least since 1990 when the Justice Department sued the Institute for violating the Civil Rights Act and the equal-protection clause by its exclusion of women. VMI superintendent Josiah Bunting, while insisting that physical requirements will not be lowered for female cadets, admits that even this last hold-out for the old standards is likely to open the school to further lawsuits. Trustee Anita K. Blair predicts that a ``co-ed VMI soon will become indistinguishable from the existing cadet programs'' at other public institutions. In other words, a co-ed VMI will no longer be VMI. Have the cadets look up ``Pyrrhic victory'' in their manuals.

Tupac Shakur, the 25-year-old gangsta rapper gunned down in Las Vegas last week, lived and died the ghetto life. The son of a Black Panther, Shakur achieved fame by glorifying violence, drugs, and the degradation of women. No hypocrite, he practiced what he preached. Arrested numerous times, in 1993 he went to prison for beating a video director in a parking lot. In 1994 he was given four and a half years for his part in sexually assaulting a woman (two friends were also involved) and served eight months. While he reportedly believed in ``The Code'' -- a set of rules to stop violence in the inner city which required: 1) no drive-by shootings, 2) no random killings, 3) no drug dealing in the 'hood, and 4) no snitching -- somehow, that wasn't enough.

President Clinton, says a White House spokesman, applauded Boris Yeltsin's decision to go public with his heart surgery as ``a bold stroke that proved how important it [is] to be open about these sorts of situations.'' Apparently, since Clinton refuses to release <I>his</I> medical records, ``openness'' is only important in the Kremlin.

Using stealth technique to sign the Defense of Marriage Act did not keep Mr. Clinton off the gay community's radar screen. ACT-UP spokesman Steve Michael advised: ``Bill Clinton shouldn't be denigrating loving, committed gay relationships. He should be taking notes.''

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N 1991</font>, with President George Bush still riding high, then-Sen. Al Gore announced he wouldn't make another bid for the Democratic presidential nomination -- partly because two years earlier his son had nearly died after being struck by a car. ``My family -- my wife and four young children -- are more important than politics and personal ambition,'' he avowed. Half a year later Gore's manifesto on the ecological crisis, <I>Earth in the Balance</I>, appeared -- also a result, he writes in the introduction, of his son's accident. The experience made him uncomfortable with the compromises and tawdriness of practical politics, ``increasingly impatient with the status quo, with conventional wisdom.'' By his own telling, Gore had been transformed into a politician of extraordinary virtue, willing to forsake ambition for his family, determined to embark on a quasi-spiritual crusade to save not just America or even democracy, but the planet.
<P>
Then, Bill Clinton called. Gore took the second spot on the ticket in 1992 and decided the wife and kids could wait while he spent his days disavowing the implications of <I>Earth in the Balance</I> in national debates and defending the compromises and tawdriness of the former Arkansas governor. Why the reversal? Well, it turns out, because his son had nearly died in a car accident. Accepting the vice-presidential nomination, Gore told the Democratic National Convention how immediately after the accident his son ``was limp and still, without breath or pulse.'' Gore was running for national office because, like his son, ``our democracy is lying there in the gutter, waiting for us to give it a second breath of life.'' His son's near-death, then, was now a kind of qualification for higher office. In fact, it seemed to be a justification for <I>anything</I>, a charm that Gore could rub whenever he needed an aura of virtue. 
<P>
Gore's father raised him to be President, and everything around him becomes automatically subsumed in the lifelong Al Gore for President campaign. His son's near death becomes a nice metaphor, his sister's painful, losing struggle with cancer a useful rhetorical riff, pandering and playing loose with the truth a necessary expedient (except when renouncing the same is even more expedient). And none of this is calculating or low because it is in the service of a goal whose purity is beyond reproach -- elevating Al Gore. The Vice President's reputation as a stiff at once underestimates him and gives him too much credit. Gore is disciplined and smart, at least an even match for his presumptive opponent in 2000, Jack Kemp. He is also, along with Hillary Clinton, today's foremost practitioner of the odious political style of the enlightened Baby Boomer, who assumes his own righteousness and considers any expedient justified in trying to visit it upon the nation.
<P>
Gore, a self-styled ``Son of the South,'' is really a Beltway baby. His father, Al Gore Sr., was a senator from Tennessee, and raised young Al in what is now the Ritz-Carlton hotel. He went to St. Albans, the exclusive prep school, and then on to Harvard, where, the joke goes, he studied Southern as a foreign language. His dad, meanwhile, got in trouble back home for his opposition to the Vietnam War. Al opposed the War, but volunteered to avoid embarrassing his father -- or, as the young Bill Clinton might have put it, to maintain his father's viability within the system. His dad lost anyway in 1970. Al supposedly soured on politics, but not enough to keep him from dropping his reporter job at a moment's notice six years later and running for an open congressional seat. He won the primary -- tantamount to election -- by 3,500 votes, the tightest race in his otherwise charmed political life. 
<P>
In the House and then in the Senate -- he won a Senate seat in 1984 -- Gore compiled a moderately liberal voting record (his Americans for Demo- cratic Action rating hovered around 70). As a congressman, he had a knack for grabbing headlines by championing goo-goo causes like nutritional standards for baby formula. In the Senate, GOP staffers still drip with contempt for him as ``a joke,'' who never matched his rhetoric with substance. He made his name on issues that, as Michael Kinsley has pointed out, were always ``difficult'' in the sense of being technical and dull, but not contentious. He became a student of the minutiae of arms control. He sponsored the Supercomputer Network Study Act. He, of course, talked about toxic waste. You can almost hear him thinking: ``Just don't make mistakes.'' It's an understandable impulse -- steer a safe course and graduate from Harvard, succeed  your daddy in the Senate, maybe even become President.
<P> 
The attitude suffused Gore's 1988 presidential bid, an exercise in ham-handed and utterly predictable cynicism. Gore ran at the urging of a group of wealthy Democrats who thought he could fill the ``moderate'' niche in the campaign. But his candidacy never developed a rationale. One of his first acts was to fly to Los Angeles with Tipper to tell music executives his wife didn't really mean the nasty things she had said about rock lyrics. Then he tried on successive campaign themes. The one he settled on was that he was the super-hawk in a field of liberal wimps, despite the fact that it was at odds with his record (votes against the Contras, against SDI, etc.). He wrote off Iowa, declaring, ``I will not barter my beliefs to win votes here or elsewhere,'' then went on to sell them wholesale anywhere he thought he might find a buyer. 
<P>
In Virginia, he visited a Norfolk shipyard to rap his opponents for wanting to cancel contracts for aircraft carriers there. Never mind that Gore had voted against $688 million in fiscal-1988 funding for those same carriers. After a disappointing showing in the Southern Super Tuesday primaries, he headed North, willing to try anything. In union-dominated Michigan he declared: ``I want to put the Democratic Party back on the side of working people.'' In Wisconsin he proposed a ridiculous hike in the dairy-support program that, by one estimate, would have cost consumers an extra forty cents a gallon. He even borrowed Dick Gephardt's economic-nationalist theme -- earlier he had been a critic -- when he vowed in an ad to ``make these corporations pay their share of taxes and create jobs here in America.'' In New York, finally, he became the candidate of Israel and Ed Koch, before his campaign at last was put out of its misery. 
<P>
In <I>Earth in the Balance</I>, published in early 1992, Gore pours some scorn, as well he might, on his 1988 bid. The book is self-flagellating and self-promoting all at once, and has a certain unhinged quality. Gore warns that we are at the ``edge of history,'' because ``[m]odern industrial civilization, as presently organized, is colliding violently with our planet's ecological system.'' So, he proposes nothing less than its complete re-organization. He rules out world government (sorry, just not practical), but not much else. He calls for a Global Marshall Plan. A Strategic Environment Initiative will phase out ``inappropriate technologies,'' including that pesky internal-combustion engine. A regime of taxes and regulations will make the environment a crucial factor in all economic decisions. Finally, binding international agreements will ensure that all nations stick with the program.
<P>
What got into Al Gore? There's still a Boy Scout feel to his advocacy. How can he get the most merit badges? By saving the planet. But Gore is also in the grip of a new idea: We're all inter-connected; our decisions affect other people; <I>there's an entire world outside Al Gore</I>! ``The search for truths about this ungodly crisis,'' Gore writes, ``and the search for truths about myself have been the same search all along.'' The book brims with amateur psychology. ``[W]e internalize the pain of our lost sense of connection to the natural world, we consume the earth and its resources as a way to distract ourselves from the pain, and we search insatiably for artificial substitutes to replace the experience of communion with the world that has been taken from us.'' Uh-huh. Gore's laments over our loss of connection with ourselves at times sound like a timid politician's cry for help.
<P>
The book marks a departure for Gore. Before, he could only muster his self-righteousness in the service of his ambition. Now he can do it for a cause, permitting him to go straight from smarmy politico to fanatic. With his repeated, sophomoric references to Nazism, he implies that those who don't share his views are not misguided, but evil. ``It is not merely in the service of analogy that I have referred so often to the struggles against Nazi and Communist totalitarianism,'' he writes, ``because I believe that the emerging effort to save the environment is a continuation of these struggles.'' Almost anything is justified in such a fight, and Gore makes it clear that science in particular shouldn't be allowed to stand in the way. He attacks Descartes and Bacon for laying the groundwork for the modern scientific revolution, and criticizes the notion that there ``can be a separation between facts and values, between the thoughts of a scientist and the moral duties of a human being.''

<font size=+3>G</font><font size=+1>ORE</font> has already struck blows for a science colored with his values. His Senate office was involved in an effort to discredit S. Fred Singer, a prominent skeptic about the greenhouse effect, after Singer published an article co-signed by Roger Revelle -- the father of global-warming theory and an inspiration to Gore --  suggesting that there wasn't evidence to justify radical actions to prevent global warming. Singer sued his chief critic, who had co-ordinated with Gore's office, for libel and won a public apology. Meanwhile, Bush appointee William Happer, the highly regarded director of research at the Department of Energy, was slated to stay on board after the 1992 election. But Happer, in internal discussions and congressional testimony, continued to discount global-warming alarmism and push for additional research before taking draconian action. One former Energy employee remembers a meeting where a high-ranking civil servant told Happer, ``I agree with you, Will, but I'd like to keep my job.'' Happer got the axe. 
<P>
Environmentalism has become de rigueur throughout the Administration. Warren Christopher recently declared that environmental issues would be a top priority of the <I>State Department</I>. It was a victory for Gore, whose most ambitious environmental project so far was the BTU energy tax, which took a drubbing in Congress in 1993. Other efforts to advance the green agenda have been similarly tempered by reality. ``Faced with an unresponsive Congress,'' says Jonathan Adler of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, ``Gore has provided an ideological rudder to ensure environmental initiatives still advance as far as possible.'' When the Administration developed a Climate Change Action Plan in 1993, environmentalists were angry that it didn't insist on mandatory caps on greenhouse emissions. In July the Administration decided it would push for just such caps, in another baby step on the way to the Global Marshall Plan.
<P>
<font size=+3>G</font><font size=+1>ORE</font> has also succeeded, thanks to his sheer relentlessness, in making himself a player in the Administration more broadly. He generally has pushed Clinton toward the center, urging him to produce a balanced budget by a date certain and sign welfare reform. His own moderate credentials have been burnished by his Reinventing Government (REGO) project, which is typical Gore: it has unobjectionable goals, involves a lot of technical details, and is much less than meets the eye. Savings have fallen far short of projections, while the project's vaunted personnel reductions are mostly a result of Defense Department downsizing. Besides, Gore's true loyalties are elsewhere. The Environmental Protection Agency's highly touted Project XL is supposed to be a model of chastened REGO-style regulation. But the state of Minnesota is already considering quitting the pilot program. One Dow Chemical official told <I>Chemical Week</I>, ``XL may be more cumbersome than the permitting process.''
<P>
But REGO is still a bragging point for Gore, as he runs simultaneously for Vice President this year and President in 2000. He's better on the stump than his reputation suggests, especially adept, as he demonstrated with his Macarena  dance in Chicago, at poking fun at himself. But he still can be flat. Before a Jewish group in New York City recently, he recited a speech in a monotone, occasionally inserting lengthy pauses between words for emphasis. Is this Al Gore delivering a speech or Al Gore pretending to be Al Gore delivering a speech? But a day later at the State University of New York at Albany he rallied a packed gymnasium of hyped-up students. They yelled, ``Do it!'', and ``Macarena!'' as soon as he came to the lectern. He pounded away at GOP education cuts, Medicare cuts, etc. He somehow took credit for the economic recovery and must have mentioned the phrase ``bridge to the future'' half a dozen times. It was a vague, slightly dishonest performance, totally lacking in content, exactly the kind of politics he attacked in <I>Earth in the Balance</I>.
<P>
It's too early to handicap the Democratic race in 2000, but Gore and Dick Gephardt are likely to be major contenders. Gore should occupy the center and try to tack left to pick up the party's special interests. Gephardt will do roughly the opposite. But neither is exactly a fresh wind in the party. The New Democrat movement, such as it is, has always been an outside force, hoping to overthrow the party's established order. Gore is at best an establishment fellow-traveler. The major debate among Democrats after 1996 will be whether Clinton's renewed popularity is a result of his move to the center or his defense of traditional government spending programs. Gore, who advocated both a balanced budget and standing firm against the GOP during the shutdowns, is well positioned to straddle the debate. Then, no doubt, he will work to make this accommodation seem a matter of high principle and courage. Dependent on his victory will be the nation's, nay the planet's, future. And, much more importantly, that of Al Gore.

<H2>Get Out The Hip-Hop Vote</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 21<br>


Two news releases advise us of current exercises in democratic practice. The first is an enterprise its sponsors call the ``hip-hop nation.'' It is specifically directed to ``keep African-Americans involved in American politics.''
<P>
Rock the Vote has joined with L.L. Cool J's Camp Cool Foundation and together they have created the Hip Hop Coalition for Political Change. The objective is young African-Americans and the design is to attract their attention in every city on the R. Kelley/L.L. Cool J tour, plus a series of television and radio public-service announcements ``featuring the likes of Will Smith, Kadeem Hardison, Coolio, Method Man, a reunited New Edition, Shai, Solo, Mokensteff, and many others.'' The coalition, reports Softline Information Inc.'s The Ethnic NewsWatch, ``plans to get the message out to the Black community that it's time to take part in the struggle and make a difference.''
<P>
Meanwhile, the <I>New York Times</I> informs us of the program of a nonprofit organization financed by the recording industry ``that revved up the youth vote in 1992.'' Rock the Vote has launched a service that will fill out voter-registration forms for callers who dial 800-REGISTER, or 800-734-4783.
<P>
Here is what you do. You dial the number and a voice asks you to tap in your zip code. A voice then reads to you the requirements of the state you live in (it is kindergarten work for a computer to deduce your state from your zip). You are then asked your name and date of birth.
<P>
You are then congratulated. In about ten days a completed form arrives in the mail. Rock the Vote even supplies the stamp. ``A new voter is born,'' the <I>Times</I> reports. One week before the election, the freshly registered voter will receive a postcard, reminding him to vote. The program, based in Santa Monica, California, hopes to register 500,000 new voters by September 10. The cost of the enterprise is borne by MCI, the communications company, in cooperation with MTV, the television station that features rock music and other saturnalia.
<P>
Now all of this has become possible owing to the national Voter Registration Act (the ``motor-voter law''). The idea (the Democrats', primarily) was to diminish the clerical burden on the voter. The Act specifies that states must accept voter-registration forms by mail. And further, that motor-vehicle departments, which is where practically everybody turns up at some point or another, must serve as registration agencies. Get a driver's license, register to vote.
<P>
The assumption, of course, is that an increase in the number of votes means a marginal increase in Democratic votes. This is quite obvious in the operation of the Hip Hop Coalition, inasmuch as it is explicitly directed to ``young African-Americans.'' Since American blacks vote over 90 per cent Democratic, it isn't likely that adding black votes will do other than enhance Democratic chances.
<P>
The Rock the Vote people aren't saying it in as many words, but you know, and I know, that the assumption is that MTV types will, without any interruption in rhythm, be attracted to free-form politics, in this case nicely summarized by the formula, A meets with B to decide how much C should give to D.
<P>
The get-out-the-vote fetishists are always declining to make the fundamental distinction, which is between voting for the commonweal, and voting for one's singular interests. It is certainly true that there is as high a percentage of rich people who vote for policies that favor rich people as of poor people who vote for policies that favor the poor. The rich farmer is likely to vote in favor of a continuation of subsidies, the poor farmer in favor of free health care. The moral tale could be lightly made if for instance after you dialed the 800 number and gave your date of birth the voice at the other end of the line were to say, in computer-tone:<br>
``That means, Mr. Squires, that you were 32 years old on your last birthday. Are you registering to vote for the first time? If so please record which of the following is the motivating impulse that brought you today to the phone, answer A, B, or C. a) I didn't know how to register until I saw this ad. b) I reflected that the time has come to do my civic duty. c) I want to vote for the party that's promising me higher wages/higher pension/better health-care benefits/higher tariffs.''
<P>
The caller is always free to hang up. Though maybe the next National Voter Register Act will make that illegal.

TRANSCRIPT EXTRACT: CAMPAIGN PHONE LINK.
<P> 
DATE: 9/22/96 BEGIN INTERCEPT: 11:19 A.M.
<P> 
STATIC. VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Rusty? Rusty, can you hear me?
<P>
STATIC. UNINTELLIGIBLE RESPONSE.
<P>
VPOTUS: Rusty?
<P>
STATIC. DEAD LINE.
<P>
VPOTUS: Damn satellite phones.
<P>
PHONE BEEPS. VPOTUS: Hello?
<P>
UNIDENTIFIED MALE VOICE: Who've I got here?
<P>
VPOTUS: This is Al Gore.
<P>
UNMALEV: Perfect. Just perfect. You with me?
<P>
VPOTUS: Who is this?
<P>
UNMALEV: Can't you recognize the voice? Thought my voice was more recognizable than the ears on my head. Perfect. This is beautiful. This is interesting. Can you follow me?
<P>
VPOTUS: Ross Perot?
<P>
UNMALEV: Got it right the first time. Now just let me finish. Will you let me finish? Hey, what's that clicking and whirring sound?
<P>
VPOTUS: It's my wife. She's on the plane with me. She's taking pictures for a new book.
<P>
UNMALEV: Huh. Isn't that interesting. I heard the same clicking and whirring during my daughter's wedding. Huh.
<P>
VPOTUS: How did you get this number, Ross?
<P>
HRP: Simplest thing in the world. Computers truly are the problem-solvers of our time. But I didn't get you on the blower to make your ears sweat. I want to know why you agreed to keep me out of the debates. Just give me a simple answer.
<P>
VPOTUS: Well, Ross --
<P> 
HRP: Will you let me finish? Can I finish here? Or is it just you talking and the American people wondering who lit the barn on fire and got the marshmallows out too late? Five Republicans and five Democrats got together and decided to keep me out of the debates and let me be completely clear with you -- okay? -- I have my home in Dallas and my children's homes under complete protection by a private group of security personnel and my wife and myself are wearing football helmets lined with tin foil -- so do not -- I repeat do not -- attempt to alter our behavior with rays or beams from space because it won't work.
<P>
VPOTUS: Ross, I assure you, if it was up to me, I'd let you in the debates.
<P>
HRP: Of course you would. When you and I went on ``Larry King'' to debate NAFTA, it was very clear to the viewers -- and I have had a team of experts from countries that were once members of the Soviet bloc analyze the tape -- that you were wearing a tiny device in your ear.
<P>
VPOTUS: I was, Ross. So were you. So was Larry. When you appear on television, the producers give you an earpiece so they can communicate with you from the booth.
<P>
HRP: Can I finish? I have been in business for forty years. I know how TV works. Now what you've just done is take a cat, skin it, put the skin on your head, and meow, okay?
<P>
VPOTUS: I beg your pardon?
<P>
HRP: You had an earpiece in the other earpiece and the White House was feeding you the answers.
<P>
VPOTUS: I resent that, Ross. I won that debate fair and square.
<P>
HRP: Now here's where it gets interesting. Okay? Let me simplify. And let me make it clear that the football helmets that my wife and I wear cannot be penetrated by thought waves, okay? Absolutely no thoughts can enter or exit.
<P>
VPOTUS: Ross -- 
<P>
HRP: I'm pulling out of the race.
<P>
VPOTUS: What?
<P>
HRP: Okay, I'm back in the race. The point is simple. I'm not stupid and neither are the American people. What are my chances in November?
<P>
VPOTUS: Honestly? Not good.
<P>
HRP: Okay. Now we've toasted the bread. Let's spread the peanut butter. Follow me. What if I promise not to go after Bill Clinton?
<P>
VPOTUS: What?
<P>
HRP: Still slow on the uptake, aren't you? Let's simplify. I run. I debate. Clinton wins. Okay?
<P>
VPOTUS: Okay.
<P>
HRP: Double-click on the year 2000. My guess is you want to be President.
<P>
VPOTUS: Well . . .
<P> 
HRP: Now I've got to wrap this up because it's hard to hear through the helmet. Here's what I'm saying. I would be honored if you would run in the year 2000 on the Reform Party ticket.
<P>
VPOTUS: What?
<P>
HRP: Think about it.
<P>
VPOTUS: Okay, but --
<P> 
HRP: Can I finish please? Can I please finish? I have to go. I'm going to debate a couple of empty chairs on ``Larry King.'' If they interrupt me as much as you have, this is going to get interesting.
<P> 
STATIC. END TRANSMISSION 11:35 AM.

In President Clinton's speech to the Democratic Convention -- which, for all we know, may still be going on as you read this -- he proposed ``to give businesses a tax credit for every person hired off welfare and kept employed,'' and ``to offer private job-placement firms a bonus for every welfare recipient they place in a job who stays in it.'' As a welfare reform, this proposal is pretty insignificant, but still wrongheaded: all previous efforts to provide benefits to recipients for getting off welfare have ended up persuading more people to get on it in the first place. But there's a more basic issue of fairness at stake here. Under this proposal, employers are encouraged to give greater consideration to welfare recipients than to job applicants who have ``worked hard and played by the rules.'' It is thus simply a surreptitious way of extending the existing regime of state-sponsored discrimination that goes by the name of ``affirmative action.'' This wouldn't go unchallenged if the Republican Party were still alive.

Ross Perot is pulling about 4 per cent in preference polls and airing 30-minute infomercials that are competing for the attention of 3 A.M. television viewers with ads for psychic phone consultations and 900-numbers. He stole the nomination of his own party, the presidential ``primary'' of which drew only 5 per cent of party members. His contribution to the policy debate consists mostly of rantings about Washington lobbyists, foreign trade, and a secret microphone in the Vice President's ear, not always in that order. He has now compounded his irrelevance by selecting as his running-mate Pat Choate, a Washington-based lobbyist for protectionism whose previous brush with destiny was as the ghostwriter of Perot's last book. Perot, in short, is a blight on American politics. For that reason -- and because he flunks the presidential debate commission's chief criterion of having a plausible chance at getting elected -- he should be kept as far from the debates as possible. The best forum for Ross Perot is the one he already has  -- the seedy reaches of late-night television.

In the last few days before adjournment, conservative senators are fighting with their own leadership to prevent the lifetime appointments of more Clinton judges to the federal bench. President Clinton has now appointed 26 per cent of all active federal judges, and GOP Senate leaders appear anxious to increase his judicial clout weeks before the election. Majority Leader Trent Lott permitted 17 district judges to be confirmed before the August recess, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch now wants to offer more Clinton appointees for expedited approval. Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison (Tex.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.), and Charles Grassley (Iowa) are to be commended for resisting this rush to judges.

Reality can no longer be satirized in the European Union. When EU foreign ministers met in Tralee, Ireland, on September 7 and 8, they disagreed totally over Iraq. London supported the U.S. raids unconditionally; Paris thoroughly disapproved. After which they reiterated their intention to write a common European foreign and security policy into a new treaty in 1997. But there are clear dangers in this process for the United States. Too divided to support the U.S. against Saddam Hussein, the EU is strangely united in its determination to defend the right of its businessmen to trade with Cuba, Libya, and Iran. Even a committed pro-European like Stuart Eizenstat was unable to change this on his recent mission. An integrated Europe increasingly governed by summiteers and independent central bankers will be both too cautious and too selfish to stand up for joint Western interests. More dangerous still: it is precisely because the Russians understand all this that they are in favor of a ``Europeanized'' (read: ``anti-American'') NATO. The U.S. must not continue to treat European integration with its customary benign neglect. What <I>kind</I> of Europe matters.

A key part of Ronald Reagan's legacy -- the National Endowment for Democracy -- is under attack once again on Capitol Hill. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently zeroed out its funding after the House had approved the Administration's request ($30 million, the same as current funding). Sen. Judd Gregg (R., N.H.) led the attack, arguing that ``the Cold War is over.'' He thus joins with those on the far Left who have sought the elimination of the NED since its creation in 1983. In fact, despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, two-fifths of the world's population still lives under autocratic rule, according to Freedom House. The NED has given aid and comfort to major democratic movements around the world, including Solidarity in Poland, Aung San Suu Kyi's party in Burma, and the Chinese human-rights movement -- and served U.S. interests in doing so. Its party-affiliated institutes may deserve some of the credit for Boris Yeltsin's defeat of the Communists in Russia --  not through the intervention of some last-minute self-promoting American consultants but through years of assistance to Russia's democrats and free-marketeers. The Senate should restore the NED's full funding in September when the appropriations bill reaches the floor.

October is Nobel Peace Prize season and Richard Holbrooke is waiting by his phone. The unraveling of his Dayton Accord on Bosnia may not be a disqualification --  after all, Ralph Bunche won the Prize for a fragile Arab -  Israeli armistice (one of many), and Le Duc Tho and Henry Kissinger shared it for a Vietnam agreement that didn't last long either. The Prize seems to be an ``A for Effort'' kind of thing. Holbrooke's was a valiant effort, though it was the climax of a badly flawed Clinton policy that ignored the real problem, namely an imbalance of military power that aided the Serb aggressors. Given the Norwegian Nobel Committee's often kinky tastes, however -- left-leaning groups are usually favored and Americans are usually shunned -- other candidates might be Greenpeace or the Mexican Zapatistas (with honorable mentions to Gerry Adams and the Unabomber). We could do much, much worse than Dick Holbrooke.

To most of America, the disingenuousness of tobacco-industry spokesmen is a cliche. To anti-smoking activists, it's a never-ending outrage. To lawyers suing cigarette manufacturers, it's a potentially lucrative tort. And to the U.S. Justice Department, it's a federal offense. The <I>Washington Post</I> reports that FBI agents are issuing grand-jury subpoenas to mid-level employees of Philip Morris and other tobacco companies, hoping that the threat of perjury charges will elicit testimony implicating senior industry officials in the crime of making false or misleading statements to Congress and federal agencies. This crime hinges mainly on whether tobacco-company executives are sincere when they suggest that smokers value nicotine for its taste, or when they insist, despite overwhelming evidence, that they personally do not <I>believe</I> that smoking causes lung cancer or that nicotine is addictive. Without getting inside their brains, we will never know for sure, but we can guess the answer. More to the point, no one is fooled by such legalistic evasions unless he wants to be. But the Justice Department has little faith in Americans' ability to see through transparent prevarications. As the Post notes, ``The tobacco industry has become an issue in the 1996 presidential campaign, with President Clinton positioning himself as the anti-smoking candidate.'' Yet ``Justice Department officials . . . say their probe is independent of White House influence.''

``I would kind of like to throw up in living color,'' said Rep. Pat Schroeder in reaction to the Morris scandal. Not to argue with your delicate sentiments, ma'am, but the contemporary term, coined by the great Australian comedian Barry Humphries, is ``a Technicolor yawn.''

President Clinton is proposing to bypass Congress and use the 1906 Antiquities Act to declare some 9,000 square miles of southern Utah a ``national monument'' in order to thwart a Dutch coal company from exercising its mining-lease rights to the Kaiparowits plateau, a remote sector of what they used to call ``badlands'' -- country so rocky and dry it was bypassed by cattlemen. Andalax Resources, Inc., discovered rich coal seams there and wants to open a mine based on leases granted in the mid 1980s. White House aides have said the Administration will not challenge Andalax's right to <I>mine</I> the coal but will deny it the permits needed to build roads to get the coal out. The <I>Washington Post</I> quoted a senior official as saying, ``The lease clearly conveys the right to explore for and develop and mine the coal. It doesn't say they necessarily have the right to get coal off the lease.'' File that under: ``What's a Constitution between friends?''

Mr. Clinton's ``bridge to the twenty-first century'' may sound like empty campaign rhetoric, but wait till you pay the toll.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT><font size=+1>RITICS</font>   called the Republican National Convention an infomercial, but San Diego was amateur hour compared to the ``Listening to America'' forums Bob Dole is holding across the country. In Pittsburgh, a hundred invited guests sit in a warehouse belonging to Gamma Racquet Sports, Inc. -- the kind of small business Dole's economic plan is meant to help -- listening to Sen. Rick Santorum (R., Pa.) introduce the candidate. The fresh-faced, 38-year-old senator paces with a microphone, explaining what Bob Dole can do for you, right now, money-back guaranteed. He elicits tightly controlled bursts of applause straight from 2 A.M. television. The product could as easily be Frizz-Ease or the Ab-Master as a political program. Before it's over, you expect Richard Simmons to bounce out in skimpy purple shorts and hug the fattest guy who's in favor of a 50 per cent capital-gains tax cut.
<P>
Of course, the main attraction isn't the light-on-his-feet Simmons, but Bob Dole, who is anything but. Dole maneuvers through these forums like a high-wire act. He is up there, trying to connect, trying to listen to America, but will he trip? His wit plays well. After the owner of Gamma gives a glowing spiel about his company's tennis products, Dole deadpans: ``Nice racket you got here.'' Everyone laughs. Later, Dole interrupts a rambling questioner, with a smile, but a little snappish: ``What's your bottom line?'' Watch that edge, Bob. He goes on to explain why regulatory reform didn't pass -- ``We needed 60 [votes] to cut off the debate'' -- just bursting to say one of those incomprehensible process words: ``cloture.'' He resists. When a single mom tells how she couldn't get her small business off the ground, Dole begins his answer, ``There is a government program . . .'' No, Bob! Don't contradict your message by recommending government help! ``I know Rick would follow up as far as the SBA is concerned.''
<P>
Ahhh! But Dole quickly rights himself and talks about creating more private-sector opportunities again. He leaves the crowd of hand-picked Republicans impressed with his straightforwardness. When Dole made this early-September visit -- his third recent trip to Pennsylvania -- he brought a sharpened tax message. In his Saturday radio address, he told Americans how they are sending on average almost 40 per cent of their income to the government, as much as they spend on food, shelter, and clothing combined. He pounded the IRS, promising to ``end [it] as we know it,'' and spelled out how cutting just a small slice of federal spending -- some $10 trillion over the next six years -- would pay for the tax cut. He scores Clinton's alternative of ``targeted'' tax incentives as just another wat ``to dictate how you should spend'' your money.
<P>
It's as about as convincing on taxes as Dole is likely to get. The campaign realizes it has lost traction on the tax front -- polls show people by a narrow margin trusting Clinton more than Dole on the issue -- and it has to punch a message through with more immediacy for the average person. The campaign (or at least what seems to be the dominant faction at the moment) is convinced that one reason the plan hasn't taken off is that public awareness of it is still low. Hammering relentlessly on it in coming weeks -- with occasional jabs on an issue like drugs -- will boost those numbers, goes the theory, and inevitably Dole's overall numbers as well. The model is Christine Todd Whitman's New Jersey campaign in 1993, when a singleminded focus on taxes paid off, but only at campaign's end. So while all of GOP Washington panics at Clinton's renewed 15 - 20 point lead, the Dole campaign seems ready to stay the course.
<P>
There's no doubt Dole's tax plan still has untapped potential. The question is whether it has enough. The New Jersey model, for instance, has flaws. Christine Whitman benefited from a huge GOP get-out-the-vote effort, while incumbent Jim Florio, still suffering from lingering unpopularity, ignored his base. Dole, on the other hand, faces depressed GOP turnout and is squaring off against a President with nearly 60 per cent approval ratings. Dole is also trying to sell an economic message in an economy growing at a 4.2 per cent pace last quarter, with an unemployment rate at its lowest in seven years. It's an indication of how hard the GOP has to stretch for bad news that the RNC recently issued a press release on declining construction spending. On the social front -- fertile ground for the GOP -- Dole has been disarmed by both the GOP Congress, which kicked away issues like crime, and Dick Morris, who helped the President snatch them up. 
<P>
Dole is left half a candidate. In a packed gym at the University of Scranton, he is greeted by an enthusiastic, sweaty throng of more than a thousand locals and pompom-waving students as the sound system blasts jazzy riffs from the Blues Brothers sound-track. Dole keeps up the energy with slashing and amusing attacks on Clinton on taxes, which go on for perhaps a bit too long. Then what? He talks about drugs. The Dole campaign swears this is a cutting issue, particularly with women; focus groups of 15 women sympathetic toward Clinton will reportedly leave after hearing the drug message loathing the President. But the crowd in the gym isn't particularly moved; drugs is simply not a defining issue. Can Dole get mileage from it? ``If they can prove the President is on drugs now,'' says political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, ``they may have a chance.''
<P>
But Dole still has an energetic crowd when he moves to his speech's close. ``Let me just say this,'' Dole intones, a bleacher full of students yelling behind him. ``This is America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth.'' It's an utterly banal line. But there's still something moving about it from Dole -- he means it, and proved it somewhere in Italy fifty years ago. This, then, is where Dole can close the deal, making up for his charisma gap with an emotional evocation of his small-town life and service to country. But Dole keeps stepping on the mood. When he mentions Russell, Kansas, he motions to fellow Russell native Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), on the stage with him: ``Arlen and I grew up there little different times. He's much, much younger . . . But nobody gets old there. But, in any event . . .'' Then Dole says he ``wasn't born with this suit on.'' Well, he pauses: ``Come to think of it I wasn't born with any suit on.''
<P>
Dole seems emotionally incapable -- except in rare instances -- of playing on his past effectively. The asides and quips always distance himself from himself. The problem isn't that Dole is too hardened or bitter really, but that he's too brittle. Watching him, in front of the Pittsburgh forum, standing with his arms crossed, his left hand holding what seems to be an almost empty right sleeve, brings home again the grievous nature of Dole's wound. There's a vulnerability to him. Dole choked up during his convention speech just saying he loved his father. To his eternal credit, it would simply be impossible for him to make the excruciatingly managed play on emotion of Al Gore talking about his sister. Dole, beneath it all, is a man of such deep feelings that they aren't readily available for manipulation, a fact that contributes to his image as the candidate of coldness.
<P>
Which in turn contributes to his poor showing among women. The campaign considers the conservative base locked up with the tax plan and the choice of Kemp as VP, and is concentrating on re-capturing women and GOP moderates. The focus on jobs and small business is considered attractive to women, increasingly the owners of small start-ups. Drugs, again, are considered a women's issue. So is education, a topic Dole treats well on the stump: he asks rhetorically why all parents in America shouldn't have the same ability as the President to send their children to private schools, and he shellacs the teachers' unions. The real danger of Dole's play for moderates is that it scares the campaign off the kind of wedge issues that polarize the electorate along liberal - conservative lines and send ``Reagan Democrats'' scurrying to the GOP.
<P>
The issue of race preferences is the foremost example. The Dole campaign doesn't think it polls well. And it is afraid of the issue's ``volatility.'' But when you're 15 points behind, volatility is a good thing: stock-market crashes, hostage crises -- bring them on! More fundamentally, the preference issue goes to the half of the campaign that has been missing so far. Dole's best-received non-tax line on the stump is when he vows that he, not Boutros Boutros-Ghali, will make decisions about committing U.S. troops to combat. Sound familiar? It's a straight lift from Pat Buchanan. Dole has adopted the Steve Forbes line on taxes; now he needs Buchanan's on the social issues (or at least Gingrich's circa 1994). With crime and welfare essentially neutralized, Dole can still talk about multiculturalism, bilingual education, illegitimacy, and even abortion to get to the differences between the parties. In Scranton, for the first time since his nomination, Dole hit on partial-birth abortion; he did it only after prodding by Senator Santorum on the trip from Washington, but it was a step toward appealing to Catholic swing voters. 
<P>
Dole needs them desperately if he is going to negotiate a tough-looking  electoral map. His aides figure he has to win everything from Idaho east to Minnesota, with the exception perhaps of Montana and New Mexico. Then he has to sweep the South, with the exception of Louisiana and Arkansas, but definitely including Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky (Clinton states in 1992). Only then can Dole afford to lose California and almost all of the Northeast. The key battleground states would be Pennsylvania (where he is down by 14 points), New Jersey (down by 13), Ohio (down by 6), Michigan (down by 10), and Iowa (down by 14). Any Dole strategy looks like a fairy tale as long as he is 15 points behind nationally, with even must-win Florida breaking for Clinton. But the campaign takes solace in the fact that twice in the campaign -- once in June, once in August after the GOP convention -- Clinton's big lead collapsed. That is evidence, they maintain, that when voters truly focus on their choice, it's a tight race.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> question is whether they will ever again get the focus they want. In Pittsburgh, Dole had just zipped off a line about the teachers' unions, when right outside the door of the warehouse a cargo train began to rumble by on a railroad bridge. It made it hard to hear, as car after car rolled by. Here was Dole, standing with a microphone, just a man, again getting drowned out by forces beyond his control: whether it's the White House unblinkingly selling Clinton as a conservative, or an economy humming along nicely, or, in the previous week, the missile attack on Iraq, or just a day earlier, Hurricane Fran. Dole handled the situation well: ``That's the bridge to the future,'' he said, gesturing outside the door, ``more taxes, more drugs, etc.'' The crowd laughed, but the symbolism seemed -- appropriately enough -- pretty ominous.
<P>
The Dole campaign, despite everything, recently contacted Ed Meese for advice on putting together a presidential transition. Give Dole credit: maybe he really is the most optimistic man in America.

September 7, 1996
<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>




It's been a heck of a week. In the first place, I'm still dealing with a lot of the emotional issues that have recently surfaced in my life -- things I've kept pretty well hidden deep in my heart. You know me, Rusty -- I'm a heart-on-my-sleeve kind of guy; I can't hide my emotions. And yet, somehow, some way, from 1988 to 1996 I campaigned in the South as a friend to the tobacco farmer, a supporter of the tobacco industry, a tobacco farmer myself -- all the while internally grieving for my sister who died of lung cancer in 1984. 
<P>
Psychologists call it ``delayed grief transference syndrome,'' and what it means, basically, is that sometimes it takes a big jolt to wake yourself up -- a jolt like realizing that Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, and Illinois don't have any tobacco farmers. You've got to look squarely at an electoral map before the healing can really begin. 
<P>
And then we had the Dick Morris thing, which is really too sordid to go into here. Suffice it to say that it turns out that Morris had a girlfriend, a mistress, and an illegitimate daughter. 
<P>
Lucky for us, Bill and HRC took it all pretty calmly. They go back a long way with Dick, so a lot of it probably didn't shock them. 
<P>
Immediately after we got word that Dick had received a $2.5-million advance from Random House for his memoirs, HRC baked a big batch of brownies and made a giant homemade card that we all had to sign. ``Congratulations, Dick! Our Little Boswell! With Best Wishes!'' was emblazoned on the front. I'm sure Dick appreciated it, but under the circumstances, it was an odd gesture. 
<P>
And later, I thought it was weird when they asked us to get on the phone with them last night, so we could all sing ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow'' to Dick. After we finished singing -- and there were a lot of us crowded around the phone: me, Tip, HRC, Bill, Leon Panetta, George Stephanopoulos, Bob Rubin, and Mike McCurry -- I made the mistake of wishing Dick a happy birthday. It turns out it wasn't his birthday after all. We were singing because, as HRC said, ``It's Dick's favorite song.'' When I pointed out that my favorite song is ``Do You Know Where You're Going To/Love Theme from `Mahogany''' and that no one had ever sung it over the phone to me, all HRC said was, ``You don't have a book contract.'' 
<P>
A few days later, Bill launched an attack on Iraq. And a few days after that, we had a 20-point lead! 
<P>
The only problem is recapturing the House and Senate. In the first place, the pattern of retirements in the Senate is against us. And in the second place, the House races seem unlikely to be influenced by our campaign. 
<P>
But can I be honest with you, Rusty? I'm not all that disappointed. I'm thinking a lot about the future, Rusty, and I've got to admit that future includes a run for the Presidency in '00, and when I called the Des Moines TraveLodge yesterday to reserve 25 rooms and the Corn Cob Convention Room for February '00, well, guess what? Dick Gephardt had already reserved them! Ditto the Granite State Motor Inn in Manchester, New Hampshire. So now I'm stuck with the Ottumwa SleepyDaze as my Iowa headquarters and the MinuteMan Zzzs-4-Less in New Hampshire. So excuse me if I don't break my neck campaigning for Speaker Gephardt. 
<P>
Tonight, as we were all in the Oval Office coloring a big ``We Love You, Dick!'' banner, the conversation drifted to the latest Time magazine cover -- it features Dick and his wife looking glum and haggard. The banner we were working on was supposed to cheer them up. HRC was going to have the Marines fly it up to Connecticut in a C-class helicopter and then just sort of buzz around for a few hours with it flapping away. ``If he gets writer's block or something he can just look up and see this happy banner and then maybe he'll want to write happy things,'' she said. 
<P>
``Here's what I don't understand,'' I said. ``He cheats on his wife, he humiliates her in public, he's famous for having no real scruples or steadfast beliefs, he's liberal when it suits him and conservative when it suits him . . . I mean, what can you do with a man like that? Why would you stay married to him?'' 
<P>
Just then, Bill re-entered the room from another bombing raid. ``Hey!'' he cried happily. ``We're up 26 points in California!'' 
<P>
HRC looked at me. ``That's why,'' she said. ``Sometimes it's worth it.'' 
<P>
I'm not sure it is, Rusty. But then, my judgment is clouded. I'm still suffering delayed grief transference syndrome. I'm due in California tomorrow and it's coming on strong. Wish me the best.

16-SEPTEMBER-1996

At the last Chicago convention, under the bad Mayor Daley, the cops whacked Yippies. Now, under the good Mayor Daley, peace reigns in the party, and the convention is in a neighborhood you wouldn't dare visit at night unarmed under normal circumstances. Progress.

The media, quick to point out an alleged ``shortage'' of women and minorities at the Republican Convention, missed a more interesting story at the Democratic Convention -- the blatant resort to quotas in the selection of delegates. Democratic National Committee rules forbid ``mandatory quotas,'' and Bill Clinton repeatedly proclaims his opposition to them. Yet the 1996 Delegate Selection Rules require all state parties to adopt ``specific goals and timetables'' ensuring that each delegation exactly matches the Democratic electorate in the state in terms of color and sex. Rigid mathematical models and formulas are spelled out, and penalties ensue for any shortfall. As the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> points out, the result is a revealing gloss on how a re-elected Clinton Administration is likely to interpret its ``opposition'' to quotas.

John Cardinal O'Connor has disinvited Bill Clinton from the prestigious Al Smith dinner because of the President's support of partial-birth abortions. Such an unprecedented snub of a sitting President powerfully communicates the depth of the Catholic bishops' outrage. But Cardinal O'Connor diluted that message by not inviting Bob Dole either, in order to avoid charges of partisanship. Jack Kemp and Al Gore have been invited in the presidential nominees' places. The plain, if unwelcome, fact is that one party's ticket sided with the angels on this issue, and another's didn't. On partial-birth abortion, the President hasn't let squeamishness alter his course. Neither should Cardinal O'Connor.

The results are in. Did the networks apply the same standards to the Democratic convention that they did to the Republicans? Did Dan Rather predict walkouts and boos whenever any speaker mentioned the welfare bill? Did Tom Brokaw ask if the delegates really cared about the two-parent family? Did Jim Wooten of ABC point out that the Chicago Convention was ``well staged, craftily designed for a broadcast image of moderation that's starkly at odds with the reality on the floor''?

Congressional Republicans have refused to touch the issue of race preferences over the last year. No longer. If the House passes the version of the Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996 just endorsed by the House Transportation Committee, Republicans will finally take on the issue of quotas -- by re-authorizing one of the Federal Government's more egregious set-aside programs. The act requires that every airport applying for federal funds under the Airport Improvements Program guarantee that 10 per cent of firms doing business at the airport are minority owned. This has led to absurdities such as rental-car companies being forced to buy 10 per cent of their tires from minority firms. It also is plainly unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's <I>Adarand</I> decision. But airport bills are full of pork-laden goodies for nearly everyone, so the Transportation Committee likes to see them pass on big bi-partisan votes -- even if it means winking at the worst sort of racial bean-counting. The House leadership will end the practice, if it has a sufficient quota of courage.

At a morning meeting the first day of the Democratic National Convention, officials of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council bragged of having won the battle for the mind of their party. They can indeed point to a platform that studiously avoids leftist rhetoric and a President who, post 1994 at least, has regularly filched Republican issues. These victories are only provisional, however, as long as the muscles and tendons of the Democratic Party remain so dominated by the Left. While ``New Democrats'' trooped to the podium in the convention hall, in the streets and meeting halls elsewhere around town activists celebrated the old faith -- from AFL - CIO chairman (and Democratic Socialist) John Sweeney denouncing the ``evil'' of Newt Gingrich at an afternoon ``America Needs a Raise'' rally, to the National Education Association caucusing with top Democrats at the downtown Hyatt. All that holds the party together now is the sheer will to retain power. That, and not New Democrat centrism or any other ideological concoction, is what motivates today's Democratic Party. A DNC T-shirt says it all -- ``Win in '96,'' which is what must pass for uplift in Chicago. The last time Democrats met in the Windy City, there was talk of a ``New Politics'' of moral commitment and idealism. Chicago 1996 is about the triumph of the old politics, winning at all costs.

Mr. H.

Or to put it more plainly, he's sticking it to taxpayers. If this is his idea of ``reform,'' he's overdue for that brain surgery.

Maybe Republicans should be happy the press didn't provide more coverage of the San Diego convention. Take the abortion controversy. Reporter after reporter explained that the Republican platform calls for a ban on all abortions. The platform's actual language -- ``we support a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children'' -- is silent on the issue of exceptions. ``It's a statement of principle, it's not a legislative document,'' explains Mike Russell, a Christian Coalition spokesman. The constraints of space, time, and audience attention often make it hard to convey the nuances of a story; but given the vast amount of media attention to abortion, it's puzzling why this error has become a hardy perennial of reporting on the issue. News accounts of the struggle over Dole's proposed ``declaration of tolerance'' were more accurate, but still misleading. They left the impression that all ``tolerance language'' had been stripped out of the platform. In fact, the platform refers three times to legitimate differences of opinion among Republicans: in the preamble (``In one way or another, every Republican is a dissenter''), in the statement of principles (``Because Americans are a diverse and tolerant people, they have differences of opinion on many issues''), and in the opening of the section which deals with abortion and other issues of individual rights and personal safety (``We are the party of the open door,'' etc.). By ignoring the more generic statements of tolerance, they misled viewers through omission. And Howell Raines, the <I>New York Times</I>'s editorial-page editor, provided the most mischievous free advice of the convention. Colin Powell ``could be a more serious force if he set out to rally Republican voters to take back the party from its convention zealots.'' In other words, the GOP's most popular figure should declare war on the party's base in the middle of an election year. And if liberal Democrats should benefit from this fratricide, well, that's OK too.

Bob Dole, it is said, is being whipped by President Clinton on the smoking issue. But nothing so dramatizes the Republican theme of an overbearing, blundering Federal Government as Clinton's policy toward tobacco. As it happens, his latest move -- to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the sale and advertising of tobacco products -- looks like a blunder indeed, because it commits the government to a protracted court battle with the tobacco industry that the industry will almost certainly win. Tobacco products simply don't fall within the purview of the FDA: the law gives the FDA jurisdiction only over pharmaceutical drugs, and all the elaborate regulations the FDA is likely to produce will in time be declared unconstitutional. FDA chief David Kessler knows that. But he doesn't care, wanting to use the interim period to speak to the nation as the President's anti-smoking czar. When Dole last got onto the smoking issue, he made the mistake of speaking off the cuff and then getting angry with lovable girl-next-door Katie Couric. He should choose his forum more carefully and then make the common-sense case that tobacco smoking is a pleasure which does entail a health risk, but that it is a matter of individual choice for adults whether or not they smoke: it is not a matter for Federal Government grandstanding and empire-building. Dole can legitimately warn against the Naderite zealots at the FDA who want to impose tobacco prohibition.

<I><b>NR</b></I> has suspected from the beginning that the political provisions of the Dayton Accords -- the noble blueprint for a unitary, multi-ethnic Bosnia -- might prove unattainable. Sure enough, the Bosnian elections scheduled for September 14 look to be a great disappointment, even a setback, rather than a boost toward stable democracy. There are charges of massive vote-rigging by Serbs in contested areas over which they seek to tighten their grip; in none of the rival communities is there a great predilection for democratic procedures. The deeper problem, however, is not the vote manipulation but the consolidation of partition. (``Electoral cleansing,'' <I>The Economist</I> dubs it.) The Serb and Croat populations have made clear (in U.S. Information Agency opinion polls) that they yearn for partition. For Bill Clinton, Dayton has already served its purpose of putting Bosnia on ice until our election is past. But whoever is President next year will face an unholy mess.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>"I</FONT><font size=+1>T ALL</font>  began with Buckley's column,'' said Jack Kemp at the NATIONAL REVIEW - GOPAC party on Monday night of convention week in San Diego. The column he was referring to, ``The Kemp Manifesto,'' had run on June 21. In it, Buckley called on Bob Dole to adopt some suggestions on welfare and economics that Kemp had made in an essay in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>. But Buckley ended by proposing ``a second, equally exciting move'': that Dole ``name Jack Kemp as vice-presidential candidate.''
<P>
WFB has recommended running-mates before, not always with success: in 1964 he advised Barry Goldwater to tap former President Dwight Eisenhower. This June, offering Kemp as Dole's running-mate seemed scarcely more likely. By now, all the newspapers in America have replayed the long volley of gibes between the two men, going back to the intraparty supply-side wars of the early Eighties: quarterbacks playing without helmets; the fire in Dole's library; the bus that went over the cliff. Dole had made a rapprochement of sorts last year when he and Newt Gingrich picked Kemp to chair a party commission on tax reform (or was it a sop?). Then Kemp seemed to blow it all sky high this spring with his last-minute endorsement of Steve Forbes, on the eve of the New York primary. On top of their policy and political quarrels, Kemp and Dole looked at each other across a gulf of temperament. On the plains where he came from, Dole would say in his acceptance speech, ``a man is very small -- and if he thinks otherwise, he is wrong.'' In the locker rooms where he came from, Kemp used to say and has been saying ever since: ``Be a leader!''
<P>
By 1996 Kemp was estranged not only from the pragmatic Dole but from the conservative movement. His years as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development were marked by questionable policy and effusive rhetoric. Meanwhile, the article of Eighties orthodoxy to which he remained conspicuously faithful -- tax-rate cuts -- was being abandoned by the deficit hawks of the 104th Congress. In July, Kemp told Gingrich at a dinner that no one in the GOP was listening to him any more.
<P>
So adrift was Jack French Kemp that, just before San Diego, he called California Attorney General Dan Lungren and asked if the Lungrens wanted to have dinner with the Kemps Wednesday of convention week. Kemp had no plans.
<P>
Then the call came, and for the next ten weeks at least, Kemp's life will be entirely planned. It was the Great Gatsby meets the Grand Old Party. Kemp had decided not to run for the presidential nomination in this cycle because he dislikes raising money. Now, without raising a dime, he had landed the nomination next door. A man who at the age of 61 had seen his career run deep down into the ground, found himself raised up, not by a loyal friend, but by an old enemy. Who says there are no second acts in American lives?
<P>
Kemp's acceptance speech was fine cheerleading, and classic Kemp. Time has whitened his thatch and thickened his waist, but he still clatters the way he did in 1978. There was inclusiveness: ``From the boroughs of New York to the barrios of California, we're not going to leave anyone out of this campaign. . . . Our appeal of boundless opportunity crosses every barrier of geography, race, and belief. [By definition, since it is boundless.]'' Tablet-keeping: ``Communism came down, not because it fell, but because he pushed it. Thank you, Ronald Reagan.'' Capitalist theology: ``In our work . . . we discover that part within ourselves that is divine. . . . Growth and opportunity . . . advance human dignity.'' Problems: The economy ``is moving like a ship dragging an anchor.'' Solutions: We will ``cut the capital-gains tax in half and not apologize for it.'' Optimism: ``Americans do not accept limits. We transcend limits.'' More optimism: ``It is 1776 all over the world.'' Bob Dole, by the conclusion of his own acceptance speech, had brought himself to assert that he was ``the most optimistic man in America.'' Think otherwise -- there is at least one man ahead of him.
<P>
We can assume that two Republicans in San Diego were secretly displeased with the Kemp pick, not so much for 1996 as for 2000. One would be Pat Buchanan. As several of his supporters reminded me -- more in sorrow, it must be said, than in anger -- Kemp had announced back in February, when Buchanan was riding high, that he could not support a ticket headed by Pat. Buchanan has endorsed the Dole - Kemp ticket now. But he has been calling Kempery ``Big Rock Candy Mountain'' conservatism since the late Eighties. If Kemp should get the top spot in 2000, Buchanan will have ample reason to walk. The other future malcontent would be Colin Powell. In one stroke, Kemp's eager acceptance of Dole's offer made the much-wooed general's unwillingness to take the same slot seem like irrelevant shallying. Kemp is the Happy Warrior, Powell has become the Smug Noncombatant.
<P>
If Dole calculated that picking Kemp would give him a lift, he calculated right. It was more than just a charisma transplant, or an age balance (Kemp is only 12 years younger than Dole, but he will seem youthful if he lives to be 100). It was a statement, by Dole, of his own intentions. The Kemp pick showed that Dole's tax plan, unveiled days earlier, was a serious thrust, not a feint. Dole had decided to put his eggs in the basket of supply-side economics. Enemies could charge him with inconsistency. Supporters could say that he displayed a Majority Leader's knack for sensing political realities. Whatever the reason, the tax plan and running-mate together brought the party into alignment like a magnet under a paper covered with iron filings. Without the one - two punch, the whole convention, from the Powell speech, to Mrs. Dole's walkabout, to the endless parade of the lame and the halt, to Mark Helprin's well-chosen words, would have seemed a lot more patched-up than it did.
<P>
What about other issues? Abortion was hardly mentioned in San Diego. But Kemp has been pro-life all his career, and he raised the issue himself two days after the convention ended at a rally in Pittsburgh. ``Wherever you stand on the issue of abortion . . . I can't imagine our nation being that city on a hill if we continue to allow the partial-birth abortion tragedy in the United States of America. We're not out to preach. We're out to persuade the American people there is something at stake here . . .'' Focusing on partial-birth abortions stops well short of the GOP's call for a right-to-life amendment, of course. But that hasn't gone anywhere for 16 years. Maybe it's time for pro-lifers to try salami tactics.
<P>
Two issues that have come to the fore since Kemp rose to prominence have been harder to finesse. In 1994 the California ballot contained Proposition 187, the initiative which sought to deny a variety of public benefits to illegal aliens. Kemp campaigned against it, both before and after it passed. ``In my view, that is not what America is all about. . . . I'm speaking from the heart, not politically.'' No kidding. On convention Tuesday, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> ran a blunt letter, signed by Thomas P. Logan, treasurer of the Concerned Citizens Committee, arguing that Dole's selection of Kemp ``cost him any chance of winning California. . . . Kemp's open opposition to Prop. 187 . . . is still fresh in the minds of many California voters.'' The next day, a more political Kemp told a meeting of the California delegation that ``we have the right to have a sovereign border. We must close the door of illegal immigration so we can keep the front door of legal immigration open.'' Does ``sovereign border'' mean denying benefits? Kemp has said yes, though he has also said he does not want to turn California ``into a police state.'' In any case, he disagrees with Dole's desire, expressed in Congress if not on the campaign trail, to lower legal immigration.
<P>
Kemp has also urged Republicans in recent years not to make affirmative action a warhead issue, lest it give the appearance of racial politicking. So the Kemp pick seemed at first to be a blow to supporters of the California Civil Rights Initiative, or Proposition 209. But Kemp told the California delegation, in the same appearance in which he endorsed border sovereignty, that ``we've got to bring this country together. We can't be divided by class, as the Clinton Administration [and] race-based quotas do.'' Meanwhile, Ward Connerly, chairman of the drive for CCRI, said he had been talking with Kemp ``for about five months. He has always said he is opposed to quotas and preferences. We had to make the case that there were quotas and preferences'' in California.
<P>
Kemp's fundamental problem was evident in the very <I>Wall Street Journal</I> essay which Buckley praised. In it, Kemp called for indexing the capital-gains law, and tying the dollar to a somewhat elastic gold standard. In return for these reforms, he suggested that the Republicans abandon attempts to change welfare. No more wrangles over poverty or taxes; the rising tide will float us all. Kemp ignores, or rejects, the arguments that the welfare system is personally crippling -- that it creates a trap which incentives, however rich, fail to lure people from.
<P>
And so on, almost down the line. Kemp seems incapable of realizing how hard citizenship, civilization, life itself can be. The comment that it is 1776 ``all over the world'' is a fantasy. It could only have been made by someone with no grasp of what a damned close-run thing 1776 was right here: not so much because of enemy power, as because of our own fecklessness, rigidity, sloth. Growth, opportunity, and work are not the only measures of dignity or divinity. In order for opportunity to flourish, it has to be sustained by a web of habits, prohibitions, and prejudices. These in turn always require the support of custom, sometimes of law. When it is a question of the right to life, Kemp sees the need for something beyond the growth mantra (why not support partial-birth abortions, like that good tax-cutter, Gov. Christine Whitman?). On other questions, he is too busy being optimistic.
<P>
Optimism isn't sufficient, but it's necessary, and the Dole campaign wasn't showing much until it brought Kemp aboard. We're in for a lively ride.

<H2>Understanding The Welfare-Reform Bill</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 2
<P>














Really, the Newspaper of Record leaves us with the impression that the welfare-reform bill is a declaration of war against the State of New York. There were two front-page stories in the <I>New York Times</I> on Thursday. The first by Robert Pear led, ``After hours of suspense and soul-searching, President Clinton said today that he would sign a bill that reverses six decades of social-welfare policy and touches the lives of tens of millions of people.'' And, alongside, from David Firestone, ``President Clinton's decision yesterday to transform the nation's welfare system left both local officials and welfare advocates gasping at the enormous new costs of public assistance they say will have to be borne by city and state taxpayers.'' 
<P>
And those were mere whispers, auguring the roars of pain and indignation and doom talk from such as Mayor Giuliani and Representative Rangel. And then it was discovered that the New York State Constitution ``guarantees'' relief payments to all its residents on welfare. How will we make these payments? Mayor Giuliani told the press the estimated increase in cost to New York City would be $720 million, and so the city's situation is that general revenues are predicted to increase by 0.3 per cent, but expenditures must now increase by 2 per cent.
<P>
Begin with some elementary mathematics. 
<P>
 -- In 1994 New York State paid to Washington, D.C., $1.26 for every dollar New York received from Washington.
<P> 
 -- That being so, a reduction of one dollar in expenditures by Washington means a reduction in levies on New York of $1.26. 
<P>
 -- Therefore, if New York quite simply took over the welfare burden now handled by Washington, the out-of-pocket cost to New Yorkers would be reduced, not augmented. 
<P> 
 -- About thirty states in the Union receive more money from Washington than they pay out to Washington. If there is cause for concern at a dollar-by-dollar level, it is a concern of those states.
<P>
 -- The thinking behind welfare reform is that welfare payments will decrease, not increase, when the plan takes hold. That reasoning is to some extent speculative, but its basis is experience. Senator Phil Gramm points out that we have spent over $2 trillion on welfare in the past thirty years, and poverty has increased. Most especially, illegitimacy has increased, which is the primary generator of poverty. 
<P>
 -- But of course devolution, which is what this bill is all about, does not lay a hand on the freedom of state legislators to re-enact welfare in the old mode, except that financing will have to come from Albany, not from Washington. This means that Sacramento and Albany are free to choose divers approaches to welfare problems.
<P> 
 -- Senator Moynihan, as often happens, had the most original thoughts on the subject. He began by calling everyone who voted in favor of welfare reform insane (``It is a social risk that no sane person would take . . .''). But he wished to distance himself from the cant-talk of fellow liberals. ``For years, whenever the critics said, correctly, that the welfare system was doing more harm than good, and suggested that it be rethought, its defenders screamed 'racism' and 'slavefare.' They did that until there was no public support left at all. Now they are stunned at what they're getting.'' He went on to name Professor James Q. Wilson of UCLA and John DiIulio of Princeton and William Bennett of Washington as prominent welfare skeptics. ``Typically liberals think otherwise, to the extent that liberals can be said to think at all.'' I wish I had said that. 
<P>
But it is indeed an important moment in American history precisely because it asks the fifty states to take on substantial responsibility for exploring more effective means than we have come up with for helping our forlorn and our wayward. In order to do this, the objective of the individual state has to be to arrest the rate of illegitimacy. The means of achieving this end have been exhaustively explored in this space. The only systematic attention given to the problem has been by the scholarly Charles Murray, and his conclusions are harmonious with those provisions of the welfare-reform bill that stress the desirability of work. (Individual states can waive this requirement, but not with federal money.) And then -- a correlative objective? -- we need to free up education, to encourage learning and skills. We know how to do this, but the First Amendment, as interpreted, has got to cooperate.

I'm sitting in my hotel suite at the Drake Hotel in Chicago, I've eaten all the raisins out of the mini-bar, and I'm working on my speech to the convention. Everyone's expecting a real Gore-style barnburner, and I can't let them down. In the middle section of my speech, around page 73, I'm going to try to get the convention hall going in a big chant: ``2.3% Reduction in CAF Standards for the Year 2000!'' And later: ``We turned back the clock on topsoil erosion!''
<P>
Get ready to stamp your feet!
<P>
Tipper's asleep on my shoulder. She's been helping me edit my remarks all nightewhat a trouper! Since I've got to get the preliminary draft over to Dr. Morris by tomorrow morning -- something about ``fine tuning the code'' -- I've really got to finish it tonight, and Tip's been very helpful.
<P>
Near the end of the speech, around page 137, I take a swipe at Jack Kemp. ``The vice-presidential nominee of the other party,'' I say, ``wants to bring us back to the gold standard. And you know what that means. More strip mining!''
<P>
Tipper suggested that I cut that part out, but I told her that the American people only fear what they don't understand, and as I went through it with her, she drifted off on my shoulder.
<P>
I'm expecting big-time cheers!
<P>
This whole campaign has me energized like never before, Rusty. I'm giddy.
<P>
First, Bill and I are finally getting to do more stuff together. Rusty, those early days of our administration were great for our friendship. But I've got to admit that as time went on, little things crept in to keep us apart. Our regularly scheduled lunches together -- just Bill and me one-on-one -- fell by the wayside as gays in the military, Travelgate, Nannygate, the first budget battle, David Gergen, Lloyd Cutler, Whitewater, health care, Haiti, the second budget battle, the 1994 election, Whitewater again, Bosnia, the third budget battle, Whitewater again, China and Taiwan, welfare reform, and Whitewater again kept our respective schedules too tight for our weekly bonding.
<P>
Not so these days!
<P>
Last weekend, Bill, HRC, Tipper, and I spent some time in Tennessee rebuilding a church, and let me tell you, it was quality time all around. You don't really know them until you rebuild a church with them, let me tell you. For instance, who would have guessed that HRC is so handy with a nail gun? And even though Bill smashed his own thumb up pretty bad in the first couple of minutes, he spent the rest of the afternoon helping the Gore girls reach up to the ceiling studs.
<P>
Plus, we've been spending a lot of time together strategizing the convention. It's in Chicago this year, which makes sense in an Electoral College sort of way, but is a little risky politically. There hasn't been a Democratic National Convention in Chicago since 1968, and I'm not so sure that we want all 400,000 television viewers to be thinking ``student protests'' and ``hippie draft dodgers'' as they watch Bill get renominated. I think I may have insulted HRC when I asked her to try to remember exactly where she was all those years ago -- I mean, I hate to be the damage-control guy, but if Ted Koppel ever got hold of an old wire photo of the young HRC, all decked out in love beads, flipping some Chicago cop the bird, well, he'd be broadcasting live from Chicago faster than you can say, ``How about this for news?''
<P>
She acted kind of chilly for a few days after I asked, but I think I was right to bring it up. Lucky for us, Bill did his antiwar protesting in Moscow, where photojournalism wasn't so prevalent.
<P>
Other than those few bumps, though, we're cruising to victory in November. Sure, Bob Dole got a ``bounce'' from his convention. That's because it was a totally scripted affair, designed to project a ``tolerant'' and ``big tent'' image of the Republican Party. Dole kept all the pro-life advocates out of sight. Except for him and Jack Kemp, no other pro-lifers spoke; how diverse can a party be when the platform is pro-life, the convention speakers are pro-choice, and the nominees are pro-life? Well, actually, that sounds pretty diverse to me, but you get my point. We're a lot more diverse than they are. I mean, our African-American guy is a socialist. Theirs isn't. And we've got lesbians and gay men and trial lawyers and teachers' unions. Let's face it, Rusty: our tent is the only tent big enough to hold the whole circus.
<P>
Gotta go! Dr. Morris is at the door. The next time I write, Rusty, it'll be from the Big Bus!

Charles Murray reports that illegitimacy increased at record rates in the 1990s. A third of all American births, and 70 per cent of all black American births, are out of wedlock. But hey, we're winning the debate.

The media all but ignored the quadrennial Polympic Games in Washington, D.C., so we'll give you results here as fast as we can make them up. The shocker, of course, was that President Clinton was disqualified in the Prevarathon for that unguarded remark about raising our taxes too much. The judges ruled that he was trying to tell a truth! -- an almost unthinkable lapse. Mr. Clinton had built a seemingly insurmountable lead with ``didn't inhale'' before his tragic stumble.

Republican platform deliberations began with clear victories for pro-life delegates. The Dole campaign wanted to list abortion as an issue of ``personal conscience'' on which Republicans disagree. Despite heavy pressure on delegates -- from convention manager Paul Manafort, among others -- conservatives stood firm: intra-party disagreement would be acknowledged only generically, and vaguely pro-choice language kept out of the platform. Dole apparently thought the presidential nominee's word would be decisive. The price of his hubris was that his bold new tax-cut initiative had to compete for attention with this defeat in the same old intra-mural battle. He would have known better if he had paid attention to recent platform fights -- or, for that matter, to Kate O'Beirne's recent column on ``pro-Dole, out-of-control'' delegates. The next day, repeated attempts by abortion-rights proponents to ``yank the plank'' were defeated by large margins. This was predictable: pro-choice Republicans never organize to win these votes; they take their case to the media instead. They were at pains to declare they were good Republicans who would work hard to elect Dole; California Gov. Pete Wilson even held a press conference to say he would try to force a floor vote if he had to, all in order to help Dole. Only Ann Stone, head of  Republicans for Choice (a wholly owned subsidiary of CNN), was out of step rhetorically: she has taken to promising that November will be ``payback time.'' As we went to press the Dole team was deciding whether to try to placate Wilson and avoid a floor fight by allowing a pro-choice minority report. If Wilson is sincere about having Dole's best interests at heart -- which the nominee's staff doubts -- he can prove it by repudiating Mrs. Stone.

Leading in the Polympic Sword Fall are Hillary Clinton's former law partners Webster Hubbell, Vincent Foster, and William Kennedy; the Clintons' former business partners Jim and Susan McDougal; and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. However, many Clinton associates have yet to take the big plunge. Keep an eye on Susan Thomases, Maggie Williams, Patsy Thomasson, Bernie Nussbaum, and Bruce Lindsey, among a host of other top contenders, in a field so crowded that we lose count.

For months the media have been going on about a forthcoming revolt by the GOP moderates. Now, at the first test -- the GOP platform debate in San Diego -- there was a successful rebellion: but by conservatives, and on the very issue which the party establishment had sought to obscure and defuse. By a nice coincidence, in the three GOP Senate primaries held on Tuesday, in Michigan, Georgia, and Kansas, the more conservative candidate won in each case. Sam Brownback won handsomely against the moderate Sheila Frahm, who had been appointed to fill the seat Senator Dole vacated in June. (Mr. Brownback's victory was achieved, it must be said, without any help from <B><I>NR</I></B>.) Where Mr. Brownback was vulnerable, notably on immigration, Mrs. Frahm failed to raise the issue. Where he was clearly in tune with the voters, notably on spending cuts, she attacked him as going too far. In other words, Mrs. Frahm was petrified by respectability, more attuned to media liberals than to her conservative constituents, and she is accordingly now a respectable ex-senator. Two conclusions suggest themselves. The conservative wing of the GOP is where the party's energy, passion, and ideas now repose. And moderate Republicans are a <I>nomenklatura</I> without an ideology. Indeed, that is why they appeal to the media.

The Federal Election Commission's complaint against the Christian Coalition -- that its voter guides constitute partisan activity co-ordinated with candidates -- is spurious and likely to fail in court. The operative legal standard here requires literature to include ``express advocacy'' (i.e., words like ``oppose,'' ``vote for,'' or ``defeat'') for it to count as partisan. The Coalition's guides simply inform voters how officials voted on issues of concern to Christian conservatives. If Democrats fare worse than Republicans, it is because of their votes. All the FEC has revealed is its penchant, typical of regulatory bodies, to expand its powers.

Rep. Sue Kelly (R., N.Y.) is part of the Republican fringe that voted against the ban on partial-birth abortions. She is being vigorously challenged by Joe DioGuardi, a right-to-life conservative who used to hold the seat. So it's not surprising that Reps. Bob Dornan (R., Calif.) and Chris Smith (R., N.J.), two of the most committed pro-lifers in Congress, would back DioGuardi. For this crime, the House leadership has come down on them like a ton of bricks. They are being denied legislative-conference seats which their subcommittee chairmanships would normally guarantee them. They were warned that their amendments would not reach the floor (the leadership has backed off on this point). And Smith's travel budget -- he chairs the International Operations and Human Rights subcommittee -- has been cut off. This follows a pattern in the 104th Congress of conservative dissenters being disciplined more harshly than liberal ones. Perhaps Bob Dole could suggest a tolerance plank to the House GOP leadership.

The Dole campaign has found an issue -- marijuana. Pot use among kids is up since Bill Clinton was inaugurated, so vote for Dole. But cocaine use is down; should we therefore vote for Clinton? It is too much to expect the GOP to rethink drug policy in the midst of an election campaign, but certain points -- the medical uses of marijuana; the draconian sentences still being served by casual possessors -- should induce it to show reason on the topic. Sending out Jointman to joust with Buttman keeps the debate on the puerile level favored by the Democrats. If Dole wants to make headway, he will have to focus on policies (e.g., affirmative action) which the Clintonites support when they are stone cold sober.

Much uneasiness among gun-control supporters. Prof. John Lott of the University of Chicago has released a terribly inconvenient study which finds that when law-abiding people are allowed to carry guns, crime drops. His nationwide, 15-year study records an 8.5 per cent drop in homicide, a 5 per cent drop in rape, and a 7 per cent drop in aggravated assault in jurisdictions which permit concealed weapons. Lott observed a slight rise in non-violent crimes, presumably as criminals plied their craft less riskily. Today 36 states now permit concealed weapons, up from 9 states ten years ago, which suggests the common sense underlying Prof. Lott's research has made a bigger impression on state legislators than on gun-control advocates.

Reviewing in the <I>New York Times Book Review</I>, Michael Lind's latest philippic against conservatism, Brent Staples whoops with delight over the author's discovery of the ``hoax'' of mass illegitimacy which, ``along with the idea that welfare causes out-of-wedlock births, is driving virtually all welfare policy.'' If Mr. Lind is right, Mr. Staples's review should have been on the newspaper's front page: <B>MILLIONS OF FATHERS FOUND AT HOME./WOMEN HONEST AFTER ALL./WELFARE REFORM A MISTAKE</B>. Not even the <I>New York Times</I>, however, will run that story because Mr. Lind's conclusion was a . . . fallacy. He pointed out that the rate of black teenagers' having out-of-wedlock babies has remained stable at 80 per 1,000 from 1920 through 1990. On this argument, illegitimate births have risen as a percentage of all births because married couples have fewer children, not because single women have more. Even if that were so, it would still be cause for concern because, unlike the period 1920 - 60, most young blacks today grow up in communities in which illegitimate births (and their attendant ills) are the norm. But it is not so. As Richard Brookhiser points out in <B><I>NR's </I></B> review (page 89), Mr. Lind's own book shows that from 1960 to 1989 expected <I>lifetime</I> births almost doubled for the average unmarried black woman (and almost tripled for the average unmarried white woman). The culprit? Welfare. Until the Sixties, single women might have children outside marriage, but they would then find a father for them and establish a two-parent family. Welfare enables single-parent families to subsist indefinitely while excusing fathers from their duties. The resulting family crisis is, alas, no hoax. And Mr. Staples's ready acceptance of it as one merely shows that fallacies which comfort are harder to detect than those which jar.

In this issue (Letters, page 4), Linda Chavez and John J. Miller seek to drive a wedge between <B><I>NR</I></B> and our economics analyst, Ed Rubenstein, by suggesting that he shares their view that immigration reduces inflation. Alas, they commit an elementary confusion between inflation and inflationary pressures of which Mr. Rubenstein, a staunch monetarist, was not guilty. When wages outstrip productivity (an inflationary pressure), the Fed has a choice: it can either do nothing and watch unemployment rise, or reduce the value of the wage hike by increasing the money supply (inflation). Immigration certainly works to remove this painful dilemma from the Fed -- but at the cost of producing the secondary effects directly. By increasing the supply of labor, immigration either reduces wages, or displaces existing workers, or a little of both. Naturally, anything that cuts wages and hikes unemployment will also tend to reduce inflationary pressures. Perhaps Miss Chavez and Mr. Miller favor other policies that will produce these desirable results. As for their general complaint about NR on immigration, we will happily say something good about them when they produce a good argument.

As the Hague Tribunal tries to hale Serbian war criminals before the bar of justice, the world should remember 1) that there are also Muslim and Croat thugs who are being (or should be) pursued; and 2) that most Serbs in the former Yugoslavia have been bystanders of its chaos. The Bosnian agony is the work of former Communist politicians and ideologues, willing to use communal hatreds in order to gain or hold power. And lest we feel too complacent, this is a feature of multi-ethnic regimes with no commonly acknowledged source of authority.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>n</font> the summer of 1994 Ward Connerly, a new regent of the University of California, was visited by Jerry and Ellen Cook. The Cooks' son, a Phi Beta Kappa undergrad, had been accepted to the combined Harvard/ MIT health sciences program, and was one of two California students admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School. But he was turned away from the medical school at UC San Diego, just around the block from his home, which he hoped to attend to be near his ailing grandparents. The Cooks couldn't believe it. They gathered data from UC medical schools -- Mr. Cook is a statistician -- showing that at the lower grade-point averages and test scores, only preferred minorities were admitted, and that preferred minorities were in the lowest 1 per cent (in terms of GPA and test scores) of accepted students. The numbers, they told Connerly, proved UC was engaged in unconstitutional discrimination.
<P>
Connerly, who had already publicly questioned affirmative action, agreed. For the November regents' meeting, he requested an account of the system's admissions policies from the UC president, who reported back that the affirmative-action policies were necessary because diversity equals excellence and also in order to right the imbalance in medical service to minority communities (minority doctors, presumably, would serve in minority areas). ``I said, If you just change some of the words in here this sounds racist to me,'' Connerly recalls. Meanwhile, he obtained a matrix that served as a guide at UC Berkeley for explicitly scoring applicants by race. The administration denied doing any such thing. ``Yet I had this damn matrix that said they did,'' says Connerly. ``And when I confronted them with it, they said, 'Oh, gee, we forgot that.' The bastards just lied.'' 
<P>
Ward Connerly was getting a crash course in 1990s affirmative action: its victims, its spurious justifications, its protective cocoon of bureaucratic obfuscation and secrecy. Soon he would help enter a new word into the vocabulary of race preferences -- rollback. The low-key Connerly, with his close friend Gov. Pete Wilson providing well-publicized support, succeeded in pushing through measures in July 1995 that eliminated race as a factor in admissions, hiring, and contracting in the UC system. A few months after this high-profile fight had been won, he took the helm of what was then a struggling California Civil Rights Initiative (to be Proposition 209 on the November ballot). Now, not only does the outcome of perhaps the nation's most important election this November depend largely on his managerial and political skills, but his career, motivations, and even personal life have become a crucial part of the battleground.
<P>
CCRI opponents have mounted a well-financed and vicious campaign against the initiative -- the Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie Foundations have kicked in $1.5 million. One of the chief targets is Connerly. The <I>Oakland Tribune</I> recently ran an editorial cartoon of a dry-cleaning shop, with Klan capes hanging on the racks, called ``Connerly & Co -- Ethnic-Cleansers.'' But, what seems to threaten CCRI opponents most is that Connerly is black. Their solution: denying he is. Says State Senator Diane Watson of Los Angeles, ``He probably feels this makes him more white than black, and that's what he really wanted to be,'' adding, ``He married a white woman.'' Or as black San Francisco contractor Fred Jordan put it: ``[H]e's a hypocrite of the worst kind. He doesn't particularly want to be called African American or black, but he's using it very astutely to advance his own personal gains. For someone to stand within the ranks and say, 'I'm not black,' but use it to destroy his own people -- that's the kind we brand as a traitor.''
<P>
Connerly's treason goes even deeper, because he has no debts to racial preferences or to the agitations of the post-1964 civil-rights establishment. So, opponents strain to deny this too. One NAACP official told the <I>L.A. Times</I> that Connerly and Clarence Thomas are hypocrites because they ``thump their chest about merit, when neither of them operates in a realm where merit matters. It's political connections.'' In a bitter op-ed in the <I>L.A. Times</I> Richard Russell, president of the California Alumni Association, attributes Connerly's business success entirely to Pete Wilson. ``If I were in Connerly's position, I too might believe that the race card is largely irrelevant and had nothing to do with my successful position.'' Rather than  gratuitous nastiness, this line of argument is essential to defenders of affirmative action -- i.e., no minority makes it in America without special help. 
<P>
But, in Ward Connerly, they have the wrong man; if the personal is political, his life is a perfect preamble to his current position in the public debate. Connerly's parents divorced in 1941 before he was two and his mother died before he was four. He ended up living with a grandmother in an all-black neighborhood in Sacramento. ``There were certain rules that had to be followed,'' he recalls. ``There weren't many, but one of them was study. Before you go anyplace, study.'' There were four kids in his neighborhood who wanted to go to college, only one of whom owned a car. Connerly had the scores to make it into a four-year school, his friend did not. So Connerly asked his boss for a loan. ``[I]f I loan you the money to buy a car,'' he remembers his boss saying, ``[you'll need] insurance and there are going to be a lot of expenses that go with it. I think you're better off just getting by without the car -- you'll find a way.'' His boss did give him a raise. After two years of car-pooling with his friend to American River Junior College, Connerly had saved enough to buy a used '48 Chevy so he could enroll at Cal-State Sacramento.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font<font size=+1>fter</font> graduating -- the first in his family to do so -- Connerly went to work for Sacramento's re-development agency, then the state housing department. Through his work there he met Pete Wilson, chairman of the State Assembly's new housing committee, who hired him as the committee's chief consultant. The two became fast friends, and Wilson's brand of Republicanism brought Connerly into the party. An early conversation sticks in Connerly's mind. ``He said, 'What are your plans in life?' I said, 'Well, I'll probably go back to the department of housing in some capacity.' He said 'What after that?' I said, 'Well, I'll probably someday become a division chief or something like that.' He said, 'Gee, that's awfully limiting. Haven't you ever considered other possibilities?''' Connerly hadn't. Working in government was a safe haven for blacks. Indeed, when the GOP lost its majority, Connerly landed back at the state housing department.
<P>
It was several more years before Connerly, in February 1973, felt he had enough experience and contacts to make the plunge into the private sector, where his business has been a success (and, <I>pace</I> his critics, has little to do with Wilson's patronage and nothing to do with set-asides). Connerly is 57 years old, balding and unassuming, if blunt. He has been involved in politics, but only as a fund-raiser and informal advisor to Wilson, and so friends were surprised when he splashed onto the front pages with CCRI. His moderate positions on social issues like abortion and gay rights make him an unlikely champion of such a hot-button issue. But Connerly has taken to it with a vengeance. ``He has an innate pro-Americanism that in a way makes him more in league with right-wing conservatives,'' says one CCRI insider. ``I think this has been a radicalizing campaign for him as he's watched some of his moderate allies go wishy-washy.'' Tom Wood and Glynn Custred, the two academics who originated CCRI, first came across Connerly at an August 1994 Assembly hearing on CCRI. ``He stole the show,'' says Wood. ``Glynn and I started plotting immediately on the drive back to the Bay area about how we could get him on board.''
<P>
Connerly initially wasn't interested -- worried primarily about his personal security (he received telephone threats for pushing the UC resolutions). But by the end of 1995 CCRI was on the verge of extinction. It had a couple of professors behind it and a lot of publicity, but little in the way of cash or organization. In November, when it had about three months to get 700,000 signatures, it had only 200,000 and signature gathering had been suspended. Wood and Co. went once again to Connerly, and he agreed to come on board. He and Wilson immediately got on the phone to provide a fund-raising infusion. Connerly, meanwhile, became CCRI's chief spokesman. ``Without Ward and Pete Wilson,'' says Wood, ``CCRI wouldn't have made it on the ballot.''
<P>
Will it pass? The ``no'' forces have the presumptive advantage in any initiative fight. In this case,  opponents are drawing on the resources of myriad organizations on the Left to try to overcome  CCRI's roughly 2 to 1 lead in the polls. Early on, opponents concluded their effort would have to have a white female face. They have indeed shamelessly distorted CCRI's Clause C -- innocuous language meant to exempt institutions like single-sex bathrooms from CCRI's scope -- to argue that the measure legalizes sex discrimination. They also stand to get a boost from a judge's ruling -- under appeal -- that the  relatively innocuous phrase ``affirmative action'' instead of just ``preferential treatment'' must appear in the ballot language. Furthermore, corporations are frightened of CCRI; Connerly recently had to ask Wilson to talk two CEOs out of publicly opposing the initiative (Pacific Gas and Electric has actually come out in opposition). The reaction of the national party has been similar, as Bob Dole appears to have chucked the issue overboard. ``Maybe we should count our blessings,'' Connerly comments dryly.
<P>
But the reaction of national Republicans leaves Connerly in an odd position, reviled by opponents while spurned by those who should be some of his strongest (and most grateful) supporters. ``The Senator Watson stuff isn't as bad as the people that you don't even know who point you out,'' says Connerly. He is often recognized by blacks in airports and elsewhere (whites don't seem to know him yet) who stare at him in disgust. ``You wouldn't be human if you didn't react in some way to that,'' he says. 
<P>
The Republican Party, meanwhile, is not always the most congenial home. Connerly will give speeches at Republican events, get standing ovations, then have a blue-haired lady ask him if he happens to know ``the nicest black man I ever met'' in Philadelphia or somewhere else. ``I just want to grab her,'' Connerly laughs, ``and say, 'Didn't you listen to what I said a few minutes ago? Didn't you listen at all?'''
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>he GOP</font>'s national leaders aren't listening. ``If there ever was an issue that defines Republicanism . . . this is it,'' he says. ``I just want my party to stand for something.'' In the meantime, the small band of CCRI organizers and a handful of California GOP officials will have to do the standing for it, in the face of a withering opposition. Connerly, who describes himself as ``57 going on 70,'' says he has learned a couple things: 1) ``How truly biased some newspapers are.'' 2) ``You don't have to have facts to attack an initiative.'' 3) ``The voters are terribly uninformed.'' But, Connerly says, a fourth lesson trumps the others. ``There's a certain magic about democracy,'' he says. ``I can go into a room with fifty people and perhaps only one in fifty understands what the issue is really about, but somehow their collective intelligence, not in terms of IQ, but in terms of the values and the instincts they bring, transcends [everything else].'' There's no one in a better position to know all they have to transcend than Ward Connerly.

<H2>The Terrorists' Leverage</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 30
<P>









Whoever did in TWA 800 must be very pleased, which makes one wonder why he has not taken the satisfaction of identifying himself. One can imagine a mafia-style meeting of terrorists in a dacha in Lebanon. One is there from the West Bank, one from Syria, from Iran, from Libya, from Ireland. Maybe a North Korean is there, and then one or two who have privatized the art, a Kaczynski type; maybe a militiaman. They cackle about TWA and one of them gives a little proprietary shrug of the shoulders, which brings from the other end of the table, ``Get off that, Buster-ali. You had nothing to do with TWA.'' Eyes travel to him. Does he mean . . . the credit should go to his organization? 
<P>
Perhaps they simply settle for a sense of common accomplishment. They have undoubtedly committed something that, in their books, would be accepted as a quite exquisite crime. Everyone dead, spectacular attention world-wide, day after day. Two weeks have gone by and those fancy American investigators haven't even established that it was an explosion! And all of America is tensing up! I mean, it's the best scene, maybe, since Dallas. And what are those cocky Americans going to do? 
<P>
Good question. Benjamin Stein wrote a few weeks ago that the primary burden of the underclass in America isn't a lack of food or education or shelter. It is a life of insecurity. Their children at school are bullied, their apartments are time and again burgled (in Albany, Georgia, the husband of the woman killed at the Olympic Games rushed off to the hospital. When he got home he found his house burgled), the drug traffickers corrupt their children, and at night they have to lock themselves in to minimize exposure to violence. The great leverage of violence. The skyjacker's leverage, I called it years ago when the practice began of brandishing a pistol in the face of the pilot and telling him to fly the plane to Havana. 
<P>
We made headway against the hijackers. But we have over that species the advantage of imposing on them the same fate that would have befallen the crew and passengers if the plane had crashed. It was in the interest of the hijackers to keep the plane functioning. And since it had to land somewhere, the odds were always against them. After a while even Castro tired of giving them sanctuary, the United States passed a law authorizing the death penalty for a murdering hijacker, and Americans began funneling their hand luggage through security machines and being frisked when they forgot to empty their pocket of the tin cigar wrapper. 
<P> 
A modus vivendi was achieved. The skyjacking went way down, and Americans added airport security to the general overhead of life in modern times. Now there is what appears a revival of the art, without the foreplay of the skyjacker demanding merely a flight to Cuba or Lebanon. This time around, as with Air India and Pan Am and now TWA, they will settle for simply killing everybody on board. 
<P>
Viewed as nothing more than an abrasion of modern life, the cost is incidental. Catastrophic to the victims and their families, but statistically negligible, not even on the same chart with cigarette smoking or driving while drunk. But the great victory of the terrorist is precisely the progressive burden of air travel. Every American who travels, say, twenty times every year by plane is even now paying the equivalent of five to ten hours of tribute to the terrorists, if you assume 15 minutes to one half hour per flight consumed by security. The prospect is for much much more than that, on international flights especially. They are talking about check-in two or three hours before flight time. Once again, the equivalent of paying a tribute of two hours to an unknown terrorist for exercising the freedom to travel. 
<P>
Can we generate a purposive anger? We can always sit at home and rage against the killers, but that's pretty Platonic stuff, doesn't hurt them a bit if we just steam every time we think of them. 
<P>
There is only one way to apply direct pressure. We know that Syria and Iran and Libya are training terrorists, but we are not in a mood simply to bomb population centers there. We need discriminating targets, and to develop them we need abundant counter-intelligence. The G-7 powers are meeting now to consider retaliatory action. The imagination here should be encouraged. The easiest and most urgent step is a gaudy reward for anyone who will lead us to the terrorist. We know there are two holed up in Libya right now, responsible for the Pan Am Lockerbie incident. Perdicaris-alive-or-Rasuli-dead is the language we should be using with Mr. Qaddafi.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>

It's been a tumultuous couple of weeks, let me be the first to admit. I'm sitting here in my office, it's late, but I'm too keyed up to go home -- I'm busy channel surfing, waiting for the early editions of the Post and the New York Times.
<P>
I guess this is how big Broadway actors feel on opening night: excited, nervous, thrilled -- you see, Bill announced late this afternoon that he's going to sign the welfare-reform bill, and I can't wait to see how it'll play in the national media.
<P> 
So far, on Inside Politics, we've been getting raves. There's been universal acclaim for the Clinton - Gingrich welfare plan. It'll be tricky, come election time, to help the voters distinguish between ``Clinton - Gingrich'' and ``Dole - Gingrich,'' but hey, that's what we pay those media guys the big bucks for, right? 
<P>
And on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, the word has been universally positive, except for one old fuddy-duddy who complained about ``no coherent philosophy,'' but let's be honest, Rusty -- there's no point in having a coherent philosophy if you're not in office. Just ask Jimmy Carter.
<P> 
I've been advocating this move for months -- you know me, Rusty, I was the original New Democrat, back in 1988 -- and for a long time, it was just me and Dick Morris, voices crying in the wilderness. We'd have long meetings in the Oval Office with the full staff -- me, Dick, George Stephanopoulos, Mike McCurry, Donna Shalala, Leon Panetta, and the rest of the gang -- and let me tell you, Rusty, it wasn't easy to win the argument. 
<P>
In the first place, Bill tends to agree with the last person who speaks, and since he calls on people to speak moving clockwise around the room, Dick and I had to keep getting up, pretending to stretch our legs, and sitting down a couple of seats over. That way, the debate would go: me, George, Dick, Leon, me, Donna, Dick, Mike, me, Bob Reich, Dick . . . and then we'd try to time it just right so that the conversation always ended with either me or Dick. 
<P>
It didn't look too natural. George caught on early, I think, because when Dick or I would get up to stretch our legs or ``get another Diet Coke,'' George would always get up too, ``to smooth out my pants,'' he'd say, but I noticed that he kept sliding down the couch, always trying to be the last one. 
<P>
At this afternoon's meeting -- the last one before Bill was supposed to announce his decision -- Dick very cleverly head-faked George by half-standing, then sitting down very quickly right next to Bill before George had a chance to slide completely over. There they were, slammed next to each other, shoulders touching, legs fighting for seat-cushion turf, pushing hard against each other until finally Dick, who has a lot more bulk, managed to squeeze George off the couch and onto the floor.
<P> 
And that's pretty much how welfare reform got signed into law. It was thrilling, let me tell you. 
<P>
Bill and I headed down to the briefing room while Dick got George into a half-nelson and stuffed a cushion into his mouth. I felt sorry for the guy, but I also knew that if he got so much as ``a million kids on the street'' out, Bill would get that quizzical look on his face, postpone the decision, and we'd still be nervous about Bob Dole.
<P> 
The only problem right now is HRC. She was down in Georgia when Bill called her.
<P>
``Hillary,'' he said into the phone, twisting the cord into a thousand loops, ``I've decided to back the House welfare reform.'' 
<P>
He winced a bit, and held the phone away from his ear for a few moments. 
<P>
He listened for a few seconds, then looked up. ``She wants to know if we can fix it later, after I'm re-elected,'' he said to Dick Morris. 
<P>
Dick shook his head and mouthed, ``No way.''
<P>
Bill nodded. ``Dick says, 'Of course we can,' Hillary. He's calling this a 'tactical center-shift.''' 
<P>
He winced again, held the phone away again.
<P>
``Okay, then, have it your way,'' he said. ``It's a 'tactical shift to the far right.' But I think we're just playing semantics.'' 
<P>
More wincing. 
<P>
``Hillary,'' he said into the phone, ``we're still very much in favor of partial-birth abortions. That should count for something.'' 
<P>
A few moments later, he hung up. ``She'll come around,'' he said. ``She's always said that in the second term, the gloves come off.''
<P> 
Rusty, the interns just brought in the Post and the Times. We're a hit! ``A masterful stroke,'' croons the Post. ``Brilliant leadership,'' cries the Times. ``Two thumbs up!'' say Shields and Gigot.
<P> 
Who knew being conservative was so . . . so popular? 
<P>
See you in Chicago!

<LI>Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has agreed to stay in his house and take no part in the upcoming Bosnian elections. Considering how Dole is doing, can we make the same deal with him?

The House Republican leadership has ended a year of wavering about the Dole - Canady anti-preference bill with a pre-emptive surrender. Instead of attempting to abolish race and gender preferences in federal programs, employment, and contracting, the GOP will target its attack on the Small Business Administration's Section 8(a) program. The program is, to be sure, a noxious mix of racial preference, corporate welfare, and administrative inefficiency. The General Accounting Office reports that 1 per cent of certified firms receive a quarter of the business under the program; less than 9 per cent of contracts are awarded competitively; and less than 4 per cent of 8(a) firms become ``competitive.'' Some Hill Republicans think this program is analogous to partial-birth abortions, as being among the least defensible products of modern liberalism. But the power of the partial-birth-abortion issue was that it brought the abortion debate down from abstraction. When it comes to preferences, the public is already in tune with Republicans on broad principle. The debate should take place there, not at the level of eye-glazing bureaucratic detail. The retreat also opens Republicans to the charge of tolerating reverse discrimination against all Americans except the owners of corporations. Finally, while many liberals voted for the partial-birth-abortion ban, they are sure to fight any affirmative-action rollback -- especially since they can sense the GOP's fear.  ``On this issue the Republican leadership has been spinning around like a weather vane in a hurricane,'' says Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.), who, along with Susan Molinari (R., N.Y.) and Chris Cox (R., Calif.), has stood on principle. It is ground they share with the American people -- if not, alas, with Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey.

When Democratic congressional leaders unveiled their ``Families First'' agenda last month, it was hailed by some as evidence of the party's newfound moderation on size-of-government and social issues, and derided by others as a pale imitation of the Contract with America. But it turns out that even when they try to present their best face to the public, New Democrats still have to placate the same Old Left constituencies. Among their agenda's 21 planks was a little-noticed call for ``fair pay'' and ``pay equity'' -- the current code-phrases for ``comparable worth,'' that golden oldie of late-Seventies feminism. The idea, remember, was that equal pay for men and women doing the same jobs wasn't enough, because men and women congregate in different fields. So occupations dominated by women should pay the same wages as ``comparable'' work in other fields; e.g., secretaries should be paid like lab technicians. Determining the proper compensation for each job would, naturally, require heroic efforts by lawyers, bureaucrats, and assorted experts. ``Families First'' is slippery about all this, as befits a party being remade in Bill Clinton's image. The Democrats want the Secretary of Labor to develop ``voluntary fair pay guidelines for the nation's employers'' and to hold a National Summit on Fair Pay to devise ``a specific legislative action plan for Congress to better achieve fair pay in American workplaces.'' The upshot is unmistakable: for 1990s Democrats, moderation means central planning with a feminist face.

Incidentally, in case you were wondering, President Clinton has declared April 11 to be National Pay Inequity Awareness Day. And to be fair, we had forgotten.

Republicans scored a few victories in last year's appropriations process -- e.g., when they zeroed out programs like the Women's Educational Equity Act. The twenty-year-old program exists to make congressmen feel righteous about their opposition to girls' scoring poorly in math, while allowing feminists to funnel dollars to their brethren and sistren in the field: $91,000 to Wellesley's Center for Research on Women, $139,000 to Educational Equity Concepts, Inc., for a program on ``Gender-Based Teasing and Bullying in Grades K - 5,'' and so on. Since Republicans are in the ``two steps back'' stage of their revolution, it should come as no surprise that 101 House Republicans voted to restore $2 million for the act, their consciences pricked by Nita Lowey (D., N.Y.) and Connie Morella (R., Md.). Cheers at Wellesley. But for taxpayers not in residence at a women's studies program, the vote is another sign that they need this limping GOP Congress like a fish needs a bicycle.

At a Washington dinner hosted by <B><I>NR</I></B>, Richard Lamm came across as a genial and intellectually curious presidential candidate lost in a minor party. Not everyone will warm to his can't-do collectivism, but on some issues -- notably entitlements and immigration -- his views coincide with those of most conservatives. While he's unlikely to win the Reform Party's nomination, let alone the Presidency, his candidacy is among the many portents of a potentially dramatic realignment of American politics if the GOP continues to falter. Mr. Lamm is a serious man whose arguments deserve a hearing (more than can be said of his rival, Ross Perot).

Under normal circumstances, Rep. Sam Brownback's August 6 primary challenge to Sheila Frahm, Bob Dole's appointed successor in the Senate, would have <B><I>NR</I></B>'s support. Brownback is making nice noises about cutting taxes, social issues, etc. And if he's really a recovered moderate (he did not sign the Contract with America), we are prepared to rejoice over any sheep which was lost. But circumstances are not normal. Brownback led the sabotaging of the Smith - Simpson immigration-reform bill this year. Roy Beck, <B><I>NR</I></B> contributor and author of the fine <I>Case against Immigration</I> (Norton), points out in an open letter to Kansas papers that the state's meatpacking workers are a classic case-study of irresponsible displacement by employers who, in the welfare state, can dump the social costs of immigration onto local communities. We cannot endorse Sheila Frahm, who is pro-choice. But we can declare neutrality.

In the July 15 <I>New Yorker</I>, James Stewart reports that Whitewater prosecutor Ken Starr is ``highly unlikely'' to seek high-profile indictments before the November elections. Mr. Starr says that the effect of charges on the political process is ``a powerful counsel for restraint.'' We hereby file a motion to reconsider. A prosecutor's duty is to bring indictments when he thinks the evidence justifies them, neither sooner nor later. Withholding indictments until after the election would politicize the prosecution as much as deliberately seeking to indict before the election. And it could be far worse for the country. The least desirable outcome would be for damaging revelations to surface at the opening of a second term, when congressional Democrats might be ready to dispense with Mr. Clinton. One Watergate was enough.

The Office of Management and Budget now predicts a $117-billion deficit for this fiscal year. That's $29 billion less than the Administration forecast only a few months ago. A great vindication of Clinton's fiscal policy? Or did Congress have something to do with it? The 104th Congress was the first in nearly thirty years to make real cuts -- not phony ``baseline'' cuts -- in discretionary spending. Admittedly, this was not a surgical operation; the government shutdown and continuing resolutions played major roles. But we'll take it: federal spending will fall to 21.3 per cent of gross domestic product this year, en route to an 18.8 per cent share (and balance) by 2002. Meanwhile, federal revenues are still on the up escalator. At 19.7 per cent of GDP, this year's tax burden is the heftiest since the recession of 1982. (Wall Street, please note.) If we dodge a deep recession, a zero deficit in 2002 is in the cards. Then the real problems start. When the baby-boomers retire, Medicare and Social Security will drive federal spending to unprecedented levels. Outlays could reach 37 per cent of GDP by 2030, according to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlements. The deficit? An astounding 18.5 per cent of GDP in 2030. Hold the champagne.

On July 17, 4 Senators and 37 Representatives filed suit to compel the Clinton Administration to comply with the 1996 Defense Authorization Act. Title II of that Act, which covered ballistic-missile defense, required the Pentagon to develop and deploy the Army's Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the Navy's Theater-Wide Defense (TWD) according to a definite timetable. Whereupon Secretary of Defense William Perry declared that he had no intention of doing so. When President Nixon refused to spend funds as appropriated, his attempted ``impoundment'' provoked storms of outrage. ``Dangerous . . . no justification . . . unconstitutional,'' thundered then-Rep. Abner Mikva -- lately a Clinton White House Counsel. Yet the Clinton Administration gives no excuses or explanations; it simply refuses to comply with the law. Hats off to Rep. Floyd Spence, chairman of the House National Security Committee and leading plaintiff in <I>Spence</I> v. <I>Clinton</I>, and to Sens. Jon Kyl and Strom Thurmond, Reps. Bob Livingston and Curt Weldon, and others who defended ballistic-missile defense and the law.

Bob Dole celebrated his 73rd birthday, and many happy returns -- as seems likely from the superb medical report his office issued. President Clinton has never permitted his medical records to be released and, indeed, fired a White House doctor early in his Administration for suggesting that he do so. Just thought we'd mention it.

Northern Ireland is again in crisis after Protestant Orangemen sought permission to march alongside a nationalist Catholic housing development on Garvaghy Road in the small town of Portadown. Local Catholics, led by an ex-IRA man who had bombed a Protestant hall, objected, predicting violence. So the Northern Ireland chief constable -- a Dubliner -- forbade the march, and thousands of policemen dutifully held the Orangemen back while militant Protestants elsewhere almost closed Northern Ireland down, causing scores of Catholics to flee their homes. Tens of thousands of Orangemen converged on Garvaghy Road, causing the chief constable to capitulate. He allowed a small and silent party of Orangemen to march, while policemen cleared the way, now using batons against protesting Catholics. Nationalist areas promptly erupted in a vengeful fury. Dublin blamed London for going easy on Protestants and hard on Catholics, but there is no simple way to subdue a majority community in insurrection without intolerable bloodshed. All policy in Northern Ireland risks making one side uneasy, and the Protestants, nervous since the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, and increasingly frightened of being sold down the river, cracked first. Their violence, appalling though it was, showed once again how a concession to one side will trigger violence from the other. If Protestants will go this far to let a few Orangemen walk down Garvaghy Road, to what lengths will they go to stay out of a united Ireland?

Is there a better television journalist than ABC's John Stossel? His latest <I>20/20</I> eye-opener exposed the Americans with Disabilities Act, the hyper-complex law that grants ``disability'' protection to a variety of dysfunctions, and hobbles businesses (e.g., the Los Angeles strip club that has been ordered to build a wheelchair ramp because ``someone in a wheelchair might want to become a show stripper''). The program's highlight was Stossel's interview with Gilbert Casellas, the chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Casellas: ``The law's fairly clear, it's fairly simple.'' Stossel: ``If you come to me applying for a job, and your arm's in a sling, can I ask you why your arm is in a sling?'' Casellas: ``You can ask -- you know what? I'm going to ask you to stop the tape . . . we're getting into a complicated area . . .'' Stossel: ``You run the EEOC, and you don't even understand [the rules]? How's some employer in Iowa supposed to know them?'' When the grilling stopped, Casellas was left thoroughly disabled.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>t first</font> only members of the House Ways and Means Committee wanted to send President Clinton a stand-alone welfare-reform bill. For months, the Republican strategy had been to combine welfare reforms with changes to the Medicaid system that President Clinton couldn't stomach, guaranteeing a Clinton veto of the welfare - Medicaid package (in what could be his third veto of welfare legislation). But Ways and Means members, after more than a year of labor, were anxious to see their handiwork become law. Committee members John Ensign (R., Nev.) and David Camp (R., Minn.) circulated a letter to the leadership in June asking that the House pass a welfare bill stripped of the Medicaid veto-bait. It got about fifty signatures. Speaker Newt Gingrich opposed the idea, hoping to give the Dole campaign an opportunity to attack Clinton over a third welfare veto. But, soon, it would be a lost cause.
<P>
Rep. Jimmy Hayes (R., La.), one of last year's party-switchers, convinced Majority Leader Dick Armey at a June meeting in the Ways and Means room of the Capitol that Clinton would have to veto even a stand-alone bill or risk infuriating his base. Meanwhile, it seemed increasingly senseless for the House to try to protect the interests of a floundering Dole campaign. If Congress passed a bill the President could sign, Members would get credit back home for a major accomplishment. ``The campaign wasn't scoring points on welfare anyway,'' explains one party official. When Ensign and Camp wrote another letter, they got more than a hundred signatures just by walking onto the House floor. House leaders weren't sure they could pass even the procedural ``rule'' -- typically a party-line vote -- for a bill keeping welfare and Medicaid together. The two would have to be split  -- and the Dole campaign would have to fend for itself.
<P> 
The decision to send Clinton a welfare bill he might sign is emblematic, not only of a potential major rift between congressional Republicans and the Dole campaign, but of the way the weakness of the campaign feeds further weakness; it prompts the GOP to throw good politics after bad. No Republican  wins from the welfare decision. If the President signs a bill, Dole loses irrevocably one of the GOP's traditional top three issues (taxes, crime, welfare). Getting anything other than a watered-down bill through Senate moderates, meanwhile, is always a dicey proposition (some Ways and Means members, privately banking on a second Clinton term, argue that <I>any</I> bill passed this year is the best chance at reform this century). Finally, House Republicans may well find that disarming Dole on a major issue would ultimately hurt more than their ``accomplishment'' helps. ``Any guy who is in a marginal district who thinks he needs welfare to boost him,'' argues a top Senate staffer, ``doesn't realize that . . . if Bob Dole is not doing well, it doesn't matter -- he sinks without a trace.''
<P>
But Capitol Hill Republicans, understandably, aren't in the mood for being team players. The feeling, according to one long-time congressional aide, is reminiscent of 1992, ``when we were getting bashed on the fairness issue, [and] Republicans kept waiting for the Bush campaign to rescue them. Finally we realized the cavalry wasn't going to come over the hill.'' This year no one is expecting a charge of the Dole brigade. ``People have given up,'' says a senior House leadership staffer. ``They're looking at Dole and he's awful. He's a nothing. He's a zero.'' It is only July, with the public more focused on Dan O'Brien's long jumps than Bob Dole's flip-flops. But if the Dole campaign continues to drift, congressional Republicans will resort to more free-lancing like the welfare - Medicaid split. Another House aide gives Dole a few more weeks to find his voice, but ``if he doesn't, it's going to be CYA, baby.''
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>F</font> House Republicans abandon Dole, it will be a sort of rough justice -- since Dole left them first. In a June interview with the <I>Washington Times</I>, Dole gave House freshmen the back of his hand: ``Those people who voted for you [freshmen] want you to do, but they don't want you to do it so fast'' (sic). His bumbling reversal on the assault-weapons ban cut the legs out from under House members who had made a tough vote to repeal the ban in order to keep the gun-rights portion of the GOP base happy. Dole, of course, was working at cross-purposes, trying to distance himself from that same base (and succeeding -- only 62 per cent of Republicans support him, according to recent polls). The strategy is the mirror image of Clinton's ``triangulation,'' which works for the President because what his core supporters represent is unpopular with the rest of the country. Dole, on the other hand, dampens his own party's enthusiasm by eschewing the very issues with which Republicans win swing voters (abortion, affirmative action, etc.).
<P>
Compounding the strategic divergence is the Dole campaign's organizational disarray. Speaker Gingrich convenes weekly Thursday-morning meetings with top staff  from the campaign committees, Sens. Spence Abraham (Mich.) and Paul Coverdell (Ga.) and Reps. Bob Franks (N.J.) and Jennifer Dunn (Wash.) -- all former state party chairmen -- to talk about the shape of the national GOP campaign. At first a representative of the Dole campaign would attend the meeting. Lately, the campaign has been AWOL. For Hill offices, trying to reinforce the Dole message -- assuming there is one -- is often a shot in the dark; it's easier to find out what the White House will be doing in days ahead than the Dole campaign. A schedule of coming events produced by the RNC for the Gingrich meetings has a column for the Dole campaign -- sometimes left nearly blank.
<P>
There have been daily morning conference calls between communications offices on the Hill and Dole communications staff. But, explains one GOP press officer, it has become increasingly clear that staff-level co-ordination is a waste of time as long as the Dole campaign is ``a rudderless ship.'' So the House has revamped its own communications apparatus around daily meetings involving Gingrich, other members of the leadership, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Bill Paxon, and Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich. In a kind of communications whip effort, the members will decide who among congressional Republicans can help deliver a daily message. Officially, the new structure has nothing to do with Dole, but privately some House aides describe it as a way of going alone -- until the campaign catches up.
<P>
Congressional Republicans share some of the blame for the GOP's funk. For one thing, over the last two years they have reinforced Dole's natural aversion to tax cuts. Jack Kemp, Sen. Trent Lott, Sen. Connie Mack, Dick Armey, and Newt Gingrich -- the so-called ``amigos'' -- have recently focused with more energy on how to get the party back on the growth track. One idea (which has already been carried out) was a Hill conference on the slow pace of the Clinton recovery.  A useful by-product of the activity is preparing the ground for a Dole tax cut (both Donald Rumsfeld and Vin Weber, two tax-cutters in the Dole camp, have been involved).
<P>
The House GOP has also abetted Dole's punt on race preferences. The campaign's unwillingness to talk about the California Civil Rights Initiative approaches insanity; in recent polling by California assembly candidates, Dole was losing by about 10 points in two swing districts in Long Beach, while CCRI was winning by 30. But the House has followed Dole's affirmative-action retreat with alacrity.
<P>
The irony is that if Congress goes its own way it may become even more timid. Republicans do best when campaigns are nationalized around a few polarizing issues. But with the Dole campaign showing little interest in that kind of campaign, congressional Republicans will be forced back on traditional incumbent campaigns, emphasizing their bi-partisan accomplishments (a marked contrast to 1994, when confrontational Republicans defined Clinton as a liberal). Welfare is one example. The other is health care, with Republicans likely to jettison their attempt to get Medical Savings Accounts in a rush to pass a version of the Kassebaum -  Kennedy regulation bill that the President can sign. If this strategy worked in the past for congressional Democrats -- natural deliverers of pork, from local water projects to the various benefits of the welfare state -- it's not so clear it will be a boon to Republicans, especially if a Dole campaign constitutes a huge drag from the top.
<P>
GOP congressmen are counting on a variety of buffers from a Dole campaign downdraft. One is money. The Republican campaign committees have huge money leads over their Democratic counterparts and so will many individual Republican incumbents (although union spending vitiates this advantage somewhat). Another is candidates. When the parties were recruiting congressional candidates the political environment still favored Republicans, and it shows. Third and last is geography. A Dole debacle could kill Republicans in tough Northeastern districts, but the big GOP gains last year were concentrated in the South, where Republicans stand to make more headway no matter what. Some on the Hill even talk of ``reverse coattails,'' drumming up enough turn-out in their own districts to carry Dole. Would that it were possible. Says political analyst Stu Rothenberg: ``That's not just wishful thinking, that comes from the Land of Oz.''
<P>
The bad news is that straight-ticket voting is on the rise. ``People aren't going to turn out and vote for Bill Clinton and [vulnerable Kentucky freshman] Ed Whitfield,'' says one party official. ``That's just not going to happen.'' Columnist Robert Novak projects that, if the election were held today, there would be a 50 - 50 split in the Senate. If Dole loses by more than eight points, the GOP majority in the House could begin to fade too.
<P>
There is still time for the political environment to change. An over-confident Clinton could veto welfare reform. The Dole tax package could be bold enough to energize his party. But, whatever happens, there's no avoiding Bob Dole. A stampede to desert him, further demonstrating his weakness and contributing to a still larger loss, will ultimately hurt the deserters. For Republicans, the Dole campaign is like a bad dream, filled with hints of impending doom, but no opportunity for escape.

<H2>Zounds! Enforcing The Law in Idaho!</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 9
<P>




The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> reports on Gem County in Idaho, which is conducting a daredevil experiment with the law, by enforcing it. Sitting in the statute books all these years is a little derelict that says that ``any unmarried person who shall have sex with an unmarried person of the opposite sex shall be found guilty of fornication.'' The county prosecutor whose bright idea was to apply the law didn't do so indiscriminately. To have done this would of course have meant to repeal the Playboy Philosophy, and nobody thinks himself grand enough or powerful enough to accomplish that. But Mr. Douglas Varie decided to focus on just one aspect. Teenage pregnancy.
<P>
As everybody (almost everybody) knows, there is such a thing as prosecutorial discretion, which means that you can't defy the cop who stops you for speeding on the grounds that he didn't stop the other guy for speeding. There are exceptions. If prosecutorial conduct bumps into the civil-rights laws, then intervention by the courts can be tried. If only Hispanics or women are stopped for speeding, they can complain and get a hospitable hearing.
<P>
But Mr. Varie didn't start snooping around in motels or parking lots overlooking the scenic splendors of the State of Idaho. He started looking for pregnant teenagers. In fact, he narrowed the search still further. He has been looking for pregnant teenagers who apply for welfare.
<P>
Having done this, he then looks for the feller who got the girl in the family way. And although this is often another teenager, sometimes it is not, for instance in a recent case in which the stud, Michael Hopkins, was 22 years old. The penalty for lewd and lascivious behavior can be life imprisonment. Nobody expects this to happen, but the mere thought of it might interfere with Michael's cocksureness in future encounters. (One pregnant girl was sentenced to thirty days for a misdemeanor and she was quite shocked by the severity of the sentence.) The prosecutor pointed out that the community had every right to be shocked at the prospect of a child being born out of wedlock, which increases by a very high percentage the probability that that child will end up in prison, on welfare, illiterate, and on drugs.
<P>
Needless to say, the American Civil Liberties Union has got into the act, though it isn't absolutely clear what case it has. The prosecutor asked the general question: Does the community intend to enforce the law against statutory rape? This is defined as sexual encounters with girls under a certain age. What does one do, he asked, in a situation in which a 15-year-old girl is made pregnant by a 22-year-old man, and declines to charge her companion with rape? The common-law provision in such cases is to pronounce any sexual intercourse with under-age girls as that exactly  -- rape. And whatever ambiguities beset the law when deciding whether sexual congress took place, there aren't any when the girl is pregnant.
<P>
The Idaho experiment reminds us once again of a paradox in the development of social practices in free societies. It is that these societies suffer from heavy criticism of their toughness (the Darwinian reproach) but shrink from getting the benefits from toughness. We terribly much want American children to learn to read and write, and we offer them public facilities in which to learn how to do this. But if they refuse to learn, we do -- nothing. We very much desire that youngsters not band together in gangs that harass innocent people, but on the whole, we do nothing about them. We terribly want boys and girls not to create children doomed to neglect, 
but far from discouraging such activity, we subsidize it.
<P>
A free society is one that in most cases imposes penalties by its own devices. If you start a mousetrap factory and produce a product less successful than that of your competitors, what happens is that you go broke. The people who work for you lose their jobs, you lose your capital, and the empty factory building is auctioned off. But if you create one of the one million children born out of wedlock every year, you pass along the welfare cost to the government and, as often as not, produce another child. Mr. Varie thinks that is not a good idea and has come up with the ingenious solution of activating, in however diluted form -- the law. Very much worth watching, Gem County.

July 15, 1996<p><P>

NSA SATELLITE DOWNLINK INTERCEPT<br>

MALE VOICE [identified as: Vice President of the United States]: Hi, Rusty! I'm flying home from Moscow. Can you hear me? [Inaudible.]<br>

VPOTUS: Hello?<br>

FEMALE VOICE [Identified as: Mrs. Gore/Second Lady of the United States]: Al?<br>

VPOTUS: Hi, Tip.<br>

SLOTUS: How did the meeting with Yeltsin go?<br>

VPOTUS: Not so well. He kind of didn't make it. I think he was sick or something.<br>

SLOTUS: Sick? What kind of world leader is so sick that he can't meet the Vice President of the United States?<br>

VPOTUS: I don't know. A sick one, I guess.<br>

SLOTUS: This is a problem. It's a serious loss of face.<br>

VPOTUS: C'mon. It's not like I'm president.<br>

SLOTUS: You never miss an opportunity to remind me of that, do you?<br>

VPOTUS: Tipper!<br>

SLOTUS: Al, go back.<br>


VPOTUS: Back to Moscow?<br>

SLOTUS: No. Back to Ft. Lauderdale. YES BACK TO MOSCOW!<br>

VPOTUS: Keep your voice down. People will hear.<br>

SLOTUS: Al, look at things realistically. Ken Starr is not going to go to the Grand Jury before October, and they won't return indictments until mid-November at the earliest. David Brock's book is going to come out after Labor Day. And Dole's chief strategist seems to be Dr. Kevorkian.<br> 

VPOTUS: What's your point, Tip?<br>

SLOTUS: My point is, when you get stood up by a world leader, well, it makes you and the office of the Vice President seem inconsequential. The whole thing reeks of . . . Mondale. Or worse: Bush.<br>

VPOTUS: Tipper, if I may, I'm pretty much regarded as a kind of ``co-president.''<br>

SLOTUS: Wake up and smell the coffee, Al. He doesn't need you to look presidential any more. Somehow, some way, he did it himself.<br>

VPOTUS: Well, that's great news! I'm thrilled! What terrific news! Really! Just terrific!<br>

SLOTUS: He's 27 points ahead of Dole in California.<br>

VPOTUS: [Expletive deleted!]<br>

SLOTUS: Now they want you and me to take a ``power walk'' together on Good Morning America to demonstrate the Surgeon General's new guidelines for exercise.<br>

VPOTUS: Actually, that sounds like fun.<br>

SLOTUS: Al, they don't mean it to be fun. They want to diminish your role. It helps you-know-who look more presidential.<br>

VPOTUS: How do you know this?<br>

SLOTUS: I went to last week's strategy meeting in the Yellow Room.<br>

VPOTUS: You went to a Yellow Room meeting? Wow! Tipper, how did you get in? They don't even let Hillary in those.<br>

SLOTUS: Never mind.<br>

VPOTUS: Tipper -- I demand to know how you talked your way into a closed and very private campaign strategy meeting.<br>

SLOTUS: I didn't talk my way in. And I didn't sneak in. I walked in, Al. I walked straight in.<br>

VPOTUS: What?<br>

SLOTUS: Okay, okay. I was dressed as a maid.<br>

VPOTUS: Honestly, Tipper! Dressing up as a maid! You make me feel like Ricky Ricardo!<br>

SLOTUS: You know, Richard Berke of the New York Times was a lot more grateful for the information than you are.<br>

VPOTUS: Okay, Tipper. What did you hear?<br>

SLOTUS: First, no bus trip after the convention.<br>

VPOTUS: Oh, man! I loved that bus trip!<br>

SLOTUS: Also, you're only allowed a short speech. And you've got to make a lot of attack speeches.<br>

VPOTUS: Who am I? Spiro Agnew?<br>

SLOTUS: That's what I said at the meeting. And then everyone turned and looked at me. And Dick Morris asked my name. I scooted out pretty fast.<br>

VPOTUS: Do you think they recognized you?<br>

SLOTUS: C'mon. It's the White House. You know how lax security is over there. And I snuck back in after the meeting to see if they had left any strategy memos around.<br>

VPOTUS: Had they?<br>

SLOTUS: Hard to tell. Those Clinton people are so messy. Too bad I was dressed as a maid. I had to spend an hour cleaning up after them. Just as I was about to leave, Bill stuck his head into the room. He said ``Tipper?'' I just about died!<br>

VPOTUS: Oh no! What did you do?<br>

SLOTUS: I froze. Then I heard her voice from the hallway. ``Tip her?'' she said. ``Why should we tip any of them?'' And he nodded and shuffled off. Thank God those people are so rough on the help.<br>

VPOTUS: I'm coming home, Tipper. You're getting into too much trouble.<br>

SLOTUS: Then I better get out our power-walking shoes. [Static.] [END INTERCEPT]

It crept across the country with July Fourth's summer dawn -- the stunning realization that the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> editorial page had yet again flinched from repeating its once-traditional annual call for a constitutional amendment proclaiming ``There Shall Be Open Borders.'' Indeed, there was no triumphalist immigration editorial at all. Mothers hushed crying children. Fathers gathered in grim groups under the bunting-bedecked pictures of Julian Simon crossing the Delaware and Emma Lazarus producing the Declaration of Independence from an Ellis Island steamer trunk. Everyone had accepted that the Journal edit page had to duck in 1994, in the (vain) hope of lulling Californians into not voting for Proposition 187's ban on welfare for illegal immigrants. And in 1995, of course, the edit page had to give priority to its (successful) disinformation campaign against the Smith - Simpson immigration-reform bills. But 1996? Were the <I>Journal</I> edit pagers demoralized by the devastating Rand Corporation report confirming that many recent immigrants are indeed failing in the economy? Humiliated at being singled out by Peter Passell, in his judicious column on the Rand report in the <I>New York Times</I>, because of their embarrassing hostility to evidence? Say it ain't so, Bob Bartley!

When Katie Couric asked Bob Dole if he thought C. Everett Koop had been ``brainwashed'' by the liberal media, he replied, ``Probably a little bit.'' Talk of brainwashing has no place in American politics, Mr. Dole. As Daniel Patrick Moynihan once remarked, a light rinse would have done the trick.

The Census Bureau is debating whether to create a new racial category for the 2000 census -- ``multiracial.'' A recent government phone survey suggested that 1.6 per cent of Americans identify themselves in that way. Racial intermixing is actually much more widespread; up to three-quarters of black Americans have at least one white or Indian ancestor. (Jesse Jackson, for instance, has some of each.) What effect would a new category have? To the extent that it broke down the rigid black - white color lines of slavery, Jim Crow, and affirmative action, it would be a good thing. But if it added another preferred class of citizens (like ``Hispanic'' class, created by the Bureau several censuses back), then it would be one more step to Bosnia, from sea to shining sea. Here's a question: How many federal policy-makers identify themselves as ``Americans''?

<I>Independence Day</I> is, as anyone who has been on this planet knows, a rip-roaring tale of alien invasion. More surprisingly, it is also a showcase for belief in ``Area 51,'' a top-secret base in Nevada where some think (yes they do) that the government carries out experiments on downed UFOs. <I>Independence Day</I> is science fiction, so perhaps this is to be expected. <I>The Rock</I>, however, is not science fiction; it is an action movie dominated by heavily armed men fighting for control of Alcatraz. Yet even this film reveals that a flying saucer really did crash near Roswell, New Mexico. What next? Alien ``greys'' near the grassy knoll? E.T., phone Stone.

At presstime passage of a minimum-wage increase looks like a done deal, while the prospects for health-insurance regulation are in doubt. And that is all that's on the agenda of this Republican Congress: destroying low-wage jobs and the individual insurance market. This situation is the natural consequence of GOP paralysis on economic policy. Rep. Bill Archer (R., Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently illustrated how even conservative Republicans have reverted to a pre-Reagan mode. Commenting on proposals for a 15 per cent across-the-board tax cut, he said, ``I don't know where you get those spending savings that can be approved'' in the House and Senate. In other words, we don't have the political will for spending cuts, and we won't be ``irresponsible'' and cut taxes without them. Republicans let their deficit obsession box them in, and superficially appealing but destructive proposals filled the vacuum. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and his colleagues must reassert control over the political agenda. Or else what's a majority for?

Meanwhile, anyone who enjoys a good culture clash really ought to have been present in London last week, when Pat Buchanan addressed a roomful of Tory Party luminaries, right-wing British journalists, and assorted plutocrats, together with a sprinkling of members of the leisured upper classes and Taki. The event was a black-tie dinner, given by Jimmy Goldsmith, the billionaire and fierce advocate of protectionism; the venue was Spencer House, the lush eighteenth-century London mansion once owned by the family of the Princess of Wales. After dinner, Buchanan gave more or less the same sort of speech he would give to a group of steelworkers in Michigan. In short, he impressed all those present with his energy, his command of statistics (the British do not bother with statistics) and ability to speak without notes (this is still a country which respects and admires extemporaneous speaking), and his condemnation of the European Union, an organization he (rightly) puts in the same category as the United Nations. Most of his listeners, however, found his economics perplexing, if not, in the words of one guest, ``insane.'' The British, and British Tories in particular, believe very deeply that they have historically been the beneficiaries of free-trade policies. No upstart American was going to change their minds in one evening. But a good time was had by all, and Buchanan certainly made the best joke. He would not make any comments about President Clinton, he said: it is customary for American politicians not to insult the President while abroad -- and certainly not while he's on active military duty.

The expose by retired FBI agent Gary Aldrich has prompted much self-flagellating introspection by media elites who regret the attention they've given a book whose most explosive charge is wholly unsubstantiated. The allegation that Bill Clinton sneaks over to the Marriott for illicit liaisons is apparently a rumor passed to Aldrich by conservative author David Brock, who is shocked, <I>shocked</I>, that it was reported as fact in <I>Unlimited Access</I>. Of course, the media haven't been so squeamish about second-hand sources in the past. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center reminds us that the media widely reported George Bush's alleged affair and similarly unsubstantiated charges by Kitty Kelley, and Anita Hill easily met the media's reliability test. Aldrich's book suffers from the animus he clearly feels toward Clinton staffers whom he views as uncouth and disrespectful. He can be forgiven for disliking disagreeable people, but his outrage over the irresponsible behavior of the ``Arkansas mafia'' in the White House gets the better of his novice editorial judgment. Regrettably, his credible first-hand accounts of the Clintonites' disregard for national security has been lost in the media barrage against his unreliable sources. To discredit the book, the Administration has called it a right-wing conspiracy led by the Dole campaign. But the notion of Dole conspiring with right-wingers is far more fantastic than the notion of the President slipping out to a hotel.

Twenty-five years after the birth of the party, Browne believes that the ``American people are fed up with this wasteful, extravagant government''; hopes that Libertarians can overcome the ``hurdle of irrelevancy'' to offer a realistic alternative at the voting booth. Browne wants to abolish the IRS and replace the federal income tax with nothing; end Social Security, welfare, and any federal role in education or law enforcement; and ``pardon all non-violent'' drug offenders on his first day in office. Abortion and gay marriage, which Browne says are ``none of my business,'' would be unrestricted under a Libertarian Administration (think of it as the Clinton White House, only more so).  After ``clean[ing] up the mess,'' President Browne would go back home and enjoy life.

Bill Clinton can't afford to veto illegal-immigration controls in an election year. Bob Dole has based his California campaign on the GOP's tough stand on illegal immigration. So, where is the bill that both houses of Congress passed and sent to conference two months ago? The House leadership has put off announcing conferees while Republicans try to reach agreement -- but that may not come. Republican Sens. Arlen Specter (Pa.) and Orrin Hatch (Utah) believe that Washington <I>should</I> require the states to educate illegal aliens, that taxpayers <I>should</I> pay for welfare services for immigrants, and that the asylum system <I>should</I> continue to function as a back door for illegal immigration. If Dole is not serious enough about the issue to convince Specter and Hatch that his chances in California depend on it, then Clinton can carry the state without raising a sweat. The parties will blame each other for killing reform, but the real losers will be the American -- the legally American -- people.

More on black churches (see ``The Week,'' July 15). They say that black churches are being burned by racists. ``They,'' notes Michael Fumento in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, turn out to be one main source, the ultra-liberal Center for Democratic Renewal. (CDR's chairman, the Rev. C. T. Varian, avers as how ``There's only a slippery slope between conservative religious persons and those who are doing the burning.'') Meanwhile, statistics show the alleged epidemic to be an anomaly, the result of more states collecting data on church arsons. Among states that have compiled this information, says Fumento, the number of black-church burnings in 1994 (11) was actually lower than in 1990 (13). The number in 1991 (16) was the same as in 1995. Church burnings are up this year -- at white and black churches alike -- according to an Associated Press review. Black suspects were fingered in 9 of the 73 black-church arsons recorded over the past 18 months. Drunken teenagers and burglars are implicated in most of the others; in only 12 cases was racism a clear motivation. ``Let's stipulate that burning a church is evil,'' columnist James Glassman (who pioneered this skeptical coverage) wrote, adding: ``But we should also remember that this is an election year. And a fire makes an excellent political smokescreen.'' Amen.

Turkey's political crisis, festering since the parliamentary elections of last December, has produced an ominous result. Islamist Welfare Party leader Necmettin Erbakan is now prime minister, in a coalition with Tansu Ciller's secular True Path party, Mrs. Ciller's blood feud with a rival secular conservative party having guaranteed that the secular forces would not unite. Mrs. Ciller is deputy premier and foreign minister, and her party holds the national-security portfolios. Therefore, the link with the U.S. through NATO and the recent military-cooperation agreement with Israel theoretically remain intact, despite Mr. Erbakan's open hostility to both. Turkey is a strategically pivotal country, which has lately been playing a more active, moderating role in the Middle East and among the Turkic peoples of the former Soviet Union. Its internal crisis stems from the weakness of the secular parties (and from the political elite's cavalier treatment of the people's Islamic faith in the past). We can hope Mrs. Ciller's gamble pays off and that political Islamism will be successfully co-opted and tamed by power. But there is a risk -- and a serious one. Turkey's foreign policy, and crucial Western strategic interests, hang in the balance.

Mr. Clinton celebrated the Fourth of July with a glorious photo-op: the release of a three-year-old female bald eagle named, a bit too conveniently, Freedom. (The bird had been injured and was being returned to the wild after treatment.) Fly away, Freedom, fly! Soar high and free!! Away, away flew Freedom, higher, higher, and out of camera range, where she was attacked and downed by ospreys. Rescuers found the poor creature wounded anew and floundering around in a river, and took her back to the hospital.

<FONT SIZE=+3>J</FONT><font size=+1>AMES</font> Baker managed George Bush's campaign for the Senate in 1970 -- and lost. He managed Gerald Ford's campaign for President in 1976 -- and lost. He himself ran for attorney general of Texas in 1978 -- and lost. In 1980 he managed Bush's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination -- and lost. In 1988 he managed Bush's general-election campaign and won -- on the coattails of Ronald Reagan. Finally, he headed Bush's 1992 re-election campaign and saw his candidate garner the lowest percentage of the popular vote of any incumbent President since 1912. Baker, in short, is a political loser, adept chiefly at media leaks that help keep the hot air in his crazily overinflated reputation. He is also a legitimate candidate to be Bob Dole's running-mate.
<P>
To be sure, the odds are against Baker, who made his way into the vice-presidential sweepstakes via Bob Woodward's <I>The Choice</I>. But he is a plausible contender because he meets what will be Dole's two chief criteria for a running-mate, as related to Woodward. The first is that the VP nominee be a ``10,'' a figure accorded universal respect (from the media) and already prepared to step into the Presidency. (Dole rates himself as having been only a 7 as a candidate in 1976.) The other criterion is Dole's own comfort with the running-mate, suggesting a pick who is temperamentally moderate, an experienced Washington hand, and personally on good terms with Dole. Baker passes both tests.
<P> 
Less likely to fare well under the Dole tests are the candidates who would energize the party's conservative base. The two conservatives with national prominence, Jack Kemp and Bill Bennett, both badly fail the second Dole test, especially Kemp, who trampled all over Dole's cherished virtue of loyalty with his Keystone Kop endorsement of Steve Forbes earlier this year (Kemp couldn't even manage to stay loyal to Forbes). A long-shot favorite of conservative insiders, California Attorney General Dan Lungren, probably fails the instant-credibility test (see sidebar, next page, for more conservative possibilities). Dole's running-mate is likely to have a strong flavor of Dole, meaning the odds are he will reinforce the ticket's ideological timidity and grey personality rather than dispel it.
<P>
<B>The Governors:</B> Early vice-presidential speculation centered on governors, especially the gaggle of popular GOP governors in the Midwest. Now second-year Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge has become the hot prospect. From a working-class background, he attended Harvard on a scholarship and served with distinction in Vietnam. He's young (50), attractive, Catholic, and from a populous state; he proved -- first as a congressman in the Democratic 21st District, then in his 1994 gubernatorial election -- that he has cross-over appeal for conservative Democrats. His most glaring drawback is on abortion. Ridge is one of the Republican governors who oppose the GOP platform's pro-life plank. While he now supports Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act, in 1993 he flirted with the Freedom of Choice Act, which would have barred Pennsylvania's package of restrictions. His nomination as the GOP gubernatorial candidate in 1994 prompted a run by a third-party pro-life candidate, who took a respectable 13 per cent of the vote.
<P>
As a congressman, Ridge was a regular moderate defector, part of the Northeastern tail that wagged the dog of the Republican conference. He was as likely to vote against Reagan and Bush as for them. As governor, he has leaned more to the right, making crime a top priority (he has signed death warrants the way a movie star signs autographs) and cutting business taxes. He undertook a major push last year to pass a far-reaching school-choice plan, which was defeated in the legislature twice (even though Ridge broke a campaign promise and signed a hefty legislative pay raise, a move widely interpreted as a way to help smooth the plan's passage). In his short tenure as governor Ridge has yet to leave much of an impression on the state's voters; his approval rating had slipped from the mid 60s last September to the mid 40s this April.
<P>
The governor Ridge supplanted in the Veepstakes is Michigan's John Engler. The 47-year-old solidly pro-life Catholic recently said his moment had passed for vice-presidential consideration. His failure to pass a military physical for Vietnam or to quickly explain the circumstances has hurt. But leaving aside the draft problem -- and the dumpy Engler's glaring charisma gap -- the Michigan governor is a formidable political figure: he has been a moving force behind the GOP's remarkable rise in his industrial, union-intensive state; he eliminated a $1.8-billion budget shortfall entirely with spending cuts his first year in office; he has been at the forefront of welfare reform (even if his successes have been oversold); and he has cut taxes repeatedly in the course of creating a business climate that has the state's unemployment rate lower than the national average for the first time in 16 years.
<P>
If Engler deserves another look, the Midwestern governor who doesn't is Ohio's George Voinovich, another pro-life Catholic from a large state. After taking office in 1992 Voinovich raised taxes by nearly $1 billion over two years. When, two years ago, voters repealed the 1992 tax on soda by initiative, he immediately suggested it might be best to re-impose it. He expressed dismay that Dole would seek to repeal Clinton's gas tax and recently opposed an effort to give some of Ohio's ballooning $1-billion budget surplus back to taxpayers until forced to by the legislature. While Voinovich nurtures an image of personal frugality, he has yet to extend his fiscal discipline to state government; spending is increasing at a clip roughly twice the rate of inflation. Choosing Voinovich would make sense only if Dole's idea of balancing the ticket is a VP whose instincts on taxes and spending are even worse than his own.
<P>
<B>The Senators:</B> Bob Dole's political nest, the U.S. Senate, is a likely breeding ground for Dole-amenable politicians. A leading contender is Arizona's pro-life and generally conservative John McCain. He would be Dole's Al Gore, a VP pick who would reinforce the nominee's strengths -- war hero, foreign-policy experience, a sense of ``adultness.''  But McCain's personal strengths are related to his weaknesses, as his perseverance often shades into stubbornness. Dealing with him was a constant frustration for the Gramm campaign, which had to pull him from the campaign trail at least twice (he broke with Gramm on Bosnia and recognition of Vietnam). McCain's advocacy of campaign-finance reform earlier this year was a classic demonstration of bull-headedness in the service of wrong-headedness, as he forced fellow Republicans to take up his baldly unconstitutional bill. To avoid having to stroke prickly personalities like McCain is one of the reasons Dole left the Senate for the campaign trail.
<P>
Besides McCain, the Senate offers a variety of other middling-to-long-shot picks:
<P>
-Connie Mack, the second-term senator from Florida, is a darling of supply-siders and acceptable to social conservatives. Tall, Catholic, easy-going, he is one of the emerging conservatives best prepared for prime time. Problems: Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles would appoint a replacement, and Mack is not particularly close to Dole.
<P> 
-Missouri's John Ashcroft, a former governor, has emerged as one of the more activist freshman senators, with a series of substantive and imaginative welfare and tax reform proposals. He's a favorite of social conservatives. But Dole -- in any case unlikely to turn to a freshman -- probably still smarts over a tiff with Ashcroft over term limits last year.
<P>
-Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar, who won votes only from the media during this year's presidential primaries, passes Dole's credibility test. But he didn't impress anyone else by scrambling to fill the vacuum in the race left by Arlen Specter. His campaign style, meanwhile, seems to have been borrowed from  <I>Weekend at Bernie's</I>; his selection would mean a ticket of Dole and duller. 
<P>
-Some insiders call Oklahoma Sen. Don Nickles Dole's adopted son. Nickles is a Catholic with something of an evangelical air. The religious and fiscal Right both love him, and so does Dole (a rare confluence). Nickles was an early Dole backer in 1988 and Dole hoped he would be his replacement as Senate Majority Leader. He is a plausible dark horse.
<P>
<B>The Establishment</B>: Another pool of talent comes from the Washington GOP establishment, the former Administration officials and office-holders who make it their business to be 10s. Topping the list is Colin Powell, although he has ruled himself out so many times even the Dole camp seems to be giving up hope. Powell has the odd distinction of being the favorite GOP candidate of both Dole and U.S. Taxpayer Party founder Howard Phillips, who calculates a Powell pick would push into his arms a plausible third-party candidate like Pat Buchanan. At the very least Powell's selection would ensure a messy, politically damaging GOP convention.
<P>
The most attractive of the establishment contenders is Dick Cheney, who tends to be discounted because of his 1988 heart surgery (some joke that Cheney must be the favorite candidate of Speaker Newt Gingrich, third in the line of presidential succession). But Cheney had no health problems as defense secretary. He has credibility with the national media and with conservatives (who also love his wife, Lynne, former head of the National Endowment for the Humanities). His personality is reassuring, if sometimes Lugarishly dull. His brief exploratory run for the Presidency last year was notable only for its lack of ideas or energy. His tenure as defense secretary was in character too; post - Cold War defense policy on his watch was safe and reasoned, if unimaginative. Cheney's inclinations are those of a conservative who also once was President Ford's chief of staff.
<P>
A more dynamic establishment possibility is Carroll Campbell, the former two-term governor of South Carolina. Dole owes Campbell for his South Carolina primary victory. Campbell left office with an approval rating in the 70s, after pursuing a Lamar Alexander - like agenda of economic development (spurred by a variety of tax incentives) and government reform; the size of government, meanwhile, went untouched. Campbell has the vivacity of a New South politician, but also the vague sense of untrustworthiness of one. He has strained relations with the South Carolina Christian Right, which correctly senses he is not one of them and also bridles under a variety of slights -- perceived or real -- from Campbell's years of brokering its rise to power in the party. (The pro-life Campbell was almost denied a slot as a convention delegate this year.) His current million-dollar-a-year job would disqualify him as a running-mate for some candidates, but probably not Dole, who if he were offended by Washington operators would have to jettison most of his entourage.
<P>
The ultimate in operators is James Baker. The former Secretary of State has no constituency -- except the national media. ``Baker makes it onto short lists because he's a master at leaking,'' observes <I>Human Events</I> editor John Gizzi. Reaganites hate him for his self-serving stroking of the media and the way he manipulated his way through staff infighting. His only ideology is power. He claims to be pro-life, but on <I>Meet the Press</I> in 1994 he equivocated: ``even though I ran on a right-to-life-amendment platform [in Texas] I find it a little difficult to understand, as a conservative, the government taking that kind of an activist approach in personal lives.'' Editorial boards would swoon over a Baker pick, but Dole surely has observed Baker enough to know loyalty isn't in his vocabulary. If Dole selected Baker and his poll numbers continued to sag, by mid September Baker would quietly be telling reporters it really wasn't his decision to join the ticket.
<P>
The Dole campaign is keeping vice-presidential deliberations close to its chest, with long-time Dole friend Bob Ellsworth handling the selection process. There are a range of dark horses who could still emerge: Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, yet another pro-life, Catholic, Midwestern governor; the young and energetic deficit hawk, House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich; Dole Republican par excellence Donald Rumsfeld, the former Illinois congressman tapped by the Dole campaign to handle policy. But chances are Dole won't stray too far afield. When Ellsworth floated Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn, it was an ``outside-the-box'' name that was as inside-the-box as you can get: a Senate insider, a mushy moderate, a political bore. Dole's talk of picking a pro-choicer, meanwhile, is probably meant only to establish his independence for the media (see below for more on Christine Todd Whitman et al.). The first dictum of vice-presidential selection, they say, is, Do no harm. Dole is likely to follow it in his own way, and pick someone who will do no harm he isn't already capable of himself.
