<P>
<BR>
Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't.<BR>
-- Shakespeare, _Hamlet_<BR>
<BR>
<P>I've written a great deal about information warfare and the application of
technology to areas of pursuit such as guerrilla warfare and terrorism. What
about the other side of the coin? Can a defense be mounted? Certainly.</P>

First, a few constraints:<BR>
<BR>
No Reduction of Civil Liberties<BR>
<P>Why must security seemingly be purchased at the cost of the liberties that make
life worth living? What have prior purchases of 'security' bought us? Are we
truly safer, more secure? Have crime, terror, and war gone the way of the
dinosaur? Of course not. Therefore I will not posit nor endorse any further
reduction of civil liberties; I will even endeavor to strengthen a few.</P>
No Empty Gestures<BR>
<P>The only interpretation one can give to anti- or counter-terror measures, other
than the cynical portrayal of politicians as hidden fascists, is where
politicians are being political--fond of empty gestures. Like chrome on a car,
they serve no purpose; not being a politician, I will pass on the option of
doing something to 'look good' or, Soviet-like, justifying my existence by
taking action, any action, regardless of applicability or utility, not to
mention consequence.

<P>My approach is to propose the initiation of a number of measures and projects to
establish a defense-in-depth approach. Strategic elements fall in the domains of
technology; social policy and initiatives; and military, intelligence, and law
enforcement work. As the name of this article states, these are the first steps;
the threat is developing, and so must the defense. This is like the recognition
of the tank or helicopter on the battlefield; speculation and experimentation at
first, evolving into important, potent tools later--and always playing with
measures/countermeasures along the way.</P>


Technological Steps<BR>
<BR>
Engineering Rigor<BR>
<P>Engineering is about trying and failing--then learning from mistakes and trying
again. And again, and so on. Sometimes, in the process of those mistakes, people
die--bridges and buildings collapse, airplanes fall out of the sky, ships sink.
Sometimes the fear of people dying complicates the engineering process to the
point where the process becomes almost unworkable--such as in pharmaceutical
development. Sometimes the conditions engineered for change, or we learn things
that change how we view the problem--like with chemicals, or radiation.

<P>In some fields of technology, there isn't a whole lot of engineering rigor going
around these days. Look at the trouble expected from the switch of the calendar
year to 2000 and you'll see a simple example. You don't know what you don't
know, you don't know and can't adequately plan for the future, and nothing gets
used as it was intended. Technology is hard enough to get working as it is--it
doesn't happen on its own, and if it isn't explicitly built in the hardware or
software, it can't do it. But this should be understood before the
responsibility for large, critical portions of the political economy is passed
over to the machines. This means changes in education of engineers to change the
engineering process--research, development, testing, evaluation, utilization,
consequences.</P>

Safe Fail Designs<BR>
<P>From the design phase on out, failure of systems (or subsystems, or remote
systems, or users) should be expected. Not if, when. While not every particular
real world failure can be predicted in advance (nice to know that some element
of human behavior is forever beyond prediction), certainly more effort can be
undertaken. Outside labs such as 'Underwriter Labs' test products, but by then
it is already too late, and they don't test much of what society depends upon
daily. Safe fail designs need to be devolved down into every development
project. This means computer, software, networks; it means all those complex
systems they are part of, and all the systems those systems interact with. And
that's just the start.</P>

Forcing Factors<BR>
<P>Forcing factors are design elements that require proper, defined usage for a
system to work. You can't successfully drive a vehicle unless you are in the
right seat for it--this is a physical forcing factor. Security systems use
forcing factors--they require a confrontation before access is allowed (usually
authentication--keys, passwords, token). Forcing factors can be cheap and
effective when built in rather than added later (automotive alarm systems, for
instance). Much of what passes for security has no forcing factors--sleepy
security guards, or locked doors and open windows. Some forcing factors
mis-assess the threat, like protecting a nuclear power reactor from protesters
or takeovers, but leaving critical systems (like cooling circulation systems)
exposed to destruction without having to confront any security measures.

<P>Forcing factors are essential to good secure system design; defense in depth
strategies layer forcing factors to cover each layer's weaknesses and maintain
overall system integrity. Social systems at risk rarely have forcing factors;
there is a trade-off of freedom versus restrictions, but again, such factors are
designed to meet threats, which free, responsible behavior is not.</P>

Hardware/Software Designed for Threat<BR>
<P>This is obviously easier said than done. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)
has had long running projects to design and implement secure computing
technology with minimal success--the technology keeps advancing in front of
them. Even as a branch of the government, NSA hasn't had the resources to keep
pace; I personally believe this is why every so often they try to hit the breaks
and slow the juggernaut (see NSA and civilian cryptographic usage policy for an
example). Obviously silly, the approach hasn't a prayer of succeeding, which is
just as well--since it is exactly the wrong strategy.

<P>Some parts of the NSA's approach to security are sound; for instance, the
Rainbow Series advocates going back to the design phase when security flaws are
found. Don't patch the hole, cure the logical design concept that led to it.
Integrity is like a balloon, no matter how good the rubber, the air still leaks
out the hole. This doesn't mean throwing out the unsecured systems we have
now--in fact, a lot of good could be accomplished with a major effort to close
the existing holes in design and implementation (yes, patches). Society needs to
keep functioning while improvements are made, and computers are now essential.
But it means an effort must be started at every major hardware and software
developer, no more pitiful efforts by amateurs. So follows the next point.</P>

Strong Cryptography<BR>
<P>Put good, strong, fast cryptography where it is needed--in every computer, on
the motherboard. No key escrow--that just leaves the key management body as
judge, jury, and executioner, not to mention a sitting target; no weakened keys,
that makes cryptography value subtracted--it takes time, but provides no
protection. Crypto such as DES or RSA should be readily available to everyone
with a computer; while we're at it, who knows that there isn't something even
better at the NSA? Open the technology up--get out the strong crypto, security,
authentication, etc. Ship the scientists out from Fort Meade to computer
hardware and software developers, or ship the engineers to Fort Meade, or at
least publish what the market needs to know. Think of it as investing the Cold
War peace dividend to help strengthen the society to weather the next wars.
Moving the national network to a point-to-point session-to-session capability
would be, as they say, a startling development.</P>

Hardened Computers<BR>
<P>I don't believe in computer security--I've had too much luck playing the other
side of the field. I don't believe in secure systems, that NSA Orange Book
Platonic Ideal. Go ahead and isolate the computer behind a locked door with no
network connection; you still use an operating system and applications, and
those (and the tools they are built with) aren't built on isolated systems.

<P>I believe in cryptography and communications, and oddly enough, those can be
solutions that work better than obscure technological attempts to prevent data
from doing what it does best--move. That's why crypto is great--let the data
move, but reader makes right. If you haven't got the key in a strong crypto
world, you better get used to the noise.</P>

<P>The impact of crypto on security can be profound--call it cryptosecurity as an
approach:</P>

Data Security<BR>
<P>If data is stored or on the move, only you or the intended party/parties can
make sense out of it; whether your recipe for soup or your credit information,
your privacy is yours.</P>

Anti-viral<BR>
<P>Software systems can catch the signature of the known virus, but not the
unknown--the first sign of trouble can already be too late. Cryptosecurity stops
viruses by stopping infection or execution. On boot, the operating system can be
confirmed with cryptographic checksums (for instance, DES's Message
Authentication Codes, or MACs for short) prior to execution, as can all
applications; if the MACs don't match those of a 'clean' MAC'ed application, you
don't execute the application. If all stored applications and data is encrypted,
and extra layer of protection is present--decrypting the application or datafile
actually turns the virus into unexecutable noise (since it appended itself into
an encrypted file). The system is necessarily more complex than this (for
instance, maintaining memory maps and referencing against MAC'ed file loads
prior to privileged functions to prevent datafile virus execution, etc.), but
prototyping has shown the process to work effectively.</P>

Anti-malice (virus, hacker)<BR>
<P>The hardware needs to trap calls to specified functions (delete, formatting,
etc.) and require a token (a password provided to the hard subsystem, or a
physical key turned) prior to approval.</P>

Miscellaneous Safety Functions<BR>
<P>Saves aren't overwrites, but are layered for transaction rollback and
checkpointing--copious storage makes this cost effective in most cases; dense
sites should use WORM drives; backing storage up and frequent checkpointing are
necessary actions; redundant systems are essential in critical systems.</P>

Heterogeneous Systems/Networks<BR>
<P>Biodiversity makes for resilient ecosystems, and technodiversity makes for a
resilient infosphere; wide-spread standards make standard attacks that much more
leveraged, and dangerous.

<P>[The specifics on cryptosecurity require significant ongoing research and
development by skilled scientists and engineers, but are encouraging areas to
explore.]</P>


Social Steps<BR>
<BR>
Community Education<BR>
<P>Threats and countermeasures need to be explained to all levels--engineers,
students, politicians, business leaders, etc. Disclosures (read 'evangelism') on
cryptography, security, information warfare, terrorism, etc. need to be made.
Such action would reduce the value of moral and material surprise that any
harmful operations against their domain may have. It also enlists the general
community in the cause, rather than leaving them as helpless casualties.</P>

Root Causes<BR>
<P>Opposition forces using tactics to effect social change--whether bombs or
bytes--are doing so for a reason. While there are certainly criminal or mentally
ill perpetrators, there are also those who are where they are for a reason. Odd
as it may seem, sometimes the only rational reaction to an irrational situation
is irrational action--or so it seems. Blanket criminalization (including the
truly moronic (and hypocritical) statements such as "We don't deal with
terrorists and criminal elements.") remove options for these players, and give
them no other recourse than to act as criminals (the Nostromo dilemma, see
Joseph Conrad's _Nostromo_: if you are labeled to your detriment, you may as
well act the way they expect you to). The triggers or causes for behavior should
be sought out and dealt with; who knows what possibilities it might create?</P>

Lock Personal Data<BR>
<P>You own your data--too much harm can occur to you if your data (credit, medical,
legal, etc.) end up in the wrong hands. Nobody should be able to view your data
without your permission; this process will become much easier when strong crypto
and authentication are more prevalent, but even then, it shouldn't be easy.</P>

Honest Media Relationships<BR>
<P>The voice to the people needs to be put to good use; first though, trust needs
to be reestablished. All the players in this game--government, free market,
media--need to stop scare tactics, spin control, hidden agendas, mythmaking, and
personal aggrandizement. The issues are confused enough without making fuel for
every 'Oliver Stone'-esque conspiracy theorist's fire.</P>

<BR>
Military, Intelligence, Law Enforcement<BR>
<BR>
Jurisdiction<BR>
<P>The jurisdictional muddle needs to be cleaned up; how to resolve it will be a
troublesome issue, however. Law enforcement like the FBI see the actors as
criminals, which colors their perceptions and actions more than a little.
Intelligence has a more balanced view of the world, but has a "water's edge"
difficulty, as well as the difficulty of giving clearances to people they may
rather not wish to. The military mindset led to troubles such as we have now
with the NSA, where the priorities are antithetical to solving the problems. The
free market doesn't have the powers, budget, or access to tackle the problem on
its own. The solution is likely some sort of new agency composed of all the
mentioned elements, although the anarchist in me screams against the creation of
yet another body.</P>

Recruit Inside the Community<BR>
<P>The paradigm mismatch between how government bodies and the free market (not to
mention the opposition forces) view the issues is crippling. These organizations
need to get 'local guides' who know the language, customs, and terrain. Such
domain expertise would help them to stop making fools of themselves, not to
mention starting to address the problems. It also provides a necessary positive
element of value to the community, one of the reasons why individuals are drawn
in the first place, a need to belong and be valued.</P>

HUMINT<BR>
The days of SIGINT strength are already fading; computing power and knowledge
have given the tools to secure themselves to opposition forces that want/need
them. HUMINT sources need to be developed--you learn intent, capabilities,
plans, etc. in advance and possibly on an interactive basis. Of course it's hard
to develop HUMINT sources, but that doesn't mean you don't do it anyway.</P>

Tradecraft<BR>
<P>Opposition forces have their tradecraft, but so does intelligence and law
enforcement--shoeleather research, manpower, resources. Certain elements of the
opposition forces' tradecraft are susceptible; for instance, all
senders/receivers of remailer traffic can be studied and mapped, as well as all
traffic flow in the remailer net. It doesn't violate any civil liberties; in
fact, it is almost an expectation (read the remailer threat assessment some
time). Strengths need to be challenged, and weaknesses need to be forced to
failure. This means following the traffic, following the money, etc.</P>

Rapid Response Team<BR>
<P>Since the timing is a matter of when, not if, a response should be prepared.
Threats should be modeled, games played, tools built, measures planned--try to
prevent fires, but still have a fire department. Team members should be domain
experts in related fields, but cross-disciplinary enough to handle a widely
divergent set of crises.</P>

Propaganda Countering Team<BR>
<P>PsyOps is a critical component of potential future conflicts, and measures need
to be taken to cope with attacks and the aftermath. Nothing cuts through like
the truth, but the team needs to establish trust and earn the reputation capital
in advance to be able to spend it when the crisis hits.</P>


Conclusions<BR>
<P>This is, I hope, a living list; measures will be thought up and initiated, and
the feedback loop between opponents will become faster, denser, and more intense
as the years go by.

<P>But--you have to start somewhere, you have to start something, and you have to
start sometime. Why not here, now, and with these?

<P>"In battle there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and
indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of
maneuvers. The direct and indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like
moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities
of their combination?" -- Sun Tzu

<P>Society, a political economy, is about a mechanism I will refer to as the
'value
chain.' A value chain is an aggregate infrastructure of processes, best
explained by example.

<P>One instance of a value chain comes from Mankind's early days--metal. Based on
what ores are readily available in an area, Man has built a variety of
implements, starting with rough-hewn rock or wood, moving via the process of
discovery and learning to more complex substances--iron, bronze, steel. Years
and centuries pass, and the materials, knowledge, and processes that started
turning out plowshares now turn out automobiles, airplanes, bridges,
skyscrapers. Each step in the process, each advance made, adds just a little
more value to the output of the previous step, building vastly more complex
systems from the interactions of numerous smaller ones.

<P>Politics is about the ownership and control of the value chain. Western
democracies, founded on such contracts as the Declaration of Independence and
the Constitution, are based on principles that every individual owns themselves
and the fruits of their labour, that they are each entitled to an equal
opportunity to be responsible for themselves. Western governments are the
tools,
the value chain the citizens created to gain an economy of scale--to do those
things collectively that are best done so. Among such things is the
provision of
a common defense, in short, war.

<P>War is a challenge to or from the value chain. Just as the discovery of steel
heralded a new wave of conquests against those less developed, war is the
competition of value chains. Whether fought with Toledo steel swords, or
composite-armour tanks, conventional and unconventional warfare are about
attacks on various stages of the material value chain, by methods best
suited to
the attack on each link. This is 'hardwar'--an obsessive emphasis on the real
control of real things, in methods, means, and end objectives.

<P>This approach loses sight of the fact that the material value chain is not the
only value chain, and I would venture to say, not the most important one. Value
chains stretch back to the beginnings of civilization, by definition in fact.
Behaviour is purposeful, directed, and a driving force is needed, a motivation.
Maslow worked out a hierarchy of needs that do much to explain the beginnings
and evolution of political economies.</P>

Maslow's Hierarchy of Need looks like this:<BR>

<LI>-- Physiological needs--survival, food, drink, health;
<LI>-- Safety needs, physical and emotional needs--clothing, shelter, protection;
<LI>-- Affection needs--family, belonging;
<LI>-- Esteem needs--self-respect, achievement, appreciation;
<LI>-- Self-fulfillment--realization and utilization of one's potential.

<P>Man's Agrarian phase of development, and that shadowy period before, were
focused on an almost purely material value chain, because just staying alive,
reproduction and metabolism, took all of an individual's time and energy. Even
here, however, the roots of another value chain are visible, something I will
refer to as the informational value chain, a misnomer as I will point out
shortly, but a necessary one for convenience of expression and understanding.

<P>The process of survival was driving the beginnings of discovery, creating
language so that such discoveries could be passed on, and education so that
they
could be made aggregate. Man was learning many things--how to build shelters,
when to plant crops, how to mine ores and smelt metals, what plants are edible,
the making of weapons, and the strategies and tactics of using them. Necessity
is a Mother.

<P>A mixed material-informational value chain existed in the Industrial period, as
man had learned how to take his simple tools to make more complex tools, using
them to add more and more 'value,' levels of complexity. This complexity forced
specialization, and herein lay the foundations of the modern dedicated
informational value chain. Obviously, this bifurcation of material and
informational value chains is unnatural--in many ways, from our distant
perspective, the advances made along the material value chain are purely the
result of advances from the informational value chain.

<P>While the process of the material value chain is dependent on the materials it
relates to, the informational value chain has a much more (and at the same
time,
less) clear mechanism, which looks like this:<BR>
              Data --> Information --> Knowledge --> Wisdom,
where the arrows represent 'transforms or evolves into.' These stages merit
some explanation.

<P>Data becomes information through a process of filtering, an exclusion process.
In mathematics, this is set theory, where the concepts of 'belonging' and
representation open a can of worms. Think of it as finding the needle in the
haystack by removing anything that isn't a needle; more generally, the item or
items are filtered from the larger body of data. Gregory Bateson called
information 'any difference that makes a difference,' and he was quite correct.
There are number of 'Smith' or 'Johnson' entries in the (U.S.A.) phonebook, but
they aren't all necessarily the one you want to talk to.

<P>The next stage of the informational value chain is information being
transformed
into knowledge; we have no 'real' understanding of how this occurs in our
brains, but it has roots in our abilities to perform analysis, generalization,
abstraction, extrapolation, and utilization. These are all functions of the
decision-making process.

<P>The final stage is the evolution from knowledge to wisdom, a deeper
comprehension of the concepts, systems, relationships, interactions, and
integration.

<P>Oddly enough, explanation of the chain points out the problem with calling
it an
'informational value chain,' just as this is not really the 'Information
Age'--society at this stage is actually oriented around data, shuttling it from
one point to another, bumping against the constraints of throughput, bandwidth,
and interactivity. There is no large scale function, no part of the political
economy providing value-add in the process. The reason for this explosive
emphasis on data is obviously the computer, and all the things a computer makes
possible; the reason for there being no true value-add is that while computers
are very good at moving data around, and can even be used in a limited way to
filter data, the rest of the value chain is totally unaddressed by the advances
in technology (forays into artificial intelligence notwithstanding).

<P>Returning to the application of this thinking to the topic of warfare,
conventional warfare is concerned primarily with the material value chain.
Attrition-style warfare seeks direct control of the material basics--labour,
capital, and resource--while manoeuvre-style warfare focuses on control of the
'key points,' dependencies in the material value chain. Unconventional warfare
seeks to overload the material value chain by various methods, whether a
nuclear
weapon vaporizes large pieces of it, or guerrilla warfare undermines the chain
by an 'ontological judo,' using the dis-economies of scale in the value chain
against the value chain itself.

<P>For simplicities sake, but following the same line of reasoning, I define
information warfare, or 'softwar' as I think of it to avoid the misnomer, as
conflict based upon and/or directed at the informational value chain.

<P>Given the preoccupation of advanced political economies with the movement of
data from point-to-point, it is no surprise that most thinking about softwar
revolves around 'denial of service' (DOS) attacks shutting computers and
networks down. There are a number of problems with this--it is very much an
artifact of hardwar thinking bleeding over into softwar, it is unsubtle,
inelegant, it betrays a lack of understanding of the 'first principles' of
warfare, it looks more like a 'scorched earth' policy than any high strategy,
and most of all, it misses the forest by looking only at the trees.

<P>In hardwar, the most catastrophic attack that can be made is directed at the
very bottom of the value chain; this is why there is a perfectly rational fear
of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Softwar is completely
reversed--the farther into the value chain any attacks are made, the more
leveraged they are, the less 'force' required, just as with the differences
between attrition- and manoeuvre-style warfare. Clearly, a more detailed
explanation of the relationship between an informational value chain and
softwar
is called for.

<P>The existence of a deep informational value chain is, in many ways, the
defining
characteristic of an advanced civilization. This very existence is the first
element available in softwar--just as steel won out over iron, having
satellites
beats not having them, and electronic communication beats a horse-borne
messenger (figuratively).

<P>The next stepping-stone to softwar is intelligence, in the espionage sense of
the term; intel is largely a function of the collection of massive amounts of
data, and then filtering that deluge. As far back as the dawn of Man, intel was
a function of softwar, which comes as no surprise to anyone, least of all
people
such as Sun Tzu. Knowing its place in the value chain helps to explain many of
the dilemmas of the intelligence community:
<LI>-- The escalating need and dependence on electronic collection of data
countered
with the information overload disaster;
<LI>-- The inability to keep pace with the increasing load of dynamic data;
<LI>-- The problem of electronic intelligence (ELINT) missing subtleties of motive,
intent, and other nuance that human intelligence (HUMINT) used to provide;
<LI>-- The inherent flaw of the intelligence process remaining unbiased--the
transformation of data into information automatically calls in to play a
paradigm, interpretation, judgment, prioritization; this bias is amplified and
exaggerated in the process of augmentation.

<P>Softwar attacks on the civilian value chain infrastructure actually look more
like hardwar attacks. Denial of service (DOS) attacks can range across the
value
chain, effecting the contributory infrastructure and social contract the way
terrorism does. There are common elements, obvious from the assessment that the
current phase of social development is only that of a data-based
society--attacks will be on the electronic transport layer we think of as
communications, and the control mechanisms we generally rely on as the
'societal
glue.' An important note is that DOS attacks on civilian entities can't go
farther up the value chain because there is no chain there to target. Military
DOS attacks are focused on many of the same elements of command and control;
this leads to the conclusion that civilian attacks are likely only to be
collateral consequences from military objectives. The fear that such attacks
will occur is well justified--after all, the techniques used by guerrillas and
terrorists worldwide already map into this new domain. Whether they work is
another things altogether--much of the low end of the military informational
value chain is already hardened, a by-product of the nuclear age. Satellites
have always been assumed to be 'expendable,' and military command-and-control
has been a target in millennia of warfare--capture of a commander in a
hierarchical structure is more effective than trying to grind down troops, and
while a heterarchy would better withstand attacks, no certain blow could be
struck. This sort of softwar attack is survivable, correctable, and will cost a
great deal in damages, but much like Pearl Harbor in World War II, it is likely
to only infuriate the citizenry of the targeted political economy.

<P>More subtle methods of DOS attacks may be effective, however. Historically,
when
analysis and decision-making power were seated in the same person, these were
worthwhile targets; in modern times however, most politicians are totally
orthogonal to the informational value chain, providing no value add themselves.
The tools in place to provide such value add are, however, directly susceptible
to such attack, and in many cases aren't even protected.

<P>Assume for example that an Adversary planned a conflict and wanted to
impair the
decision-making abilities of a powerful, advanced ally of their target. Are
attacks on orbiting satellites that provide data on their region even possible,
let alone cost effective? Unlikely. A little leverage brought to bear, however,
can answer that problem. Imagine this chain of events:
<LI>-- A set of video cameras are placed so that they collect data, the license
plates of vehicles going into the 'hostile' intelligence agency;
<LI>-- Data is continually collected and processed;
<LI>-- The license plates are checked for in a variety of databases to provide the
name and any other data on the owner and likely driver;
<LI>-- The driver's credit and personal data is pulled, as well as any other
information that can be checked from the ever-growing number of databases;
<LI>-- Based on the data derived, a structural map of the organization is
developed,
founded on such things as salary levels, education level, specialty, et al;
<LI>-- Certain functions are targeted, such as analysis sections or skill bases,
such as knowledge of the Adversary's region or language;
<LI>-- Just prior to hostilities, such individuals are targeted for either
subversion or elimination.

<P>This sort of DOS attack is directly targeted at the deeper levels on the
informational value chain--those with knowledge or wisdom about the region and
Adversary. It has many benefits besides being cheap, direct, and leveraged; it
leaves the political players 'in the game,' but without any way to makes sense
of the overwhelming levels of data generated prior to or during a conflict.
Because of the common mechanism of reliance by the military on politicians to
set objectives, any coherent military response by the targeted country is also
hamstrung. It takes no great sophistication to carry out exactly this sort of
attack, but the impact, particularly the transformation of the political
structure into one of 'value subtracted,' is considerable. Recovery from
such an
attack is a matter of luck in making all the right choices in the time
period it
takes to rebuild the lost functionality, an unknown period, but far longer than
rebooting a computer and reinstalling software as after a DOS hardwar attack.

<P>A true softwar attack is one of covert perversion, best thought of in terms
of a
military adage--war is deception. People make decisions based on their
cognitive
environment, their infosphere; control of the data comprising such an
environment allows a certain amount of control over those in it. The
drawback of
course is that the better the information of the opponent about their
infosphere, the closer the deception must be to the reality provided by the
environment. Very much a situation of Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO), this sort
of attack is about the use of lies and mis/disinformation to produce very real
results. It can be very direct, and successful when so--surrendering when you
only think you are surrounded but aren't, inflatable tanks and airplane
skeletons to misdirect thinking regarding the time and place of an attack,
or an
impossible-to-implement missile defense system that leads a believing opponent
to spend itself into collapse. Such attacks will become more prevalent and
subtle when direct control of data channels is possible; the double-edged sword
of the media can be grasped more directly than was CNN by the West during the
Gulf War, and to much better effect, but care must be taken to avoid the
sapping
of will that occurred during the Viet Nam conflict.

<P>Viet Nam, besides teaching a host of lessons in conventional warfare, guerrilla
warfare, hardwar, and softwar, was also a masterful piece of the 'high end' of
softwar--'wetwar,' the battle for will and mindshare.

<P>Wetwar, derived from the concept of 'wetware,' the hardware/software of the
human mind, is war conducted entirely through subtle, mainly non-violent means,
to control the deepest end of the informational value chain--an insidious form
of propaganda directed at will, support, and perception of data. Viet Nam is a
case study of intentional and unintentional wetwar, with brainwashing,
confessions by POWs, media bias in the data --> information link, GIs televised
coming home in body bags, Hanoi Jane, winning yet losing the Tet offensive,
bombing campaigns that drove neutral civilians to join the alternative and
hostile infrastructure set up and controlled by the wily opponent, et al. This
form of warfare is the pinnacle of skill, where your opponent defeats himself,
and then writes you a bank draft and says he was sorry.

<P>Information warfare, whatever its form--hardwar, softwar, or wetwar--is simple
and complex, subtle and obvious, a product of an advanced civilization yet
oddly
echoed in ancient Sun Tzu, part of the past and a still-unrealized future. It
can no more be dismissed than any other form of war; not to prepare for it is
the act of a fool, yet it is difficult to prepare for. Focusing on one small
area, such as DOS attacks, leads to errors just as the idea of attrition
and air
superiority did in Viet Nam--control of one part of an infrastructure or value
chain is like trying to control a puppet with only one string. Understanding
information warfare is very much a search for an understanding of conflict and
progress, Aquinas' concept of a return to the first principles. You can go so
far down the path, only to find yourself back at the very beginning.

<P>


As information systems permeate our military and civilian lives, we are crossing a new frontier - the Information Age. it will define the 21 st century and influence all we do as an air force.  Information Warfare has become central to the way nations fight wars, and will be critical to Air Force operations in the 21 st century.  This means, of course, that today we must invest in our people, planning, equipment, and research so our ambitions can become reality.  We will involve every Air Force person in this effort, generating a wave of momentum that will carry us into the next millennium.


<P>
Information Warfare is not the exclusive domain of the Air Force, or any other service. information technology advances will make dramatic changes in how this nation fights wars in the future.  They will allow a commander's vision and view of the battlespace to be shared at the lowest level.  Because of this, every practitioner of the profession of arms has a responsibility to understand the impact of information warfare on their service.  From our unique perspectives as soldier, sailor, marine, or airman, we can then forge a common understanding of how to use information warfare to enhance joint warfighting capabilities.

<H2>CORNERSTONES OF INFORMATION WARFARE</H2>
<P>


The competition for information is as old as human conflict. it is virtually a defining characteristic of humanity.  Nations, corporations, and individuals each seek to increase and protect their own store of information while trying to limit and penetrate the adversary's.  Since around 1970, there have been extraordinary improvements in the technical means of collecting, storing, analyzing, and transmitting information.  Reams have been written about the impact of this technical revolution on the conduct of war, particularly since DESERT STORM.  However, most of the literature focuses primarily on technical developments, not on how these developments impact doctrine.

<P>

This paper will pose questions important to Air Force policy makers and provide answers firmly grounded on concise definitions, institutional experience, and doctrinal concepts.  In the process, it will clarify why the competition for information, which predates the dawn of history, is suddenly a riveting national security topic.  Closer to home, this paper will also describe how Air Force doctrine should evolve to accommodate information warfare.  The ultimate goal is a sound foundation on which to base the inevitable changes in organizing, training, equipping, and employing military forces and capabilities.

<P>



<H3>WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT INFORMATION NOW?</H3>

<P>

Because there is a technological revolution' sweeping through information systems and their integration into our daily lives leading to the term 'Information Age.' information-related technologies concentrate data, vastly increase the rate at which we process and transmit data, and intimately couple the results into virtually every aspect of our lives.  The Information Age is also transforming <B>all</B> military operations by providing commanders with information unprecedented in quantity and quality (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#2">2</A>).  The commander with the advantage in observing the battlespace, analyzing events, and distributing

information possesses a powerful, if not decisive, lever over the adversary.

<P>


Before continuing, we must distinguish between <I>information age warfare</I> and <I>information
warfare</I>.  We make this distinction because much of the literature treats information warfare and
advances in information technology synonymously.  Information age warfare uses information technology as
a tool to impart our combat operations with unprecedented economies of time and force (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#3">3</A>). Ultimately,
information age warfare will  affect all combat operations.  <B>In contrast, information warfare, the point of
this paper, views information itself as a separate realm, potent weapon, and lucrative target.</B>  Information,
as we will show below, is technology independent.  However, information age technology is turning a
theoretical possibility into fact: <I>directly</I> (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#4">4</A>) manipulating the adversary's information.  This is the driving
force behind this paper.

<P>



<H3>WHAT IS INFORMATION?</H3>
<P>

This question is elementary, but pivotal.  It is impossible to discuss information warfare meaningfully without rigorously defining the central concept: information. 

<P>

Information derives from phenomena.  Phenomena, observable facts or events, are <I>everything</I> that happens around us.  Phenomena must be perceived and interpreted to become information.  Information, then, is the result of two things: perceived phenomena (data) and the instructions required to interpret that data and give it meaning.

<P>

This distinction is important, and easily encompassed by a familiar paradox: If a tree falls, but no one was around to hear it, did it make a noise?  The falling tree caused pressure waves in the atmosphere, a phenomenon.  Noise, the information denoting a falling tree, occurs when someone's ear detects the pressure waves, creating data, and the brain's instructions manipulate that data into the sound recognizable as a falling tree.  Within that person's context, there is no falling tree until the person hears (or sees) it.

<P>

Phenomena become information through observation and analysis.  Therefore, information is an abstraction of phenomena.  Information is the result of our perceptions and interpretations, regardless of the means.  As falling trees make clear, to define information requires only two characteristics:


<P>










<B>Information:</B> <I>data and instructions</I>.

<P>

Note that the definition for information is absolutely distinct from technology.  However, what we can do with information, and how fast we can do it, is very dependent on technology.  Technology dramatically enhances our observational means, expands and concentrates data storage, and accelerates instruction processing.  We use the following term to encompass the technology-dependent elements associated with information:

<P>

<B>Information Function:</B> <I>any activity involving the acquisition, transmission, storage, or transformation of information.
</I>
<P>

For example, the system that tells a machine to stamp eighty hubcaps is performing an information function.  The sheet metal press stamping those hubcaps is not.

<P>



<H3>WHAT ARE SOME MILITARY INFORMATION FUNCTIONS?</H3>


<P>


Quality information is the counter to the fog of war.  As mentioned earlier, the commander with better information holds a powerful advantage over his adversary.  Military operations make special demands on information functions in seeking to give the commander an information advantage.
<P>


Surveillance and reconnaissance are our powers of observation.  Intelligence and weather analysis are the bases for orienting observations.  We use those bases to form an Air Tasking Order, which command and control operations execute and monitor in directing the conflict.  Precision navigation enhances mission performance.  Together, these are the kinds of military information functions that enhance all military operations.  Collectively, we use the term military information functions to describe force enhancing information functions.

<P>

<B>Military Information Function:</B> <I>any information function supporting and enhancing the employment of military forces.
</I>
<P>

This definition serves to delineate militarily important information functions from the total universe of information functions.





<P>



<H3>WHAT IS INFORMATION WARFARE?</H3>


<P>


At the grand strategy level, nations seek to acquire, exploit, and protect information in support of their
objectives.  This exploitation and protection can occur in the economic, political, or military arenas. 
Knowledge of the adversary's information is a means to enhance our own capabilities, degrade or counteract
enemy capabilities, and protect our own assets, <I>including our own information.</I>  This is not new.  The struggle
to discover and exploit information started the first time one group of people tried to gain advantage over
another.

<P>

Information warfare consists of targeting the enemy's information and information functions, while
protecting our own, with the intent of degrading his will or capability to fight (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#5">5</A>). Drawing on the
definitions of information and information functions, we define information warfare as:

<P>

<B>Information Warfare:</B> <I>any action to deny, exploit, corrupt, or destroy the enemy's information
and its functions; protecting ourselves against those actions; and exploiting our own military information
functions (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#6">6</A>).
</I>

<P>
This definition is the basis for the following assertions:


<P>


<B>Information warfare is any attack against an information function, regardless of the means.</B>  <I>Bombing a
telephone switching facility is information warfare.  So is destroying the switching facility's software.
</I>
<P>

Information warfare is any action to protect our information functions, regardless of the means.  <I>Hardening
and defending the switching facility against air attack is information warfare.  So is using an anti-virus
program to protect the facility's software.
</I>


<P>










Information warfare is a means, not an end, in precisely the same manner that air warfare is a means, not an
end.  <I>We may use information warfare as a means to conduct strategic attack and interdiction, for example,
just as we may use air warfare to conduct strategic attack and interdiction.</I>

<P>

Militaries have always tried to gain or affect the information required for an adversary to effectively employ forces.  Past strategies typically relied on measures such as feints and deception to influence decisions by affecting the decision maker's perceptions.  Because these strategies influenced information through the perception process, they attacked the

enemy's information indirectly.  That is, for deception to be effective, the enemy had to do three things:

<P>

<UL><LI>observe the deception,

<P>

<LI>analyze the deception as reality, and

<P>

<LI>act upon the deception according to the deceiver's goals.

<P></UL>



However, modern means of performing information functions give information added vulnerability: direct
access and manipulation (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#7">7</A>). Modern technology now permits an adversary to change or create information
without relying on observation and interpretation.  Here is a short list of modem information system
characteristics creating this vulnerability: concentrated storage, access speed, widespread information
transmission, and the increased capacity for information systems to direct actions autonomously.  Intelligent
security measures can reduce, but not eliminate, this vulnerability; their absence makes it glaring.

<P>

Militaries are not inclined to trust their success to the fortunes of war.  So we must direct our information warfare efforts to more than just targeting an adversary's information: we must also defend our own information, and all its operations.  The Air Force depends heavily upon military information functions, making us vulnerable to information warfare.  The integrity of our military information functions, as well as the information itself, bears heavily and directly on the success of our military operations.

<H3>WHAT COMPRISES INFORMATION WARFARE?</H3>

<P>

Recalling the definition, information warfare consists of activities that deny, exploit, corrupt, destroy, or protect information.  Traditional means of conducting information warfare include psychological operations, electronic warfare, military deception, physical attack, and various security measures.

<P>

<B>Psychological Operations</B><I> use information to affect the enemy's reasoning.
</I>
<P>

<B>Electronic Warfare</B> <I>denies accurate information to the enemy (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#8">8</A>).
<P></I>


<B>Military Deception</B> <I>misleads the enemy about our capabilities or intentions (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#9">9</A>).
</I>
<P>

<B>Physical Destruction</B> <I>can do information warfare by affecting information system elements through the conversion of stored energy to destructive power.  The means of physical attack range from conventional bombs to electromagnetic pulse weapons.
</I>

<P>
<B>Security Measures</B> <I>seek to keep the adversary from learning about our military capabilities and intentions (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#10">10</A>).
</I>
<P>

The Information Age has provided new and practical means to deny, exploit, corrupt, or destroy information (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#11">11</A>), as well as the vulnerabilities to make those attacks possible.  Air Force doctrine does not yet acknowledge or define these assaults on information, which we call Information Attack.

<P>

<B>Information Attack: </B><I>directly corrupting (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#12">12</A>) information without visibly changing the physical entity within which it resides.
</I>
<P>

Information attack, constrained by the definition of information, is limited to directly altering data or instructions.  It is, therefore, just another means of conducting information warfare, one whose immediate effects do not include visible changes to the entity within which the information resides.  That is to say, after being subjected to information attack, an information function is indistinguishable from its original state except through inspecting its data or instructions (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#13">13</A>).

<P>



<H3>HOW IS INFORMATION ATTACK DIFFERENT?</H3>


<P>
As previously described, there are two ways to influence the adversary's information

functions: indirectly and directly.

<P>

Indirect information warfare affects information by creating phenomena, which the adversary will
perceive, interpret, and act upon.  Military deception, physical attack, and OPSEC traditionally achieved
their ends indirectly (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#14">14</A>).  For example, the goal of deception is to cause the adversary to make incorrect
decisions; deception does this by creating an apparent reality.  Generally, this entails creating phenomena
for the enemy to observer Success, however, depends on several conditional events: the adversary actually
observes the phenomenon, thereby turning it into data; analyzes it into the desired information; and acts
upon the information in the desired manner.

<P>

Direct information warfare affects information through altering its components without relying on the adversary's powers of perception or interpretation.  Information attack acts directly upon the adversary's information.  Since nearly all modem information functions are themselves controlled by information, information attack may be directed against most information functions.

<P>

Direct information warfare, the point of information attack, acts on the adversary's information without
relying on the adversary's collection, analysis, or decision functions.  It can short circuit the OODA loop (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#15">15</A>)
through creating observations and skewing orientation, or decapitate it by imposing decisions and causing
actions.

<P>

A short illustration will serve to demonstrate the difference between indirect and direct information warfare applications:

<P>

Our goal, using military deception, is to make the adversary think there is a wing of combat aircraft where, in fact, there is none, and act on that information in a manner benefiting our operations.

<P>

<I>Indirect information warfare: </I>Using military deception, we could construct fake runways and parking areas, and generate enough other activities to present a convincing image.  We rely on the adversary to observe the pseudo combat operation and interpret it as real (as opposed to detecting the fake).  Only then does it become the information we want the adversary to have.
<P>


<I>Direct information warfare:</I> Conversely, if we use information attack to create the pseudo combat wing in the adversary's store of information, the result-deception-is precisely the same.  But the means to that result, never mind the resources, time, and uncertainty, are dramatically different.

<P>

<H3>WHAT IS THE OTHER EDGE OF THE INFORMATION WARFARE SWORD?</H3>

<P>

The defensive side of information warfaresecurity measures aimed at protecting information-prevents an adversary from conducting successful information warfare against our information functions.  Current security measures such as OPSEC and COMSEC are typical means of preventing, detecting, and subverting an adversary's indirect actions on our military information functions.  In contrast, security measures such as COMPUSEC encompass preventing, detecting, and subverting direct information actions on our information functions.  Future security measures must evolve as information technology advances.  Consequently, new-measures will likely take forms entirely different from today's security measures, rooted as they are in previous security requirements.  As the simple examples in this paper illustrate, we must avoid falling victim to profound, debilitating effects of direct information warfare.



<P>






<H3>WHY IS INFORMATION WARFARE IMPORTANT TO THE USAF?</H3>

<P>

Two reasons.  First, because information warfare offers important means to accomplish Air Force missions.  Second, because the widespread integration of information systems into Air Force operations makes our military information functions a valuable target set.

<P>

A hypothetical example using information attack shows how information warfare might accomplish a typical Air Force mission:


<P>
Interdiction prevents or delays essential resources from reaching combat units.  One approach to interdiction is wrecking bridge spans using laser-guided bombs.  Alternatively, we might be able to alter the adversary planners' information, falsely categorizing the bridges as destroyed, causing the planners to reroute forces and supplies.  Each means performs interdiction; information attack offers the possibility of achieving our goal while consuming fewer resources or without exposing our assets to attack.

<P>

As an example emphasizing the need for robust defenses against information warfare, imagine the chaos that would ensue should an adversary manage to penetrate our time-phased force deployment database.  Subtle changes in it could be sufficient to bring our power projection capabilities to a near standstill.

<P>



<H3>HOW SHOULD WE CHANGE AIR FORCE DOCTRINE TO ACCOMMODATE INFORMATION WARFARE?</H3>



<P>

Presently, Air Force doctrine recognizes air warfare and space warfare.  However, the doctrine doesn't identify separate missions for air warfare or space warfare.  Instead,

both cut across all roles and missions.  Similarly, information warfare cannot be pigeonholed as a single mission.  To do so would fail to completely integrate information warfare into Air Force doctrine.



<P>











Recall that missions are operational tasks performed to achieve military objectives.  Air warfare is a means, defined by the environment, to execute those missions.  There are three objectives of air warfare:

<P>

<UL><LI><B>control</B> the air while protecting our forces from enemy action,

<P>

<LI><B>exploit</B> control of the air to employ forces against the enemy, and,

<P>

<LI><B>enhance</B> our overall force effectiveness.

<P></UL>

In our doctrine, the <I>objectives</I> of control, exploit, and enhance translate into the <I>roles</I> of aerospace control, force application, and force enhancement.

<P>

In many respects, one can consider information as a realm, just as land, sea, air, and space are realms (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#16">16</A>)
information has its own characteristics of motion, mass, and topography, just as air, space, sea, and land
have their own distinct characteristics (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#17">17</A>). There are strong conceptual parallels between conceiving of air
and information as realms.  Before the Wright brothers, air, while it obviously existed, was not a realm
suitable for practical, widespread military operations.  Similarly, information existed before the
Information Age.  But the Information Age changed the information realm's characteristics so that
widespread military operations within it became practical.

<P>

Information warfare, like air warfare, is the means defined by the environment to execute military missions.  There are three objectives of information warfare:

<P>

<UL><LI><B>control</B> the information realm so we can exploit it while protecting our own military information functions from enemy action,

<P>

<LI><B>exploit</B> control of information to employ information warfare against the enemy, and,


<P>
<LI><B>enhance</B> overall force effectiveness by fully developing military information functions.

<P></UL>












The <B>first</B> objective of information warfare, to <B>control</B> the realm so we can exploit it while protecting our own military information functions from enemy action, contributes significantly to controlling the combat environment.  Presently, Air Force doctrine recognizes two missions to control the combat environment: counterair and counterspace.  Counterair comprises missions whose objectives are control of the air; counterspace comprises those missions whose objectives are control of space.  Clarity and consistency require we term those activities dedicated to controlling information as <I>counterinformation</I>.

<P>

<B>Counterinformation: </B><I>actions dedicated to controlling the information realm.
</I>
<P>

Further, counterinformation, like counterair and counterspace, has both offensive and defensive aspects.  Offensive counterinformation enables us to use the information realm and impedes the adversary's use of the realm.  Typical means include physical attack, military deception, psychological operations, electronic warfare, and information attack.  Defensive counterinformation includes both active and passive actions to protect ourselves from the adversary's information warfare actions.  Defensive counterinformation is accomplished, for instance, through physical defense, physical security, hardening, OPSEC, COMSEC, COMPUSEC, and counterintelligence.

<P>

Successful aerospace control enables us to use the air and space realms without suffering substantial losses, and inflict substantial losses on the enemy's use of those realms.  Counterinformation, working with counterair and counterspace, seeks to create such an environment.

<P>

The<B> second</B> objective of information warfare is to <B>exploit</B> our control of information.  In air warfare's force application role, the missions of strategic attack, interdiction, and close air support exploit air control.  Similarly, information warfare might also be used to achieve the same ends.  We have already cited an example of how information warfare can perform interdiction.  It can also perform strategic attack:

<P>

Suppose we want to limit the enemy's long-term mobility by restricting his POL resupply.  We first identify his refineries as the most suitable target to achieve this goal.  Through research we further identify the specific refineries comprising most of his production capacity.  For each refinery, we find there is one critical cracking tower.  We mount a strike and, with admirable economy of force, put the refineries out of operation by destroying just those towers, while leaving everything else untouched.  This is a classic example of strategic attack.


<P>




Same situation.  Like all modern refineries, these have extensive automated control systems.  These extensive information functions offer a potential target for information warfare.  Early in the conflict we performed an offensive counterinformation mission by penetrating and characterizing the refinery's automated control system.  In the process, we uncovered several vulnerable information dependencies, giving us the means of affecting the refineries' operations at a time of our choosing.  Later in the conflict, combined with interdiction and ground maneuvers, we choose to exploit one of the vulnerabilities.  We have just disabled their refineries.  This, too, is a classic example of strategic attack.

<P>

Information technology is already tightly woven with our military operations, providing heretofore
unimaginable amounts of information.  Exploiting this information has provided us striking capabilities;
relying on it inevitably creates potentially crippling vulnerabilities.  This, coupled with advances in the
ability -to both locate and destroy command and control (C2) nodes makes C2, more than ever, a lucrative
target set.  History has shown successful militaries can achieve striking success through paralyzing the
enemy's ability to exercise command and control.  Airmen have always considered this an important
objective and expended much effort against C2 (<A HREF="mil_c4ia.html-ssi#18">18</A>). For these reasons, the efforts to disrupt and destroy the
adversary's command and control elements have prompted us to identify a separate mission under force
application.

<P>

<B>C2 Attack:</B> <I>any action against any element of the enemy's command and control system.
</I>

<P>
The <B>third</B> objective of information warfare is to develop information functions to <B>enhance</B> total force effectiveness.  Previously we described military information functions as supporting the employment of military forces.  Our current doctrine does not include such a mission.  To fill that void, we will include information operations under force enhancement.  Some examples of information operations are: surveillance, reconnaissance, command and control, communications, combat identification, intelligence, precision navigation, and weather.  The distinguishing characteristic of the information operations mission is that it deals primarily with information as both its resource and product.

<P>




<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="corner_chart2.gif" ALT="Roles And Missons of Aerospace Power">
	<P>	

<B>Information Operations:</B> <I>any action involving the acquisition, transmission, storage, or transformation of information that enhances the employment of military forces.

<P></I>

Since we require relevant, accurate, and timely information for <I>everything</I> we do, information operations support the conduct of missions across all four roles', from aerospace control to force support.  Information operations provide commanders the ability to observe the battlespace, analyze events, and direct forces. information operations provide logisticians the ability to know what is in inventory, and where it is needed.  Information operations provide the flight lead the ability to know where the target is, its defenses, and select the most appropriate weapon.

<P>
In sum, information warfare cuts across all Air Force roles and missions.  It is another means to conduct our traditional missions.  However, there are three additional

operational tasks that information warfare enables us to execute which are not suitably addressed by our current doctrine: counterinformation, C2 Attack, and information operations.  Similarly, we elected to delete two missions no longer relevant under regrouped missions: electronic combat, previously under force enhancement, is now subsumed by information warfare; surveillance and reconnaissance are now considered instances of information operations.  However, this list is by no means exhaustive.  As this paper's title conveys, the ideas contained herein provide the cornerstones, not the entire building.  Invariably, as the Air Force fully accommodates the information technology revolution, additional operational tasks may arise which will in turn warrant adding or removing missions.  To the extent these cornerstones continue to provide a valid litmus test for information warfare, all new missions need to meet and pass it.







<P>



<H3>WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMATION WARFARE AND COMMAND & CONTROL WARFARE?</H3>

<P>



The focus of information warfare is <I>any</I> information function, whether it is C2, a refinery's control system, or a telephone switching station.  C2 represents only part of the universe of military information functions.  The Joint Staff defines command and control:

<P>

<B>Command and Control:</B> <I>the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned forces in the accomplishment of the mission. [joint Pub 1-021
</I>
<P>

Command and control warfare (C2W) only addresses activities directed against the adversary's ability to direct the disposition and employment of forces, or those which protect the friendly commander's ability to do so.  As we have illustrated, information warfare not only attacks the C2 process, but it also attacks the enemy's combat power itself.  Conversely, by definition, C2W is not associated with reducing or nullifying the ability or desire of combat units to execute their orders.  Tactical psychological operations and electronic countermeasures self-protection hinder the ability of units to execute orders.  But they in no way affect commanders' ability to issue orders to those units, nor their ability to receive those orders.
<P>


Although extraordinarily important, the JCS's policy of Command and Control Warfare is only a particular application of information warfare.  For the military to concentrate only on C2W would be ignoring other legitimate target sets.  Therefore, information warfare, and its attendant organizing, training, and equipping issues, is essential to fully effective C2W.

<P>

<H3>IS INFORMATION WARFARE IMPORTANT ONLY TO  THE AIR FORCE?</H3>

<P>

We have established that information warfare is important to the Air Force for two reasons.  First, since our
military information functions present a valuable target set, we must make commensurate defensive efforts. 
Second, as the examples in this paper show, information warfare is a potential means to achieve typical
Air Force ends: strategic attack, interdiction, etc.  More fundamentally, the Air Force <I>already does</I>
information warfare through such systems as the EF-111 and Compass Call.

<P>









But in a broader sense, information warfare might be a means to conduct any mission the services already conduct - and the services are best positioned to choose the best means for their ends.  Each service has its own unique operational demands.  After all, the Army is best qualified to decide which means are best suited for pursuing the goals the joint Force Commander apportions to the Army.

<P>

As a result of its service-unique expertise, its own OODA loop requirements, logistics, etc., each service has information warfare concerns.  In developing the doctrinal constructs in this paper, we used airpower terminology and examples.  That is our background, those are the terms and the environment with which we are familiar.  But the argument we present <B>is not</B> dependent on terminology.  Replacing Air Force terms with Army or Navy terms would leave the conclusions unchanged.


<P>


<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>

<P>

The information revolution, startlingly fast as it is, shows no signs of slowing.  As the Air Force becomes more technologically sophisticated, it becomes more technologically dependent.  We need to use that technological sophistication to avail ourselves of all the opportunities that information, as a target, presents.  We also need to be aware that our technical dependencies represent potentially crippling vulnerabilities.  Sophisticated, robust, multi-layered defenses for our military information functions may well be what separates us from joining the sorry league of military failures.

<P>

Information, combined with modern information functions, has distinct characteristics that warrant it being considered a realm, just as land, sea, air, .and space are realms.  Information warfare does not fill a discrete place in Air Force doctrine. just like air warfare, information warfare can be part of many AFM 1 -1 missions. just as when space warfare was integrated into Air Force doctrine, viewing information as a realm now leads us to add several missions:

<P>

<B>Counterinformation:</B> <I>controlling the information realm.</I>

<P>

<B>C2 Attack: </B><I>any action against the enemy's command and control system.
</I>

<P>
<B>Information Operations: </B><I>any action involving the acquisition, transmission, storage, or transformation of information that enhances the employment of military forces.
</I>
<P>

Since World War 1, airmen have had to control the air environment effectively to employ airpower.  What is more, air and space superiority are virtually a <I>sine qua non </I>for employing ground and naval forces.  Information is the next realm we must control to operate effectively and with the greatest economy of force.

<P>

At the outset we stated the competition for information is as old as man's first conflict.  It involves increasing and protecting our own store of information while limiting and penetrating the adversary's.  The recent explosion in information technologies is prompting the current discussion in and outside government on the topic of information warfare - targeting the enemy's information functions, while protecting ours, with the intent of degrading his will or capability to fight.

<P>

For airmen, controlling the combat environment is job One.  With the advances in information technology,
airmen must pursue information superiority just as they do air and space superiority.  Only with these
realms under our control can we effectively employ <B>all</B> our combat assets.  Military information functions are
essential to our combat operations-they are a tool for achieving the Joint Force Commander's campaign
objectives.  Targeting the enemy's information functions keeps him from achieving his.

<P>

In this paper we have laid out information warfare's doctrinal foundation.  Our goal is to provide a sound and widely accepted basis from which we can adapt Air Force doctrine to the Information Age.  The ultimate aim?  Incorporating information warfare into the way the Air Force organizes, trains, equips, and employs.

INTRODUCTION
	
<P>	I have been asked to address the future management and organization of the federal government for information warfare.  Where should the leadership and stewardship of the multi-faceted efforts that make up the offensive and defensive parts of INFOWAR be housed?  Who should be the head honcho of these efforts?  What should be the heads authorities and responsibilities?  Who should conduct R&D on information warfare?  Who should initiate acquisition of defensive and offensive capabilities associated with information warfare? If multi-service or multi-agency procurement is required, how should they be coordinated and facilitated?  Who should have operational control of these activities? Should one or more subentities be empowered to initiate operations?  These are questions we will explore together in the next few minutes. 	

<P>	Let me begin by postulating a number of models of US government executive branch organization and provide some preliminary views on the appropriateness of these models in performing the tasks associated with INFOWAR.

<P>     The quantitative  estimations of efficiency for information security systems (ISS) are still important and very difficult problem.  Our team are working in this sphere for a long time.  There is the general
idea of our approach in this paper.</P>
<P>    By "The  Information Security System" (ISS) we shall mean organization for combine efforts different means and ways of  counteraction to threats  for information security.</P>
<P>       Functional structure ISS.</P>
 <P>    We shall present functional structure of ISS as hierarchical System, consisting of parts of different levels which shone on the picture. As you can see on the picture,  the structure of ISS is defined by
structure of possible threats. As you know each threat has same different ways of realization.  For example, a plunder of information my be make by different manners.  In correspondence with this possible  manners we design the structure of the ISS.</P>
     <P>Elementary part the ISS (first level) is some means of counteraction to a concrete way of realization concrete threat.</P>
     <P>The parts  of the second level provide organization and coordination of  actions  for  all means of counteraction to determined way of realization of threat.</P>
     <P>The parts of the third  level  coordinate the actions of all means of counteraction to all various ways of realizations of each threat.</P>
     <P>The parts of the fourth level coordinate the actions of  parts  of the third level against all prospective threats.</P>
     <P>The the fifth level coordinate actions of parts of the fourth level for maintenance information security for all objects which enter in the ISS.</P>
     <P>The process of functioning any ISS can be presented in the  terms of this hierarchical structure.
      Statement of a problems.</P>
     <P>In a general kind of the problem of an estimation of  effici ency may be present through three tasks:
     To define efficiency of functioning the ISS in question by a presence complex of means for maintenance information security;</P>
     </P>To define  structure the ISS in question ensuring minimum it cost at a given level information security of object;</P>
     <P>To define  structure  the ISS in question ensuring maximum level of information security for object at given size of resources.</P>
     <P>The main idea of our approach basis on two principles.</P>
     <P>At first,  all calculations of efficiency are made from first level to highest level of the ISS. For this We mast have all information for elementary part of first level of the ISS in question.</P>
     <P>The second principle is the principle equiprotection.  This principle supposes that estimation of efficiency of the ISS is equally efficiency of most weak part of this ISS.</P>
     <P>By central  concept ,  allowing us to construct normative base of quantitative estimations  of efficiency the ISS is specific efficiency of a means.  It is "Counteractions to a particular way of  realization of threat  "  for  all elementary part of first level of the ISS.  The specific efficiency can be interpreted as probability that  the  given way realization of threat will be prevented .</P>
    <P>The dimensional  representation  of  this parameters defined distinctions of functioning each means of protection.  It can be size  of protected  territory by one means in unit time.  Quantity of the coded
information by one means in unit time or volume of the  processed  information by one means in unit time and etc..</P>
     <P>In correspondence with principle of equiprotection,  we shall enter criterion RELIABILITY of PROTECTION - Qjkl, as universal criterion of  efficiency for all parts and all level of ISS,  beginning from the
second level.</P>
    <P> In this case Reliability of protection of object  on  the  second level from  j-way of k-threat is defined by expression</P>
 <PRE>
               Qjk = 1 - [Pjk * (1 - Ujk)      (1) ,
 
   where:
    Pjk  - dependence  of  probability   of realization j-way 
            of k-threat from a degree of protection - Ujk,
    Ujk - degree of protection of object from j-way of k-threat.
    Pjk = Pjk(Ujk)
 </PRE>
     <P>The dependence Pjk(Ujk) fixes obvious fact,  than the more effective protection so less the probability of threats realization.  There is very difficult problem to define this function. We have same different methods for defining  this dependence and for calculations efficiency elementary part of means of counteractions.  Same of this methods and models are very complex.</P>
    <P> The expression (1) is a basis for calculation parameters of efficiency of measures of counteraction at all following levels of theISS.</P>
    <P> The purpose of activity of the third level is maintained equiprotection of  object from all ways of realization of the threat in question.</P>
 <P>The reliability of protection for third level is defined  formula (2)</P>
 <PRE>
    Qk = Qjk min from { Qjk} for all j(J    (2).
 </PRE>
<P>The purpose  of functioning of the fourth level the ISS is maintenance
equiprotection of object from all threats. It means, that criterion of
efficiency  for this level is equal to the minimum reliability protection on the third level.</P>
 <PRE>
 Ql =  Qkl min from  {Qkl} = Qjkl from {Qjkl} For all jkl (JKL. (3)
 </PRE>
  <P>   The purpose of functioning the ISS as  integrity  is  maintenance
equalreliability  of  protection  all objects in view of their gravity
-Bl. Criterion of efficiency of functioning the ISS is defined by formula</P>
 <PRE>
    Qiss = [Ql * Bl}min from {Ql * Bl} for all l(L     (4).
 </PRE>
<P>     As you  can see this approach allows us to formulate the problems
of an estimation of efficiency existing  the ISS and on the basis of it decisions  to put problems of creation new ISS or modernization existing one. It allows us to carry out research and comparative analyses  different ISS  on  critical  parameters  and to reveal perspective way of their development.</P>
<P>     This approach  was implemented by the mathematical model which was used for practical  calculations.</P>

<P>
<B> Introduction</B>
<P>
 This paper outlines both the requirement for, and a recommended
approach to, the creation of a National Information Strategy.
 Despite the fact that we have leaders in both the Administration
and the Legislature who understand the critical importance of
information as the foundation for both national security and national
competitiveness at the dawn of the 21st Century, our leadership
has failed to articulate a strategy and a policy with integrates
national intelligence (spies, satellites), government information,
and private sector information objectives and resources.
<P>
 In the Age of Information, the absence of a National Information
Strategy is tantamount to abdication and surrender--the equivalent
of having failed to field an Army in World War II, or having failed
to establish a nuclear deterrent in the Cold War.  This paper
is both an orientation for citizens and bureaucrats, and a call
to arms for policy makers and legislators.  It is a fundamental
premise of this paper that in the Age of Information, the most
important role of government--at the Federal, State, or Local
level--will be the nurturing of the &quot;information commons&quot;
 National security will be largely a question of protecting information
infrastructure, intellectual property, and the integrity of data;
national competitiveness will be completely redefined--corporations
and individuals are competitive in a global economy--it is the
role of nations to be &quot;attractive&quot; to investors.  How
nation's manage their information commons will be a critical factor
in determining &quot;national attractiveness&quot; for investment
in the 21st Century.  This paper will address and define the challenge
of change; the information commons and information continuum;
the theory and practice of intelligence in the age of information;
the ethical, ecological, and evolutionary implications of this
approach; the need to reinvent and integrate national intelligence
(spies and satellites) into a larger network of distributed intelligence
largely accessible to citizens; and finally, the concrete elements
which must comprise the National Information Strategy.
<P>
<B> The Challenge of Change</B>
<P>
 As we enter the 21st Century, we are faced with several dramatic
challenges, confronted by order of magnitude changes that defy
resolution under our existing paradigms and organizational or
policy structures.
<P>
 The most obvious challenge to government as a whole is the changing
nature of the threat.  Since the rise of the nation-state; with
its citizenship, taxation, and standing armies; the most fundamental
national security issue for governments has been the sanctity
of its borders and the safety of its citizens and property abroad.
 Physical security maintained by threat of force was easy to understand
and easy to implement.  Today, we face a world in which transnational
criminal gangs have more money, better computers, better information,
and vastly more motivation to act and to act ruthlessly, than
most states.  Perhaps even more frightening, we face a world in
which we are allowing technology and limited policy understanding
to create very significant masses of dispossessed and alienated
populations--including sizeable elements within our own borders;
and at the same time we are ignoring our government's obligations
to provide for home defense, for electronic civil defense, in
the private sector.   
<P>
 There is another important change requiring government diligence,
and that is the change in the role of information as the &quot;blood&quot;
of every enterprise, every endeavor.  Three aspects of this change
merit enumeration: first, each citizen, whether they are conscious
of this fact or not, is increasingly dependent on accurate and
timely information in order to be fully functional; second, the
&quot;information explosion&quot;, like a major climatic change,
is making it difficult for citizens accustomed to slower times
and simpler tools to adjust to the requirements of life in the
fast lane of the information superhighway; and finally, most citizens,
stockholders, and business managers do not realize that we have
national telecommunications, power, and financial networks that
have been designed without regard to security or survivability.
 It is not safe, today, to work and play in cyber-space, and we
do not even have a body of law that requires communications and
computing providers to assure their customers that their services
and products are safe and reliable!
<P>
 In brief, we now have an information environment in which every
citizen needs to be a collector, producer, and consumer of &quot;intelligence&quot;,
or decision-support; and at the same time we have an extraordinarily
complex and fragile information infrastructure which can be destroyed,
disrupted, and corrupted by single individuals or small groups
now capable of attaching our information infrastructure nodes
through electronic means or simple physical destruction--and able
to do so anonymously.
<P>
<B>Defining The &quot;Information Commons&quot;</B>
<P>
 The &quot;information commons&quot;can be viewed--as the public
commons for grazing sheep was once viewed in old England--as a
shared environment where information is available for public exploitation
to the common good.  There are three major information &quot;industries&quot;
that must contribute their fair share to the commons if the commons
is to be robust and useful.
<P>
 The first, relatively unknown to most citizens, is the U.S. intelligence
community, traditionally associated with spies and satellites.
 In fact, between 40% and 80% of the raw data going into the final
products of the intelligence community comes from &quot;open sources&quot;,
from public information legally available.  Unfortunately, this
$25 billion dollar a year community buries its open source acquisitions
in the &quot;cement overcoat&quot; of classification, with the
result that most of the useful public information acquired by
the intelligence community at taxpayer expenses is not in fact
made available to the citizen-taxpayer.
<P>
 The second, well-known to most citizens as a massive bureaucracy
which generates regulations and imposes taxation, is the government.
 The government is <U>not</U>, however, known for making information
available to the public, and this is an extraordinary failure,
for it turns out that the government is not only acquiring enormous
stores of information at taxpayer expense, on every imaginable
topic, but the government also serves as a magnet for vast quantities
of information which it receives &quot;free&quot; from other governments,
from think tanks, lobbyists, universities, and every other purveyor
of a viewpoint desiring to influence the bureaucrats that comprise
the government.  In the age of information, governments must transition
from the industrial model (vast bureaucracies attempting to deliver
goods and services using a hierarchical structure to control resources)
to the &quot;Third Wave&quot; model (small expert nodes nurturing
distributed centers of information excellence).  There are some
significant capabilities within government intended to address
this issue, including the National Technical Information Service
(NTIS) in the Department of Commerce and the Defense Technical
Information Center (DTIC) in the Department of Defense, but by
and large government information is <U>out of control</U>.  If
the intelligence community is a 25 billion a year industry, then
the U.S. government can safely be assumed to be at least a 250
billion a year industry. 
<P>
 The third &quot;industry&quot; capable of contributing to the
information commons is the most important, the most diverse, and
the most dynamic--it is the private sector.  This has extraordinary
implications for both governance and enterprise in the 21st Century,
because of four characteristics of &quot;knowledge battle&quot;
in the 21st Century that governments must recognize if they are
to do their part:  first, 90-95% of knowledge is open, not secret--governments
that continue to believe in secrecy as the paramount element of
executive action will fail; second, the center of gravity is in
the civil sector--governments that continue to rely on their military
and their police and exclude from consideration the role of private
sector capabilities, will fail; third, information today is <U>distributed
</U>--governments that persist in relying upon &quot;central intelligence&quot;
structures will fail; and finally, information is multi-lingual--governments
that do not invest in analysts and observers able to move easily
in multi-lingual environments will fail.  If the intelligence
community is a $25 billion a year industry, and the U.S. government
is a $250 billion a year industry, the private sector can safely
be assumed to be a $2.5 trillion a year industry--do we see a
pattern here?  The national information community, in short, is
comprised of three concentric circles of investment which are
not, at this time, contributing a single datum to the &quot;information
commons&quot;.
<P>
<B> The Information Continuum</B>
<P>
 The &quot;information continuum&quot; for any nation is comprised
of the nine major information consuming and information producing
sectors of society: schools, universities, libraries, businesses,
private investigators and information brokers, media, government,
defense, and intelligence.
<P>
 It is very important to understand three basic aspects of the
information continuum:
<P>
 First, each organization within each sector pays for and controls
both experts and data that could contribute to the information
commons.  Perhaps most importantly from the taxpayer and government
point of view, these distributed centers of excellence are maintained
at no cost to the government.
<P>
 Second, it is important to understand that what any one organization
publishes for sale or for free, whether in hard-copy or electronically,
represents less than 20%--often less than 10%--of what they are
actually holding in their databases or is known to their employees.
<P>
 Third, and here we begin to set the stage for why a National
Information Strategy is essential, it is essential for both citizens
and bureaucrats to realize that across this information continuum
there are &quot;iron curtains&quot; between the sectors, &quot;bamboo
curtains&quot; between organizations in each sector, and &quot;plastic
curtains&quot; between individuals within organizations.
<P>
 The role of government in the 21st Century is to provide incentives
and to facilitate the sharing and exchange of information between
the sectors, the organizations, and the individuals that comprise
the national information continuum--and to work with other governments
to create an international and transnational information commons.
<P>
 Schools and universities have both expert faculty and willing
student labor as well as significant electronic storage facilities.
 They also tend to have a multi-lingual population that can do
very fine data filtering and data entry work.  Two examples: the
Monterey Institute of International Studies (MIIS), which uses
graduate students fluent in Russian, Korean, Vietnamese, and Arabic
to maintain the world's best database on the proliferation of
nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons; and Mercyhurst College,
which uses undergraduate students to produce newsletters on narcotics
trafficking and other trends on interest to law enforcement agencies.
 Universities can also provide technical assistance and project
assistance--one very fine example of this capability, which provides
direct support to local government agencies as well as small and
medium-sized businesses, in the InfoMall developed by Syracuse
University.
<P>
 Libraries represent &quot;distributed knowledge&quot; in the
best possible way, and not only provide direct access for citizens,
but also skilled librarians who can serve as intermediaries in
global discovery and discrimination.  Examples of unique contributions
in the library arena are represented by the University of Colorado,
which created Uncover Reveal to distribute electronically the
tables of contents of all journals it processes; the Special Libraries
Association which brings together corporate and association librarians;
and the Library-Oriented List Service developed by Mr. Charles
Bailey, Jr.
<P>
 Businesses not only hold significant amounts of data that they
generate themselves, including customer preference data that could
contribute to aggregate industry studies; but they also pay for
great quantities of data, such as market surveys, which could
after a short passage of time be eligible for sharing with smaller
businesses and universities.  One of the challenges facing nations
which desire to be attractive to international investors is that
of creating &quot;information-rich&quot; environments within which
corporations can be globally competitive.  One way of doing this
is by developing information consortia and protocols for releasing
into the information commons such data as might have already been
exploited by the company that collected it or paid for it, but
which could now have a residual value for the larger community.
<P>
 Private investigators and information brokers are addressed separately
because they play a unique role in a global economy driven by
information, in which information is--as Alvin and Heidi Toffler
have noted--a substitute for wealth, violence, labor, and capital.
 The capabilities of organizations dedicated to finding and processing
information can be extraordinary, and worth every penny of investment.
 It is important to note that one of the most significant changes
to occur in relation to government information in the past two
decades is that the &quot;information explosion&quot; and the
free market economy have led to the establishment of private sector
capabilities which are superior to traditional government collection
and processing mechanisms.  Examples of &quot;best in class&quot;
private sector &quot;intelligence&quot; capabilities include Oxford
Analytica, with its global network of human experts monitoring
political and economic events world-wide; FIND/SVP, able to acquire

and the experts behind the knowledge.
<P>
 The utility of media information for policy, economic planning,
military contingency planning, and law enforcement is almost always
severely under-estimated.  In fact, journalists, and especially
investigative journalists, are extraordinarily talented, energetic,
and well-connected individuals who produce very significant and
accurate reports which can be integrated into finished reports
on virtually any topic.  It also merits comments that most journalists
only publish roughly ten percent of what they know.  James Baker,
former Secretary of State among other important positions, notes
in his memoirs that &quot;In terms of fine-turning our own work,
staying abreast of the press commentary was particularly important.&quot;
 Colin Powell, in his own book, notes that when he was Military
Assistant to then Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger, he &quot;preferred
the <I>Early Bird</I> with its compendium of newspaper stories&quot;,
to the &quot;cream of overnight intelligence&quot; which was delivered
to the Secretary by a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) courier
each morning.  In a direct and practical example, the U.S. Southern
Command, working with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, was
able--at very low cost--to exploit Latin American investigative
reporting such that tactical interdiction missions could be planned
and executed based primarily on media reporting.  This is not
to say that media sources are superior to classified intelligence,
only that they cannot be discounted and are especially useful
to those in the private sector and in much of government who are
not authorized access to classified information.
<P>
 Finally we have the government, including state and local governments
and their information holdings, the Department of Defense, and
the intelligence community.  These will not be examined in detail.
 However, it bears mention that in the absence of a policy supportive
of information archiving and public dissemination--and the means
for implementing that policy--vast stores of information reaching
the U.S. government, including information collected and processed
by contractors to the U.S. government, are being &quot;buried&quot;
each day, needlessly depriving the public of significant information
resources.  For those in government who are overwhelmed by their
own internal &quot;information explosion&quot;, and at a loss
for how to handle their archiving, Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) requests, and the complex issues of copyright, there <U>is
</U> a solution: NTIS. 
<P>
<B> Intelligence in the Age of Information</B>
<P>
 Now, having explored in general terms the elements of the information
commons and the information continuum, we must focus on the specifics
of intelligence in the age of information.  Among the core concepts
that government and private sector information managers must adopt
and promulgate:
<P>
 --  Espionage, whether by governments or corporations, is less
cost-effective that intelligent exploitation of open sources.
 Unfortunately, most intelligence communities are trained, equipped,
and organized to do secrets, and they are not well-positioned
to collect and integrate open sources--public information--into
their analysis and production processes.  This needs to be changed
and is addressed at the conclusion of this article.
<P>
 --  The best target for the application of intelligence methods
(requirements analysis, collection management, analytical fusion,
forecasting, visualization of information) is <U>not</U> a competitor
organization, but rather the customer and the environment.
<P>
 --  Decision-support (intelligence) is the ultimate objective
of all information processes.  One must carefully distinguish
between <U>data</U>, which is the raw text, signal, or image;
<U>information</U>, which is collated data of generic interest;
and <U>intelligence</U>, which is information that has been tailored
to support a specific decision by a specific person about a specific
question at a specific time and place.  Most government information
and so-called intelligence products are so generic as to be relatively
useless in directing action.  Only when information serves as
the foundation for intelligence, can its cost be justified.
<P>
 --  Distributed information is more valuable and yet less expensive
than centralized information.  The art of information governance
is the 21st Century will focus on harnessing distributed centers
of excellence rather than on creating centralized repositories
of information.
<P>
 --  &quot;Just in time&quot; information collection and intelligence
production is far less expensive and far more useful to the consumer
of intelligence than &quot;just in case&quot; collection and archiving.
<P>
 --  The value of information is a combination of its content,
the context within which it is being used, and the timeliness
with which it is obtained and exploited.  This means that information
which has been used by an organization declines in value when
taken out of context and after time has passed.  This in turn
means that there is every reason for an organization to barter,
share, or sell information (e.g. market research) once it's &quot;prime&quot;
value point has passed....this is especially important to an organization
as a means of increasing its acquisition of new information which--in
its own context and time--has greater value than when it was lying
fallow in the information commons.
<P>
 --  The new paradigm for information acquisition is the &quot;diamond
paradigm&quot;, in which the consumer, analyst, collector, and
source are all able to communicate directly with one another.
 The old paradigm, the &quot;linear paradigm&quot; in which the
consumer went to the analyst who went to the collector who went
to the source, and back up the chain it went, is not only too
slow, but it is not workable when you have a fast-moving topic
with many nuances that are difficult to communicate.  Today and
in the future, the information manager's greatest moment is going
to be when a consumer can be put in direct touch with exactly
the right source who can answer the question directly, at low
cost, by creating new knowledge tailored to the needs of the consumer,
at that exact moment.
<P>
 --  The most important information resource is the employee.
 Every employee must be a collector, producer, <U>and consumer
</U> of information and intelligence.  This is called the &quot;corporate
hive&quot; model, and is the foundation for a creating &quot;smart
nation&quot;.  If every personnel description does not list as
task number one: &quot;collect and report information useful to
the organization&quot;, and if organizations do not provide a
vehicle (e.g. Lotus Notes) and a protocol for sharing information
among employees, then by definition the organization is &quot;dumb&quot;.
<P>
 --  Published knowledge is old knowledge.  The art of intelligence
in the 21st Century will be less concerned with integrating old
knowledge, and more concerned with using published knowledge as
a path to exactly the right source or sources who can create new
knowledge tailored to a new situation, in real-time.
<P>
 --  The threat (or the answer) changes depending on the level
of analysis.  The most fundamental flaw in both intelligence and
information today is the failure to establish, for  each question,
the desired level of analysis.  There are four levels of analysis:
strategic, operational, tactical, and technical.  These are in
turn influenced by the three major contexts of inquiry: civil,
military, and geographic.  A simple example from the military
sphere will illustrate the importance of this issue.  Examining
the capability of  specific Middle Eastern country in the mission
area of tank warfare, it was found that while the initial threat
assessment (by someone unfamiliar with the levels of analysis
approach) was very high because this country had a great many
modern tanks, in fact the threat varied significantly depending
on the level of analysis.  Only at the technical level (lethality)
was the threat high.  At the tactical level (reliability) the
threat was in fact very low because the crews were not trained
and had poor morale, and the tanks were generally in storage and
not being maintained.  At the operational level (availability)
the threat increased to medium because there were large numbers
of tanks widely scattered over the country.  At the strategic
level (sustainability) the threat dropped again to low because
it would be almost impossible for this country to carry out extended
tank warfare operations, even on its own terrain.  This approach
can and should be applied to every question for which intelligence--tailored
information--is to be provided. 
<P>
<B> Ethics, Ecology, &amp; Evolution</B>
<P>
 Our &quot;industrial age&quot; concept of intelligence and information
has relied heavily on a centralized, top-down &quot;command and
control&quot; model in which the question virtually determined
the answer, and the compartmentation of knowledge--its restriction
to an elite few--has been a dominant feature of information operations.
 This article suggests that the true value of &quot;intelligence&quot;
lies in its informative value, a value which increases with dissemination.
 The emphasis within our government, therefore, should be on optimizing
our exploitation of open sources, increasing the exchange of information
between the intelligence community, the rest of government, and
the private sector; and the production of unclassified intelligence.
 This could be called the &quot;open books&quot; approach to national
intelligence.
<P>
 As we prepare to enter the 21st Century, we must ask ourselves
some fundamental questions.  How do we define national security?
 Who is the customer for national intelligence?  What is our objective?
 There appears to be every reason to discard old concepts of national
security and national intelligence, and to focus on developing
integrated nation-wide information and intelligence networks which
recognize that national security depends on a solid economy and
a stable environment; that the center of gravity for progress
in the future is the citizen, not the bureaucrat; and that our
objective must be to enable informed governance and informed citizenship,
not simply to monitor conventional and 
<P>
nuclear threats.
<P>
 I am convinced that the &quot;ethics&quot; of national intelligence
requires a dramatic reduction in government secrecy as well as
corporate secrecy.  After twenty years as an intelligence professional,
I am certain that secrets are inherently pathological, undermining
reasoned judgement and open discussion.  Secrets are also abused,
used to protect bureaucratic interests rather than genuine equities.
 Consider the following statement by Mr. Rodley B. McDaniel, then
Executive Secretary of the National Security Council:
<P>
  &quot;Everybody who's a real practitioner, and I'm sure you're
not all naive in this regard, realizes that there are two uses
to which security classification is put: the legitimate desire
to protect secrets, and protection of bureaucratic turf.  As a
practitioner of the real world, it's about 90 bureaucratic turf;
10 legitimate protection of secrets as far as I'm concerned.&quot;
<P>
 A wise man once said &quot;A nation's best defense is an educated
citizenry.&quot;  I firmly believe that in the age of information,
national intelligence--unclassified national intelligence--must
be embedded in every decision, every process, every organization.
 The &quot;ethics&quot; of openness need to apply to the private
sector as well as to the government.  Universities should not
be allowed to hold copyrights or patents if they are not able
or willing to disseminate knowledge or commercialize technology.
 Corporations should be allowed to monopolize patents solely to
protect archaic production processes. 
<P>
 The environment in which we live, in which we hope to prosper
and secure the common defense, is our most important intelligence
target, and our most neglected intelligence target.  Both our
traditional intelligence community, and our more conventional
government information community, both appear reluctant to take
on the hard issues of honestly evaluating the larger context within
which we export munitions, keep the price of gasoline under two
dollars a gallon, permit unfettered gang warfare and exploitation
within our immigrant communities, and so on.  At what point are
we going to establish an architecture for integrating federal,
state, and local data about the natural environment, and for producing
useful strategic analyses about specific political, economic,
and cultural issues?  The following paraphrased observation by
Ms. Ellen Seidman, Special Assistant to the President on the National
Economic Council, is instructive:
<P>
  CIA reports only focus on foreign economic conditions.  They
don't do domestic economic conditions and so I cannot get a strategic
analysis that compares and contrasts strengths and weaknesses
of the industries I am responsible for.  On the other hand, Treasury,
Commerce, and the Fed are terrible at the business of intelligence--they
don't <U>know</U> how to produce intelligence.
<P>
 Taken in combination, what we do out of ignorance to our environment
each day through our existing energy, trade, defense, housing,
transportation, and education policies is far worse than a whole
series of Chernobyls.
<P>
 Finally, if the Nation is to evolve, if it is to &quot;harness
the distributed intelligence of the Nation&quot;, as Vice President
Al Gore has taken to saying in his many speeches on the National
Information Infrastructure, then we must come to grips with the
fact that we are &quot;losing our mind&quot; as a Nation, and
that education is the &quot;boot camp&quot; for national intelligence.
 We must catalyze our educational system, including corporate
training and continuing education programs, and  realize that
openness is a powerful catalyst for bringing to bear the combined
intelligence of every citizen and resident--instead of &quot;National
Intelligence&quot; (spies and satellites) bearing the burden for
informing policy, we should rely upon &quot;national intelligence&quot;
(smart people), and use our distributed network of educated scholars,
workers, information brokers, journalists, civil servants, and
soldiers as the <U>foundation</U> for smart policy.  Upon such
a foundation, spies and satellites can add a decisive value--without
such a foundation, spies and satellites are irrelevant. 
<P>
<B>Reinventing National Intelligence</B>
<P>
 Now we can finally turn to the reinvention of the national intelligence
community as traditionally defined, for in reinventing this community,
we can inspire the reinvention of government information and the
establishment of a national information commons.
<P>
 By and large, the elements of the national intelligence community--the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency
(NSA), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), have
all performed to expectations.  Where we have gone awry was with
our expectations.  We focused this community on Soviet secrets,
and we funded this community to collect and process Soviet secrets.
 Everything else was secondary, and by and large, everything else
received--no surprise--virtually no attention.
<P>
 Unfortunately, the national intelligence community, in developing
approaches to &quot;denied area&quot; collection requirements,
became obsessed with technology, and ultimately ended up substituting
technology for thinking.  At the low end, an exclusive reliance
on the polygraph machine destroyed the art and craft of counter-intelligence.
 At the high end, the billions of dollars spent on satellites
capable of collecting images and signals led to cost-cutting in
other critical areas, with the most unfortunate loser being analysis.
 The community failed to invest in processing technologies, such
that less than ten percent of the images and signals collected
by this technology are actually processed, and the community went
short on analytical expertise, hiring young people just out of
college because they were cheap, rather than investing modestly
(say, one percent of what is being spent yearly on satellites)
in order to hire true experts who have proven themselves in the
private sector over time.
<P>
 What is to be done?  The following are but a few of the major
initiatives that could be considered, those most pertinent to
government information managers a body.
<P>
 First, we must accelerate the tentative program established by
the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to increase intelligence
community exploitation of open sources.  The Community Open Source
Program Office (COSPO) is under fine leadership and moving in
the right direction, but much more could be done, and done quickly.
 The National Foreign Intelligence Board has stated for the record
that 40% of the all-source intelligence product (products integrating
clandestine human intelligence reports, classified imagery, and
classified signals intercepts) comes from open sources <U>at a
cost of 1% of the National Foreign Intelligence Program budget
</U>.  This is an extraordinary admission.  The intelligence community
should <U>not</U> become a collector of public information--it
should instead develop capabilities for exploiting the vast resources
of unclassified information available to the rest of the government,
and at the same time develop a well-funded and well-managed capability
for purchasing from the private sector those open sources and
services most pertinent to the intelligence requirements it is
expected to satisfy.  Open sources are a foundation for the all-source
product, they are not a substitute for spies and satellites. 
We should not be sending spys where schoolboys can go, and we
must at the same time overcome the problem with spys today, that
they only know secrets and cannot validate or evaluate their secrets
in the larger context provided by full access to public information.
<P>
 Second, we must revitalize the CIA by restoring its core competence,
strategic analysis, and stripping away from this organizations
the extraneous functions that have depleted its analytic reserves.
 The existing Directorate of Intelligence should have transferred
to it the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) now resident
in the Directorate of Science and Technology; and the National
Collection Division (NCD) now resident in the Directorate of Operations.
 The National Intelligence Council should be significantly expanded
to include a National Intelligence Officer assigned to each of
the departments and principal agencies of the government, as well
as Assistant National Intelligence Officers for the traditional
intelligence topical areas.  COSPO should be integrated into the
DDI as its management arm, and should assume operational authority
over all intelligence community open source collection capabilities
and contracts.  The Directorate of Operations should be spun off
from CIA to become a separate Clandestine Service Agency (CSA),
and all of its case officers and other personnel gradually withdrawn
from our Embassies and placed under completely non-official cover.
 In their place in the Embassies we should put small inter-agency
teams of analysts, as well as open source collection and collection
management specialists, to provide the DDI with a tactical collection
and a tactical analysis team in direct support of the Ambassador
and his Country Team.  The Directorates of Science and Technology
and Administration should also be spun off from CIA, but upgraded
to the Office of the Director of Central Intelligence, and charged
with managing their respective domains for all agencies, not just
the CIA.  Now cleansed of its non-analytic elements, CIA can and
should be renamed the National Intelligence Agency (NIA).
<P>
 Other initiatives need not be stressed here, but would include
the establishment of a National Imagery &amp; Mapping Agency (NIMA)
charged with fully exploiting commercial imagery before assigning
scarce and expensive classified imagery assets; the expansion
NSA's charter to explicitly include monitoring of unclassified
communications in cyberspace; the establishment of a new Electronic
Security &amp; Counterintelligence Program under the oversight
of the FBI and with the private sector as its primary beneficiary;
and the integration of all military intelligence capabilities
under a Joint National Military Intelligence Command.
<P>
 Having thus put its own house in order, the traditional national
intelligence community of the United States would be ready to
serve as a full partner with the rest of government and the private
sector in making America the first &quot;smart nation&quot; in
the 21st Century.  This would, however, require a National Information
Strategy, and that is where we conclude.
<P>
<B>  National Information Strategy</B>
<P>
 The National Information Infrastructure (NII) provides the vital
element of connectivity--including civic networking--without which
no program to improve our national competitiveness could succeed.

<P>
 However, there is a larger vision, a larger program, where Executive
leadership must play a vital role: we as a people require a National
Information Strategy.  Our national competitiveness, and indeed
our national security in the information age, require a depth
and breadth of commitment to information as a commodity; to information
as a substitute for time, space, capital, and labor.  Information--applied
information--is vital to both our defense and our prosperity.
<P>
<I> Connectivity is but one of the four major elements of what
must soon become a National Information Strategy.</I>  For those
counseling the incremental approach, &quot;connectivity today,
content tomorrow&quot;, one must say: it will be too late.  The
fragility of our position in the world, in terms of &quot;brain
drain&quot;, budget deficit, and electronic security, all require
that we establish a four point integrated program immediately,
outlined below. 
<P>
 <U>Connectivity</U>.  Such a strategy should build upon the NII
as its technical foundation, but provide for three additional
elements:
<P>
 <U>Content</U>.  Existing government programs, under the auspices
of a National Information Foundation within The White House, should
provide incentives for all elements of the information continuum
(K-12, universities, libraries, businesses, information brokers,
media, government, defense, and intelligence) to put content online;
only in this way can we establish a robust national &quot;information
commons&quot; and give Robert Reich's symbolic analysts something
other than a starvation diet.  It is vital that we establish means
of nurturing distributed centers of excellence throughout our
Nation, in all topical areas, providing all sectors with incentives
to place encyclopedic information into the &quot;information commons&quot;
and thus stimulate productivity.  Just $1 billion a year invested
in this program could yield enormous productivity and competitiveness
gains across our entire private sector.  Within government, we
should dramatically acclerate NTIS involvement in structuring
and digitizing information now in the possession of the government
but not available to the public.
<P>
 <U>Coordination</U>.  Using a body similar to those now orchestrating
NII technical issues, focus on resource management across government
and private sector boundaries in both technical and non-technical
(content) arenas.  There is no good reason why hundreds of major
organizations should be wasting approximately $2 billion a year
creating hundreds of variations of a basic multi-media analysis
workstations.  There is no good reason why hundreds of corporations
and other organizations should be wasting enormous sums collecting
and processing the same encyclopedic information about foreign
countries, companies, and capabilities.  Presidential leadership
will make a difference and save the Nation billions of dollars
annually, not only within government, but across the private sector.
<P>
 <U>Communications &amp; Computer Security</U>.  We have a house
built over a sinkhole!  The vulnerabilities of our national telecommunications
infrastructure to interruption of services as well as destruction,
degradation, and theft of data are such that experts feel comfortable
in predicting that--unless we are able to establish a major Presidential
program in this arena--we will see a series of enormously costly
electronic attacks on our major financial and industrial organizations,
generally undertaken by individuals who stand to benefit financially
from degraded or interrupted performance.  The current generation
of systems engineers was not raised in an environment where security
was a necessary element of design.  At every level, through every
node, we are wide open--and in a networked environment, one open
house contaminates the next.
<P>
 Such an integrated program could be established using existing
resources.  The cost savings from the elimination of redundant
and counterproductive investments in information collection and
information technology across government departments and into
the private sector can also make a substantive difference against
the deficit.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
 We are a smart people today, but a dumb Nation.  Our national
security and our national attractiveness as a site for international
investment which permits our citizens to prosper are both at risk.
 We have no alternative but to completely redefine the role of
government to emphasize its responsibility for the nurturing of
our national information commons, and to redefine national intelligence
so as to create a Virtual Intelligence Community in which every
citizen is a collector, producer, and consumer of intelligence--to
do this, we must have a National Information Strategy.

<P>
Heraclitus noted that a man cannot walk in the same river twice,
for it was not the same river, and he was not the same man. Less
eloquently, things change. It stands to reason that conflict,
at once the driving force for change, the method of change, and
the fall-out from change, would itself change in nature over time.
As things change, and we are able to observe more of it, certain
patterns begin to arise; distance, in space and time, certainly
lends perspective.
<P>
Once Man thought the Earth was the center of the Universe; then
Galileo worked out a theory of motion, and paid the price; Newton
comes along, and given some room for contemplation, generalizes
a number of principles; Einstein catches some flaws and postulates
an even more generalized set of theories. We all stand on the
Shoulders of Giants.
<P>
No surprise, then, that some basic principles behind the Art or
Science of War are becoming more evident as we once again transform
our ways of thinking on the subject.
<P>
Approaches to conflict in the world fall into a four-quadrant
grid, passive-active on one axis, defense-offense on the other.
Passive defense stems from the assumption that a situation is
'friendly,' while active defense assumes 'hostile.' American activities
tend to fall into this first category, while those of the Cold
War Soviet Union fell into the later. Passive defense is a lethal
conceit--no wonder that America has found itself playing catch-up
on every conflict it has ever engaged in. The inherent danger
of active defense is
<P>
seen in the fall of the Warsaw Pact and sponsor: total collapse
from exhaustion as they actively tilted every windmill, unable
to afford the expense of continual vigilance bordering on paranoia.
<P>
The other grid half is the realm of the active and passive use
of force. Active offense, primarily the unnecessary bifurcation
into attrition and manoeuvre warfare, is an area of excellence
for the United States. Passive offense is an area that eludes
the military establishment, although, as I will explain, this
isn't necessary with a deeper understanding of what conflict is
about.
<P>
Life is the struggle for the free energy in a system; even the
most basic organisms are primarily 'concerned' with metabolism
and reproduction. As a political economy progresses and evolves,
interesting things happen, as you would expect in any system where
complexity can be measured by the combinatorial interactions of
the aggregate sub-systems. Political economies, social structures
if you will, can be defined by the depth of what can be called
'dependency infrastructure,' or the 'value add' chain.
<P>
The most basic political economy is that of the Agrarian society,
The Age of Bread. Such social structures have a very short 'material'
value chain (phases in a process where the receiver of the process
experiences a net gain in value or performance because of the
prior process), and a short 'informational' value chain. For example,
the material value chain of hunter-gatherers is minimal, just
the raw labour involved in the acts of hunting and gathering,
and the informational value chain is foodstuff identification
and processing knowledge. Slightly more complex is a feudal society,
where already the material-based labour component was being advanced
by the informational--blacksmithing and tack to create plows,
knowledge of planting seasons, milling grain for bread, animal
husbandry. This period is still preoccupied in the struggle for
the basics of life--food, shelter, warmth, procreation (Maslow's
Hierarchy); resource, labour, and capital are King (usually quite
literally, trapped in a zero-sum game, hierarchical political
economy).
<P>
The next phase of development is the Industrial Age, The Age of
Mass Production. This phase has long value chains in material
resource (systems to build systems to build systems...; tools
to build tools to build tools...), and a steadily growing value
chain in informationals. Additionally, considerable effort is
dedicated to the social contract, another example of spontaneous
order, which allows the complexities of a political economy to
function. The human species, not content to let such systems be
self-regulating, has wasted enormous resource in the attempt to
govern (in a cybernetic sense) the process, not realizing that
where there is free competition, there is no dependency, something
most groups claim to desire.
<P>
The current phase of development is what has been termed the Information
Age, the Age of Patents. Material value chains are beginning to
die back, while the informational value chain is increasing; this
reflects the situation that embodied thoughts can have value (and
in fact are replacing the resource-labour-capital triad), while
still being dependent upon the infrastructure. Western civilizations,
the most advanced of this phase, are fumbling with the new informational
value chain that progresses data into information into knowledge
into wisdom; most effort actually goes into simple shuttling of
raw data and a little information from here to there. The social
contract is more confused than ever; specialization has been forced
by the
<P>
complexities of getting to this phase, yet most of the critical
basis for interaction is being undermined. It is still increasingly
an age of positive-sum games, heterarchies, etc.
<P>
Interestingly, extrapolation of this trend leads to a further
or complete decay in the material value chain, possibly because
of advances in space exploration or nanotechnology. We'll have
to wait to get there-then to see which it is.
<P>
Now to return to conflict. In the Agrarian Phase, direct control
of the means of production through possession was necessary; from
this phase we have centuries of examples of 'conventional' warfare,
attrition style. As advances were made into the Industrial Age,
devastation of the dependency infrastructure was no
<P>
longer a viable option--what was broken couldn't work for the
winner's benefit. This led to progress in manoeuvre warfare, where
control became important, rather than devastation. Other than
a decidedly significant side-trip because of atomic and then nuclear
weapons, this remains the guiding principle of modern warfare.
In fact, it demonstrates (incidentally satisfying the correspondence
principle) a more fundamental nature of 'warfare' oriented around
the dependency infrastructure (DI):
<P>
-- Conventional warfare seeks victory by overwhelming or through
forcing a failure of the opposition's DI.
<P>
-- Manoeuvre warfare seeks victory by taking control of key elements
of the opposition's DI, essentially imparting control.
<P>
-- Guerrilla warfare orients around opportunistic attacks on the
opposition's DI, making the energy cost of conflict too great
to maintain.
<P>
-- Political warfare is control of the members of a political
economy through (establishment and) control of a DI, coupled with
media manipulation, propaganda.
<P>
-- Terrorism is a case of actions taken against the social contract
to attract media attention to a conflict when the media is (perceived
to be) controlled by the opposition.
<P>
A dependency infrastructure is composed of widely varied elements
of the social contract of the political economy--command-control
bodies, social services, education, the workings of an economy,
communication systems, spiritual leaders, anything that supports
the value chain of the phase, directly and collaterally.
<P>
Warfare, then, is about the control of the dependency infrastructure;
some forms of warfare need not require a single shot to be fired,
instead seeking victory through establishing control of the dependency
infrastructure. This cognitive tool explains many things:
<P>
-- Gandhi was successful in large part by his demonstration that
the infrastructure of the raj was actually in the control of the
Indian people (consent of the governed), and they reasserted themselves
in this fashion.
<P>
Other strategies of Gandhi bear study, including his self-creation
as a media symbol and deliberate infliction of harm upon that
symbol as a method of war, whether through his being arrested,
or fasting to the point of personal bodily harm.
<P>
-- The problem of Iraq for the West, post-Gulf War, is that the
Iraqi dependency infrastructure was left intact, and in the hands
of Saddam Hussein. This does not question the validity of the
conflict itself, which has been claimed to be in the 'national
interest.' The rule of thumb to see if something is a national
interest? Does it have an effect on your dependency infrastructure
to a dangerous degree. Any singular control of significant OPEC
resources can be viewed as a weapon in the making.
<P>
-- Social unrest occurs because of a failure of the dependency
infrastructure for those suspended and dependent inside it; riots
are a symptom of this problem, by people who suffer from a cultural
disease we have no name for.
<P>
-- The odd relationship the U.S. has with terror; access to the
free media market has become important to support for a cause,
while the blind eye the U.S. turns on certain issues makes it
a target. Any group who feels a media bias on an issue, Palestinians
versus Zionist occupation, Ireland versus United Kingdom
<P>
rule for example, will be caught trying to have it both ways.
<P>
-- The problems the U.S. faced in Viet Nam, such as the inability
to control a dependency infrastructure with air strikes, or the
total corruption of the allied infrastructure, driving anyone
adversely effected to the alternative infrastructure supplied
by the Viet Cong and NVA.
<P>
This cognitive tool also suggests a new form of warfare where
victory comes from the establishment of alternative dependency
infrastructures in a political economy, in conjunction with propaganda
efforts (which would be useful in the Former Soviet Union, Central
and South America, or North Africa for example).
<P>
Let me also add that it is going to be a serious failing in areas
such as Gaza/West Bank where no infrastructural development is
being undertaken, the greatest threat to peace in the region.
<P>
Following this chain of reasoning, even new areas of thought on
conflict make sense, such as the special case of information warfare--at
one end of a 'force spectrum' it can be used as a weapon of mass
destruction (WMD) just as nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons
which overwhelm the dependency infrastructure
<P>
of an opponent, and at the other end it can be used in guerrilla,
terror, or political warfare to selectively destroy or surreptitiously
control the dependency infrastructure. Seen on these terms, it
makes perfect sense in terms of doctrine; it also explains why
it is an increasing and soon to be critical threat to the nations
of the West.
<P>
Conflict in this 'advanced' world is not getting any easier. To
understand what is occurring in Bosnia or Somalia, you have to
put them in their context; to understand future conflicts, with
guerrillas, terrorists, propagandists, hackers, cyberpunks, et
al, we will have to search for the basic essence of conflict--because
only by understanding those basic principles will we be able to
prevent the world from falling apart around us, or at least not
be caught out by it when it does.

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
Maximizing the flow and control of information is key to competitiveness,
whether it be on the battlefield, in the marketplace, or on the
campaign trail.  An innovative tool and approach to planning and
managing intelligence or information in these very intense, time
sensitive environments is the &quot;war room&quot;. 
<P>
General Norman Schwarzkopf had a war room when he implemented
an end run around the Iraqi front lines and routed Saddam Hussein's
prized Republican Guards.  James Carville had one when he mapped
out Bill Clinton's strategy to win the Electoral College.  Ford
had one when they made the Taurus the best selling car in America.
 What they had in common was a central meeting area in which to
prepare, organize, and implement their efforts by having the decision-makers
visualize the situation (thus converting boardrooms into war rooms).
 Traditional war rooms are generally thought of as a conference
room dedicated to a group of individuals who are frantically pursuing
the solution to a difficult problem or engaged in a level of intense
activity.  Although useful, these rooms are not truly optimized
to their greatest potential and miss utilizing the symbiotic collection,
analysis, and dissemination components in a situation awareness
framework.  Moreover, they place a higher weight on technology
in formulating actions and narrowing decision gaps instead of
using human factors (i.e., experience, intuition).  This over
reliance increases the chances that wrong decisions will be made
if technologists are removed from the process and clearly identifies
key technology targets for adversaries.
<P>
<B>THE WARROOM</B>
<P>
The WarRoom  is basically an information-driven planning, presentation,
and edutainment facility designed to enable the most effective
and accountable decisions as possible from a variety of information
sources and virtual locations.  It supports an endless array of
domains and applications for government, commercial and educational
organizations.
<P>
The WarRoom has an embedded information processing capability
that permits a variety of multipartite information sources comprised
of textual, numerical, graphical, multimedia, and intelligence
formats for inter- or intra-organizational use.  This information
is routinely fused with other sources and displayed so as to not
<U> </U>influence a decision, but rather to present as much relevant
information as possible without the information clutter that is
experienced in typical government C3I facilities.  This is accomplished
using multivariate displays, texturizing techniques, and visualizing
information adjacent in space as opposed to stacked in time. 
This information design and display component of the WarRoom is
critical to the decision-making process, simply because default
briefing standards drive information dequantification (i.e., chartoons,
slideshows) and do not account for information causality.
<P>
Every WarRoom is divided into separate areas called 'caves' and
'commons' where specific synergistic functions are conducted.
 Each of these areas has multiple safeguards for ensuring appropriate
quality, relevance, and integrity of information.  At minimum,
caves are divided by collection, analysis, dissemination, and
security, but can be augmented for particular domains or applications.
 Commons are where self-directed work teams, or other work group
structures, collaborate to formulate proactive or reactive actions
based on the information 'piped' by each of the caves on density-rich
displays and printed materials.  This unique display approach
supports a variety of configurations based on the application
domain and physical constraints of the facility.  For example,
some WarRoom designs have three visualization walls per cave,
which are used to display and manage information, while other
designs have as many as ten.  Information can be manipulated via
several preferred interfaces (i.e., touchscreens, pointers, data
gloves) and is represented by domain specific graphical language
structures.
<P>
Considering that a WarRoom is a decision-support hub containing
sensitive information and processes, the security cave is responsible
for monitoring internal and external issues to ensure compartmentalization.
 Moreover, robust Information Systems Security, Operations Security,
and Competitive Intelligence programs have been developed for
WarRoom efforts and are highly recommended for implementation.
<P>
<B>HUMAN ELEMENT</B>
<P>
The human element is the most important factor in a WarRoom. 
This is why each WarRoom is ergonomically designed in order to
&quot;bring out the best&quot; in each of the team members.  WarRoom
Research is also developing technology associated with their Virtual
WarRoom  design.  It enables an individual operating from a small
office or home office (SOHO) or from some other remote location,
to be able to obtain three dimensional imagery, associated visualizations
and binaural sound which will replicate the information and information
flow and linkages derived from the confines of the other WarRoom
designs.  Interestingly enough, the security is not compromised
in this example, but does require expanded security measures.
<P>
Teams of creative, energetic people are the best possible tool
for which a company or governmental organization can tackle a
difficult problem.  The challenge is how to harness the synergy
of such people and maximize their potential as a group.  An initial
difficulty, is to give the group a common reference point as to
the nature of the problem or challenge.  To convey information,
teams traditionally use view graph presentations, or  project
information from a computer screen.  This mode of information
communication is serial in nature, enabling the viewer to consume
only one frame at a time. The beauty of the human mind is that
it allows for parallel thinking.  Although slow when compared
to the number crunching capability of the computer, the organic
brain can examine multiple discrete bits of information simultaneously,
and form various linkages and connections. Thus thought can lead
to learning and additional thought can be transformed into creativity
and inventiveness. The WarRoom enables an entire process to be
laid out in a framework which could never be captured on one screen
or slide.  The WarRoom provides a format for individuals within
the team to follow the whole process and logic train.  It enables
the linking of the myriad of different data sets depicting a complex
program or process.
<P>
<B>APPLICATIONS</B>
<P>
There are numerous applications for which a company or governmental
organization would use a WarRoom.  A team utilizing groupware
and various collaborative tools can lay out a WarRoom to reflect
a specific process, approach or activity.  Developing a strategic
plan and monitoring its implementation is one of the most useful
functions for a WarRoom. 
<P>
In addition to using a WarRoom for corporate business intelligence,
WarRoom Research is utilizing Portable WarRoom designs at conferences.
 These are set up in hotel rooms and are used to orchestrate what
is known as the Quarterback technique, which is a systematic and
focused collection at a conference from a well coordinated team.
 The WarRoom is used for command and control of the collection
efforts.  A WarRoom can also be used for mergers and acquisition
research, and for investment analysis.  For example, a government
organization trying to determine where it should invest its limited
resources in information warfare research and technology would
find the WarRoom of immense help. 
<P>
WarRoom designs enable individuals and teams to examine the totality
of the process and activity.  They can quickly follow the logic
train, find strengths and flaws.  If someone new is brought into
the room, and finds a certain shortcoming or gap, their input
or suggestion can be inserted on the wall, and find its place.
 Thus, the WarRoom can become a powerful advocacy tool, bringing
in others, co-opting their support by making them part of the
process.    
<P>
<B>INTELLIGENCE</B>
<P>
The old adage &quot;knowledge is power&quot; has never been more
true than in the so-called &quot;information age&quot; of  today.
 Information warfare is the means by which this power can be either
obtained or denied.  There is both a &quot;Yin and a Yang&quot;
side to harnessing information..  Success for large and medium
sized companies and agencies alike is increasingly dependent on
a timely awareness by key executives of rapidly changing events
outside the organization.  This is particularly true for organizations,
which are in the midst of a period of great transition, occurring
within a rapidly changing market, business and technological environment.
<P>
Most organizations are caught in a &quot;Catch-22&quot;.  To raise
their intelligence about opportunities, they become so involved
with gathering information that they're swamped by facts and figures.
 They have a hard time winnowing the important from the trivial.
 With this in mind, a growing number of companies are developing
a new management tool called &quot;Business Intelligence Systems&quot;
(BIS).  Business intelligence is not industrial espionage.  It
is a legal, ethical and smart approach to collecting, analyzing
and disseminating information which influences senior decision-making.
 Some companies refer to a portion of this activity as &quot;competitor
intelligence.&quot;  Business Intelligence is more inclusive and
takes into account competitors as well as collecting and analyzing
on customers, emerging technologies, regulations, budgets and
funding, etc. (i.e. the total environment impacting business).
<P>
Foreign competitors who are either owned or subsidized by their
national governments as well as the national governments who support
them, know full well the competitive advantage of an organized
intelligence program.  American firms are only beginning to discover
the powerful knowledge based management tool of a business intelligence
system.  Those corporations that are willing to take on the challenge
of developing and using their own business intelligence system,
are most likely to be the successful companies on into the 21st
Century.
<P>
In most corporate settings, executives are working with massive
amounts of raw data, small amounts of value-added information
derived from analysis, and very little intelligence.  A BIS reverses
this by shifting the focus from data to intelligence to support
the senior management.  Developing a BIS for a company involves
a form of &quot;intelligence engineering&quot;.  If one envisions
a pyramid hierarchy of information, the bottom level would be
considered data.  This information often is well known and often
&quot;stale&quot;, (i.e. too late to capitalize on).  The next
level is information, which has the value added by being analyzed
data.  At the apex of the pyramid is intelligence.  Intelligence
is information which is &quot;actionable&quot; by the key decision-maker
and has foresight.  It responds to the executive's informational
needs and leads to a decision.  Executives should be working primarily
with intelligence and less with raw data.<HR>

new challenges face us both as a nation and as part of the global
community. Definitions of how people and nations relate, communicate,
and conduct daily business are being redefined at the most fundamental
levels. What once could only be achieved through the labor of
hundreds backed with government financing can now be accomplished
by a skilled individual supported by the commercially-available
and affordable technology of today. Indeed, the technological
revolution of the past twenty years has positioned the United
States as one of the key leaders of the technological charge into
the next millennium.
<P>
 Almost century ago, this same situation faced European nations
regarding the conduct of war. New technology brought war to a
higher level of destructiveness and expanded the battlefield far
beyond the soldier's line of sight. However, the critical shortcoming
during the years of the First World War was the inability of each
side to improvise, adapt, and replace their failing war plans
with a new doctrine that reflected the offensive potential of
emerging technologies and tactics <I>and</I> provide for the defense
of friendly forces against similar technology and tactics used
by the enemy. The result was a traditional General Staff mindset
on all sides of fighting the current war based on the successes
of the last. 
<P>
Like World War I, contemporary military technology moves the application
of force on the battlefield to a new level of destructiveness
through the improved communications technology of today. However,
unlike World War I, the impact of technology on war today - and
the creation of a new military environment - changes the very
nature, conduct, and fundamental definition of war. In these last
remaining years of the twentieth century, there are sweeping changes
in global society resulting from advances in technology and information
management. Of a singular significance is the INTERNET, the 1967
Department of Defense computer network that evolved from a United
States government network to an anarchic worldwide commercial
&quot;network of networks&quot; with no controlling authority.
This single piece of technology has given the general public the
ability to exchange instantly detailed amounts of information
anywhere in the world - a capability formerly held exclusively
by the military. Ultimately, such increases in communications
technology (the &quot;Communications Revolution&quot;) creates
substantial problems for the military planners. This paper will
examine this new threat and highly unconventional military environment,
discussing the challenges facing the tactical and strategic military
environments as they conduct operations in the Fifth Dimension
of Warfare.
<P>
Information has always been a two-edged sword. It can help allies,
confuse enemies, and yet backfire on both. The past twenty years
has seen fantastic innovation in both battlefield and warroom
communication technologies. Commanders at all levels are now being
provided instant access to increasing amounts of information,
including near-real-time intelligence, manning rosters, weather
forecasts, and battlefield targeting data - in addition to remote
communication down to the individual soldier level --  through
the use of miniature computers, remote sensing, and the constantly-evolving
products of military engineers from the industrial base. This
rapid and direct nature of battlefield communication allows commanders
to sustain the momentum of the attack and subsequently attempt
to direct the Clausewitzian dynamic of war in ways previously
thought impossible. One example is the U.S. Army's Advanced Deep
Operations Coordination System, or ADOCS. This is a major communications
component that corps commanders use to coordinate the combined
operations of Army and Air Force units in conducting deep operations.
<P>
Electronic materials and mediums such as the INTERNET, on-line
databases, telecommunications, and other such services drive the
modern world. Such instant-communications technology also drives
large business. The &quot;virtual office&quot; lets five people
over a scattered area do the work of twenty. This technology allows
students and authors to research papers or books via any of several
on-line resources and databases.  This technology allows banks
to instantly transfer money between accounts. This technology
allows private individuals to communicate so securely that even
the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation
are concerned about their ability to respond in the interest of
national security and law enforcement. It is also this technology
that allows people - criminals, drug dealers, intelligence organizations,
among others - to communicate with their associates around the
world in the latest plot to achieve their illicit goals.
<P>
Just as the combatants of World War I faced the new threats of
 emerging military technology and had to redesign their strategic
and tactical doctrines to meet these challenges, the same circumstances
exist today - and the enemy is far more dangerous, devious, and
clandestine than simply a new piece of military hardware on the
battlefield. The threat today descends from the Communications
Revolution of the 1980s with the advent of instant-communications
and data-retrieval technologies. Now, the line between military
and civilian information technology has become blurred, and a
race is on to determine the size, complexity, and ramifications
of this global, electronic, civil-military information environment.

<B> Tactical Considerations of Information Operations</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;Information-based Warfare is an approach to armed conflict
focusing on the management and use of information in all its forms
and at all levels to achieve a decisive military advantage especially
in the joint and combined environment. Information-based Warfare
is both offensive and defensive in nature -- ranging from measures
that prohibit the enemy from exploiting information to corresponding
measures to assure the integrity, availability, and interoperability
of friendly information assets.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>- National Defense University (Excerpt of Working Definition)
</I>
<P>
The ability to disseminate and exchange information anywhere in
the world instantly has brought war to a new, more abstract and
challenging level.  The &quot;battlespace&quot; replaces the &quot;battlefield&quot;,
a term that encompasses the physical environment of war and includes
the newly-found (but barely-charted) zone of C4 warfare or &quot;cyberspace&quot;.
War plans -- Command and Control - are now instantly Communicated
via Computers to their destination. This provides a commander
the ability to react instantly to new changes, Murphy's Law, and
the Fog of War  from anywhere in the world, thus directing the
war's dynamic and hopefully sustaining the momentum of the engagement
toward victory.
<P>
Information has always driven a war -- campaigns waged by two
or more entities on a battlefield with heavy weaponry, many casualties,
and reliance on the wisdom of the commanding general. War is still
the movement of forces to engage and overcome the enemy, [with
the overwhelming application of firepower] however, today's military
environment is driven more by information exchange at all levels
of battlespace command than by tactics or the wisdom of a single
general or his staff. Even the very essence of war - <I>battles
</I> fought by soldiers with <I>weapons</I> - has evolved to a
highly unconventional environment that knows no limits or boundaries;
an environment where &quot;force&quot; or military-initiated efforts
can be directed to a specific target (military or civilian) at
a specific time and with a new series of weapons designed specifically
for this new threat.
<P>
Disruption of the battlefield C4I infrastructure would most likely
create sufficient havoc to allow an enemy the advantage and possibly
achieve victory. Disruption or (preferably) denial of service
of key information services is the primary goal of information
warfare. Naturally, both sides will attempt this action, and the
first to do so successfully gains the tactical advantage. In the
opening rounds of Operation DESERT STORM, a successful 'communications
attack' against Iraq resulted in both the enemy's inability to
detect and coordinate a defense against the first wave of Allied
strike aircraft and our subsequent first-strike successes on 16
January 1991. This was done with specially-modified weaponry that
physically destroyed the internal circuitry of Iraqi C2 systems,
thus preventing enemy defenses from both detecting and responding
to the coalition air attack <I>and</I> from warning Baghdad. Thus,
Saddam Hussein was seriously hindered from coordinating a strong
Iraqi defense (rumor has it that he did not know where his forces
were, let alone those of the coalition!) by forcing him to use
sub-normal modes of communication.
<P>
Even during the American Civil War, the wide-spread use of, and
reliance on, the  telegraph by the Union for tactical communications
required sizable resources to protect the 15,000 miles of cabling
from attack by the Rebel forces. By the end of the war, over half
the  Union Army was deployed in defensive positions around such
vital lines of communication. Had these telegraph cables - carrying
some 3,300 coded messages daily - been severed, there would have
been an unprecedented level of C2-related confusion at all levels
in the Union Army, and the outcome of the war might have been
drastically altered. This was defensive information warfare waged
over a hundred years ago, with inferior and less reliable technology
than today's modern systems.
<P>
This radical change in the battle environment creates a major
issue in establishing an all-encompassing definition for this
new type of warfare. In the past, &quot;warfare&quot; connotated
physical violence against two opposing combatants using military
weaponry - gunpowder, tanks, or missiles - to win a battle through
the effective use of force and maneuver. This is most evident
in the writings of the leading scholar of the military arts, Prussian
Karl von Clausewitz. His opus <U>On War</U> describes in painstaking
detail how to wage a war of industry - where such war materiel
mentioned above were the primary tools in achieving a decisive
victory. It is his doctrine that permeates and dominates many
Western military schools of thought, including the United States.
Unfortunately, in an information operation, the definition of
a &quot;war&quot; expands to include a larger spectrum of conflicts,
complete with many new combatants and the application of new weaponry
in a non-physical military environment. Soldiers are now faced
with the challenge of applying conventional information technology
- computers and keyboards - in an unconventional military environment
to counter traditional military technologies and tactics.
<P>
Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Windhall and USAF Chief of Staff
General Ronald Fogelman describe this essence of war in their
shared publication &quot;Cornerstones of Information Warfare&quot;.
They see information warfare as means to an end for both strategic
and tactical purposes. While published from an Air Force perspective,
the logic and examples are applicable to all military services
and civilian organizations:
<P>
<I>Information warfare is any attack against an information function,
regardless of the means. Bombing a telephone switching facility
is information warfare. <B>So is destroying the switching facility's
software</B></I><B>. </B>(Author's emphasis)
<P>
<I>Information warfare is any action to protect our information
functions, regardless of the means. Hardening and defending the
switching facility against air attack is information warfare.
<B>So is using an anti-virus program to protect the facility's
software. </B></I>(Author's Emphasis<I>)</I>
<P>
Conducting information operations using conventional military
weaponry and doctrine worked well in the past, during situations
where the available technology did not allow a &quot;softer&quot;
method of attack, such as destroying an enemy's communications
facility by air attack. A computer virus that causes an enemy's
military C2 systems to falter achieves the same result as a bombing,
but without physical violence or destruction. Thus, a<I> </I>&quot;soft&quot;
attack provides the same result but with a noticeable absence
of violence, physical harm, or destruction. This subsequently
brings war - the application of force - to a new level of effectiveness
through the use of non-lethal technology, a by-product of information
warfare.

The ongoing threat lies in the strategic implications of Information
Warfare. During World War II, the conduct of strategic bombing
operations against Germany's industrial complex undermined their
war effort at home - now the government leaders contended with
civil unrest, failing industry, and food shortages in addition
to their already complicated war efforts against the Allies on
two fronts. Likewise, the German V-series of  &quot;terror bombs&quot;
showered random destruction on the innocent civilians of England.
Later, in the Vietnam conflict, the Vietcong used hidden agents
to wreak social havoc and create social unrest in the South Vietnamese
civilian population. Since these &quot;plants&quot; could not
be easily distinguished from the natives and appear at any time,
this hidden threat remained an effective terror weapon during
the war. In the continuing saga of Middle East relations during
the 1980s, hijackings and aircraft bombings prompted the civilian
populace of the West to pressure the government for action and
defense against these indiscriminate acts of violence or war.
In today's information society, a logic bomb placed on a key information-processing
system is an effective method to cause civic unrest and function
as an Information Age terror weapon.
<P>
Clausewitz's Trinity of War describes the role of the People -
civilians and society at large - in the overall national security
effort. With civil unrest, a government will be unable to devote
full attention to an external military action as it must also
contend with an internal and quite angry civilian populace. As
stated, computers, information, and the speed by which it is communicated
in that void known as cyberspace drives today's society. This
new environment encompasses the military and civilian C3 infrastructure.
Phone and television services, traffic signals, subway systems,
financial institutions, and government communications - to name
a few - are now run by computers in a semi-autonomous manner.
However, this electronic Maginot Line of internetworked systems
that provides critical strategic services to the nation will grind
to a halt if a key electronic artery is cut or attacked. Jamming
one of the dozens of communication satellites that supports the
world information infrastructure is one example of such activity.
Along the many roads in America, one can see a sign that reads
&quot;CAUTION - BURIED CABLE&quot;. To a hostile information warrior,
this sign is a welcome sight and just as easily reads &quot;BURIED
CABLE -- CUT HERE.&quot;
<P>
Renowned author Tom Clancy's book series included a novel about
just such an event. In <U>Debt of Honor</U>, a virus was released
into the financial network of America with disastrous results
to the stock market and global economics. While fictitious, such
a situation could be created by a foreign nation, organized crime
group, or terrorist organization as a tool for blackmail or a
prelude for a larger, more widespread aggression. In a 1993 lecture
in France, Robert Steele, the leading world advocate of Information
awareness programs remarked to a collection of French military
leaders that 
<P>
I can destroy any major nation in 24 hours with one platoon of
knowledge warriors and make billions of dollars on the international
market by doing so, because I will know when this is going to
happen and invest accordingly.
<P>
Winn Schwartau, author of <U>Chaos: War on the Information Superhighway
</U>, is the leading civilian thinker on the subject of information
warfare and offensive information operations. His detailed discussions
about such attacks and our current inability to defend against
them bring shocked looks to his audiences' faces. His testimonies
on Capitol Hill have been met with equal disbelief. He sadly -
but correctly -  observes that today's world seems to dictate
that &quot;the computer is right&quot; - and whatever information
the computer presents - credit reports, school or police records,
 and financial portfolios - is taken as fact. Imagine the chaos
caused by a hostile organization conducting this type of offensive
information operation on a broad-scale. This has been dramatized
in recent movies and books, but this is a real threat - and does
not happen only on the battlefield operation between opposing
military units, but from one or more private individuals against
others from anywhere in the world.
<P>
 Crashing the stock market is a favorite strategic &quot;what-if&quot;
by amateurs attempting to describe the potential of offensive
strategic information warfare (OSIW), and will not be discussed
here - the global implications of a breakdown in financial information
systems are fairly well-known. Furthermore, a public misperception
is that information warfare is limited to computers, and conducted
<I>only</I> by computers. I propose the following hypothetical
situations demonstrating five OSIW attacks, some of which are
not solely computer-based (Author's comments in italics):
<UL>
<LI><B>Train Derailments or Air Traffic Control Mishaps</B>: 
In February 1996, a commuter train collided with an Amtrak passenger
train just outside of Washington, D.C. The current analysis points
to faulty signals that gave a &quot;false proceed&quot; message
to the conductor of the commuter train, who proceeded on the assumption
that the signal was correct and he was clear to speed up. This
particular railroad signal system was controlled from a nationwide
control center in Tampa, Florida through the use of high-speed
computer networks. The result of this faulty signal were twelve
passengers killed by fire, many more injured, the repair costs
for the trains involved in the collision, and the time spent on
the federal investigation of the crash and signal system. Likewise,
western air traffic control systems are computer-controlled to
relieve the work burden of human controllers. Seeing the problems
associated when these systems fail because of mechanical reasons
raises some interesting questions. <I>We're scared enough when
something breaks down under normal circumstances. What if such
computer-control systems were infiltrated, destroyed, or changed
in an intentional nationwide OSIW attack?</I>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Traffic Signals and Power Grids</B>: In the latter part
of 1995, a school bus in Illinois was damaged by a speeding freight
train and several elementary school students were killed. This
time, the cause was  a faulty traffic signal on the road crossing
the railroad tracks, which the school bus driver naturally followed.
<I>We use the roadways to commute and travel. Millions of innocent
people are exposed and are potential targets to an OSIW attack
on local traffic-control networks</I>.  Blizzards, hurricanes,
and tornadoes cause power outages each year, and we all know how
annoying, troublesome, and in some cases, life-threatening they
can be. <I>An OSIW attack could bring down power grids down and
paralyze a city. Simply bomb the power plants and a few substations,
and you've effectively shut down a metropolis - along with its
computers, most communications mediums, and a majority of economic
resources; shops, businesses, corporations, and government buildings
would close. Such a circumstance is what I refer to as &quot;Functional
Paralysis&quot;, or a sizable Denial of Service.</I>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Mass Media</B>: We read the paper and watch the news daily.
Through the use of a personal computer and some common commercial
software, an information warrior can electronically edit (morph)
pictures and video. Imagine the many implications if Saddam Hussein
was portrayed on Iraqi television sitting down to a state dinner
with a glass of wine, roast ham, and buxom women surrounding him?
<I>All it takes is video editing equipment to receive the actual
signal and broadcast the doctored one on the same frequency in
real-time. My mother always told me to &quot;believe half of what
you see, and absolutely nothing that you simply hear&quot;. </I>This
is sound advice for a society that can alter reality (<I>or, given
the media-driven world today, the &quot;perception of&quot; reality
</I>) with a keyboard and mouse. Edited pictures of the President,
First Lady, and other public figures in compromising situations
have already circulated around the world on the INTERNET. <I>How
many edited pictures have appeared on the front page of leading
Western newspapers already -- and subsequently accepted as &quot;fact&quot;?
</I>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>EMP Attacks:</B>  During the Cold War, there was substantial
civil defense preparation for potential Soviet attacks that consisted
of atomic devices detonated at a certain altitude over the United
States. The resulting blast of electromagnetic energy would literally
and physically &quot;fry&quot; electronics, circuit boards, computer
chips, and any other electronic item. Such weaponry exists today
in terms of a directed-EMP that can be focused on a certain target
within a certain range. <I>Given the many instances of suicide
bombings associated with terrorism, using trucks (or even remote-controlled
rockets and aircraft), picture a situation where a hostile organization
was able to physically destroy a regional electronics infrastructure
by using only a few precisely-placed atomic weapons. The result?
Functional Paralysis through Nuclear Terrorism.</I>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Electronic Assassination</B>: Picture the surprise - you
attempt to get a new drivers' license or open a bank account only
to find out the computer has you listed as having been dead for
five years! Or that you have been arrested for prostitution, drug-related
crimes, and are badly in debt. Perhaps your employment record
shows you having never graduated high school, but yet you are
working as an engineer for a major corporation? &quot;<I>Sneakers&quot;
was a good movie, but presented some interesting and very real
threats. Anyone with a computer, modem, and some common sense
can do some very real damage to others. Again, I agree with the
&quot;old timers&quot; who still keep receipts, invoices, and
other important documents in the family safe  - not that they
don't trust computers, they don't trust the data on them or how
it's used. Today's large corporations and banks rely on computer
databases for record-keeping. Modify that information, and you've
changed the electronic life of a living, breathing person.</I>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 The threat is real and quite verifiable - just not seen as 'practical'
for anything but the silver screen. It has many components - computers,
modems, networks, hackers/crackers, cypherpunks, the new professions
of Information Security, and prompted a revision of the aging
Telecommunications Act (recently passed by Congress amid controversy
over free speech and public assembly rights.) The harbinger of
this threat might be another country, intelligence establishment,
terrorist group, organized criminal activity, or it may be the
young professional across the hall in your apartment complex working
for such an entity. &quot;Knowledge Warriors&quot; are those who
have been reared during the Communications Revolution and are
able to navigate the endless numbers of networks and databases
with ease. Information Warriors, Knowledge Warriors, Competitive
Intelligence Specialists - the names are relatively the same.
All are able to find whatever they seek. Some are able to carry
out successful OSIW operations at the request of their employer.
All seem to make good money doing it.
<P>
During my last undergraduate year, I witnessed the ease of information
exchange and how it might benefit the intelligence community.
From my dormitory room, I was using a real-time &quot;chat&quot;
service on the Internet known as IRC (Internet Relay Chat) to
converse with a sixteen-year-old student in Sarejevo who watched
&quot;tanks rolling down my [sic] street...lots of soldiers walking
and shouting outside...&quot; Those of us on this particular &quot;chat&quot;
service felt as though we were reading a modern techno-thriller
instead of participating in an online discussion. Perhaps during
future conflicts, this type of real-time information will prove
vital in an unconventional information environment. -  conducted
by those on-site and <I>without military training or experience.
</I>
<P>
 The key problem with strategic information warfare is that <B>it
is easy to do</B>. As noted, anyone with a computer or access
to a network can search for, retrieve, or delete data on another
network from anywhere in the world using any number of techniques
ranging from on-line tools such as viruses, Trojan Horses in addition
to traditional weapons like bombs, and jamming devices. And since
the global information infrastructure has redefined the concepts
of a &quot;border&quot; and national sovereignty, a Knowledge
Warrior can easily cross into another nation electronically to
accomplish what formerly had to be done in person at great risk.
Further, since there 
<P>
are no front lines or &quot;areas of (information) operations,&quot;
anyone from anywhere can conduct information search, retrieval,
or destroy operations. Indeed, the Shakespearean paradox has come
true, for today, &quot;all the world's a stage&quot; upon which
IW operators act.

</U>(1987)</I>
<P>
 Based on the reliance on information and information technology
to drive both our military and civilian environments, there currently
is a concerted effort to design, implement, and coordinate an
Information Strategy that provides for a strong defense of national
information interests. In my judgment, there are three key areas
that must be addressed by leadership in both areas with regard
to the security of information.
<P>
 <B>Operation</B>: Implement INFOSEC measures and provide systemic
and infrastructure redundancies at all levels in the event of
an offensive information attack. This needs to be done in both
the military and civilian arenas. As noted, each of these two
areas is information-driven and subsequently vulnerable to intentional
&quot;accidents&quot; or mishaps.
<P>
 <B>Legislation</B>: Congress and the Executive Branch must agree
on formal regulation and definitions of Information Warfare and
Security. Funding and political support must be allocated to those
organizations charged with designing information safeguards for
our military and civilian environments. Organizations - both defense
(such as NSA and the individual service organizations working
the IW issue) and civilian (such as NIST) - must be comfortable
in communicating openly between each other, with a minimum amount
of &quot;required&quot; classification. (As information technology
becomes even more available and essential to the private sector,
there is less disparity between &quot;military&quot; and &quot;civilian&quot;
information assets, products, and capabilities.)
<P>
 <B>Education</B>: Common sense and user awareness drives information
security. Unfortunately, while one cannot mandate common sense
as a national agenda, there can be measures taken to improve the
situation/technological awareness for the legislators paving the
way for the development of an Information Infrastructure, the
leaders in both military and civilian sectors responsible for
coordinating these information operations, and the end users -
military specialists, civilian office workers, and John Q. Public
- who are responsible for day-to-day information operations and
who stand the most to loose if subjected to an information attack.
Education and knowledge are paramount - given the &quot;virtuality&quot;
of today's society, its members must be able to separate fact
from fiction by their own intuition and sense, and not from the
overtly-misleading media of today. What people see must not always
be taken as &quot;fact.&quot; As was commonly heard in Washington
during the Reagan-Gorbachev years, &quot;Trust, (or believe) but
verify.&quot;
<P>
 As a descriptor in the opening paragraphs of this paper, I refer
to Information Warfare as a form of <I>unconventional warfare
</I>. It is. Not only is it a new type of offensive tactic we
must defend against and develop our own offensive tactics for,
but it is not fought in the &quot;conventional&quot; method with
tanks, bullets, and ships in a theater, in a traditional military
environment on a &quot;battlefield&quot;. The IW theater is the
world, with no front lines, trenches, or advances. It is fought
primarily with keyboards, computers, networks, and information
against not simply a military targets, but strategic, civilian
ones as well. Operations are conducted in the realm of cyberspace
- in a military environment this is called &quot;battlespace&quot;.
This new environment includes foreign relations, communications,
domestic law enforcement, and military organizations as key players
in this new cyberspace environment. The leaders of this new type
of warfare are the young specialists - civilian and military -
who have grown up among this explosion of information technology.
It is only recently that our traditional thinkers in the military
have begun seriously devoting resources to examining the threat
of information warfare in an effort to determine the size and
complexity of this new environment.
<P>
 As members of the most elite military in the world, we must continue
to harness this new technology and consider the military implications
this new environment brings to our current doctrine. We must insure
doctrine remains dynamic - ready to change and adapt to emerging
trends in technology, tactics, and thought. Remember the history
associated with new technology and both sides' inability to adapt
existing doctrine to meet the new threats on the battlefield during
World War I. This is a singular lesson we must not forget as we
approach the new century and this new battle environment. As members
of the most information-driven society in the world, we must guard
against the misuse of information technology in a strategic information
attack against civilians in general. We are living and working
in  a dynamic, new, world - as its leaders, we have an interesting
and challenging job in charting and exploring this new environment.

<H4>1. 	Introduction</H4>

Changes in the world political scene, a requirement to reduce military spending and consequential changes in force structures are identified as major factors leading to a reduction in the number of major military exercises. The resultant problems appear to be particularly acute for Higher Level Commanders. Hence, it is necessary to review training requirements and the current and future facilities to meet these requirements. Two parallel research studies, sponsored by the Deputy Chief Scientist within the UK MOD, have been initiated to address: the training requirement of 4* Joint and 2/3* Joint Force Commanders; and the development/utility of High Level Wargaming of joint and combined operations in establishing operational and equipment concepts, training Higher Level Officers and the derivation, exercise and assessment of operational plans, concepts of operation and doctrine. This Paper provides an overview of the development and application of the UK High Level Wargaming Facility (HLWF) to meet the requirements for this latter study and it also provides an indication of future research required to support high level wargaming and Synthetic Environments (SE's).<P>

<h4>2.	Background</H4>
2.1 	A research area has been initiated by the UK Ministry of Defence to define more precisely those military functions or areas in which wargaming, at the higher level of command, could be best employed and the nature and size of gains to be obtained. The research study is sponsored by Deputy Chief Scientist with associate customers of  Director Joint Warfare (DJW), Directorate of Naval Staff Duties (DNSD), Director General Development and Doctrine (DGD&D) and the Director General Air Force Staff Duties (DGAFSD). The study is addressing the following key areas:<P>
a. Human Factor Aspects of Wargaming. This forms the major scientific focus within the study, and is divided into a number of main areas - investigation and analysis of the higher level wargaming process, execution and assessment; higher level decision making, performance influences and effectiveness of teams.<P>
b. Development of a Research Facility. Wargaming can provide the opportunity to study issues in a controlled, reproducible environment, if supported by an instrumented  facility. The High Level Wargaming Facility  is being developed to :<P>
-  Support the seminar method of wargaming and Mission Rehearsal for higher command (4*) and their support staff.<P>
- Allow the research programme to determine more accurately the requirements for Higher Command Wargaming.<P>
-  Assess the utility of wargaming in both joint and combined operations.<P>
- Assess the impact of operational effectiveness on higher command and control training.<P>
c. Interoperability. This part of the study is designed to demonstrate tri service and combined capabilities and interoperability with our allies.<P>

<h4>3	Development/ Utility of the High Level Wargaming Facility</H4>
3.1	Overview of The UK High Level Wargaming Facility - Figure 1<P>
	The High Level Wargaming Facility  is being developed within the Centre for Defence Analysis of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency at Portsdown, UK. An initial set of requirements for the High Level Wargaming Facility have been determined and the following approaches have now been adopted to meet these requirements:<P>
3.2	Approaches to Meet HLWF Requirements - Figure 2<P>
3.2.1	The UK HLWF primarily comprises two elements:<P>
A Wargame Design and Planning Tool<P>
-	A computer IT system for the rapid design and evaluation of wargames.<P>
A Wargame Information System<P>
-	Developed on Sun SPARCStations in C++ code according to the principles of object orientated programming. <P>
-	Encyclopaedic/Geographic databases. Global geographic data is available from an augmented and rendered version of the commercially available Digital Chart of the World. A major encyclopaedic database provides the game designers and players with platform, sensor and weapon data. To aid the game designer in Wargame scenario generation, the encyclopaedic database includes information on nations orders of battle, political data, religious data and social data. The database is being trial populated as part of a UK/USA collaborative agreement.<P>
-	User-friendly Graphical User Interface to provide human interaction with the system through a graphical interface built with Xview routines.<P>
-	Message handling facility which incorporates a full audit trail.<P>
-	Integrated maritime, land and air simulations are planned to be included which will provide comprehensive modelling of platform behaviour and the incorporation of models of the lower level command decision making process in order to reduce the number of human operators necessary for game play.<P>
-	Networked using the Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP). The  provision of a flexible, multi-warfare capability can be obtained by linking the HLWF to other detailed simulations in the land, air and other warfare areas using ALSP.<P>
3.2.2	The HLWF is being built to a Quality Plan (based on BS 5750/ISO9000), is under configuration control and is subject to a defined and phased Validation and Verification approach.<P>
3.2.3	Figures 3 and 4 show a number of windows of the HLWF which illustrate the type and format of information which can be made available during the wargame design and execution process or in the Military Crisis Management process<P>
3.3	Wargame Training/Simulation Hierarchy - Figure 5<P>
3.3.1	Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), the Aggregate Level Simulation (ALSP) and the supporting technologies now provide a capability for simulations to be linked to provide platform/weapon system evaluation, training and wargaming facilities from the strategic to the operator level and to accurately represent the human dimension in warfare.	<P>
3.3.2	The provision of a powerful, flexible Tri-Service facility can be obtained by networking the core of the UK HLWF to other detailed maritime, air and land simulations/wargames via the ALSP protocol, as illustrated in Figure 5. These simulations/wargames can be part of a UK confederation or networked to USA or NATO/European confederations They can comprise live, constructive or virtual elements and operate at the strategic, operational or detailed tactical level. In practice, it is considered that only two different levels of command are likely to be exercised or trained simultaneously. However, this approach provides flexibility and the ability to train sequentially different command levels to a common basis.<P>
<h4>3.4	Collaborative Programmes - Figure 6</H4>
	In order to investigate and demonstrate the advantages and technical requirements of networking the UK HLWF to simulations and wargames at different levels of command and across different warfare areas, three collaborative programmes have been initiated.<P>
3.4.1	Internal DRA Interoperability Programme<P>
	This programme involves the DERA sites at Portsdown, Fort Halstead and Malvern in the UK and will network the HLWF to a research version of ABACUS (a training simulation which is being procured for the UK army) and an air simulation called the Total System Model.<P>
3.4.2	UK/USA Collaborative Programme<P>
3.4.2.1	A UK/USA Memorandum of Agreement, the High Level Simulation Protocol (HLSP), has been initiated. This MOA involves DERA Portsdown, the USA Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Centre  at San Diego and the USA Naval War College at Newport. The MOA provides the umbrella for two networking experiments (the first experiment was undertaken in May 1995 and the second experiment is scheduled for 1996), the phased evaluation of the UK HLWF and the population/maintenance of encyclopaedic databases.<P>
3.4.2.2	Objectives of the DRA/NRAD HLSP Collaborative Programme<P>
	a. The specific objectives of the DRA/NRAD HLSP Collaborative Programme are:<P>
-	To investigate the use and application of ALSP for networking heterogeneous wargaming simulations.<P>
-	To establish ALSP confederation/s for networking USA and UK wargaming simulations.<P>
-	To demonstrate the technology for conducting Tri-Service strategic and tactical wargames at a classified level.<P>
-	To investigate sharing of UK and USA resources to populate/maintain the HLWF database.<P>
3.4.2.3	The UK/USA Phase I  Experiment, May 1995 <P>
	a. A schematic of the UK/USA HLSP Interoperability Experiment that was conducted is shown in Figure 7. The experiment consisted of linking the HLWF to NRAD's Research Evaluation and Systems Analysis (RESA) maritime simulation via ALSP and using RESA's Message Generator to network to a UK Aircraft Carrier via JOTS terminals. A Video conferencing facility was also set up between the UK Aircraft Carrier and the wargaming centre at DERA Portsdown to investigate how the Military Crisis Management process could be conducted using this networked facility.<P>
b. The experiment consisted of demonstrating how the Military Crisis Management process could be conducted, monitored and controlled using information supplied from  a system such as the HLWF. The Military Crisis Management process and the role of a system such as the HLWF is shown in Figure 8. In conducting the Military Estimation process, information from the HLWF could be supplied on Aims and Factors to assist the high level commander and his team in determining Considerations and arriving at a Command Decision. Lower Level Models, Planning and Analysis Tools and What-If Capabilities networked to the HLWF can also a provide detailed information to assist in this task. Military plans can then be developed with this information and disseminated to other HQ's, Command Centres, Platforms or Wargaming Centres and then interactively monitored or controlled by these Centres and Platforms during the operation.<P>
	<P>
3.4.2.4	The UK/USA HLSP Interoperability Experiment, 1996 - Figure 9<P>
	a. A more ambitious experiment is scheduled under the HLSP collaborative programme for 1996. The HLWF will be networked via ALSP  to the USA Marine Tactical Warfare Simulation (MTWS). It is proposed also to link the HLWF to a confederation of other UK simulations/wargames (ABACUS and TSM) and to other live/constructive elements of  Trainers/Simulators and to the Operational Centre at Northwood.<P>
	<P>
3.4.3	The UK/NATO CAX Collaborative Programme<P>
3.4.3.1	The requirement for computer support for exercises by NATO forces was highlighted for the first time during the ACE 89 exercises which demonstrated the advantages of exercises in a simulated dynamic and interactive environment. ACE 89 exercise also showed the need for the capability to link simulations to the Command and Control Information System, to enable staffs to work in their command posts with their usual tools. SHAPE initiated the Computer Assisted Exercise (CAX) project in 1991 at the STC which was asked to prepare computer assisted exercises and to specify the tools to meet CAX requirements for the Allied Command Europe as described in the Military Requirement for CAX.<P>
3.4.3.2	To enable the currently available simulation models to be used to meet the CAX requirement, SHAPE has initiated a Multinational Working Group and has initiated a Multi-National Test Bed (MNTB) of operational environment simulations to study existing simulation models and how far they complement each other, to identify necessary developments and to suggest an approach to support model interoperability. The DRA at Portsdown is playing an active role in the development of the MNTB. The UK HLWF has been chosen as the maritime component of the MNTB.<P>
3.4.3.3	Figure 10 shows the confederation of simulations forming the MNTB. The UK HLWF  interfaces with the Joint Theatre Level Simulation JTLS model (Supply), MOVESIM (operational movement of forces), KORA (which simulates the direct and indirect fire of troops, helicopters and air defence) and KIBOWI (a battalion/brigade level training wargame).<P>
3.4.3.4	The High Level Wargaming Facility has been successfully integrated into the Multi National confederation of five models/simulations to form the Multi National Test Bed for NATO CAX at the SHAPE Technical Centre. The first Multi National Test Bed Experiment (MNTBEX 95/1) was held over the period 22 May 1995 to 1 June 1995. This demonstrated the potential of a coalition of models to provide cost-effective computer support to multi-national exercises for NATO CAX.<P>
<h4>3.5	Supporting Strategic Research</H4>

3.5.1	Specific strategic research programmes have now been initiated by the UK MOD which provide support to the development of the HLWF. In 1994 a strategic research  study was initiated to identify and solve the challenging technical issues associated with synthetic environments and networking real time man-in-the-loop simulations. The  programme was structured initially to provide the infrastructure for and to open up UK research into Advanced Interactive Simulation (ADINTSIM). This was achieved by creating a research network across the main DRA sites as a test bed for investigation and demonstration of ADINTSIM techniques, and identification of those areas requiring priority research under the programme.<P>

3.5.2 	The following five priority items of research, illustrated in Figure 11, are now being pursued under this programme: <P>

- Parallel Multi-Agent AI Simulation. To investigate and develop an integrated intelligent object orientated simulation environment capability with high performance parallel machines.<P>

- Future Networking Technology. To investigate and develop future networking and networking technology requirements for distributed simulation in the UK.<P>

- Aggregation/Disaggregation of Simulation Entities. To develop AI techniques for aggregation and disaggregation, building from advanced entity-level rule bases.<P>

- Database Correlation. To investigate and develop novel methods of manipulating photograph source data to ensure that captured cultural information is correlated with standard source databases.<P>

- Verification, Validation and Accreditation of Networked Simulations. To investigate the advanced specification of remote access simulator interfaces, in order to; improve the verification, validation and accreditation procedures for DIS systems, and to provide multi-level access interfaces which address the issue of aggregation within DIS systems.<P>
<h4>4	Advanced Interactive Simulation</H4>

<h2><center>The Information Warfare Challenges of a National Information Infrastructure</H2>

by Ronald Knecht  and  Ronald A. Gove, Ph.D.<BR
Science Applications International Corporation<BR></Center>

<BR>
The phenomenal growth of the Internet is redefining our very notion of privacy and property. The Internet has created a demand for instantaneous information exchange in the military, government, and private sectors that is without precedent. Information networks and computers that are connected to the Internet are routinely processing private, proprietary, sensitive, classified,and critical military and business information. Our economic base and our military effectiveness are more dependent on automated information systems than any country in the world.  However, the very technology that created this dependence is its greatest weakness: the infrastructure is fundamentally insecure to attacks from individuals, groups or nation-states which can easily deny service or compromise the integrity of information.<P>

In this paper we discuss the elements of a coherent strategy that will support the goal of creating a robust,  interoperable, and cost effective information infrastructure.  Given that it is not possible to control the state of the globally interconnected information infrastructure, we must determine how to design information services that can operate safely in this inherently unsafe environment. This infrastructure must include built-in resiliency for information and resource protection. The problem is incredibly complex and will require fundamental changes in the approach to designing and operating an infrastructure.  Each subsystem, component, protocol, and software application must be designed knowing that they will be operated in a malicious environment. Network managers must be equipped  to know the status of the infrastructure on a global basis and be able to detect attacks or system failures.  They must be prepared to react effectively and efficiently when a problem does occur to diagnose,  control, and recover capability.<P>

In the following paragraphs we address a number of challenge areas that are known to be fundamental to improved NII/DII security  and will  suggest strategies, legislation, or other mechanisms for balancing the three legs of the NII/DII INFOSEC equation: protect, detect, react. <P>

The critical issue areas are:<P>

<UL>
<LI>- Fragmentation of Responsibility<BR>
<LI>- Technology<BR>
<LI>- Architectural Framework<BR>
<LI>- People<BR>
<LI>- Facilities<BR>
<LI>- Data Bases<BR>
<LI>- Network Control<BR>
<LI>- Threat and Risk<BR>
<LI>- Security in a Global Infrastructure<BR>
</UL>
<BR>
Our discussions are not intended to provide final answers, but rather to get the community thinking about these issues.<P>

Fragmentation of Responsibility It is critical that the U.S. develop an integrated, assured, end-to-end information transfer capability that can be managed through centralized technical control processes and mechanisms.<P>

"During World War II everyone knew that it was the Navy's job to protect oil tankers from marauding U-boats," stated Bob Ayers, chief of the Information Warfare division at the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).  A similar clear assignment of responsibility for protecting the transport of information across a global telecommunications networks does not exist.<P>

The American military is the most information dependent in the world. Computers support everything from the design of weapons to pay and health care.  We would have much less of a challenge if this computer processing and telecommunications were conducted over private military networks.  But that just isn't reality; about 95% of the military's communications are carried over the public switched networks (PSN).  These same networks are shared by individual users, universities, various governmental entities, and private corporations, world-wide.  The networks are spread across many states, countries, principalities and are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations under a variety of jurisdictional authorities.  <P>

The already complex mix of stakeholders interested in the rapid access to information and near instantaneous communication is now undergoing explosive growth fueled by the world wide web or WWW.  Most major corporations are establishing WWW "home pages" for informational and advertising purposes.  Some are beginning to consider using the Internet as a medium for electronic commerce.  Microsoft and Visa have announced a joint effort to develop standards for Secure Transaction Technology to enable electronic commerce in a user friendly way while maintaining the privacy and protection of account numbers that consumers have come to expect in conventional credit transactions.  A major disruption in the PSN would also have a crippling effect on the nation's business and financial industries.  Who, then, is responsible for protecting the information in these computers and networks?<P>

Responsibility for security today tends to be assigned as a function of the classification of the information rather than the utility value of the information.  An example is the provision of P.L. 100-235 that requires security plans for Federal systems containing sensitive information, yet exempts those systems containing classified information.  Domains of authority must be clearly delineated so that when an attack occurs the appropriate agents may react.<P>

A "Big Brother" approach that places all of a nation's telecommunications under a single government jurisdiction -- even in the event of war-is probably impossible.  Most networks were built to service commercial users and private industry will object to intrusions by the government.  Consider the controversy raise by the introduction of the Clipper Chip and key escrow. Civil libertarians and conspiracy theorists would make common cause in resisting dominant government control of the telecommunications infrastructure.  The recent mood in the Congress to reduce government regulation will further inhibit the government's ability to provide centralized network control.  Regardless,  it is critical to the future security of the U.S. that we find a way manage this problem.  It must be possible to determine if an "event" involving the nation's networks is the result of an accident, is a criminal attack, is an isolated terrorist incident, or is an act of war.  The damage from an event may be the same but if the intent behind the event is malicious then the responsibility for response to the event falls under a different jurisdiction that is a function of the intent-crime, terrorist or war. If we are unable to react promptly until the jurisdiction is established, it may be too late to react appropriately.<P>

Technology:  In spite of years of discussion about the need for security in computer systems and networks, most systems continue to be designed without needed security features.  The military continues to defer the security requirements in favor of other operational needs when budgets and schedules are tight.  Even where security is being included, the current process of development and security evaluation causes systems to be obsolete by the time they are fielded. This must change.  We must change the very premise on which systems and infrastructure are designed and acquired. The time between generations of computing technology has dropped from five years to eighteen months and is now approaching one year.  Clearly, to acquire military systems over a 5 to 10 year acquisition cycle is inconsistent with today's needs. Also, the DoD has imposed an ill-defined certification process for security products that lags far behind the technology life cycle resulting in the fielding of obsolete security technology that is incompatible with rapid technology refreshment.<P>

In addition to separating the acquisition of data, applications and the underlying computing and communications technology so that each is acquired on an appropriate cycle-as contrasted to the failed grand design systems acquisition approach-a design approach is needed that is appropriate to the continued injection of security technology into existing and developmental information environments. This design approach should explicitly address the security design practices for the protection on information environments, the detection of malicious action, and the capability to react to such actions.<P>

This must be contrasted to past practices focused on the protection of confidentiality where, in spite of over ten years of publicity regarding the need for secure computer systems, we have failed to train designers to consider security as a fundamental feature of an operating system or computer application, nor have we trained acquisition managers to insist upon secure computers and application software; when cost and schedule become an issue, security is the first thing dropped. <P>

Architectural Framework:  The Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) Technology Policy Working Group, supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology is examining an  Architectural Framework for National Information Infrastructure Services and Standards that will lead to an open systems environment.  However, the focus on security in this initiative is primarily driven by privacy concerns.  The implications of malicious or hostile action taken against the elements the NII is not given suitable attention.  <P>

Likewise, the Office of Management and Budget has published five draft Security Tenets [Federal Register/ Vol 60. No. 28/ Friday February 10, 1995] that the NII should provide the people who use it:<P>

(1)  The ability to control who see (or cannot see) their information and under what  terms;<BR>
(2)  The ability to know who they are communicating with and that information received comes from who it says it is from;<BR>
(3)  The ability to know that information stored or transmitted is unaltered;<BR>
(4)  The ability to know when information and communication services will (or
will not be) available; and<BR>
(5)  The ability to block unwanted information or intrusion<BR>
<BR>
These are very worthwhile tenets and address the issues of integrity, confidentiality and availability but still do not get at the issues of malicious attack on the NII.<P>

Further, if you examine OMB's report  "NII Security: The Federal Role", of June 5, 1995, prepared by the National Information Infrastructure Security Issues Forum, you will find that it does not address the need for a national information strategy on how to assure national security and network protection. The section of the report titled "Privacy and Security" is concerned almost exclusively with privacy. There is no discussion of the potential threats to national security from disruption, corruption or compromise of the NII by actual or potential enemies of the United States.<P>

People:  Ultimately, many problems are the result of authorized individuals roaming and browsing in computers and computer files outside of their specific responsibilities.  In the business world, the majority of crimes are committed by authorized users acting outside of their authorized duties.  We know that we are not going to change human nature. There will always be persons acting in ways that are contrary to societal norms.  It is possible, however to be aware of such behavior and to design systems and procedures that mandate accountability.<P>

The techniques for protecting systems against insider threats are well-known and do not need repeating.  Training and awareness, strong identification and authentication, meaningful audit collection and reduction.  Clearly we must focus resources on the passive and continuous identification and authentication of the users of information systems, auditing of users activities at both the technical telecomputing and application (work flow) levels (including audit reduction), and the design of personnel security programs for information workers.<P>

Facilities:  We must not neglect the physical plant that houses our information systems.  Computers will not run without electricity and water for large air conditioning systems.  Critical data must be backed up regularly, stored in locations that will not share common disasters.  In addition, means for distributed computing that is inherently protected from local perturbations should be developed.  <P>

Data Bases:  Data base research and design requirements should be explored including such topics as how the integrity state of stored data can be known even if not being used to support active transactions and design features for the rapid replication of data bases while under attack as a strategy to preclude single point failures.<P>

Network Control:  In an integrated information infrastructure, a coordinated network control capacity is required to integrate the communications control function and the data control function. This coordinated control requires the visibility of infrastructure operations from keyboard to keyboard.  The issues are still: protect, detect, react. We must be able to detect the signs of an attack early and to be able to distinguish attacks from other forms of failure or perturbation.  We must be able to determine the nature and extent of that attack (isolated incident or global attack). The overall Defense Information Infrastructure needs to be monitored by an external security control center.  This center will have primary responsibility of defensive information warfare and will have a robust computing and communications capability. It must be able to diagnose problems, conduct triage actions to limit proliferating attacks or cascading failure modes,  and manage the restoration of operations without being dependent on the damaged network for this activity. Recall the Morris worm incident, where systems were taken off the Internet, thus shutting off the primary means of communication between system operators, who were so dependent on the Internet as a communications medium that they often were unaware of each other's telephone numbers.  <P>

Threat and Risk:  We must rethink our approach to relating threat and risk. Our past approaches have been confused and of limited effectiveness.  In themilitary and government environment it has been the case that "threat" was paramount.  One always needed to have a well defined threat in order to provide a justification for protective measures.  It was considered prudent to purchase countermeasures in proportion to the clearly defined threat in order to avoid spending more than the risk would warrant.   The commercial world tended to be checklist oriented.  Various standard practices and procedures had evolved over time and businesses were expected to follows these practices. These common business practices have not kept up with the growth and dynamics of computer technology.<P>

The technical capacity and cost to attack an information system is now so insignificant in proportion to the value of the information that we must assume the threat is real.  Under the right motive or circumstance every network can be attacked.  In order to conserve our critical resources, we must balance protection with the value of the information.  We need to develop design metrics that relate a specified degree of protection to cost.  A normalized means of addressing the incremental cost of various information security  technologies and design features in relation to the anticipated risk is needed for informed design decisions.<P>

Security in a Global Infrastructure:  The DII is not simply part of a defense infrastructure.  It is rather part of a global information network whose interconnections are beyond visualization and understanding.  We must develop capabilities that will enable the protection of information enclaves within this global environment. The tension between protection and openness and balance between economy and effectiveness must be carefully addressed.  <P>

Economic pressures will force private industry to develop strategies for dealing with security and privacy in electronic commerce.  Visa and Microsoft have recently announced that they have established a joint venture to establish standards for electronic commerce in their Secure Transaction Technology.  Microsoft and other software developers are including C2 (Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria rating) features in their standard product line (e.g. Windows NT and Novell). However, even commercial giants like Microsoft are not likely to develop the global protective and reactionary mechanisms needed to protect the networks from concentrated attack.  This will have to come from government efforts.<P>

What should we do?<P>

Private industry will need to work cooperatively with the Federal government to provide the required levels of protection.  We likely will need to evolve toward enclaves or domains of systems whose levels of protection will vary according to the utility of the information in commerce or warfare.  Related to this will be the need to develop processes and metrics so that developers of the DII/NII can demonstrate the cost basis for the resulting trade-offs.  <P>

The key to protecting the nation's information infrastructure is to provide the ability to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>- Protect the system from attack<BR>
<LI>- Detect an event when it is occurring and be able to decide if it is an
attack, a failure mode, or an isolated hacker<BR>
<LI>- React to the event in a way that minimizes the impact and restores and maintains capability.<BR>
</UL>

<U>Protect! Detect! React!</U>  To achieve this we begin with a systematic examination of information security research and design criteria at the architectural level.  We must find <P>

1. A means to know the current state of an information system environment at the technical computing level, the telecommunications level, and the application level.<P>
2. A criteria to recognize when the current state of the environment is perturbed in order to provide for automated diagnostics and warning.<P>
3. Features at the technical and application levels that will enable the ready restoration of a perturbed environment to a known desired state.<P>
4. Basic protection features that will limit well-known and low cost attacks in an information environment<P>
5. Network features that will automatically limit proliferating attacks or cascading failure modes.<P>

Most importantly, we who have the good fortune of having a technical background that enables us to have some informed insights into this very complex challenge have a  responsibility to educate the general public on the importance of this issue.   We must foster a climate of reason so that we can reach agreement on acceptable means to conduct status monitoring of the NII in such a way that it will allow industry and government to detect and to react to attacks on the United States through cyberspace without creating an electronic police state that inappropriately monitors the information transactions of individuals and businesses. <P>

Conclusions.  In this paper we have considered some of the problems facing the future of information infrastructure.  The threat is very real.  The ability to cause a catastrophic breakdown of our information and telecommunications infrastructure exists and is not technically challenging.  A computer and a modem is all that is needed.  In the past, it required the resources of a nation to wage war.  Today anyone with a thousand dollars worth of equipment and a modicum of technical understanding can bring down the house.<P>

<p align=center><b>ABSTRACT</b></p>
<p align=justify>	The increasing incorporation of Information Warfare (IW) and Command and Control Warfare (C2W) into theater operations requires some new and original thinking on measures of effectiveness.  Whether in training simulations, or simulations conducted as part of the "wargaming" phase of actual operations, measures of effectiveness (MOEs) are required that reflect the nature of theater and Joint Task Force (JTF) operations to assist the commander in planning and executing his operation.  </p>
<p align=justify>	Dynamics Research Corporation (DRC) has worked in the area of theater campaign simulation for a number of years.  Working in conjunction with The National War College and The Army War College, DRC developed measures including: 
<UL>

<LI>How well Blue reads the threat plan, to include whether the enemy's main effort was predicted and if it was predicted in a timely manner.  	<BR>

<LI>Whether the Blue force reserves were in the proper location and posture when needed. 	<BR>

<LI>Whether the Blue force commander exploited an asymmetrical advantage and denied the enemy the converse.  <BR>

<LI>Whether the phasing of the campaign or major operation was properly planned and executed.  

<LI>Whether the enemy center of gravity was properly identified, successfully attacked. <BR>

<LI>Whether the enemy was defeated, and whether the enemy was convinced of this decision.<BR>

<LI>Whether the Blue force components were maintained in a balanced fashion (as opposed to unequal attrition to a marked and unnecessary degree). <BR>

<LI>Whether significant modalities (i.e., air, air defense, C4I) were defeated on either side 	<BR>

<LI>Whether the theater boundaries were of the proper size to allow the Joint Force Commander (JFC) control of required territory and forces without excessive responsibility for non-essential forces and area.<BR>

</UL>

<p align=justify>	Success in theater and JTF campaigns demands the full incorporation of C2W and IW. This exploratory paper discusses measures with a commentary on IW, including techniques for selecting theaterlevel measures and thoughts on modeling and simulation.</p>

<p align=center><b>I.  INTRODUCTION</b></p>

The end of the cold war and the birth of the new world order  with its new emphasis on Joint,  coalition, interagency, and international operations and frequent Operations Other Than War (OOTW)  brought several significant changes in the way the US prepares to wage war: 

<UL>
<LI>The joint system has matured under the power granted by GoldwaterNichols, and Theater Commanders in Chief (CINCs) are making great use of their new ability to tailor joint task forces (JTFs). <BR>

<LI>The Joint Staff, supported by the Services and CINCs, are in the midst of significant developments of joint training and doctrine.<BR>

<LI>US Atlantic Command (USACOM) now controls almost all Service combat forces in the continental US.  As the Joint Force integrator, USACOM is responsible for the training and deployment of Joint Task Forces. <BR>

</UL>

We are in the  Information Age.  While the Persian Gulf war highlighted the power of destroying an opponents command and control structure, we are only beginning to tap the potential of information supremacy.  The Services and the joint system are busily engaged in developing doctrine, tactics and organizations to wage information warfare. Since Information Warfare (IW) will be a key factor in theater operations, we need to be able to measure its contributions</p>
<p align=justify>	</p>
<p align=justify>	This effort, which addresses measures of effectiveness for theater operations, is a continuing commentary on how the senior commander  of a military operation pulls all these things together and how IW and Command and Control Warfare (C2W) supports the theater campaign.  It is one of 15 topics covered in our Theater Campaign research note [8]. There are more questions than answers, as we will see.    </p>
<p align=justify>	The paper first establishes some groundwork in the Background section, which presents  the concepts of theaters, levels of war, levels of command, OOTW, and sources.  Next, IW and C2W are discussed.  The Measurement section examines the concept of measuring, looking at "what, when, how" to measure, and subjective versus objective measures.  Examples of theaterlevel measures of effectiveness (MOEs) are provided in the following section, Theater MOE, in which the TheaterLevel MOE Worksheet is introduced.  Modeling is addressed in the next section, which states why models are of interest, suggests improvements, and discusses worksheet applicability.  Finally, we present suggestions for improving the measurement of theaterlevel C2W.</p>
<p align=justify>	It is our intent to provide, for policy makers as well as commanders, some techniques for them to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns and operations.   </font></p></body>

<h2>STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:
    THE INTERNET</h2>
<p>
<h3><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h3>
 
The political process is moving onto the Internet. Both within the United States and internationally, individuals, interest groups, and even nations are using the Internet to find each other, discuss the issues, and further their political goals. The Inte

rnet has also played an important role in recent conflicts. As a result, overseas segments of the Internet can be a useful tool for DoD, both for gathering and for disseminating information. By monitoring public message traffic and alternative news source

s from around the world, early warning of impending significant developments could be developed, in advance of more traditional means of indications and warning. Commentary placed on the Internet by observers on the scene of low-intensity conflicts overse

as could be useful to U.S. policymaking. During larger scale conflicts, when other conventional channels are disrupted, the Internet can be the only available means of communication into and out of the affected areas. Internet messages originating within 

regions under authoritarian control could provide other useful intelligence. Public messages conveying information about the intent of overseas groups prone to disrupting U.S. military operations can provide important counterintelligence. The Internet cou

ld also be used offensively as an additional medium in psychological operations campaigns and to help achieve unconventional warfare objectives. Used creatively as an integral asset, the Internet can facilitate many DoD operations and activities. 
 
<h3><a name="Background">Background</a></h3>
 
In the last few years, the Internet has become a household word. After a long period of relative obscurity when it was solely the domain of technically oriented individuals, the Internet has burst onto the national scene and is playing an increasingly imp

ortant role in an ever-widening spectrum of activities involving an exponentially increasing number of people. It is now in the mainstream. Having a tangible effect on in the social, cultural, economic, and political lives of millions, the evolution of th

e Internet is taking it into roles completely unanticipated by its original designers. Rather than merely ''fitting in" to pre-existing social processes, the Internet is actually transforming the nature of the processes themselves. 
<p>
The Internet has been increasingly involved in politics and international conflict. Local, state and national governments are establishing a presence on the Internet, both for disseminating information to the public and for receiving feedback from the pub

lic. Candidates for elective office are conducting debates over the Internet. Organizers of domestic and international political movements are using the Internet. It has played a key role in Desert Stomm, the Tiananmen Square massacre, the attempted coup 

in Russia, the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and in the challenge to authoritarian controls in Iran, China, and other oppressive states. The Internet is playing an increasingly significant role in international security, a role that is potentially im

portant to DoD. 
 
<h3><a name="Objectives">Objectives</a></h3>
 
The goals of this strategic assessment are to: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Explain current general trends in the evolution of the Internet 
<li>Analyze the role being played by the Internet in domestic and international politics and conflict
<li>Provide some relevant predictions about the future of the Internet 
<li>Derive implications and recommendations for SO/LIC and for DoD in general. 
</ul>
 
<h3><a name="Scope">Scope</a></h3>
 
The discussion in this assessment is non-technical. It is intended for audiences who are both familiar and unfamiliar with the Internet. Topics more relevant to social and commercial use of the Internet than to uses directly related to national security a

re provided in order to establish an appreciation for the broader importance of the Internet in the daily affairs of individuals and institutions, and its potential for reaching wide audiences. 
 
<h3><a name="What">What is the Internet?</a></h3> 
 
The Internet is an enormous global network of computers. Often called a "network of networks," it integrates thousands of dissimilar computer networks worldwide through the use of technical standards that enable all types of systems to interoperate. Indiv

iduals connected to the Internet using their desktop computers can perform the following functions (depending on the sophistication of the "host," or local Internet node, to which they are connected for service): 
<p><ul>
 <li>Exchange electronic mail, or e-mail, with any other user at any location 
  <p>
<li>Participate in offline (i.e., not current simultaneous) discussions via e-mail with large   groups of individuals interested in particular topics, using "mailing lists" and "News   Groups" 
<p>
<li>Participate in online (i.e., real-time, or current) discussions with large groups of individuals using the "Internet Relay Chat" function 
<p>
<li>Log on to remote computer sites worldwide using the Telnet function 
<p>
<li>Download files from remote sites and users and upload files to remote sites and users via the FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, function (the files can be text, graphics, sound. or video) 
<p>
<li>Read complex documents composed using "Hypertext" (clicking on a highlighted   phrase on the screen takes the user into another domain, e.g., clicking on the word  "Anthropology" creates a new screen or menu devoted to that subject), allowing hierarch

ial or "non-linear" structuring of documents. The components of a single hypertext document can be multiple files residing in host computers anywhere on the worldwide net; a standard protocol fetches the desired component from its home location and presen

ts it transparently to the user, who is unaware of the underlying processes. 
  <p>
<li>Read "multimedia" documents, resident at "World Wide Web" sites, consisting of text,   graphics, sound, and video, using an intelligent front-end program such as Mosaic. 
</ul>
There is no central authority managing the Internet. Participation is on a voluntary and cooperative basis, requiring only that technical standards be followed to establish a presence on the net. The Internet Society in Fairfax, Virginia plays an integrat

ing role and sets technical standards. Funding for the communication links is provided partly by governments (e.g., the U.S. National Science Foundation has been funding the national high-speed backbone) and partly by non-governmental institutions such as

 universities and corporations. 
<p>
Although it is difficult to obtain accurate estimates, it is believed that currently there are approximately twenty million individuals worldwide with access to the Internet. Projections indicate that approximately one hundred million will have access by 

the year 2,000. The following factors are fueling this vast increase: 
  <ul>
<li>User friendly - Improvements in technology, replacing arcane operating system   commands understandable only by computer experts with user-friendly, icon-based,   "point-and-click" interfaces, allowing non-technical individuals to become highly   soph

isticated users. 
  
<li>Universal access - Proliferation of commercial Internet access providers offering   online connections from virtually any location over telephone lines 
  <p>
<li>Lower cost -Substantial reductions in the cost of access, making it affordable by a   large segment of the population 
  <p>
<li>Increased benefits - Large increases in the volume of information available over the   Internet that is useful or entertaining 
  <p>
<li>Convenience - the ability for any individual to easily and inexpensively exchange   e-mail with any other individual 
  <p>
<li>Cost-effectiveness - use of the Internet to realize low-cost improvements in business   operations 
  <p>
<li>Momentum - Increases in the size of the net-wide audience attracting additional   information providers and businesses seeking markets, causing a spiraling effect 
  <p>
<li>Prestige - Encouragement by the Clinton Administration   Mystique 
<p></ul>
<h3><a name="BBS">Bulletin Board Systems</a></h3>
<p>
A Bulletin Board System (BBS) is a personal computer running sophisticated but inexpensive software, to which people with their own computers can connect over a phone line. Generally available 24 hours a day, a BBS allows callers to read, reply to, and or

iginate e-mail, read text files (bulletins), and exchange other kinds of files such as computer programs and graphics. Virtually anyone, including high school students, can set up and operate a BBS. International e-mail networks linking BBS's worldwide ha

ve developed, through which local callers can exchange messages with others of similar interests around the globe. There are roughly fifty thousand BBS's in the U.S., and the number is increasing rapidly. <p>
A BBS generally has a specific theme, such as ham radio, fishing, religion, or computer games. Numerous BBS's have political themes. In the Washington area, there is a BBS run for the NRA providing anti-gun control information, a BBS for the "Christian Ri

ght," a BBS providing conservative critiques of alleged liberal bias in the news media ("AIM Net," for Accuracy in Media), BBS's supporting gay rights and women's rights, and various others. Anyone can write a manifesto or other political material and pla

ce it online using a BBS, making it available to a wide audience. BBS's are slowly connecting to the Internet. This trend is slow because most BBS's are run by individuals as a hobby at their own expense, and the cost of connecting a BBS to the Internet i

s still relatively high. However, even standalone BBS's have many of the same functions as the Internet, and their political role can be similar. 
 
<h3><a name="Trends">Current Trends</a></h3>
 
One important trend is the growth in the proportion of professionals having personal e-mail addresses on the Internet. Increasingly, business cards include not just voice and fax phone numbers, but Internet addresses. This trend is so strong that many pro

fessionals now assume that their counterparts have an Internet address to which they can send e-mail. Rather than considering an Internet address to be a luxury, not having one is coming to be viewed as a handicap, comparable to not having a fax. Individu

als and organizations without Internet access increasingly risk being left out of important discussions and processes taking place via the Internet. <p>
The internal use of e-mail within organizations, by putting all personnel in direct contact with each other regardless of organizational rank, has tended to "flatten the pyramid," i.e., functionally change the organization to a certain extent from a hiera

rchial one to a horizontal one. There have been reports of this occurring even within a military organization. 
Along with the individuals who have Internet addresses comes their own expertise. Millions of experts in various fields, from medicine to plumbing, conduct business over the Internet and use if for recreation and information exchange, making available a v

ast potential storehouse of specialized knowledge. In the experience of the author, much of this knowledge is available for the asking. <p>
Commercial online databases containing every form of information imaginable are now accessible (mostly for a fee) via the Internet. "Open source intelligence" originates largely from these databases. Public library catalogs, including the one belonging to

 the Library of Congress, are available for free over the Internet. <p>
Increasingly, authors of magazine and newspaper articles include their Internet addresses in their bylines, allowing readers to contact them directly to provide their reactions or ask for additional information. <p>
Federal, state, and local governments are establishing a presence on the Internet. Dozens of Federal agencies provide public information online. These agencies are all reachable through a service in Virginia called Fedlink. Fedlink acts as a gateway throu

gh which the general online public can reach any agency's system. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs has just implemented a World Wide Web service containing current and historical news releases, daily summaries, press adv

isories, transcripts, and contracts. Information on this service flows one way, however, from DoD to callers. Provision has not been made to accept feedback from callers. OSD C3I is building its own"World Wide Web server," an Internet computer that provid

es graphics-based information publicly over the Internet. This server will provide OSD organizational information and an online version of the Early Bird. <p>
Local governments are increasingly establishing "Freenets," which are online information services open to the public. These services provide local government documents and news, and are a medium for discussions among callers about local issues. 
Internet users interested in particular subjects participate in "conferences" devoted to those subjects. These conferences are collections of messages embodying extended discussions about those subjects. Currently, there are roughly ten thousand conferenc

es available on the Internet in various forms. Conferences exist for virtually every subject known to man. On these conferences, one can find unique expertise, experience, information, and sources of advice unavailable elsewhere so conveniently and at suc

h low cost. Some of the most energetic types of conferences are those devoted to current events and political debate. At any time, there is an enormous volume of discussion about the news of the day. Opinions span the entire political spectrum, from far l

eft to far right, and originate in many nations. Whenever an important event occurs, such as a national election or a major conflict, even a natural disaster, there is an almost "deafening roar" of responses on the Internet. Participants in the internatio

nal conferences include journalists, professors, political analysts, and politicians. <p>
Internet conferences provide a unique medium for interpersonal communication on a massive scale 
<p><ul>
"Usenet (one of the Internet's conferencing systems) is a place for conversation or publication, like a giant coffeehouse with a thousand rooms; it is also a worldwide digital version of the Speaker's Comer in London's Hyde Park, an unedited collection of

 letters to the editor, a floating flea market, a huge vanity publisher, and a coalition of every odd special-interest group in the world. It is a mass medium because any piece of information put onto the Net has a potential worldwide reach of millions." 

[Rheingold] 
<p></ul>
Many of the issues addressed in these conferences focus on current military operations in which DoD is involved. Often, incorrect statements of fact, misrepresentations of the U.S. position, and gross distortions of situations are made, which is not surpr

ising. However, the vast size of the audience for these misstatements amplifies the magnitude of their effect on public opinion. 
<p>
In global terms, Americans are by far the heaviest users of the Internet, and the proportion of American homes with personal computers and modems is increasing quickly. Internet use in Europe is less prevalent but still significant, and is increasing rapi

dly. In the undeveloped world, particularly in some of the very nations where some future conflicts are likely to occur, few individuals other than government officials, business persons, educators, and some professionals have access to the Internet. Howe

ver, all South American nations and about two-thirds of all African nations have at least some Internet connectivity."[Fineman] There is an international project whose goal is to spread the Internet to the undeveloped world, but progress is likely to be s

low. 
<p>
The threat from "hackers" and computer viruses is always present. Internet security is one of the greatest concerns of organizations using it, particularly the Department of Defense. Malicious tampering with government computers could seriously disrupt va

rious operations if sufficient countermeasures are not built in. A strategy called ''firewalls'' has been developed, whereby a second computer (a firewall) is placed between an organization's own computer and the Internet communication lines, to help cont

rol access and prevent "break-ins." It has recently been found that even a triple firewall architecture has been successfully penetrated by hackers. <p>
With respect to viruses, there is a kind of arms race spiral, whereby anti-virus software writers improve their software to protect against a newly discovered type of virus, the virus writers respond by creating a new virus that can circumvent that new pr

otection, and so on.  
<h3>The Internet and Domestic U.S. <a name="Politics">Politics</a></h3>
 
The Clinton Administration has embraced the Internet as a means of direct political communication with the electorate. Using the President's e-mail address,<a href="mailto: president@whitehouse.gov"> president@whitehouse.gov</a>, anyone with access to the

 Internet can send a message to the President's staff. Some 5,000 e-mail messages come into the White House every week. Interns read every message, tally them by issue and by opinion expressed, and send a standard response. This is part of a relatively so

phisticated political strategy: <p><ul>
"To a certain group of techno-literate staffers at the White House... the Net is not just a mechanism for receiving mail. It is emerging as a full-blown forum for conducting the country's political affairs. While the vast majority of the public gets its d

ose of political information from television and newspapers, the citizens of the Net are plugged directly into their government. On a daily basis, subscribers to America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy, as well as other denizens of the Internet can downlo

ad and read a stack of new policy papers, speeches, and transcripts of conversations put out by dozens of departments within the Clinton Administration. In the past, only reporters and lobbyists saw these documents... White House staffers tend to view the

 Net as a ballast against the out-of-control mass media and Washington press corps. And they believe the public is sympathetic - that there is as much anger against the media as there is against government... By... establishing a growing presence on the N

et, the Clinton administration is making a pitched effort to perform an end run around the media. Not surprisingly, the inside-the-beltway press corps does not like the idea of giving up its role as the filter through which the public sees its government.

"[Schwartz] </ul><p>
The White House actually uses the content of all this e-mail: <p><ul>
 "...e-mail is all neatly stored on the White House computer network where staffers can search by keywords such as 'health care,' 'crime,' 'Persian Gulf,' and so on. That enables staffers to instantly measure which issues are foremost on people's minds"[S

chwartz] 
</ul>
<p>They see interaction with the public via the Internet as a positive force:<p>
<ul>
"Jonathan 'Jock' Gill, a former Lotus Development Corp. manager who now works in the Office of Media Affairs, is heaped up about using technology to cut through the thick fog of cynicism in America. He believes that the Net can greatly expand the 'idea sp

ace' in which public discourse happens. Instead of watching a few talking heads on TV, citizens can sit at their computers and engage in two-way conversations with each other and with government officials....Gill's goal is to 'give everyone in government 

a name, a face, and a contact point.' The reason the public seems disconnected from government in recent years, he says, is that it has grown beyond the reach of the ordinary citizen.[Schwartz]</ul><p>

This direct, two-way interaction between the pinnacle of the Federal government and ordinary citizens is highly significant. The bypassing of congressional representation, the poll takers, and the news media tends to counteract any distortions or filterin

g that those entities might have otherwise added. This is probably the first time this phenomenon has occurred on any appreciable scale in the history of the nation. If it continues to grow over the long term, it can fundamentally alter the political proc

ess. However, future Administrations may not put so much emphasis on this mechanism. 
<p>
It is not only the American public that uses the Internet to communicate with the White House. On February 4, 1994, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt sent an e-mail message to President Clinton, the first head of state to do so: 
<p><ul>
"Dear Bill: Apart from testing this connection on the global Internet system, I want to congratulate you on your decision to end the trade embargo on Vietnam. I am planning to go to Vietnam in April and will certainly use the occasion to take up the quest

ion of the MIAs... Sweden is - as you know - one of the leading countries in the world in the field of telecommunications, and it is only appropriate that we should be among the first to use the Internet for political contacts and communications around th

e globe. Yours, Carl."[Schwartz]</ul><p> 
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has established a program to make electronic versions of all draft legislation available on the Internet. This will allow the subset of the electorate who has Internet access to evaluate it for themselves, and will allow

 them to make highly informed inputs to their representatives in Congress. It will also place those without access in a relatively weaker political position, because they will generally not be able to know the details or independently ascertain their sign

ificance. The theme of the Internet as a threat to the established mass media is a common one in the recent literature. 
<p><ul>
"'The important trend,' messaged Michael Newman... on the WELL (an online information service), 'is technology abetting the grassroots distribution of information rather than the information being the domain of huge institutions to dole out according to t

heir agendas. The "many-to-many" model is going to eat the "few-to-many" model alive.' (Newman) is right on the button. For generations, the leading newspapers have served as the nation's information gate-keepers, deciding which of the many millions of ne

ws stories will move through the gate and out into the country. Armed with relatively inexpensive technology, millions of Americans are now finding that they don't need the gatekeepers any more. For the first time, they're free to pick and choose their ow

n stories and share their own responses. They tap into electronic wire services at will, call up expanded versions of news stories that interest them, then tell one another directly of their political aspirations or cultural passions. The bulletin boards 

not only carry news and forge communities, they shape values and public opinion without help from the gatekeepers - those who have always told us what information was important and what we should think about it. The shift in control is already evident in 

the journalistic confusion that results when talk radio and TV force Zoe Baird from a cabinet nomination or make a contender of Ross Perot, when a president ignores the White House press corps to communicate through town meetings... For journalists, such 

interaction (as occurs online) means surrendering control and sharing power, things that journalists are trained not to do. Although individual reporters struggle to hear from and respond to readers and viewers, journalism is not user-friendly. Its instit

utional structure is hostile to people who want to communicate with its practitioners or argue about its content. Reporters rarely answer directly to consumers and constituents in the way they expect politicians to. Most media organizations believe they k

now better than their constituents what's good and proper for them."[Katz] 
<p>
"The importance of today's passive mass media is likely to diminish greatly over the coming decades. Passive media will be replaced by a new type of interactive multimedia, characterized by highly specialized media outlets often described as 'information 

agents. "' [Snider] </ul>
<p>
Many newspapers and magazines are timid about going online. Others, believing that they had better go online to retain their relevance, are finding for the first time in their entire history that they are subject to strong, serious criticism: 
<p><ul>
"In a media conference on CompuServe, AOL (America Online), (or) the Well, journalists are repeatedly challenged by non-journalists. People ask - and are told - how editing decisions were made, question why stores were left out, point out errors, disagree

 with conclusions... Time (magazine)'s online effort is intensely interactive, generating more than 2 million online visits in its first eight months. Editors and writers regularly make online appearances for drubbings by displeased readers who want to go

 a few rounds about gun control or women priests... Time's online message boards contain some of the most vigorous democratic debate on social issues in any modern medium... More importantly, users sense that Time, hardly a bastion of populist journalism,

 is changing as a result, becoming a bit less aloof, more in touch. It turns out that communicating with readers, like getting a needle, is scary, but it doesn't hurt all that much and is actually good for you."[Katz] 
</ul><p>
Another popular concept is "electronic democracy," whereby American citizens can become more influential participants in their government's decisions by making their views known via the Internet: 
<p><ul>
"'Electronic democracy' is inspired by two overlapping dislikes- of bureaucrats and of politicians - and by two ideas for making these groups more likeable. The first conjures up a world where the grumpy civil servant behind a counter is replaced by an ea

sy-to-follow screen that makes all the government's information available at the touch of a button. The second idea wants to make politicians as answerable and accessible to their constituents as Pericles was to the tiny Athenian democracy."[Economist] 
<p>
"The promise is that the average citizen will provide more input and have a greater impact on the decisions of government. Through... electronic mail and bulletin boards, and instant feedback mechanisms, government officials can know more clearly what the

ir constituents want... Instant knowledge of decision-makers' actions with the opportunity for instant feedback from angry constituents would necessitate backbone implants for many of our politicians before tough decisions get made."[Varn] 
</ul><p>
Some advocates of electronic democracy envision online elections and referendums: 
<p><ul>
"Clearly, the new technology facilitates new forms of voting and thus direct participation. For example, instead of physically going to the polls, people could vote from their homes. With more-convenient and less-expensive voting, people could be expected

 to vote more frequently and on more issues. Ballot referendums and polls could proliferate."[Snider] 
</ul><p>
Other observers are more skeptical: 
<p><ul>
"We'll be in trouble if politicians cannot resist the movement to let people vote on individual issues electronically. Unless Americans can gain a lot more leisure, they just don't have time to do their homework. That's why we elect politicians to attend 

to our business. If we don't like the way they are doing their jobs, we toss them out of office. I'm skeptical of people who think the whole country could be run like the Internet. Voting on the creations of a new newsgroup isn't quite the same as voting 

on the death penalty or abortion laws. The effects are a little more permanent."[Internet Unleashed] 
</ul><p>
Still others fear the potential for Big Brother types of control of the political process: 
<p><ul>
"Policy-makers... will ratchet up their sophistication in manipulating the perceptions of their actions. Data bases of information on constituents can be used to target information and manipulate opinions."[Varn] 
<p>
"How do we know that our computer vote is secret? Perhaps it's stored on a disk alongside our name... A government or a civilian computer hacker might rewrite an election for money, political motives, or a lark."[Bacard] "The Net that is a marvelous later

al network can also be used as a kind of invisible yet inescapable cage. The idea of malevolent political leaders with their hands on the controls of a Net raises fear of a more direct assault on liberties."[Rheingold] 
</ul><p>
The Internet has already played in important role in several local elections. In these elections, the candidates were essentially forced online and put under the spotlight of determined questioning by voters. In another episode, 
<ul><p>
"...organizers on the Net don't need vast hordes to be effective. One of the first potent (cyber)tribes was gathered... by a software developer from Washington State. Browsing political (discussions) on the Internet... Richard Hartman last summer found an

 instant -and national - fellowship that shared his dislike for his congressman, the then-Speaker Tom Foley. Within weeks a "De-Foley-ate Congress" campaign had used the Net and commercial online services to find supporters and donors. Foley might have lo

st anyway, but news of Hartrnan's effort helped spread the notion of the Speaker's vulnerability -and brought help from national Republicans."[Fineman]
</ul><p> 
Many other political activists have discovered the utility of the Internet for sharing information and organizing their activities. For example, 
<p><ul>
"LatinoNet, a non-profit advocacy group based in San Francisco, has created a service on America Online to help Latino organizations cooperate and lobby government officials. The open service, called LatinoNet, was praised by Reed Hundt, the chairman of t

he Federal Communications Commission. With LatinoNet up and running, we may soon see additional networks for ethnic lobbyists, such as Serbo-CroatNet, SlovakNet or BelarusNet."Washington Technology] </ul>
<p>
One activist has actually published advice for online political activists, in the form of ten "Rules," summarized below 
<p>
<ul>
<li>"Rule One: Decide what issues are worthy of your time." 
<li>"Rule Two: Don't automatically assume you must work within a traditional group." 
<li>"Rule Three: Be realistic about the possibility of payback." 
<li>"Rule Four: Know how to scout the Internet effectively - and where to post your own messages." 
<li>"Rule Five: Don't be intrusive or otherwise boorish." 
<li>"Rule Six: Write for the medium." 
<li>"Rule Seven: Tell the truth." 
<li>"Rule Eight: Turn flaming (insulting postings) to your advantage." 
<li>"Rule Nine: Provide a way for people to take action." 
<li> "Rule Ten: Don't forget to communicate with the media - and the policy makers." [Internet Unleashed] 
</ul>

The ability via the Internet to efficiently reach large numbers of individuals who are potential political actors plays to the strengths of special interest groups and political action committees. The Internet is thus highly attractive to activists who va

lue a populist approach as opposed to a republican approach that emphasizes electing representatives and influencing their positions. 
Examples of online political activism abound: 
<p><ul>
"Even before NRA-ILA's Gun Talk (an electronic bulletin board system run by the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action) came online, the importance of rapid communication was illustrated last September, when word that Handgun Contro

l, Inc., had scheduled 'Free the Brady Bill' press conferences was spread throughout the United States by pro-rights computer bulletin boards. Second Amendment activists worked feverishly over the weekend to mobilize our forces. In city after city, when t

he press conferences began, the anti-gun forces found themselves outnumbered by pro-rights citizens who had decided to attend a public event. In one city, the state senator who had volunteered to host the pro-Brady press conference observed the large crow

d of pro-rights citizens and announced that he thought the Brady bill wouldn't do any good."[Kopel] 
<p>
"When it looked as if the Colorado Springs city council was going to make a decision that would effectively prohibit telecommuting from his home in nearby Old Colorado City, (David) Hughes went into action. 'The city planners of Colorado Springs decided t

o tighten the ordinance that regulates working out of the home,' Hughes recalls. 'I was the only person to stand up in front of the planning commission and testify against the ordinance; the planners tabled the matter for thirty days. I then brought the t

ext of the ordinance home with me and put it on my BBS.' Hughes sent letters to the editors of his two local papers, inviting people to dial into his BBS and read the ordinance. Two hundred and fifty callers above the normal traffic level for his BBS call

ed within the next ten days. What Hughes did not realize at the time was that many of those callers worked in large high-tech plants, and they downloaded, printed, copied, and circulated hundreds of copies of the ordinance throughout the city. At the next

 city council meeting, more than 175 citizens, representing every part of the political spectrum, showed up to protest the ordinance. It was defeated. Hughes pointed out that 'ordinarily, the effort needed to get involved with local politics is enormous. 

But the economy of effort that computers provided made it possible for me to mobilize opinion."'[Rheingold] 
<p></ul>
Another, somewhat startling, example, is a message posted on the Internet on December 16, 1994, calling for nationwide protests against the Republican Party's Contract with America. The message accuses the Contract with America of being, in effect, class 

war, race war, gender war, and generational war, and urges recipients to "mobilize thousands of demonstrations in local communities across the nation," "fill the jails by engaging in acts of civil disobedience," and engage in other disruptive actions (see

 Appendix A for the full text of the message). 
 
Yet another example is a message posted on the same date entitled, "Protest: GOP '96," which begins the process of organizing mass protests against the 1996 Republican National Convention in San Diego. The message states (see Appendix B for full text): 
<p><ul>
"With the GOP's historical opposition to women's equality, Lesbian & Gay civil rights, and freedom of choice, and with the party's support for Prop 187, insensitivity to environmental issues, and hawkish pro-war stances, the possibilities for expressing p

opular dissent against Republican policies are virtually endless. For that reason, a local committee is forming to help facilitate the largest number of protests and demonstrations for the broadest range of issues possible... Called Protest: GOP '96, the 

committee seeks to serve as a local point of contact for organizations from across the country intending to demonstrate during the GOP Convention in August of 1996."</ul> 
<p>
Various fringe groups are beginning to exploit the Internet. These include: 
<p><ul>  
<li>"<a href="http://www.natvan.com/WHAT/what.html-ssil">The National Alliance</a>, a white supremacist organization that circulated a missive on   the Internet last month exhorting people to oppose welfare mothers, homosexuals,       Jews, illegal aliens and 

'minority parasites"'
<p>
  <li>"The Gay Agenda Resistance, 'dedicated to the struggle against the sexual deviancy   forces,' tells users they can aid the anti-gay struggle 'by distributing our files far and   wide through cyberspace"' 
<p>  
<li>"The <a href="http://www.grfn.org/~heiny/cmrm.html-ssil">Michigan Militia Corps</a>, a private group that is training to combat what it sees as   an inevitable takeover by federal armed forces
<p>
 <li>"The <a href="http://www.norml.org/">National Association for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</a>" 
<p>      
<li>"<a href="http://www.envirolink.org/orgs/ef/">Earth First</a>, a loosely affiliated group of environmental extremists"
<p>
 <li> "<a href="http://www.envirolink.org/arrs/peta/index.html-ssil">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a>, which is preparing an online foray to   promote its militant approach to animal rights."[Sandberg] 
<p></ul>
According to the Wall Street Journal,
<p><ul>
"Fringe groups are increasingly going online, gathering converts and seeking validation on the Internet. The network's far-flung links and low-cost communications are a boon to backwater groups that can't afford to use direct mail to make their pitches...

 The more a group is shut out of the mainstream, the more likely it is to go online... The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which monitors hate groups... has tracked about 250 hate groups in the U.S. and says 50 or more communicate online. Other experts believe t

he number is     considerably higher."[Sandberg]
</ul><p>
Still other kinds of interest groups have moved online. Groups of conspiracy theorists exchange e-mail explaining their often bizarre theories about conspiracies conducted by the U.S. government in general and DoD in particular. A much better organized gr

oup, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), has its own computer network with a gateway to the Internet. Much of the  traffic on this network refers to U.S. military operations that members believe relate to investigations and cover-ups of UFO-related incidents,

 and other messages contain details on MUFON's efforts to conduct surveillance of DoD installations and to obtain information on UFOs that they believe exists in classified form. 
<p>
The relatively more advanced role being played by the Internet in domestic U.S. politics provides a glimpse of what may happen in other nations in the future. Their different political systems, however, may change the precise nature of the Internet's role

 from what it is in the U.S., but its energizing effect is likely to be universal. 
 
<h3><a name="International"> The Internet and International Political Activism</a></h3> 
 
Numerous commentators and activists believe that the Internet will increasingly play a catalytic role in international affairs:
<p><ul>
"We are moving into an era in which political decisions in a number of areas are going to become supra-national in character. And we are no longer going to be able to allow the intervention of the age-old doctrine of state sovereignty to interfere with ce

rtain imperatives... and I think the Internet, being the one great system that links all of the various information technologies and services around the world, is the likely theater - a great, global theater - in which many changes can be brought into bei

ng and new ideas can be exchanged... Right now I am very interested in using the Internet, and the technique of electronic petitioning, to strengthen the United Nations... I am also interested in developing a world court, not like the one that currently e

xists, but a world court of public opinion that people would have recourse to. You would, in effect, be taking an electronic poll throughout cyberspace and using that medium to assemble opinion and then publicize and propagate the results so that they wou

ld find their way into the other media around the world and be acknowledged as representing an important segment of world public opinion. In addition, I believe with the Internet we could build a kind of political early warning system. Back when we fought

 the Cold War, we had an early warning system, with sensors and monitors from one end of Canada to the other, warning us of the approach of missiles from the Soviet Union. <i>With the Internet, we could erect warning stations around the world, so that bef

ore a situation developed, like the one on Rwanda, we would know that trouble was brewing, that one tribe was threatening to annihilate another.</i>(emphasis added)" (former U.S. Presidential candidate John Anderson)[Long] 
<p>
"...if the resources available on the Internet - the deeper sense of other people's lives and kinds of information that will be theirs to examine and explore - if these things work on and strengthen the imaginations of those who use them - well, then you 

have something that can have great significance for the cause of world peace. Because, you see, a key to compassion and the urge to moral action is the ability to imagine someone else's life and circumstances and how it feels to be that person in those ci

rcumstances of war, famine, or imprisonment or political oppression." (Father Andrew Greeley) [Long]
<p>
"The advent of global networking is fragmenting and re-sorting society into what one author calls 'virtual communities.' Instead of being bound by location, groups of people can now meet in cyberspace, the noncorporeal world existing between two linked co

mputers."[Cooke, Lehrer] 
<p>
  "Access to alternate forms of information and, most important, the power to reach others with your own alternatives to the official view of events, are, by their nature, political phenomena. Changes in forms and degrees of access to information are indi

cators of changes in forms and degrees of power among different groups. The reach of the Net, like the reach of television, extends to the urbanized parts of the entire world (and, increasingly, to far-flung but telecom-linked rural outposts). Not only ca

n each node rebroadcast or originate content to the rest of the Net, but even the puniest computers can process that content in a variety of ways after it comes in to the home node from the Net and before it goes out again."[Rheingold] 
 <p>
"The development of communications technologies has vastly transformed the capacity of global civil society to build coalitions and networks. In times past, communication transaction clusters formed among nation-states, colonial empires, regional economie

s and alliances - for example, medieval Europe, the Arab World, China and Japan, West African kingdoms, the Caribbean slave and sugar economies. Today new and equally powerful forces have emerged on the world stage - the rain forest protection movement, t

he human rights movement, the campaign against the arms trade, alternative news agencies, and planetary computer networks." (quoted in [Rheingold]) 
</ul>
The Internet has been playing an increasingly important role in international politics. One highly significant effect of Internet use overseas has been to circumvent the informational controls imposed by authoritarian regimes on their citizens: 
<ul>
"Undeniably, cyberspace has great subversive potential. The Internet gives individuals publishing power hitherto undreamed of. You can write a book, or a manifesto, and distribute it, free, to hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. In theory, all nati

onal censorship and control becomes obsolete, so long as telephone communication exists."[Jenkins] 
</ul><p>
This is more than just potential. In Asia, for example, according to the Wall Street Journal,
<ul><p>
"The Internet is giving Asians a heady dose of free expression, providing a conduit for everything from racy pictures to heated political debate. In a region where controls on the press and other limits on freedom of expression are common, the global netw

ork of computer networks has become a platform for Asians to criticize their governments... an engineering student... in Thailand... says the Internet is filling a void. 'Since the Internet can offer unlimited access to the rest of the world from one's ow

n living room, it is the only means so far to get around the government control...' And that access is apparently available to an ever- wider audience....the number of computers connected to the Internet (in Asia) rose 62% between January and July (1994),

 compared with 38% in the U.S. ...Asia now has more than 110,000 computers connected to the Internet."[Sandberg] 
</ul><p>
And elsewhere:
<ul> 
"Many people use computers to search for and bond with sympathetic 'neighbors.' For example, the Chinese students at Tiananmen Square and the Russian democrats during the Moscow coup used computer networks to communicate with kindred spirits around the wo

rld. The Chinese and Russian autocrats knew how to censor radio, TV, and the print media; however, they could not shut down the computer networks."[Bacard] 
<p>
"Russians have added incentives for getting online: e-mail is a more dependable medium than either phone calls or faxes in their country, since error-correcting PC modems can usually deliver messages intact despite the hissing and crackling of poor teleph

one lines... As a result, electronic bulletin boards and commercial online services are sprouting regularly in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other urban areas."[unattributed article] 
<p>
"The Internet is the censor's biggest challenge and the tyrant's worst nightmare... Unbeknown to their governments, people in China, Iraq and Iran, among other countries, are freely communicating with people all over the world."[Rolling Stone] 
<p>
"Authoritarian countries are hesitating before allowing their people access to this technology. I know it is being discussed at the highest levels in Vietnam. Government officials are nervous that people are going to use the Internet to push certain progr

ams and issues and values that the Vietnamese government, which wants to stay in charge, doesn't want.."[Long] 
<p></ul>
In addition, the Internet has played in important role in recent and ongoing conflicts. For example: 
<p><ul>
"During the siege of Sarajevo, the war-torn citizens of that city were prisoners in their own homes. They risked their lives just to buy food or find fuel to heat their apartments. They also were isolated: phone calls didn't go through; letters went undel

ivered. But a lucky few found another way to send messages to their families and friends. With one computer and a single phone line, more than 150 people were able to send electronic mail out of Sarajevo in one three-month period."[Long] 
<p>
"I was told by an acquaintance in Moscow about how he was picked up by the police on the day of the attack on their Parliament in December, 1991. It was a time of chaos, and apparently the police were using this as an excuse - this man was a left-wing dis

sident not looked on too kindly by the people in power. (He had organized something called the Labor Party and had been elected to the Moscow City Council.) He and some others were taken to a local police station and beaten up badly. A prisoner - a racket

eer - who was about to be let out, wanted to help them and asked them for the phone numbers of their families. After his release, the racketeer contacted their wives, who then contacted an organization with an Internet connection. The organization put a m

essage, a call for help, out on the Internet. In no time phone calls started coming in - people calling from places like Japan - saying, 'We hear you have so-and-so in jail, and we are worried about him,' and shortly thereafter, the men were released and 

the police apologized to them. This man says the Internet saved his life." [Long] 
<p>
(Excerpt from Internet e-mail originating in Moscow during the attempted coup) "I've seen the tanks with my own eyes. I hope we'll be able to communicate during the next few days. Communists cannot rape the Mother Russia once again!... Don't worry, we're 

ok, though frightened and angry. Moscow is full of tanks and military machines - I hate them. They try to close all mass media, they stopped CNN an hour ago, and Soviet TV  transmits opera and old movies... Now we transmit information enough to put us in 

prison for the rest of our life... maybe you'd write me what do they say on your (American) TV about the situation, as we can't watch CNN now... You can't even imagine how grateful we are for your help and support during this terrible time l The best thin

g is to know that we aren't alone... Don't worry; the only danger for us is if they catch and arrest us, as we are sitting at home and distributing all the information we have... Thanks Heaven, these cretins (KGB) don't consider us mass media! Please stop

 flooding the only narrow channel with bogus messages with silly questions. Note that it's neither a toy nor a means to reach your relatives or friends. We need the bandwidth to help organize the resistance (emphasis added). Really good news. Right now we

're listening to Radio Russia (without any jamming); they told that the eight left Moscow, no one knows where..." [Press] 
<p>
"During the coup in Moscow, the information posted to (the Internet) was used by Voice of America and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a> and (indirectly) by some other Western broadcasters and newspapers."[Rheingold] 
<p>
"During the Gulf War, we on the <a href="http://www.well.com/">WELL</a> (an online information service) were spellbound readers of reports relayed via (Internet) by an Israeli researcher, who was in a sealed room with his family, under missile attack. We 

asked him questions in the WELL's many-to-many public conference, that were sent to him, and his answers returned, via Internet e-mail."[Rheingold] 
<p>
"IRC (Internet Relay Chat) stepped into the limelight in early 1991, due to the Persian Gulf War. During the bombing of Iraq, hundreds of users from all over the world gathered on a single channel for live reports from users logged in from the Middle East

."[Internet Unleashed] 
<p>
"Kat's bulletins, which he calls 'Zagreb diary,' don't appear in Yugoslav papers or on television. They exist in cyberspace. Kat types them on his own computer in Zagreb and sends them by modem to an electronic bulletin board in Germany. From there, his s

tories are relayed to computers around the world via the global mega-information stream called the Internet. 'Electronic mail is the only link between me and the outside world,' says Kat, writing by e-mail. The Croatian government owns all the major media

 in the country and is prosecuting a group of journalists for treason."[Cooke and Lehrer] 
<p>
"'During Tiananmen Square, students were getting the news out and were fundraising through Internet,' (said) Tom Mandel... 'There were a bunch of us hungrily reading newsgroups, stuff we weren't getting from reporters."[Cooke and Lehrer] 
<p></ul>
A very significant use of the Internet is by international protest groups and political activists: 
<p><ul>
"Protest groups opposing regimes from Uruguay to the Philippines are plugging in their computers and planning their political resistance. Trade unions and charities in the industrialized world are keen to give computer equipment to groups elsewhere. If an

 impoverished group can persuade a better-funded organization to donate a modem to connect to the phone and can obtain a reliable phone line - often the most difficult part -it can make contact with millions of people worldwide via international computer 

networks. This can make governments nervous. Some African regimes are unhappy that a few unions seem to be using more advanced technology than they are. In India, a modem cannot be connected to a phone line without official permission."[Holderness] 
<p></ul>
One example of this phenomenon in Europe is an Internet mailing list (e-mail-based conference) called "Counterev-L:" 
<ul><p>
"This list is under the aegis of l 'Alliance Monarchists, affiliated with l'Alliance pour la Maintenance de la France en Europe, and is dedicated to promoting the cause of traditional monarchy and counterrevolution. Its principles are a government based o

n natural law, decentralization, subsidiarity, an economy based on the principles of distributive justice, and the defense of traditional Western values."[Maxwell and Grycz] 
<p></ul>
Another example in Europe is the use of "electronic mailboxes" (i.e., BBS's) by neo-Nazi groups in Germany: 
<p><ul>
"In addition to events in which neo-Nazis are physically present, there is Right-wing extremist communication by means of electronic mail. It is not uncommon for neo-Nazis to maintain their own computer mailbox or to know a fellow extremist who does. With

 a standard personal computer and a telephone modem, anyone can connect to a neo-Nazi national network that contains eight mailboxes. Currently about 100 right-wing extremists frequently use the box... The neo-Nazis use electronic links to update developm

ents within the right-wing extremist scene. The mailboxes are used to transmit propaganda, notify sympathizers of sites where rallies and social gatherings will take place, and review books and articles focusing on neo-Nazi politics and topics of interest

 such as immigration... German officials have cited potential abuses of this electronic network of race hatred. Coded messages could be transmitted promoting or coordinating illegal violent activity. The Vice President of the Bavarian State Office for the

 Protection of the Constitution said, 'The planning time for extremist operations might be shortened to a period that would make it impossible for us to intervene (before the attack)."' [U.S. Army] 
</ul><p>
Yet another example is the use of computer networks by a Mexican underground group: 
<ul><p>
"...Subcommandante Marco of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Mexico utilizes a portable laptop computer to issue orders to other EZLN units via a modem, and to foreign media contacts in order to maintain a favorable international propagand

a image. Increasingly, an insurgent or drug trafficking group's access to and utilization of electronic media technology for exploiting the information superhighway will bolster their support networks and enhance their command and control."[U.S. Army] 
<p>
"According to federal legislator Adolfo Zinser, who met with Marcos at a jungle hideout last year, the rebel leader typically would write his voluminous communiques on a laptop computer, which he carried in a backpack and plugged into the lighter socket o

f an old pickup truck he used when traveling between the remote Zaptista strongholds of La Garrucha and Guadalupe Tepeyac... Marcos' communiques continue to flow unimpeded through cyberspace, usually reaching readers in countries as distant as Italy, Germ

any and Russia faster than they can be published by most Mexican newspapers... If Marcos is  equipped with a telephone modem and a cellular phone, it would be possible for him to hook into the Internet even while on the run...[Robberson] 
</ul><p>
Apparently, the Zapatistas have attempted to use the Internet to deceive: 
<ul><p>
"Critics charge that the Internet is being used by the Zapatista supporters to distort recent events. When the army began mobilizing, for example, word went out on the Internet that San Cristobal was surrounded by tanks and armored cars. While it was true

 that the army presence had increased throughout Chiapas, no tanks were to be found anywhere in the state. One user group here sent out a report that airborne bombardments were underway in several named mountain villages and urged an international protest

. They passed on rebel assertions that women were being raped and children killed. But reporters who visited those areas and interviewed scores of witnesses said they were unable to confirm even one such incident."[Robberson] (Note: see Appendix D for ful

l text of message) 
</ul><p>
Elsewhere in Latin America, the Internet has actually been used by national governments as a tool of statecraft: 
<p><ul>
"In the battle over the Ecuadorian border, both Ecuador and Peru have been launching verbal missiles at each other via the World Wide Web"[Washington Technology] (Note: the World Wide Web is an Internet function that provides graphics as well as text to c

allers) 
<p></ul>
The largest and most active international political groups using the Internet appear to be the San Francisco-based <a href="http://www.igc.apc.org/">Institute for Global Communications (IGC) and the Association for Progressive Communications (APC)</a>. As

 such, a review of the IGC can provide a good perspective on the breadth of DoD-relevant information available on the Internet. According to a text file placed on the IGC's publicly accessible Internet site
<p><ul>
"IGC provides computer networking tools for international communication and information exchange. IGC is the U.S. member of the Association for Progressive Communications (APC), a coalition of computer networks providing services to over 25,000 activists 

and organizations in more than 130 countries. The IGC networks -PeaceNet, EcoNet, ConflictNet and LaborNet - together with APC partner networks, comprise the world's only computer communications system dedicated solely to environmental preservation, peace

, and human rights. New technologies are helping these worldwide communities cooperate more effectively and efficiently... Send and receive private messages to and from more than 18,000 international peace, environmental and conflict resolution users on o

ur affiliated networks or to millions of users on virtually any other network...Private conferences can be set up to facilitate internal group decision-making, task-sharing processes, or sensitive communications... APC is the most extensive global compute

r network... dedicated specifically to serving non-governmental organizations (NGOS) and citizen activists working for social chan~e." 
</ul><p>
Although IGC/APC is clearly a left-wing political organization, without actually joining IGC and reading its message traffic, it is difficult to assess the nature and extent of its members' actual real-world activities. Some of its conferences, however, a

ddress the following subjects:  
<ul>
<li>"Lists of companies and/or products to be considered for a boycott due to unsound   practices of the company, or unsound impacts of the product." 
<p>  
<li>"State security activities, surveillance, tapping<p> 
 <li> "...articles from 'Forward Motion,' a magazine of socialist ideas and action which seeks   to promote dialogue among grass-roots activists, build the working class as a force for   social change, and challenge white supremacy and national oppression

." 
<p>
 <li>"The Left List... a discussion forum dedicated to bringing together activists organizing   for fundamental social change and creating a common meeting ground for electronic   discussion, debate and collaboration." 
<p> 
 <li>"To aid in the planning and execution of campaigns to end the nuclear weapons era." 
<p> 
<li> "Information relevant to the campaign opposing U.S. military bases in Australia and the   Asian-Pacific region." 
<p>  
<li>"News, announcements and information from War Resisters International, on all   aspects of anti-militarist and nonviolent action worldwide." 
<p>  
<li>"Information and discussion regarding the anarchist and anti-authoritarian movement   and non-hierarchial organizing." 
<p>  
<li>"Monitoring activities of the extreme right." 
<p>  
<li>"...discussion related to the future of socialism, Marxism, or other non-exploitative   forms of economic relations..." 
  <p>
<li>"...a multicultural, multi-racial news conference for the politically progressive. The   conference also serves as a conduit for information from other Left Wing Sources." 
</ul><p>
There are also "alternative news sources" emerging overseas, that can play a significant, if slanted, role in filling gaps left by the reports issued by the mainstream news media. The most extensive set of alterative news networks appears to be operated b

y the IGC. According to an IGC document (Appendix): 
<p><ul>
"IGC News Service gathers and distributes alterative news and information to clients in the United States and abroad through a global network of distributed computers... IGC News Service is part of a worldwide network connecting primarily non-governmental

 organizations, alterative press and community broadcasters and is dedicated to the free flow of information, human rights and environmental preservation. IGC's regional and issue-oriented conferences serve as a repository for news, analysis, <i>calls for

 action</i> (emphasis added) and networking activities about that issue or region."

<a name="Predictions">Some Predictions</a></h3>

The following predictions are offered by the author, covering the next five to twenty years:
<p>
<b>New Political Parties Operating Though the Internet will Emerge</b> The convergence of large numbers of people of similar political persuasion through the Internet eventually will cause the development of political blocs, or parties, whose only means o

f interaction is through the Internet. Virtual conventions will be held over the Internet, where party platforms are agreed upon, and candidates for office are determined by vote. These activists will then interface with the "physical" world by running fo

r elective office, representing an electronic constituency. Virtual political parties of every type will be ad-hoc and may not be institutionalized for long periods of time like conventional parties; they may be orientated toward single issues or just a f

ew issues, and thus they may dissolve once the issues are resolved to their satisfaction. They will also not recognize any political or geographic boundaries. Electronic parties will transcend local, state, and even national borders. Membership in and act

ivism on behalf of these parties will occur on a global scale. They will increasingly make their presence felt in the internal political affairs of nations and in international affairs. The proliferation of these parties will also make the political scene

 much more complex, and multiple simultaneous political wars will occur in cyberspace. Due to the almost instantaneous transmission of news about current events to members and the very rapid development of responses to them via e-mail, these parties will 

be able to react almost immediately to developments that relate to their interests. This reactive speed will afford them a degree of influence that is disproportionately strong relative to their actual numbers. <p>
Although it will be essentially impossible to enforce party discipline in these semi-formal, loosely defined organizations, considerable political momentum will be achieved when large numbers of members support particular positions. Single-issue coalition

s between different parties with common interests will add to their potency. Financing would also be problematic, since members may be reluctant to transmit funds to a virtual "treasurer" for a party that might go out of existence without warning. However

, these parties will have modest financial requirements compared to current conventional political parties, since most of their operations will occur over the Internet. The only significant costs will be incurred by activities through which party leaders 

interface with the "real world" of Congress and the White House. Lobbying, advertising, membership drives, polling, and most other party activities will occur almost exclusively on the Internet at almost negligible financial cost. <p>

Political groups whose operations are coordinated through the Internet will be vulnerable to having their operations disrupted by false messages inserted by opposing groups. This will encourage the proliferation of encrypted messages. However, these group

s will face the dilemma that encrypting their messages excludes the wider audience, from which they hope to elicit sympathy and support. <p>
<b>The monopoly of the traditional mass media will erode</b>. No longer will the news editors and anchorpersons of television networks and newspapers solely determine what the mass audience learns and thinks about current events. Raw news reports from loc

al, national, and international news wires and alternative news sources, and from unaffiliated individual observers on the scene of events acting alone, will be accessible by all Internet users. The filtering and slanting of the news currently performed b

y traditional media will give way to some extent to direct consumption of un-analyzed information by the mass audience, diminishing the influence now enjoyed by those media An increasingly skeptical audience will be able to compare raw news reports with t

he pre-digested, incomplete, out-of- context, and sometimes biased renditions offered by television and newspapers. Some of the mass media will attempt to reassert their traditional roles on the Internet, and they will fail, because they will not have any

 advantage over their audience. Another consequence of this is that the average consumer of news on the Internet will have a much wider cognizance of current developments worldwide than currently, and will be more likely to have an opinion on overseas sit

uations. 
This is not to say that the traditional mass media will lose their audience and become insignificant. They will continue to play a major role in the national news flow. However, they will lose considerable ground to alternative sources and alternative int

erpretations circulating on the Internet. 
<p>
<b>Members of Congress and Federal Agency officials will be inexorably drawn into the Internet</b>. When members of Congress who do not currently have a presence on the Internet realize that other members (who may be political competitors or enemies) do h

ave a presence on the Internet, they will want to join themselves. Particularly when they understand that they are being attacked in the electronic political debates and there is no one in cyberspace to defend them, or even worse, that they are not being 

discussed at all, they will not be able to avoid joining. Remaining out of the Internet will increasingly be recognized as a strategic weakness and a sign of being behind the times. The same phenomenon will affect officials in the Executive Branch of the 

Federal Government. Increasing demands for public accountability will draw them into the Internet too, beyond simply posting news releases and other documentation online. Members of Congress and senior Federal officials will require staffs just to monitor

 and respond to the traffic. 
<p>
<b>Text-oriented e-mail will be replaced by video/audio messages</b>. As a result of reductions in the size and cost of high quality video cameras and improvements in video data compression technology, all personal computers in the future will be equipped

 with small video cameras, much as each computer today has a mouse. At the same time, the capacity of the communication links connecting personal computers to the Internet will greatly expand, due to replacement of twisted-pair copper telephone wires with

 fiber optic cables. These two trends will allow Internet users to compose messages consisting of compressed full-motion color video images of themselves speaking. When a user wants to send a message, he or she will first prepare a script and then speak t

he words for the camera while reading them from the computer screen like a teleprompter. The resulting data file will then be uploaded into the Internet and played back by all recipients using standard video playback hardware/software with which all compu

ters will be equipped. Although some users will prefer the anonymity of text-oriented e-mail, many others will find the urge to let the world see what they look like and hear what they sound like irresistible. The addition of the visual and audio dimensio

ns to computer-mediated communications will greatly expand the content of messages, since facial expression, tone of voice, body language, race, nationality, gender, and age all convey much information that is lost when flat text is used. Even today, a ty

pe of sign language has evolved in e-mail that attempts to make up for this. For example, the icon<b> ;-) </b>when viewed by tilting one's head to the left, resembles a face winking and smiling; the symbol <g> is used to connote "grin," a good-natured add

ition to signify that the message is sent in friendship, even if it is critical or sarcastic. When this iconography is replaced by full-motion color video with sound, the emotional impact and intensity of political debate on the-Internet will be greatly m

agnified. 
<p>
Politically oriented groups will realize the propaganda potential of video on the Internet, and will produce and disseminate video clips supporting their point of view. Internet users will have available to them a wide variety of political advertisements 

in the form of video files. Opposing groups will engage in video propaganda wars entirely within the Internet medium. 
<p>
<b>The Internet will be used as a tool of statecraft by national governments</b>. The use of the World Wide Web portion of the Internet by the Peruvian and Ecuadorian governments is highly significant. Those nations, not renowned for their technological s

ophistication, have been the first to bring international diplomacy officially into the online world. Although many governments currently have an official presence on the Internet, they provide only standard embassy-type public affairs statements, with in

formation about their populations, cultures, industries, and businesses. In the future, as more governments recognize the strategic value of this new medium for conveying their message, they will use it as an additional tool in the political process. That

 is, the current type of information placed on the Internet by official government organizations will be supplemented with politically-oriented material conveying argumentation favorable to their respective positions on issues important to them. When one 

country involved in a dispute with others begins to use the Internet in this way, and the other countries become aware of this, a catalytic effect will occur, whereby all involved countries enter into the electronic debate in an official way. 
<p>
<b>The Internet will play an increasingly significant role in international conflict</b>. Political discussions among the members of the online public at large, and real-world activities of national leaders, representatives of electronic political parties

 and interest groups, world bodies such as the U.N., commercial enterprises, and individual political activists, will be energized by the Internet. Current information about conflicts placed on the Internet in real time by on-the-scene observers and alter

native news sources will be voraciously devoured by the world audience and will have an immediate and tangible impact on the course of events. Video footage of military operations will be captured by inexpensive, hand-held digital video cameras operated b

y local individuals, transformed unedited into data files, and then uploaded into the global information flow, reaching millions of people in a matter of minutes. Public opinion and calls for action (or calls to terminate actions) may be formed before nat

ional leaders have a chance to develop positions or to react to developments. These factors will greatly add to the burden on military commanders, whose actions will be subjected to an unprecedented degree of scrutiny. 
<p>
<h3><a name="Assessment">Assessment</a></h3>
<p>
<i>Political Roles</i>
<p>
While there is already a great deal of political use of the Internet domestically and internationally, there is likely to be a significant increase in the scale and sophistication of such use in the coming years. Due to the differences in concentration of

 Internet use between different areas of the world, the impact of the Internet in directly influencing public opinion is likely to be heaviest in the U.S., less in other parts of the developed world such as Europe, and still less in the undeveloped world.

 Individual activists operating in less-developed countries, though, are likely to bring the Internet with them in the form of laptop computers that can access the Internet through any telephone line. Information brought into those countries through the s

mall numbers of Internet access points can be spread locally through more traditional methods such as print, radio broadcast, and word of mouth. The activists will also be able to use the Internet to disseminate information to the rest of the world and to

 help coordinate their activities. 
<p>
The Internet is clearly a significant long term strategic threat to authoritarian regimes, one that they will be unable to counter effectively. News from the outside world brought by the Internet into nations subjugated by such regimes will clash with the

 distorted versions provided by their governments, eroding the credibility of their positions and encouraging unrest. "Personal" contact between people living under such governments and people living in the free world, conducted via e-mail, will also help

 achieve a more accurate understanding on both ends and further undermine authoritarian controls. Information about violations of human rights and other forms of oppression will be increasingly conveyed to the outside world by the Internet, helping mobili

ze external political forces on behalf of the oppressed. 
It is thought by some analysts that the concepts of "national sovereignty" and "nation state" are becoming less relevant due to greatly increased economic, political, and cultural linkages that cut across national boundaries. To the extent that this is tr

ue, the Internet will play an important role, since it is the medium through which an increasing volume of these types of linkages will take place. <p>
<i>Intelligence</i>
<p>
The Internet is a potentially lucrative source of intelligence useful to DoD. This intelligence can include: 
  <p><ul>
<li>Reports on current events 
<li>Analytic assessments by politically astute observers on or near the scene of those   events, many of whom offer unique insights 
 <li>Information about the plans and operations of politically active groups. 
</ul>
John Anderson's concept for using the Internet to provide early warning of impending security threats has a great deal of merit. Internet message traffic about developing situations tends to precede news and intelligence reporting, since the individuals w

ho originate that traffic are not constrained by the resource limitations to which news and intelligence organizations are subject. Those organizations must prioritize their efforts, focusing on what appears to be the most important items of the moment. I

ndividual observers overseas who have access to the Internet can write about anything that interests them. It is likely that routine monitoring of messages originating in other countries would help provide strategic warning of developing security threats 

that would be of concern to the United States. 
<p>
At the same time, it should be noted that a great deal of the message traffic on the Internet is idle chit-chat with no intelligence value whatsoever, a veritable "Tower of Babble." Monitoring of that traffic would need to be supported by automated filter

s that pass through for human analysis only those messages that satisfy certain relevance criteria. It is also important to note that the accuracy of much of the information on the Internet would be suspect: 
"Information and disinformation about breaking events are pretty raw on the Net. That's the point. You don't know what to think of any particular bit of information, how to gauge its credibility... You never really know how to gauge the credibility of the

 nightly news or the morning paper, either..."[Rheingold] 
<p>
Thus new means of validating information received in this way would be needed. Alteratively, news reports on the Internet could be used to cue higher confidence means of U.S. intelligence collection, by alerting us to potentially important factors and all

owing us to orient and focus our collection more precisely. 
<p>
Beside being used to develop early warning of developing conflicts or the beginnings of new global trends or "sea changes," the Internet can be used at the opposite end of the spectrum: to obtain pinpoint information about specific matters of interest. Ne

tworks of human sources with access to the Internet could be developed in areas of security concern to the U.S., and these sources could be oriented to seek specific needed information. If constructed and managed correctly, such a system could be much mor

e responsive and efficient than the current complex, unwieldy intelligence tasking and collection processes we must use. We might even consider cultivating the capability to perform strategic reconnaissance "by modem." This approach could never replace of

ficial DoD intelligence collection systems or services, but could be a useful adjunct. 
<p>
The Internet can also serve counterintelligence purposes. For example, a message posted recently in an Internet discussion group for left-wing political activists repeated for their benefit an Associated Press article about an upcoming U.S. Army Special O

perations Command training exercise directed at the (empty) St. Moritz Hotel in Miami Beach (see Appendix C). 
<p>
If it became widely known that DoD were monitoring Internet traffic for intelligence or counterintelligence purposes, individuals with personal agendas or political purposes in mind, or who enjoy playing pranks, would deliberately enter false or misleadin

g messages. Our analysis function would need to account for this. 
<p>
<i>Support to Policy Making</i>
<p>
Beyond intelligence, the insights and analyses of thoughtful overseas observers such as educators, former politicians, local journalists and officials of other governments could be very useful to U.S. policy making. E-mail discussions about the likely con

sequences of various policy approaches to security problems could help improve the quality of U.S. policy making. A great deal of "brain power" exists on the Internet, and if it could be harnessed and channeled for productive purposes, it might be a usefu

l addition to DoD's informational and political assets. Any such use, of course, would have to be protected by appropriate security measures. 
<p>
<i>Support to Civil Affairs Programs</i>
<p>
The Internet has substantial value to the Civil Affairs community in helping to establish contacts and closer working relationships with non-governmental organizations. In pursuit of the goal of minimizing the U.S. government's role in executing civil sec

tor programs in favor of a stronger role by non-military organizations, the Internet can be used to accelerate and strengthen activities among all parties. In addition, a project is underway to identify public online information bases accessible through t

he Internet that contain data useful to Civil Affairs programs. A substantial volume of relevant information has been found. 
<p>
<i>Offensive Uses</i>
<p>
Just as the U.S. could be vulnerable to disinformational e-mail, politically active groups using the Internet could be vulnerable to deceptive messages introduced by hostile persons or groups. Far-right groups and far-left groups tend to watch each other,

 and it is likely that "moles" will obtain access to the other camps' networks for the purpose of disrupting their operations. This would tend to weaken the protection afforded by coding or encrypting messages. 
<p>
Increasingly, officials in national governments, foreign military officers, business persons, and journalists, are obtaining access to the Internet and establishing individual e-mail addresses. There is even a commercial service that will shortly offer ac

cess to an online database of the names, organizational titles, phone/fax numbers, and Internet e-mail addresses of virtually all government officials in all countries. Using this information, it would be possible to employ the Internet as an additional m

edium for Psychological Operations (Psyops) campaigns. E-mail conveying the U.S. perspective on issues and events could be efficiently and rapidly disseminated to a very wide audience. 
<p>
The U.S. might be able to employ the Internet offensively to help achieve unconventional warfare objectives. Information could be transmitted over the Internet to sympathetic groups operating in areas of concern that allows them to conduct operations them

selves that we might otherwise have to send our own special forces to accomplish. Although such undertakings would have their own kinds of risks, they would have the benefit of reducing the physical risks to our special forces personnel, and limiting the 

direct political involvement of the United States since the actions we desire would be carried out by indigenous groups. 
<p>
<i>Roles During Conflict</i>
<p>
Even if the actual presence of the Internet in the location of a conflict is very limited, the widespread access to Internet available in the U.S. and other parts of the developed world will provide a medium over which political debate and activism relate

d to that conflict can occur. Thus the Internet can indirectly play an important role in the way the world deals with a conflict, without having substantial physical presence within the conflict. The Internet can play an important positive role during fut

ure international crises and conflicts. In the chaotic conditions usually present in such situations, normal government and commercial reporting channels are often unreliable or unavailable, and the Internet might be one of the few means of communication 

present. Some of its uses might include: 
<p>  
<ul>
<li>Getting news out of the region and into the U.S. government 
<li>Getting information from the U.S. and other nations into the region 
<li>Cultivating political and even operational support for the U.S. side and opposition to   the other side. 
</ul>
<p>
In order to use the Internet most productively for such purposes, it would be necessary for DoD to address it directly and explicitly as an integral asset, rather than as an uncontrollable element of the environment whose role is determined by happenstanc

e or as an afterthought. If viewed as a resource and systematically integrated into our planning and operations, the Internet can make some important contributions to conflict management and assuring the success of U.S. foreign policy. 

<h3><a name="Recommendations">Recommendations</a></h3>

<i>NOTE: The recommendations listed below should be carried out only in full compliance with the letter and the spirit of the law, and without violating the privacy of American citizens </i><p>
<ul>
<li>All DoD professional and support personnel should have an Internet e-mail address   with convenient access and a user-friendly interface.
<p> 
<li>Individual analysts in DoD intelligence agencies should routinely monitor Internet   traffic (that is readily accessible to the general public) related to their responsibilities.   Agencies should establish high volume internal outlets to provide them

 with this traffic,   subject to appropriate relevance filters. 
<p>  
<li>DoD intelligence agencies should investigate the role of the Internet in helping   coordinate the operations of political activists and paramilitary groups in regions of   interest 
<p>  
<li>An early warning capability should be established that uses Internet messages to help   identify developing situations overseas that could lead to security threats 
<li>  
Officials planning and conducting DoD civil affairs programs overseas should be   informed about any activists working in their vicinity who use the Internet 
<li>  
The OSD Public Affairs site on the Internet should accept feedback from callers and   should provide responses, using the full potential of the Internet for supporting DoD   public affairs programs. Although it would be impractical to provide an individua

l   reply to every incoming e-mail message, statistical profiles of opinions conveyed by   large volumes of messages could be used to compose periodic DoD bulletins addressing   them in general terms. This would help provide a semi-interactive environment

 within   our resource limitations.
<p>
<li>Subject to appropriate security and propriety precautions, DoD officials involved in   formulating DoD policy should be given access to the advice and thinking of people on   the Internet with relevant expertise. 
<p>  
<li>DoD should continue to monitor the evolution of the Internet and its role in national   security. 
<p>  
<li>The Internet should be incorporated in our Psyops planning as an additional medium. 
<p>  
<li>Means of employing the Internet offensively in support of our unconventional warfare   objectives should be explored. 
<p>  
<li>Senior DoD officials should be kept aware of domestic U.S. political developments on   the Internet that relate to DoD interests.

<h2>PRESS RELEASE</h2>

<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE </b><br>
December 15, 1995
<p>
Upon the announcement of San Diego as the selected location for the 1996 Republican National Convention, local activists began gearing up to meet the GOP with a series of protests and demonstrations. 
<p>
With the GOP's historical opposition to women's equality, Lesbian & Gay civil rights, and freedom of choice, and with the party's support for Prop 187, insensitivity to environmental issues, and hawkish pro-war stances, the possibilities for expressing po

pular dissent against Republican policies are virtually endless. For that reason, a local committee is forming to help facilitate the largest number of protests and demonstrations for the broadest range of issues possible. 
<p>
Called Protest: GOP '96, the committee seeks to serve as a local point of contact for organizations from across the country intending to demonstrate during the GOP Convention in August of 1996. Keith Ramsey, a co-founder of Queer Nation/San Diego who also

 assisted with the reorganization of ACT-UP/San Diego several years ago, is coordinating the formation of the committee. "My goal in organizing the group is to assist in any way possible any organization that wishes to demonstrate during the '96 conventio

n." Ramsey expects the Protest committee to fulfill that goal by providing maps and timetables showing where and when other organizations have planned events and by serving as liaison with local law-enforcement agencies and other government bodies. "We ca

n help groups in other regions secure the necessary local permits, make hotel arrangements, and by providing other similar services," says Ramsey. "And by maintaining a central information file we can curtail conflicts between organizations trying to asse

mble at the same place and time which will make the scheduled demonstrations run more smoothly." 
<p>
Members of the Califomia Green Party, ACT UP, and the Radical Faeries have already been contacted and have expressed enthusiastic support for the project, as have a number of individuals not affiliated with particular organizations. 
Viewing the committee more as a networking resource than as a protesting group in its own right, Ramsey anticipates utilizing a number of media to disseminate information. In addition to establishing a telephone number and post office box, Protest: GOP '9

6 will have an account on the Internet, complete with an e-mail address and a World Wide Web home page accessible through Mosaic and other web browsers. Until those accounts have been set up, anyone needing information on the committee or who would like t

Export Control As a Proactive Defensive 
Information Warfare Mechanism</H2>
by 
Winn Schwaratau</Center><BR>



<P>Information Warfare in both a commercial or military model is generally categorized as either offensive or defensive, but one can argue for the inclusion of a third category, Proactive Defensive Information Warfare (PDIW),  which contains characteristics of the former two. </P>

<P>Offensive Information Warfare would consist of specifically offensive actions to deactivate opposition infrastructure, ability to communicate, ability to collect, transmit  or use information.  It well might involve the use of passive data collection (insidiousness) through any available means, or the use of mis/dis-information, or any of a number of other approaches which are outline in "Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway."</P>

<P>Defensive information warfare would include countermeasures to defeat any offensive actions on the part of either a known or unknown adversary.  Hardening of missile silos against the secondary EMP effects of a nuclear attack certainly fits into this category: the defensive goal being to maintain availability of information system to permit an appropriate response.  On a smaller, less cataclysmic scale, the use of Tempest shielding to prevent remote eavesdropping of spurious information from information systems is certainly defensive in nature.  And so is the use of sophisticated encryption and key management techniques to keep data transmissions and storage media free from breaches of confidentiality and integrity threats. </P>

<P>Proactive Defensive Information Warfare techniques, though, do not cleanly fall into either mode, although a case could be made along either or both lines.   Such appears to bt the case when export control mechanisms such as ITAR and COCOM, are employed.  A compelling case can be made for this third category to be actively used to protect US military and commercial interests.  As we shall see, IW and PDIW are symmetrical, and similar techniques can be used against our own infrastructure by foreign information warriors.</P>

<P>ITAR and COCOM export restrictions are, at a high level, intended to keep so-called 'sensitive technology' out of the hands of certain, policy chosen, third parties.  (It is the not the intent of this paper to identify those individuals, groups or nation-states; these will change from time to time as geopolitical and econo-technical conditions evolve.  We will only refer to them for discussion's sake as Potential Adversaries.)  Nonetheless, the commercial sector has made consistent arguments over the last decade, and most notably since the end of the Cold War, that export restrictions have inherent points of failure, and thus our export policies should be altered to reflect new realities in a global market.</P>
<UL>
<LI>	Much of the US restricted technology is available anyway from foreign companies who may not adhere to US export controls and laws.  Therefore, why bother with export controls over such items.

<LI>	 History has shown that many restricted export technology regulations have been easily bypassed by less than scrupulous manufacturers and through multi-pathed distribution channels.

<LI> US Customs (and Customs of other countries) does not have the ability to perform 100% inspections, and often the technology is beyond their scope of expertise to make a determination upon.

<LI>	Some restricted export technology is only restricted in its final assembled form, thereby permitting legal export of subsystems and components, wherein the final 'export-restricted' product is assembled by the Potential Adversary.

<LI>	 US companies have argued that based upon the 'holes' in the export policy and enforcement, many export regulations are simply rendered ineffective.

<LI>	 Some US companies further argue that the loss to the US economy is import revenues and domestic employment is a greater threat than the export of the technology itself.</P></UL>

<P>This debate has gone on in various arenas for years, but as global availability of advanced fundamental technology proliferates, the efficacy of export restrictions has been further weakened.  </P>

<P>The most visible debate which has reached the front pages of the conventional media has been over the export control of encryption.  For example, Bruce Scheier's book, "Applied Cryptography" is fully able to be exported without restriction, even though it contains detailed source code listings of popular, unclassified encryption algorithms.  However, the exact same material, when copied onto electronic media such s floppy disk, has been denied an export license under current ITAR interpretation. </P>

<P>Detractors of the current export policy maintain that the policy does not inhibit the export of the 'restricted technology,' and indeed may call more attention to its particular value.  A similar failure can be observed with the export control of DES (Data Encryption Standard) under ITAR, even though DES has been a US public domain standard since 1976.  Today, despite attempts at export control, approximately 50% of the world's DES products are not made in the United States.  What further exacerbates US manufacturers, is not only the loss of international market share, but when a US company uses a non-US DES engine, he is free to import the raw components from countries such as Germany, Taiwan and Japan, but he is restricted from re-exporting them.  In some cases, this has caused manufacturing and re-assembly of these devices to be moved to non-US soil where export restrictions are more relaxed.</P>

<P>The emergence of the Internet further adds fuel to the argument that export controls are not effective. Phil Zimmermann wrote a software based encryption program called PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) which employs a public-key technology.  PGP was placed on a computer node connected to the Internet (by persons unknown) and thus is now a virtual standard for private electronic communications on the Internet.  As a result Zimmerman is facing possible prosecution by the Department of Justice for alleged export control violations.</P>

<P>The ostensible aim of cryptographic export control is to make the US intelligence community's job easier.  Given that the NSA is the electronic listening post as the interests of the US dictate, they understandably want to make their job as easy as possible.  Intercepting signals transmissions is only one part of their task.  The other is to make sense of them from a contents standpoint.  Thus, the more cryptographically encoded transmissions they encounter, the more time, money - resources- they must expend to fulfill their task.  It is completely within reason, from their perspective then, that they actively promote and lobby for adherence to ITAR in the area of cryptography.</P>

<P>This is clearly once area in which we have already seen the NSA proactive in what we might now call Proactive Defensive Information Warfare.  NSA wants to make their job easier not harder, so they expend efforts to encourage cryptographic export, but only under certain conditions.  </P>

<P>When a cryptographic engine is under export control review for either specific foreign customers or a general license, NSA acts a reviewing counsel to the Department of State and Commerce.  In some cases, the export is completely denied or permitted.  Intuitively, such decisions would likely be decided upon by the relative difficulty of decoding such encrypted messages, but the details of export permission/denial are not publicly available. In other cases, though, the NSA will confer with the manufacturer/designer who is attempting export, and ask that certain changes to the encryption engine be made.  </P>

<P>Some manufacturers allege that the changes instituted by the NSA are designed with two goals in mind, both of which neatly fit into the PDIW concept.</P>

<OL>
<LI>	NSA suggests changes to the algorithm and encryption engine to make their decryption of intercepted messages using that engine simpler.</P>

<LI>	 NSA suggests changes which 'label' the encrypted message with a 'flag' so that upon interception, they know which process to employ for rapid decryption.  </P>
</OL>
<P>This second approach is subtle, but reminiscent of other signals interception techniques.  No manufacturer has suggested that upon examination of the source code that the NSA triggered alterations actually place a header or tail on the transmission which say, "I am encryption technique XV367, use decryption process F618."  That is too obvious a trap which would not meet the subtler needs of the capable Information Warrior or serious adversary.</P>

<P>Rather, private crypto code analysts maintain, the NSA changes create a cryptographic 'signature' which becomes part of the message.  Marshall McCluen's "The medium is the message" prediction comes patently to life with such a tactic.  Once a signal is intercepted, and upon the discovery that the signal is somehow encoded. through the use of sophisticated real-time analysis tools, the code breakers determine which encryption algorithm was used in the encoding.  Then, if they so choose, they employ the inverse as a crypto-analytic attack upon the message. This can also be viewed as a sublte form of Steganography, the inclusion of a private communication within an open one, such that the casual observer cannot determine the meaning of the hidden information, or even that such information exists.</P>

<P>This approach makes total sense since NSA had spent extensive resources on electromagnetic eavesdropping techniques from keyboards, monitor screens and printers.  They prepared what is called Digram tables for a myriad of printers - each of which exhibits specific electromagnetic patterns upon analysis.  Thus, when US intelligence places a covert eavesdropping device into an opposition's IT equipment, based upon the device's known catelogued patterns, analysis of the actual signal contents becomes an exercise in computing horsepower. </P>

<P>This is an ideal example of PDIW.  Permit the export of 'restricted technology' but insure that within that exported commodity, a so-called 'back door' is in place which largely nullify much of its original purpose.  </P>

<P>But these 'secret' techniques are fairly 'open' and the NSA's real or perceived policies, are (rightly or wrongly) deemed for what their detractors claim them to be: thinly disguised attempts at restricting export of technology through fear and loathing and disinformation.  Therefore, the quality and inttegrity of exported US crypto products is increasingly viewed with suspicion by the majority of industrialized nations.  A secondary goal is thus achieved: imbue distrust into the approved export products which will diminish their use. I would suggest that a backlash effect can occur, where independant cryptographic efforts from other countries develop even hard to crack codes. Only the NSA knows for sure.</P>

<P>As a vehicle of PDIW, NSA control over cryptographic export restriction is like having Ronald McDonald pick the world's best hamburger.  However, from a strategic policy standpoint, it makes a lot of sense.  And so do other similar instances,</P>

<P>In the late 1960's. Poland wanted to purchase a new telephone system.  Obviously, AT&T with its latest generation of telephone switching equipment, as did others,  wanted to be the recipient of such a mega-dollar contract. However, the export of such technology was restricted to a Soviet bloc country.  A deal was reached, a critical part of which the Poles were ignorant.  The AT&T switch would receive export permission if certain alterations to the switching system were made.  Poland would never know the difference, since all apparent systemic functionality would be unimpaired.  </P>

<P>What was added to the Poland bound telephone switch was the equivalent of a remote controlled 'self destruct' switch.  The goal was simple, obvious and effective.   According to knowledgable sources within the NSA, AT&T made certain modifications to the system that would permit we, the good guys, to, at will, remotely access and subsequently shut down the telecommunications infrastructure that was controlled by this equipment.  The thinking was, "only hypothetically, mind you; you can't use my name" (said the NSA gal/guy) "that in case of a Soviet incursion into Western Europe - through Poland - we (the US/NATO) could shut down land based telecomm in a microsecond."</P>

<P>More recently, the US military used the media as an unwitting participant in an active mis/disinformation campaign  example.  Government representatives claimed that during the opening minutes of the Gulf War, we injected a hardware based computer virus into a printer destined for Iraq.   Because the virus was so smart, we (the Allies) were then able shut down Iraq's Windows 3.0 based air defense systems,  (US News and Report unknowingly bought into this story despite massive substantiation that the entire tale was in reality a replay of an April Fool's hoax originally printed in the computer industry magazine, InfoWorld.) </P>

<P>What really happened, though, is that the NSA built a special integrated circuit in their own silicon foundry at Fort Meade. Designed to duplicate the functions of a chip within a printer, it of course performed as expected, but it also contained special circuitry to broadcast a unique low-level electromagnetic signature which was detectable by intelligence satellites.  The purpose was to track the routing and identify the final destination of the printer.  This intelligence gave the Allies additional bombing target options of information processing centers.  </P>

<P>A similar approach has been taken with North Korea.  Although under severe ITAR and COCOM restriction, North Korea has been able to build a formidable military machine.  One of their main military processing centers is run by an old IBM series 370 mainframe with an old, presumably altered version of the company's operating system.  It is claimed that we have the means to deactivate that center through at least two back door channels in the event of heightened readiness or imminent  conflict.  </P>

<P>The IBM AS-400 series computers are also export restricted to North Korea, but the country has apparently been able to acquire up to a few hundred of them, allegedly from a distribution point in India.  These machines are directly tied to the offensive capabilities of that country, and thus of strategic value.  Specifically, a denial of service assault upon them would be a prime means to deactivate much of North Korea's military power.  </P>

<P>Certainly a very clean, non-lethal (and politically acceptable) method of launching a successfully denial of service attack against these machines is preferable to physical assaults.  Again, with the unwitting cooperation of the Indian government, ITAR export permits allowed the export of this advanced technology to India, from where (the planning assumed), the machines would soon find a anew home: North Korea.  </P>

<P>But these machines are different.  They have been 'chipped' with special NSA manufactured silicon devices, designed to fail upon command.  Either single or multiple silicon critical component which are presumably difficult to acquire and replace are carefully chosen as the chipping targets.  The exact details are likely classified, but the general technique uses a remote high frequency 'trigger' signal that the modified chip 'hears.'  Conceptually no more complex than a child's remote control device, the target chip fails, and thus causes a systemic denial of service event.  In the event of conflict, the US military obviously gains a significant advantage.</P>

<P>Let's then briefly consider how such similar PDIW mechanisms can present the US with both opportunity and risk.</P>

<P>From a military and national intelligence standpoint, these techniques meet a number of key criteria.</P>
<OL>
<LI>	 Conceptually simple.
<LI>	 Highly efficient.
<LI>	 Reasonably 'safe' (non-lethally speaking).
<LI>	 Insidious and extremely difficult to detect.
<LI>	 Highly targetable.
</OL>
<P>Such techniques will continue to be used more extensively in PDIW for the above reasons, but we now can ask ourselves, just how far beyond tthe domain of the military and conventional national security should we take this tact?  Third world countries do not have the resources to develop their own technology and must source it from first world technology nations, most of whom subscribe to ITAR or COCOM -like policies. </P>

<P>If listening devices, tracking devices, trap-door software, or self-destruct mechanisms are built into both critical and non-critical US manufactured export systems, (with or without the assistance of the original manufacturer for security reasons) at what point does the target Potential Adversary suspect that all US sourced equipment is so configured?  Will this approach cause a shift to purchase of non-US equipment because either the equipment is modified for PDIW, or merely because it is suspected that the equipment might be so altered?  And if so, what effect does this have on export revenues, domestic employment and strategic advantage?  </P>

<P>Alternatively, similar tactics can be used on greater quantities of US exports, to include non-critical export items so that even off-shore assembly of systems would be infected with any of a number of embedded weaknesses?  For example, if high speed line printers were outfitted with an electromagnetic detector to read the solenoid signatures as printing occurred, a similarly planted transmitter could send the printer output to a convenient listening post.  The Russians allegedly used this approach, (however with a more crude implementation) by so 'bugging' Moscow based US State Department teletype machines in the early 1980's.  Upon receipt of the signals, a digram analysis is performed for a real-time reading of the machine's output.</P>

<P>When one considers that the French put listening devices in first class seats of Air France airplanes as a part of their national economic intelligence program, we should consider what technologies are available to the US for similar intelligence gathering or denial of service capability.</P>

<P>On the risk side, the US private sector and government are potentially vulnerable to similar strategies.  Much of the technology used in both commercial and classified systems are sourced from the Far East, even though integration and deployment are domestic.  Low level, silicon implementations of common functionality are bought on price: they are commodity items. But what happens when an insidiously designed piece of hardware or software, destined for a critical system (private or government) is remotely triggered to fail? Or if the MTBF is built right in as a form or Denial of Service through pre-planned pbsolescence? Woth a second or two of condsideration.</P>

<P>The symmetrical nature of export controlled PDIW becomes apparent, when we become the potential victim. Commercially available keyboards have been found with pre-programmed silicon chips that insert nasty messages into word processors. Funny? Maybe not so funny in many applications.</P>

<P>The risks are becoming more defined as our reliance upon technology increases daily. The risks to 'our side' also increase if our trading partners fear that we may use such techniques as a form of PDIW. There is no clean, simple solution that fits within 10 pages.</P>

<P>Thus, part and parcel of quality systems design and security considerations, should be an analysis of the defensive postures needed to thwart exported information technology products based PDIW assaults against the US.  The solutions to this conundrum are not simple, implying a greater expenditure of resources to develop identification methods, and then expending the time to perform thorough inspections.</P>

<P>Since such export controlled PDIW techniques give us potential advantage as well as point our potential weaknesses, policy must be developed for export controls as they apply to PDIW, and policies must be developed which would provide additional protection to our domestic private and government infrastructures.</P>

<H2><Center>Ethical Conundra of Information Warfare</H2>
by Winn Schwartau</Center>
<BR>

<p>At first blush it sounds so clean. </p>

<p>So non violent. So intangible. Then you get to thinking about it.</p>

<p>Information Warfare. </p>

<p>In the late 1980's, the military began to think about a new kind of warfare; on in which the American populace could be more supportive in whatever overt or covert actions were required. A new and better kind of warfare; more palatable for the dinner eating, news watching family of four. Vietnam era pictures on the six o'clock news graphically showed dead soldiers and children burning from napalm strikes which did not fit neatly with the desired American image of White Hat, Mom and Apple Pie. As a country, we are not comfortable with viewing ourselves as baby killers or unleashing mass destruction just for the hell of it.</p>
<p>The media has had a tremendous effect on how we view war, and with the advent of "anywhere, anytime" instant remote communications, our soldiers are no longer thousands of miles away, fighting for American national interests. Today, they fight in real time, in our living rooms, where not only we, but the entire world watches and judges our actions.</p>
<p>Consider the involvement of US troops in Somalia. Media broadcasts of horrendous conditions, fiefdom-like chaos and civilian tragedies created a swell of urging for America to do something to assist a helpless population. And so we landed on East African shores for a peace keeping mission. But oddly enough, the media beat us to the punch. Entrenched on the hot beachheads with their cameras and boom microphones, live broadcasts of arriving Marines filled the airwaves. And then we went to work, attempting to bring some sort of order to a country in dire straits.</p>
<p>But our exit from Somalia was as cathartic as our entry. Full color videos of Somalian rebels dragging a dead US soldier through the streets in effigy was too much for most Americans too stomach. Nearly instantly, support for US intervention waned and we pulled out.</p>
<p>Based upon conversations with, and getting to know hundreds of military folks over the last five years, I believe that a new breed of soldier, a post-World War II soldier is coming to the fore. We are being guided by military leaders who are charged with defending our country, but who are also keenly aware that we do indeed live in a new world. They thoroughly understand that the typical war fighting projection of power must be handled in ways that not only make military sense, but do not violate the political, social and ethical consciences of those who must support them. </p>
<p>Now this might sound like a George Bushism, but I believe that the US military genuinely wants to be a kinder and gentler fighting force. Inherently, we have attained what might be referred to as an enhanced consciousness. We have a fundamental desire to whip the bad guy's butt, but we want to do it honestly, quickly, efficiently and with a minimum of bloodshed. From what I have seen and learned as a civilian, every effort is being made to develop ways for America to fight a clean war.</p>
<p>The military has been developing an array of technologies which fit into the non-lethal category. Sticky-foam which when shot out of a hand held 'cannon,' binds the enemy in a spider web of inescapable gluey substances. Sonic cannons which incapacitate adversarial forces. Nerve shattering electromagnetic emanations which effectively paralyze the enemy's ability to function. </p>
<p>But none of the non-lethal methods have attracted as much attention as Information Warfare.</p>

<h4>                                          Info-War</h4>

<p>The definition I first proposed for Information Warfare back in 1993 was a conflict in which "information and information systems act as both the weapons and the targets." At that time the working military definitions of InfoWar were classified, but some versions were close to the one I offered. Today, the Pentagon's working definition of InfoWar has been expanded to include the concepts "deny, destroy or intercept adversary computer, network or communications, while protecting ones own."</p>
<p>The other criteria I have used when describing Information Warfare is the total absence of bombs, bullets or other conventional tools of physical destruction. Thinking in this focused manner, concentrating exclusively within the virtual domain, or fourth dimension of warfare, hones the process of problem solving and generates new paradigms of thought.</p>
<p>Within this model of (Pure) Information Warfare, many options become apparent that are no so readily available for conventional conflict. </p>
<p>Simply put, if we (or anyone else for that matter) flies a plane into the airspace of a sovereign state and drops a load of bombs, there is a reasonable chance that such an act would be considered an act of war. However, we must note that the US has not "officially" been at war with anyone since the end of World War II, which further complicates the process. (I say this with full recognition and respect for the soldiers and families who suffered during the last half century of conflict in undeclared 'wars.')</p>
<p>Consider that in the last decade or so, several international allegedly unprovoked "shoot-downs" did not trigger war: the Soviet downing of KAL 007; the American missiles that shot a civilian Iranian jet-liner; the recent Cuban fatal interception of Cesnas in the Caribbean. Then consider that in 1986, American warplanes ravaged through downtown Tripoli and we did not see a military response.</p>
<p>The bottom line we have come to accept, perhaps in too cavalier a fashion, is that we are King of the Hill militarily: we are the big kids on the block, and don't screw with us if you know what's good for you. Thus, one could argue, we have seen an increase in terrorist type state-side events from non-US interests. They can't beat us in a "fair" fight, so they resort to terrorism.</p>
<p>Now with the advent of Information Warfare as an increasingly viable option to conventional armed conflict, we should inwardly examine those issues which we must openly face, come to terms with, and if I had my say-so, clearly announce our policy and attentions about to the world.</p>
<p>Pure Information Warfare takes many forms, and I will concern myself with only Class II and Class III InfoWar as detailed in "Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway." </p>
<p>             Offensive Capabilities</p>
<p>Forgetting about the defensive aspects for a moment, what do we have in our arsenal that would permit the US to wage InfoWar against an adversary, whether by the military or by other officially government sanctioned organizations? Briefly, they include:</p>
<UL>
<LI>Offensive software: viruses, Trojan horses, embedded exported systems or other malicious software.<BR>
<LI>Sniffing the communications of foreign (domestic) civilian and military networks and communications.<BR>
<LI>Tempest style eavesdropping upon electronic devices with characteristic emissions.<BR>
<LI>Chipping: hardware based embedded malicious software in <BR>
<LI>Directed energy weapons which disable or destroy electronic systems.<BR>
<LI>A full range of PsyOps capabilities.<BR>

</UL>

<p>Used in various combinations, deployed by a politically willing and ably armed force, these 'weapons' have the capability to potentially replace much of our military's conventional means of conflict? </p>
<p>But, should we use them, other than in times of 'war,' (ie, Gulf Conflict) or as an adjunct to conventional conflict? Can the weapons of Information Warfare stand alone as means of projection of force?</p>
<p>This is the ethical conundrum that we face today.</p>
<p>* * * * </p>
<p>Is it ethically correct for the US to defend its economic national security interests by resorting to those same tactics that are used against us? </p>
<p>It goes without saying that the United States is a highly visible and rich target for the theft of intellectual property from the private sector, and to a lesser degree from the military sector. We have the most sophisticated spying apparatus in the world. to the tune of nearly $30 billions per year, but to date the immense sscapabilities have been relegated to Cold War tactics and military protectionism.</p>
<p>Should we, restructure our 'eyes' and 'ears' to the industrial and economic treasures of our friends and adversaries alike, not with the prime intentions of military advantage, but global economic supremacy instead? We know full well that in less than two decades, unless radical steps are taken, the United States will become second or third in national global economic might. Should we not utilize the same tactics and techniques as our competition? </p>
<p>Or, do we find it ethically displeasing to "read other men's mail?" On the other hand, what choice do we have?</p>
<p>Is there a middle ground, perhaps? That while we may choose to listen to our competitors, we will do nothing overt to actively disrupt their operations? Or do we find ourselves in the position that must use clandestine and covert methods. Perhaps we should employ technical mercenaries, in no way officially affiliated with the US government, who will remotely, invisibly and deniably effect our will. </p>
<p>The capability is distinctly there. Some corporations are allegedly already engaged in such missions for their own behest; but, if caught, will the US prosecute those persons who are operating in the best interests of our country?</p>
<p>Ethical considerations, whose decisions, will set the American tone for generations to come. </p>
<p>Another option we face, which also creates and ethical dilemma, is whether we should use Export Control as Means of Proactive Defensive Information Warfare. </p>
<p>The US has the capability to export technology, ostensibly for the good of the buyer and the seller. However, using advanced software and hardware techniques, we can also export goods that can effectively be used as 'weapons' if indeed the need so arises. In the early 1970's, according to intelligence sources, when AT&amp;T sold a national telephone switch to Poland (then a Warsaw Pact country), they were asked to include 'bits and pieces' that would allow the United States to remotely shut down the country's communications infrastructure. The idea was that in the event of a Soviet land based incursion, we would slow down and perhaps thwart hostile activities. Similarly, it has been claimed by other sources, that we have developed similar capabilities against North Korean military computers.</p>
<p>The question becomes though, should we as a country exploit this capability by using 'infected' or malicious software, or by installing modified silicon chips whose payload can be activated by the US when deemed appropriate? In a world of global competition, and as military, national economic and civilian interests converge, how do we draw a line between those actions that should be taken, and those from which we should refrain?</p>

<h4>Collateral Damage</h4>

<p>I pose this situation for your consideration.</p>
<p>The United States is involved in an armed conflict with a recognized adversary, and we have the support of our significant allies and the majority of our population. CNN and the world's major news services have access similar to that in the Gulf War; ergo, we assume that cameras are on the shoulders of our military.</p>
<p>In order to achieve some very specific tactical goals, the field commanders are faced with a choice.</p>
<p>	1. They can pick a sophisticated smart bomb, which will almost assuredly strike the exact designated target, and will definitely kill 7 - 15 innocent civilians. </p>
<p>	2. They can choose to use a non-lethal weapon (of whatever sort - that's immaterial here) which will have the same tactical effect as #1 above. However, there will be no civilian deaths to record on video tape immediately. Instead, the planners project 100-200 collateral civilian deaths within two weeks, as a result of the non-lethal attack.</p>
<p>What do we do?</p>
<p>This is the crux of the ethical conundrum that we face, for the use of non-lethal weapons in no way means that deaths will not occur, either in the short term or the long term. Non-lethal refers to the immediate casualty count of the weapon's use, not it's downstream collateral effects.</p>
<p>Further complicating the issue is the fact that Information Warfare offers additional opportunities other than in strict conflict, war or not. The techniques and offensive capabilities of InfoWar weapons can be considered part of our arsenal for:</p>
<UL>
<LI>Operations Other Than War<BR>
<LI>Prelude to Conflict<BR>
<LI>Alternative to Conflict<BR>
<LI>Sanctions<BR>
<LI>Middle ground between diplomacy and war (conflict).<BR>

</UL>
<p>A couple of examples should suffice.</p>
<p>Country 'A' is misbehaving, and the international community agrees that steps must be taken to bring them into line. One of the options available is to deny them access to international communications and or financial commerce. Through the use of jamming, denial of service attacks or assorted other methods, Country 'A' is electronically isolated from the world. As a result, the internal economy suffers, and a range of social effects are seen and felt, perhaps including starvation, an inability to care for sick people, etc. </p>
<p>If the only other alternative is conventional conflict, is this an acceptable route for we and our allies to take? We have to then consider if the 'attacks' against Country 'A' are all done outside of their physical sovereignty, or are some waged from within their physical boundaries. Does this make a difference to our chosen policy? </p>
<p>Denial of Service attacks offer a great deal of power to the Information Warfare enabled nation-state. The targets for such attacks in today's integrated information society (given an appropriately vulnerable society) blur the lines between the military and civilian as the increased convergence occurs.</p>
<p>Therefore, is an InfoWar attack against a power plant which services a military target acceptable, if we know that the same power source is the life line to a civilian population as well? Or, is it politically and socially acceptable to avoid the headline grabbing visual carnage that a military strike might cause, preferring instead to permit invisible collateral damage (although perhaps deeper in long term fatality).</p>
<p>Military and political planners will have to come to terms with these fundamental issues as we move into the fourth dimension of war - Cyber or Pure Information Warfare - but we must also remain acutely aware of the ramifications of such actions.</p>
<p>Let us say that the US does initiate some sanctions based offensive denial of service assault against a target nation-state. Or, fraught with even more complexity, we launch and InfoWar offensive against a non-nation-state entity, whose physical location happens to lie within the physical boundaries of a nation-state.</p>
<p>Even though the United States is still unclear policy-wise what constitutes and Act of War against us, we must consider how the target will view such actions on our part. Perception is the name of the game; especially with a world-wide audience watching. Will the target react as though the US had in fact declared war? No military action notwithstanding? Will the target in turn react offensively against US interests using either conventional, unconventional or InfoWar weapons? And then what is our response.</p>
<p>This issue begs the question: Is Information Warfare a potential step which can lead to an escalation to military conflict which was meant to be avoided in the first place? Or does Information Warfare present merely ethical questions, since no country in their right mind would militarily assault us?</p>
<p>The definition of War in this new age of Global Networks, trans-national commerce, and increasing fuzziness of borders is arguable at best - and create an essential debate for the future of peace. At the core of any nation-state's view of war should be a National Information Policy which clearly delineates value, national security and the thresholds over which another nation-state must not cross. But in addition, such a Policy view must include options for dealing with renegades, terrorists, corporations or individuals who provoke the international community.</p>
<p>Many people maintain that an Act of War implicitly involved fatalities.</p>
<p>I no longer believe that to be the case, and thus the ethical conundrum of exactly what is an Act of War comes to the fore. What is a measured response? If the US is hit with a non-lethal or InfoWar weapon, how should we respond? Our options are wide open today, but will increase as our arsenals grow in sophistication and complexity.  Further, as third world nations get 'wired' to the Global Information Infrastructure, they too, will find a demonstrable vulnerability that they currently do not enjoy.</p>
<p>There are no immediate answers that are right or wrong, but the questions and conundra beget more questions and dilemmas as we look into the future of warfare. It is my sincere hope, that this type of thinking and pondering will allow us all, as a nation and as a planet, to evolve our thinking past bombs and bullets, past military superiority, and find a common strength and unity amongst ourselves.</p>
<p>The alternative is not pleasant.</p>
<p>For we find, each of us as we leap forward into the future, that our greatest assets are indeed, also our greatest vulnerability. The ethical balance that we choose to follow in the coming decades will define us a species.</p>
<p>Let's make the right choices.</p>

<h2><Center>SOMETIMES THE DRAGON WINS:</H2>
A Perspective on Information-Age Warfare<BR>
Colonel Charles J. Dunlap, Jr., USAF</Center>


<I>The views and opinions expressed in this presentation are those of the author alone and do not necessarily represent those of the U.S. Government or any of its components.</I><P>


<h4>Introduction</H4>
	I want to take this opportunity to thank the sponsors of this conference for providing me the opportunity to share my views with such a distinguished audience of international experts.<P>

  	At the outset I must caution you that I use the phrase "my views" literally.  Everything that I say is my opinion alone and does not necessarily represent the views or opinions of the United States Government, the U.S. Department of Defense, or any of its components, including U.S. Strategic Command.<P>

	My presentation this afternoon will center on an article I wrote last January for the Weekly Standard entitled "How We Lost the High-Tech War of 2007: A Warning from the Future."  In writing it, I was influenced by my experiences serving in Africa during our relief efforts in Somalia.  I was struck by the resourcefulness, cleverness, and fierceness of the Somalis in confronting us.  With that experience as a starting point, I theorized about the broader issue of what impact information-age technologies might have on the less-developed world, especially as the cost of extremely capable and easy-to-use information systems continues to fall.  I wondered to what extent cheaper technology might affect the combat capability of societies we had considered too resource-poor to challenge us.<P>

	Those of you who may have read my article will realize that it is not a technical document.  Rather, it is an imagined tale wherein the leader of a mythical non-Western nation delivers an "after action" report to his colleagues in his country's "Supreme War Council."  In his speech, the unnamed chieftain explains how he engineered the defeat of the United States in a conflict set in the year 2007.<P>

	The scenario I set out is deliberately vague, but it does imply that this mythical nation has invaded a weak neighboring state.  America, together with other members of the international community, endeavors to expel the aggressors.<P>

	What I tried to do is put myself in the position of a potential adversary some ten years in the future and postulate how war might be waged against a high-tech power.  In setting the scene for my fictional war I made a number of assumptions:<P>

		a)  That Western nations, and particularly the United States, would develop and deploy sophisticated information-based weaponry (e.g., F-22 fighters), and would organize their forces and develop doctrine accordingly.<P>

		b)  That these same nations would develop and deploy information-based methodologies that could defend their most vital civilian and military facilities not only from hackers and other forms of cyberassault, but also from Oklahoma City-style physical attacks.<P>

	Many of you may properly think that such assumptions are overly optimistic.  Nevertheless, what I wanted to do is to hypothesize a "best case" scenario for the United States and the West.<P>

	Against this background my fictional enemy nevertheless masterminded the defeat of the United States by waging not limited war, but a new kind of conflict that I call "neo-absolutist war."  This is a vicious form of confrontation that extends across the spectrum of warfare.  It differs from more traditional "total war" by, among other things, the propensity of the aggressor to focus on shattering the will of an opponent by employing brutality openly and unapologetically against combatants and noncombatants alike.  In a sense, such warfare has existed throughout the history of man, but information-age technology modernizes it (hence the term "neo") and vastly expands its potential.<P>

	In order to explain the theories that High-Tech War of 2007 meant to illustrate, I've extracted a number of propositions that I'd like to discuss.<P>

<h4>	Proposition #1 Our most likely future adversaries will be unlike ourselves.</H4>

	The adversary I invented for High-Tech War of 2007 is not a First World nation and perhaps not a nation-state in the traditional sense at all.  Instead, it is more a grouping of peoples who are profoundly unlike ourselves in several critical respects.  My analysis causes me to disagree with those - including some information-warfare gurus - who too often seem to assume that our future opponents will be Westernized, technology-dependent societies whose armed forces are built more or less along the same lines as those of the U.S.  Likewise, I believe that many information-warfare enthusiasts mistakenly suppose that our future opponents will have cultural mores and values similar enough to ours so that a "rational" (in a Western sense) cost-benefit analysis would drive decisions of peace and war.<P>

	I do not, of course, entirely discount any possibility.  Given the history of the twentieth century, I guess that it's theoretically possible that a high-tech Western European nation might wage war against the U.S. in the future.  Furthermore, I recognize that we in the West are finding groups of rather bizarre extremists who might someday pose more than the mere law enforcement threat that they do today.  But I still think the much more likely scenario is what Samuel Huntington called in his 1993 Foreign Affairs article of the same name, a "clash of civilizations." <P>

	What would be the nature of such civilizations with whom we might clash?  In a fascinating piece in the summer 1994 issue of Parameters, Ralph Peters, then a U.S. Army major, described what he called the rise of "The New Warrior Class," a multitude which he contends "already numbers in the millions."  Peters says that in the future:<P>

[America] will face [warriors] who have acquired a taste for killing, who do not behave rationally according to our definition of rationality, who are capable of atrocities that challenge the descriptive powers of language, and who will sacrifice their own kind in order to survive.<P>

	In a similar vein, eminent British military historian John Keegan maintains that we are seeing the re-emergence of not just a warrior class, but warrior peoples who are psychologically distinct from the West.  These are societies, he says, where the young are "brought up to fight, think fighting honorable and think killing in warfare glorious."  A warrior in such societies, Keegan has written, "prefers death to dishonor and kills without pity when he gets the chance."<P>

	A civilization so composed, perhaps organized around some powerful social or cultural force, will be a most dangerous foe because of the uncompromising zealotry and ferocity with which it can wage war.  In my scenario, the aggressor nation's motivating psychological force is an unspecified religion that completely dominates its culture.  I might add that the driving force could have just as easily been an ethnic identification, political ideology, or even some kind of as yet unknown cult.<P>

	If one is looking for a prototype of the kind of adversary and type of conflict that I foresee, I would suggest studying the war in Chechnya.  Despite the application of tremendous military power, savage fighting persists.  I submit that a lesson of that conflict, and one that I'll talk more about later, is that such peoples are hardly the type to capitulate solely as a result of the "bloodless" information warfare techniques touted by so many as the future of war following the purported "revolution in military affairs."<P>

	These warrior societies (or "streetfighter" nations as one commentator aptly described them) actually enjoy certain warfighting advantages over the U.S. and the West.  Their populations are usually much more disciplined, casualty-tolerant, and able to endure deprivation better than we are.  Their troops are unfazed by orthodox calculations of what is militarily "doable," and quite often have much more austere logistical and support requirements.<P>

	For most of the nineteenth and twentieth century, however, these warrior societies and streetfighter nations infrequently succeeded - in a purely military sense - against the technologically superior forces of the West, especially when the Western power put its full resources into the effort.  Indeed, a common critique of my article is that no adversary like the one I invented could possibly conduct the global military and paramilitary operations necessary to achieve the victory I describe.  However, I assert that new developments in cyberscience have the potential to prove my detractors wrong.<P>

<h4>	Proposition #2: Information technology will facilitate and hasten the consolidation of potential opponents, including warrior societies.</H4>

	I believe that new, simplified, but enormously effective methods of communication will allow the consolidation of national and transnational warrior societies (as well as radical elements of streetfighter nations) to a degree hardly dreamt of today.  Specialized satellite television networks, comsats, Internet gateways, faxes, cell phones, and all the other attributes of the global communications revolution may enable the formation of "cybertribes."  These could unite what now might be a diaspora of like-minded peoples hostile to U.S. interests.  We already know, for instance, that neo-nazi groups use the Internet to maintain contact with each other.  <P>

	Enhanced communications can also be a catalyst that releases potent but presently inchoate psychological energy.  That venting can produce violent results:  one observer insists, for example, that the Milosevic regime "fanned the fires of pan-Serbism by taking over the national television system and using it to magnify semi-dormant hatreds."<P>

	Where once the word "communications" conjured up expensive networks of telephone lines, microwave towers, repeater stations and so forth, a defining mark of the information age is the radical decline in the cost of all forms of communications.  New hardware such as direct broadcast satellites eliminates the need for expensive cable or fiber-optic distribution systems while making it possible to reach audiences numbering into the billions.  A similar result is produced by the growing use of cellular phones.  I once visited the Khyber Pass which, as you know, is in a desolate region of Pakistan near the Afghanistan border.  To my great surprise I saw people who were living much as Rudyard Kipling must have found them, but who were, nevertheless, using cellular phones to maintain communications, often with the help of satellites.<P>

	Please note, however, that in the future it may not even be necessary for a less-developed nation to spend the huge sums necessary to launch satellites.  The L.A. Times reported last month that the U.S. Marines were experimenting with communication "satellites" that are actually held aloft by high-altitude balloons as a less costly alternative to space-based systems.  Obviously, a potential adversary could do likewise.<P>

	I am convinced that the employment of new and increasingly inexpensive means of communications can tremendously influence and mobilize significant populations against U.S. and Western interests.  The leadership of the warrior "cybertribes" can use cheap communications to not only unite their followers, but also to exercise effective command and control over groups that might be widely separated yet whose aggregate capabilities create genuine military concerns.<P>

	Along this line I should note that a phenomena of warrior societies and extremist streetfighter nations is that they tend to produce charismatic leaders.  Modern communications systems will enable telegenic leaders to leverage their personal "aura" to reach huge numbers of peoples.  Even wholly illiterate people will be able to see and hear their leader via "telepresence."  What's more is that coming holographic imagery will project the leader's charisma in an enormously convincing way and do so for audiences at multiple locations.  Perhaps more importantly, a variety of emerging information and communication technologies will also leverage the streetfighter nation's military capabilities.<P>

<h4>	Proposition #3: Most analysts dangerously underestimate how significantly emerging technologies will empower warrior peoples. </H4>

	As I mentioned, a common critique of my article is that no such "warrior society" could ever carry out the sort of world-wide attacks that happen in the scenario.  Such attitudes dangerously underrate potential enemies, and reflect an arrogance that has had unfortunate consequences for the U.S. and the West throughout history.  In conflicts ranging from Vietnam to Somalia to the Balkans, we have repeatedly seen how crafty opponents can offset high-tech hubris.  Frankly, I think my critics misread the true implications of the information revolution on military affairs.<P>

	One key implication is that our potential adversaries will be technology-enfranchised in ways which will obviate many of the advantages First World militaries enjoy today.  The U.S. and the West seem to believe that they can safely downsize their forces so long as they maintain relatively small numbers of well-educated troops supplied with high-tech equipment.  But I question how much longer we can expect to maintain a monopoly on the world's best trained troops.  Realistic new combat simulators and self-paced computerized teaching technologies will make sophisticated training available to the masses in the less-developed world.  Furthermore, this kind of technology does not depend upon the physical presence of foreign military trainers who might otherwise be able to influence and moderate warrior societies' actions.<P>

	In any event, I'm not at all sure how much technical training the average combatant will need in the future - my guess is that most will need very little.  My article predicts that extremely user-friendly software will empower poorly-trained or even illiterate fighters to operate what is today considered complicated weaponry.  Furthermore, some adversaries may abandon whole classes of weapons that require highly-trained operators (e.g., manned fighter aircraft) in favor of fully-automated, easy-to-use systems (e.g., anti-air missiles).<P>

	With the help of artificial intelligence systems incorporated into personal information devices, raw but determined conscripts might be able to use complex weapons in a strategically and tactically effective manner.  The wisdom of the West Points, the Sandhursts, and the St. Cyr's of the world could be available - in the local language - to anyone who can wear a headset and push an "on" button.  A step in this direction already exists in the form of what a company called Intervision calls the "computer-on-a-hip."<P>

	Because new technology can implant "expertise" into a military organization in so many ways, it may not be necessary to educate the force as a whole.  I disagree, therefore, with those strategists who contend that success in future conflicts will depend upon the technical knowledge of individual soldiers.  By using technology to replace the intellectual achievement that could previously be obtained only through laborious and time-consuming courses of study, the combatants on future battlefields will become much more equal than has historically been the case.  Moreover, given the innate martial qualities of warrior societies, the diminishing importance of the educational credentials cannot favor today's high-tech nations.<P>

	Besides eroding the training and education advantage that the U.S. and the West are counting upon to maintain a military edge, I also believe that technology itself will be much more "level" on future battlefields than most people think.  This coming parity can be largely ascribed to the fundamental difference in what Alvin and Heidi Toffler would call Second and Third Wave weaponry.  "Second Wave" weaponry are the planes, tanks, and ships produced by industrialized countries.  Nations without sufficient heavy industry to allow at least some degree of weapons' autarky had little hope of prevailing militarily in all-out struggles against countries so equipped.<P>

	Likewise, for most of the twentieth century, the invention of revolutionary new weaponry usually occurred in those nations able to sustain a rather specialized and militarily-unique research and development base.  Again, in large measure, this was the industrialized West and, accordingly, the West could monopolize and control the creation and production of the most advanced armaments.<P>

	That, in my opinion, will not be the case much longer. The key to "Third Wave" warfare does not lie in producing traditional weapons platforms; rather, if the experts are to be believed, the critical element will be the new information technologies that are largely computer-sourced.  For this reason I do not believe that tomorrow's information-based weaponry will be produced by another resource-intensive "Manhattan Project" or "Skunk Works."  Obviously, it does not take a huge dedication of assets to turn out, for example, a piece of devastatingly effective software weaponry.  Low-cost personal computers available in retail stores worldwide will more than suffice.<P>

	But a more fundamental reason the U.S. and the West will not have the high-tech advantage that they now possess is the simple fact that there are too many commercial applications of the new information technologies for the defense establishment of the United States or any other country to monopolize and control them.  Businesses all over the globe are racing to invent new information-oriented software and hardware products.  Accordingly, our future opponents (without investing anything in an indigenous R & D infrastructure) can leverage the whole world's research and development capacity as it looks for information technologies that have possible military uses.<P>

There are additional reasons that the most up-to-date technology will be readily available to our potential opponents.  Of course, producing computers is a much less taxing enterprise than building aircraft carriers so there will be far more sources, perhaps even the streetfighter/warrior nation itself.  After all, the manufacture of some systems may favor countries - unlike the United States and those in Western Europe - with low-cost labor pools.  In addition, notwithstanding the potential military applications of information technologies, third-party financing and economic assistance is much more likely to be available to a less-developed nation for this kind of venture than for a traditional arms industry.  The inherent versatility of cyberscience means that a country can build an information infrastructure with military capabilities while simultaneously serving the needs of economic development and, incidentally, not necessarily arousing the world's suspicions.  Our potential adversaries will not have to choose between "guns" and "butter" in building information-age warfighting capabilities.<P>

Yet another reason that the battlefield will become more technologically "level" lies in the growing dependence of the U.S. and other armed forces on commercial-off-the-shelf or "COTS" technology.  Plainly, this means that we have to expect that sooner or later our enemies can make similar purchases in the retail market.  Like the decline in communication costs, the astonishing reduction in the price of computer power brings extraordinarily versatile systems within the range of even the poorest potential foes.  Because of the ready availability of cyber-technologies and the continuing decline in costs, I contend that the era when the First World would produce and control the latest weapons is over - at least to the extent that information technology is the linchpin to the most sought after arms.<P>

	Furthermore, non-democratic opponents may well have another significant advantage over us.  Specifically, their acquisition policies are not necessarily as fettered by Byzantine rules and regulations as are ours.  We all know that information technology can become outmoded in a matter of months, and that's much too fast for our current procurement process to react very well.  Thus, a totalitarian regime may well be able to get inside our 'acquisition loop' and procure and field advanced information-based weaponry before we can do so.  In short, I am not confident that our existing contracting laws are dynamic enough to accommodate the information-age's environment of rapid technological change.<P>

<h4>	Proposition # 4:  The age of mass warfare may not be over!</H4>

	Incidentally, should my predictions on these points prove valid then, contrary to the forecasts of most experts, the era of mass warfare might not be over.  As I've indicated, most First World militaries - including ours - are counting upon an advantage in high-tech weaponry and superior training to allow dramatic downsizing of forces.  If, as discussed, our adversaries will have much the same technology as we have, and information technology can neutralize the technical expertise and training that gives First World forces so much of an advantage today, then the difference between victory and defeat might well revert to a question of the sheer numbers of combatants deployed.  A future Napoleon might rightly echo the words of the original:  "Victory goes to the big battalions."<P>

	In my estimation those in the U.S. who think that the Vietnam-era draft protests are little more than historical curiosities may be in for a shock.  In the future we could find it necessary to conscript huge numbers of people to battle civilizations willing to place millions of technology-empowered citizens under arms.  Even if the fashionable view prevails, i.e., that future armies will be populated by highly-educated cybersoldiers, I am not so sure that an all-volunteer force will be able to attract enough such specialists in the coming years that conscription can be permanently ruled out.  Media reports of anti-draft demonstrations may again fill our television screens.<P>

<h4>	Proposition #5: The impact of information-age technology on the global media will be the most immediate and most powerful influence on information-age warfare.</H4>

	In my opinion, the most immediate and powerful impact on future conflicts will be the ongoing media revolution occasioned by information-age technology.  Parenthetically, it amazes me how little discussion there is about this in the reams of literature concerning the alleged "revolution in military affairs."  What discussion exists is, in my view, incredibly naive and underdeveloped.<P>

	We already know that the media can project powerful images.  What is new is the explosive growth in the media's ability to find and report these images from areas of armed conflict.  Historically, governments with a mind to do so have been able to exercise considerable control as to reporters' access to war zones as well as the dispatch of stories from battlefields.  The press was often forced to depend upon the benevolence of the armed forces for transportation and communication in combat theaters.<P>

	That will seldom be the case in the future.  As I predict in my article, news organizations will own surveillance satellites and self-contained communication systems that will allow them to function almost totally autonomously.  Indeed, one firm, Aerobureau of McLean, Virginia, run by Chuck de Caro, already can deploy a self-sustaining flying newsroom.  The airplane is equipped not only with multiple video, audio, and data links, but also gyro-stabilized cameras, side and forward-looking radars and, believe it or not, its own pair of camera-equipped remotely piloted vehicles.  In addition to being able to land on short unimproved runways, the aircraft can also dispatch satellite uplink-equipped reporters by parachute!  Clearly, the media will be physically able to report the news, "live from the battlefield," totally independent of military support or, even more importantly, the military's permission.<P>

	While we might be able to prevail upon the ethics or patriotism of individual correspondents who are our own nationals, the growing globalization of the news will always leave foreign journalists willing to report and broadcast such intensely newsworthy events as armed conflicts, especially those involving U.S. or other First World forces.  I am convinced that information technologies will empower the media to such a degree that virtually no observable detail of any consequence will escape their view.  Furthermore, huge interconnected databases will add tremendously to their news sources.  Advanced software will enable them to "fuse" the raw inputs into useful, real-time or near real-time reportage.  Such developments, in my opinion, will profoundly affect the conduct of future war.<P>

	The media revolution is but another example of how the information age will diminish the First World militaries' current superiority.  The press will become the "poor man's" intelligence service and this will help warrior societies and streetfighter nations to wage war "on the cheap."  With immense quantities of information available from global news groups, what need will there be for our future enemies to spend enormous amounts of money building Western-style intelligence infrastructures?<P>

	None of this should really surprise us.  We already see decisionmakers of many nations relying upon information from media sources like CNN.  Some might say that if the media serves as a de facto intelligence service for a hostile force, then they should be treated accordingly.  I doubt, however, that Western democracies can muster the political will to forcefully block reporters' activities, especially those of the non-belligerent third-countries.<P>

	The media revolution will have another important effect on military operations:  the increasing obsolescence of operational security (along with deception and psyops) as useful military concepts.  The rise of aggressive, technology-infused global news organizations will fill the air with colossal amounts of data.  Every military move, or seeming military move, will be scrutinized and analyzed by the press and the expert consultants they hire.  In that context few military courses of action can remain concealed for very long.<P>

	I might add that it is not only the media that is responsible for this evolution.  The proliferating numbers of personal cell phones, e-mail capable laptop computers, fax machines, and so forth that troops themselves carry with them will also contribute to the avalanche of information that will be available about military operations.  I think that commanders will find these devices near impossible to monitor and censor.  While our adversaries will have a similar problem, I think it will be more pronounced for the militaries of Western-style democracies because of the open nature of our societies.<P>

	Indeed, we are already experiencing an inkling of what's coming.  I invite your attention to a recent report that 90% of Israeli recruits arriving for service brought along their own personal cellular phones.  Some used them to call their parents and others to complain about various aspects of their military duties.  As Newsweek predicted over five years ago, "if soldiers can phone mom or the local newspaper from the middle of the battlefield, what are the implications for maintaining military discipline or secrecy?"  I think the obvious answer is that both will suffer.<P>

<h4>	Proposition #6: The technology-empowered media and the proliferation of personal information/communication devices will have the effect of limiting the practical ability of casualty-adverse democracies to engage in combat for much more than thirty days.</h4>

	I maintain that the synergistic effect of the media revolution combined with a proliferation of personal information devices will make it politically unfeasible for most democracies to wage intense combat operations for much more than a month or so.   During the Gulf War we saw how gruesome photos of the so-called "highway of death" undermined support for continuing the war - and those were pictures of the destruction of a brutal enemy invaders.  What should we expect when the bodies are those of our friends and relatives?<P>

	In the future, the type of "real-time" reportage of death and mutilation of our own soldiers that the new technology makes possible will likely create unsolvable political problems.  Tomorrow's communication capabilities may allow commercial news services to furnish soldiers' families with customized coverage of their loved one's unit, and perhaps even of specific individuals.  This kind of coverage supplementing personal communications from the troops' own information/data devices will enable the soldiers' families to establish a "virtual presence" with them on the battlefield.  When such "telepresence" begins to communicate the horrific shrieks and terrifying sights of death and mutilation as it happens to a loved one in combat, the political pressure to terminate hostilities at almost any price may become inexorable.<P>

	To accommodate this approaching reality, I think that the U.S. and other Western democracies may need to retain larger standing forces than are presently contemplated.  We must be able to react swiftly to fight time-sensitive "come as you are" wars.  Because there will only be a short period before the enhanced communication of the horrors of war makes continuing simply not politically viable, there will not be enough time, for example, to prepare and deploy those reserves who require refresher training prior to combat.  Rethinking the size and composition of reserve forces may, therefore, be in order.  Similarly, if political demands dictate that fighting must be brief, then sustainment and reconstitution may be less important than many militaries think.  In short, if a military solution cannot be achieved quickly, political exigencies may make it not achievable at all, notwithstanding the gravity of the interest at stake.<P>

	Planners for information-age conflicts ought to consider, therefore, training and equipping forces for extremely intense, hyper- or "blitzkrieg" style warfare.  Regrettably, pressure for quick resolutions may compel military commanders to forego time-consuming tactics even though they might limit casualties on all sides in the long run.  Once fighting has begun, I just don't think that the public will have the stomach or patience for methodical approaches even if they promise less bloodshed over time.  Accordingly, it will be imperative to develop stratagems that maximize the application of combat power before public support and political will evaporate.<P>

<h4>	Proposition #7:  Seeking "information dominance on tomorrow's battlefield is unrealistic and quixotic; instead, the U.S. should focus on developing doctrine and strategies for operating in an environment of "information equality" or "information transparency."</h4>

Among the stratagems, however, that should not be counted upon for achieving rapid military success is the notion of gaining "information dominance."  For all the reasons I've mentioned - the likely technological parity of future belligerents, the stupendous multiplication of personal information devices and, most importantly, the explosive growth of the technology-empowered media - it will be nearly impossible for any belligerent to "dominate" the information dimension.  What we should do now is not chase an unrealistic and quixotic strategy of  "information dominance," but rather we ought to be thinking about how forces will fight in an environment of information equality or, perhaps more realistically, a totally transparent information environment, i.e.,  where each side knows everything about the other.<P>

	As already described, the nature of the information age will likely find ourselves with equipment at best equivalent to that of our enemy, and very possibly inferior.  Even if we were able to deploy somewhat superior devices, I still think that achieving true "dominance" in anything more than a transient, tactical sense will be frustrated by our inability to degrade enemy systems.  Information technology, and particularly communication systems, will become too inexpensive, too compact and, consequently, too redundant for military or cyber-action to neutralize all of them.<P>

I can foresee a time when the communication capabilities that today require entire units will be found in the personal information devices I've mentioned.  There will no longer be any key communication "nodes" upon which to focus an attack - ultramodern information technologies will turn individual soldiers into self-contained communication centers.  In fact, the L.A. Times article I referred to previously reports that the Marines are experimenting with small three-man groups linked to units by computers as a substitute for personnel-heavy command structures.  To take out all of the new style C3I "nodes" will mean, literally, destroying every combatant on the battlefield.  And, when confronting warrior peoples and streetfighter nations, such bloody business may be exactly what information-age warfare requires.<P>

<h4>	Proposition #8: Information-age warfare will not become an "almost bloodless" electronic exchange that some predict; rather, it will be as savage, and likely more savage than ever.</H4>

	One of the principal reasons I wrote the High-Tech War of 2007 was to attack what is becoming conventional wisdom in the United States and many Western nations: the idea that information technologies will allow wars to be waged virtually bloodlessly.  In a scenario depicted in Time magazine last summer, a U.S. Army officer conjured up a future crisis where someone like himself ensconced at a computer terminal in the United States could derail a potential aggressor "without firing a shot."  He visualized the foe's phone system brought down by a computer virus, logic bombs ravaging the transportation network, false orders confusing the adversary's military, television broadcasts jammed with propaganda messages, and the enemy leader's bank account electronically zeroed out.  All of this is expected to cause an opponent to capitulate without fighting.<P>

	I don't really know if what he implies is technologically possible.  I do think, however, that he is failing to anticipate a point I've tried to emphasize:  that future information technology may become so inexpensive that aggressively-minded nations - even relatively impoverished ones - will be able to afford redundancies that will make it difficult or impossible to accomplish what he suggests.  Consider that the Internet, access to which only requires an inexpensive computer, originated in a system meant to survive a nuclear attack by exploiting redundancies in modern communication processes.  Surely critical communications and information technologies based on this or similar systems will be very difficult to defeat.<P>

	Once again it seems that the ability of foes to devise low-tech ways to circumvent high-tech capabilities is being underestimated.  Should we not anticipate that our future adversaries will plan work-arounds for precisely this kind of cyberassault?  But even assuming the colonel's plan is technologically feasible, and assuming the profound legal, ethical, and policy issues that his storyline raises can be resolved, I still maintain that it reflects a fundamental misunderstanding as to the character and temperament of our most likely future opponents.  Warrior societies and streetfighter nations are just not as vulnerable to technology loss as is the U.S. and the industrialized West.  <P>

	To me the Army colonel's scheme also mistakenly takes for granted that future foes would plan to fight us in the same high-tech way as we would, and that they would engage in the kind of cost-benefit approach to conflict that the U.S. and the West do.  It may be that we in the West in the late twentieth century might be ready to abandon a military effort if our phone and electrical systems were disrupted, or if our bank accounts were emptied.  But it is a peculiarly Western notion to presume that every enemy in a future conflict would back down for like reasons.  I would not count on such discomfiture deterring a warrior society acting in pursuit of a powerful cultural imperative and under the spell of a charismatic leader.<P>

	In any event, I doubt that a warrior society or streetfighter nation would try to defeat us by assaulting our domestic information infrastructure.  I believe they would conclude - as the potentate in my article does - that to do so is too difficult for a less-developed nation with limited resources.  I anticipate that they would determine that the 'center of gravity' in conflicts with First World democracies is not the information infrastructure per se, but the will of the people in a Clausewitzean sense.  They will concentrate not so much on destroying our things, but on smashing our spirit.  In doing so, they may well decide that preserving our information infrastructure actually facilitates their strategy - it helps them to graphically communicate their willingness to do anything for victory, however despicable.<P>

	Streetfighter nations like the one in my scenario will feel no compunction about waging war - particularly against the West - completely outside the norms of international law.  Indeed, in my story their strategy is to deliberately wage war in a most inhumane and public way possible as a means of intimidating us and undermining our will to win.  I think emerging information technologies will enable them to do that in quite innovative ways.  This further explains what I mean by neo-absolutist war:  Total war ruthlessly waged by unconstrained enemies enfranchised by technology.<P>

	That said, I should note that while a few of our future enemies will no doubt be sociopathic, I do not mean to necessarily suggest that their whole society would be similarly affected .  I think that some groups may be able to form a moral, political, or cultural construct that leaves those outside of it unworthy of humane treatment.  Aiding and abetting such a weltanschauung might be real or perceived affronts occasioned by U.S. or the West's actions, perhaps not even of recent origin.  What I am saying is that adversaries' populations might somehow be able to rationalize abominable behavior in a war with a high-tech power.<P>

	Accordingly, I believe that a future opponent will not hesitate to use brutality to exploit the growing aversion to casualties that more and more shapes the political and military decisions of the U.S. and other First World countries.  Consistent with neo-absolutist war, atrocities will be brazenly displayed, not hidden.  Our enemies will seek to manipulate us through barbarism, and enhanced information age technologies will help them do just that.  <P>

	Why would they choose this strategy?  For the simple reason that they might believe, rightly or wrongly, that it has worked in the past.  To explain what I mean I invite your attention to another criticism of my essay:  an adversary who conducted himself as the one in my story would so incite the U.S. that America would never abandon its military effort until the enemy was fully prostrate.  I hope that would be true, but I wonder.  Did that occur when Somalis dragged the body of a U.S. soldier through the streets of Mogadishu?  No, it did not; there was no public demand to crush the perpetrators.<P>

	Although there were many complex reasons for the subsequent U.S. withdrawal, I worry that our future enemies might conclude that the atrocious behavior the Somalis displayed helped undermine U.S. public support for the whole operation.  If that is so, then the perceived failure to make those responsible pay a terrible price for such barbarism might encourage even greater viciousness in future information-age conflicts.<P>

	I fear that one target of their strategy will be prisoners of war.  POWs became an important bargaining chip for the Communists during the Vietnam War and they were often used for propaganda purposes.  In my scenario, female POWs were particularly victimized by an enemy hoping to capitalize on our domestic debate concerning the extent to which women should be involved in combat.  That victimization was not done in secret; rather, the enemy employed modern communications to broadcast - live - the torture of the POWs to their families at home.  Clearly, this was designed to demoralize us and erode our will - a classic example of neo-absolutist war. <P>

	A few might wonder who could commit such terrible crimes.  Apart from the fact that the twentieth century has witnessed more than its share of such deeds, last August Newsweek magazine reported a disturbing trend: several Third World countries are recruiting young teenagers and even pre-teens into their armies.  Among the reasons for doing so, Newsweek concluded, was that "boys will do things grown men can't stomach."  A UNICEF worker observed that "kids make more brutal fighters because they haven't developed a sense of judgment".  Along this line you may recall that most of the Somalis mugging for the camera with the body of the U.S. soldier were youths in this age group.  Because a basic tenet of neo-absolutist war is brutality, we might expect that young fighters will become a staple of many of our adversaries' soldiery.<P>

	The inexpensive but powerful communication capabilities we've discussed will allow a future opponent to off-set other aspects of our current military superiority, especially when aided by willingness to ignore fundamental precepts of humanity and the law of war.  For instance, our opponents will be able to maintain command and control while at the same time dispersing their forces in such a way as to be extremely difficult to find and destroy.  I foresee "virtual armies" composed of small numbers of people, even individuals, remaining widely dispersed until immediately prior to an assault, if then.  In carrying out this tactic, I believe that our enemies will present ethical quandaries for First World nations by purposely dispersing themselves among noncombatant civilians.  Every attempt to strike them will risk noncombatant casualties.<P>

	Some might believe that information-age precision-guided munitions are the solution.  But I think that underestimates the ingenuity of an enemy prepared to wage neo-absolutist war.  In my story, for instance, the adversary counters the U.S.'s advantage in high-tech airpower and precision-guided munitions by building VIP shelters, supply depots, and other vital facilities beneath hospitals, apartment houses, churches, and even POW camps.  The clear aim of the enemy was to create the same kind of dilemma as did the bombing of the Al Firdos bunker during the Gulf War.  You may remember that what was thought to be a command bunker apparently housed Iraqi civilians, many of whom were killed in a strike by the precision munitions delivered by F-117 stealth bombers.  Because of the political furor that ensued, attacks on Baghdad were sharply curtailed.<P>

	In a way, information age technology and its success in the Gulf War have produced a problem for the U.S. and the other Western nations.  The repeated television displays of "smart" weapons scrupulously hitting strictly military targets has created the public perception that war can be waged very discretely and relatively cleanly.  In fact, however, over 90% of the munitions dropped in the Gulf War were "dumb bombs" with predictable inaccuracy.<P>

	If we need to rely on such weapons in future conflicts, as will probably be the case, our opponents can propagandize the inevitable collateral damage, particularly if they widely disperse their forces among noncombatants as I imagine they will.  In large measure, we will have no one to blame but ourselves because we have, as I say, oversold the salutary potential of precision munitions on modern war.  Furthermore, as the U.S. and the West pour billions of scarce procurement dollars into expensive "smart" bombs in the hopes of limiting casualties, an adversary intent upon waging neo-absolutist war can rely upon cheap "dumb" munitions.  Ironically, the propensity of such weapons to cause collateral damage may even serve the enemy's interests by inflicting terror on noncombatants.<P>

	In yet another manifestation of neo-absolutist war, I think that future opponents will make hostage-taking an integral part of their warmaking strategy because hostage-taking can further off-set the technological advantages of the U.S. and other First World nations.  In my story, hostages are taken and chained - much as the Serbs successfully did in the Balkans - to all kinds of potential targets, including tanks, vehicles, and aircraft.  The idea was to present Western forces with the terrible moral and political conundrum of having to kill civilians or even their own comrades in order to attack critical objectives.  As I say, hostage-taking seems to work.  I note that the Chechens successfully used hostages in several operations and I expect they will continue to do so.  Nothing succeeds like success.<P>

	I also think that hostages will be taken not only from among our people, but also from the nationals of other countries.  The purpose would be to pressure key nations into denying us logistical bases necessary to support forward deployed troops.  In addition, since so many important communication satellites are consortium-owned, an enemy may try to use hostage-taking to blackmail member countries, including neutrals.  By taking hostages from third countries, our adversary will seek to assault us employing the "indirect approach."<P>

<h4>	Proposition #9:  Future adversaries will seek asymmetries in confronting technologically-superior opponents like the U.S. and may do so by embracing the "indirect approach."</H4>

	Our future opponents, and particularly those arguably technologically weaker than the U.S., will almost certainly seek asymmetries in waging war against us and, being freed of what we would consider legal and more restraints, will look for them in places that may not be immediately apparent to us.  In my article the enemy does so by applying B.H. Lidell Hart's "indirect approach," though in a somewhat different manner than perhaps he contemplated.  To avoid U.S. strengths, they frequently chose to attack another, weaker country (or the nationals of that country) with a view towards influencing U.S. actions.  These third countries become "proxy" or "surrogate" belligerents in a conflict in which they have few, if any, interests and are not otherwise involved.  Tragically, they are attacked mainly because they could be attacked.  The expectation was that their ill fortune could adversely impact the U.S. in some way.<P>

	In my fictional piece, one such "proxy" target was Mexico.  The warrior-chieftain orders cyberassaults on Mexico's computer systems on the theory that they might be less well protected than those of the U.S.  In addition, information-age document technologies are used to print billions in counterfeit pesos to undermine the Mexican economy.  Finally, insurgency groups are encouraged to renew their activities.  The collective effect of all this caused the Mexican government and economy to collapse.  In turn, millions of refugees fled across the border into the United States creating a crisis there.  The strategy was to divert U.S. resources and effort away from the overseas conflict while at the same time causing U.S. domestic upheaval.<P>

	I've already indicated that the nationals of minor, militarily-weak nations are used as hostages in my scenario.  All of this suggests, I suppose, that one lesson of my essay might be that even in the information age small nations still need to maintain an authentic national defense capability.  This capability, I submit, should include some means to project at least a deterrent force beyond its borders.  Otherwise, they and their ex-patriot citizens are susceptible to becoming pawns in conflicts if for no other reason than they are vulnerable to attack.  If by victimizing small, defenseless countries helps bring pressure on the U.S. or other powers, then I think that the streetfighter nations will not hesitate to do so.<P>

	But the "indirect" approach is not only applied to nations, it is aimed at domestic targets as well.  If critical centers of government and business are secure against cyberassault and more conventional terror attacks, then the enemy - as was the case in my story - will seek asymmetries by striking more exposed targets.  Unrestrained ethically or legally, my notional adversary chose to strike America's growing population of politically powerful elderly.  Bombs were placed in parks and elder care facilities - again to divert resources and generate political difficulties.<P>

	The enemy leader in my tale engages in other, very nasty and appalling conduct.  For example, he openly wages environmental war by sinking oil tankers to pollute our coasts, and scatters AIDs-infected needles on bathing beaches to create hysteria.  He attacks U.S. agriculture for much the same reason that he attacked the vulnerable, "proxy" countries: because it was within his means to do so.<P>

	In each instance the warrior/streetfighter nation does not seek to hide its culpability.  To the contrary, it is a precept of neo-absolutist war to use the technology-enhanced media to broadcast to the world the extreme methods that they are willing to use to achieve their ends.  The enemy's fanaticism extended to sacrificing their own people in a completely unexpected way.<P>

<h4>	Proposition #10:  Information-age warfare will likely see both new techno-weapons and more traditional arms used in innovative and unexpected ways.</H4>

	One of the more startling aspects of my article was the way in which the potentate used nuclear weapons.  In my story, his nation had managed to assemble a few crude nuclear devices but had no reliable way of delivering them in the face of high-tech U.S. weaponry.  Accordingly, a plan was developed where an American attack is induced on the warrior-nation's "Military City" by building a genuine biological warfare lab there.  The attack is carried out during a live TV news broadcast and, just as the F-117s are dropping their precision munitions, the nuclear weapon is detonated.<P>

	Of course, it appears that it was an American weapon that was detonated.  There was a predictably hostile world reaction.  The Japanese withdraw their support and begin to sell U.S. securities, panicking American financial markets.  The rest of the world turns against the U.S., despite vehement protestations of innocence.  The streetfighter nation then presents itself as a "victim state" and gains world sympathy.<P>

	I got the idea for this part of the scenario from the discussions concerning the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that took place during the World War II anniversary last year.  Personally, I was amazed that the propriety of the weapons' use during that conflict was so intensely questioned and that there was - and is - so little discussion of the savagery of the Japanese aggression that was responsible for the war in the first place.  This persuaded me that nuclear weapons could be used in such a way as to undermine the U.S. war effort while providing an excuse of sorts for barbaric behavior on the part of our enemy.<P>

	At the same time I wanted to suggest that although a strategy like this might be unthinkable to us, it isn't necessarily beyond the ken of other societies.  Every culture does not value self-preservation above all else.  We find examples throughout history - the Jews at Masada, kamikazes during World War II, the Revolutionary Guards during the Iran-Iraq War - where surely suicidal actions were more or less willingly undertaken.  During the Vietnam War Buddhist monks publicly immolated themselves as a symbolic statement to advance their cause.<P>


<h4>Conclusions and Observations</h4>

	A fundamental lesson that I hope my nightmare scenario presents is the importance of preparing for innovative uses not only of the new information technology, but of existing weapons as well.  Potential opponents may integrate both into an information-age warfighting doctrine that may be significantly different than what is popularly supposed today.  Admiral Charles Turner Joy warned more than forty years ago that "we cannot expect the enemy to oblige by planning his wars to suit our weapons; we must plan our weapons to fight war where, when, and how the enemy chooses."  In this regard we cannot allow our fascination with electronic gadgetry to blind us to the fact that warfighting is a holistic endeavor that has many different elements of which information technology is but one aspect, and not necessarily the most important at that.<P>

	Lest anyone misread my intentions it is my hope that by graphically discussing these issues, viable counters and defenses will be developed.  That's the reason, incidentally, that the Weekly Standard piece was subtitled "a warning from the future."  You may be interested to know that someone who read my article complained that I was giving potential adversaries ideas.  I find it comical that anyone would think that a lawyer, sitting in his study in Papillion, Nebraska, could possibly think up strategies that our crafty potential foes overlook.  In fact, I think this is another example of profoundly underestimating our likely enemies.<P>

	Such naivet is exactly what I want to confront.  As we study the implications of emerging information technologies, I urge you to evaluate these new scientific achievements from other than the Western point of view.  Additionally, I recommend that you seek the views of the non-technocrat.  As with anything, one's own expertise can make the forest indistinguishable from the trees.  I hope that as a non-technocrat I've been able to offer some insights that are, as I like to say, "out-of-the-box."<P>

	At the conclusion of my article, I indicated that the U.S. needed to confront barbarity and cruelty promptly and unequivocally when it arises.  One writer insists that the only way to deal with the emerging warrior class is to hunt them down and kill them in summary fashion.  In addition to the ethical and legal problems that presents, I do not think that such a policy is practical.  While I agree with the theory that warrior societies (and particularly their leaders) must suffer ignominious defeat in order to be subdued, the spectacle of summary executions presented via information-age technologies would likely sap public support for the war effort very quickly.<P>

	So I am certainly not downplaying the importance of political and diplomatic actions as some of my critics suggest.  I believe, for example, that the international war crimes tribunal now sitting in the Hague is an important step towards holding accountable those who engage in barbaric behavior.  I am merely saying that such behavior must be confronted in an effective way, otherwise there are too many who will perceive us as weak and see nefarious opportunity in such assumed weakness.  Make no mistake about it, however, opposing savagery will often require unambiguous force of arms, to include, as Bevin Alexander predicts in The Future of War, the murderous business of soldiers physically "moving into enemy territory and taking charge."  As Plato said:  "Only the dead have seen the end of war."<P>

	Finally, as we consider the impact of new information-based technology on future warfare, I want to emphasize again that we must not deceive ourselves with the notion that war can somehow be made antiseptic and bloodless.  This is an extremely dangerous proposition that in its worst extrapolation could even encourage conflict by deluding decision makers that the horrificness of war can be electronically avoided.  As my article tried to show, even in the information age, war will remain a gory business, full of unthinkable cruelty and relentless misery.  We must not forget the deadly warning of the warrior-chieftain of High-Tech War of 2007:  "No computer wages war with the exquisite finality of a simple bayonet thrust."  And there will always be those willing to thrust bayonets to achieve their aims.<P>

Information Warfare Is Not InfoSec Re-Packaged</H2>
by Winn Schwartau</Center><BR>

<P>The nay-sayers - there are always nay-sayers who have little more to do than criticize the work and progress of others - think that Information Warfare is little more than "Information Security with a budget."</P>

<P>I thank the nay-sayers for that sound byte, for it gets laughs every time. Of course, timing is everything, and I make sure that I use that line only after my audiences get a real feel for what Information Warfare is all about.</P>

<P>When I first wrote "Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway" I had no earthly clue that the subject much less the title of the book was classified. It came as quite a shock to me that Her Majesty's Government wanted to ban the book "because so much is considered classified," and that I had become a piranha in certain DoD circles for I "knew too much and talked too much." I had not written the book with the intent of annoying the military, nor had I written it with the intent of building up CitiBank's infosecurity budget. </P>

<P>I wrote it for I had a vision of a new kind of post-Cold War conflict into which I felt we were heading. But suddenly, after the book's appearance, the phrase "Information Warfare" was out of the closet and it was spewing forth from tongues everywhere. The term, as I first envisioned it was being bastardized by  those with personal agendas, and it soon became a catch-all phrase for budget-strapped Washingtonians who needed additional funding vehicles. (This is not meant to criticize, merely observe.)</P>

<P>So today, Information Warfare has come to mean a number of different things - perhaps a combination of them all; and what it means really depends upon your particular bias.</P>

<P>I stick with the definition of Information Warfare that I put forth some three years ago:</P>

<P>"Information Warfare is the offensive and defensive use of information and information systems in a conflict."  It is fundamentally sound. The Pentagon has added a bit to it; something like "to exploit, corrupt, or destroy an adversary's information and information systems while protecting one's own," and they may specify a conflict, but the point ultimately is that the target is immaterial. It could be personal, Class I, industrial or business, Class II or National, military or terrorist, Class III, reflecting the three intensities of Information Warfare that can be fought.  A number of other academics have added their bits as well, but the flavor is the same as I had originally intended.</P>

<P>But along the way, something went askew as the umbrella phrase 'Information Warfare' started to twist and turn in the political winds of Washington and now we see the debates over the definition of Information Warfare. Let's see what we have:</P>
<UL>
<LI>	 The Pure Information Warrior, like myself, sees Infowar as a war without bombs or bullets; a conflict of any magnitude, waged anywhere, motivation independent. My book still holds true.

<LI>	 The next group to come along believe in "Information In Warfare." This group includes a lot of the big name Beltway Bandits and government contractors who developed much of the nation's advanced war fighting capabilities in the last decade. They feel, that with the advent of better info-tech, we can increase our conventional war fighting capability by better and better iterative information processing. This brings the battlefield closer (in the virtual sense) to the generals who make tactical decisions based upon available information.

<LI>	 Knowledge Based Warfare is a naiscant smart-extrapolation of the last concept and makes a distinction between information and the subjective increased value of knowledge. I personally see little distinction.</P>
</UL>
<P>The semantic debate offers a wide variety of positions and definitions, each fighting for supremacy and mind-share, but still, all based upon the fundamental premise of the vulnerabilities of Information Technology and the ability to design and deploy targetable IT weapons systems.</P>

<P>So, is this information security repackaged?</P>

<P>I just don't see it that way at all. That phrase alone is somewhat derogatory, implying that Infosec was valueless, and needed a new cover to sell.</P>

<P>Infosec has traditionally been a corporate term, applied to the protection of corporate assets. If we accept the findings of the research groups over the last twenty years, the studies have suggested that between 50-80% of computer crime is committed by insiders - not outside penetrations.</P>

<P>These figures began to skew in the early 90's when the use of dial-up remote connections increased, and then dramatically when the Internet was sprung upon Corporate America. We saw that external attacks against systems were on a steep increase, making ground on the insider threat. Is remote access control or firewalls infosec repackaged? Of course not; they are merely technical steps taken to counter new threats. Evolved? Yes. Repackaged? No.</P>

<P>As the threat changes, so do the necessary defensive postures, and so we can expect an evolution in terminology.</P>

<P>The term "Information Warfare," though, offers such a compelling broad view of infosec, that some old-timers may be understandably offended by such a new paradigm that we offer. It is so all-encompassing, that we find the traditional infosec disciplines are now relegated to mere subsets of a more general approach. In physics we hail and salute a more generalized theory; this thought process, though, is new to infosec.</P>

<P>Information Warfare clearly offers a wide spectrum of adversarial conditions due in large part to the massive global connectivity in which we find ourselves enmeshed. A decade ago, the hacker was a gnat, connected by a dial-up line, using manual home-brew tools, and represented a very small number of attacks. Today the hacker is a capable adversary, with a sophisticated suite of automated GUI tools, who can attack anyone he chooses, since Cyberspace places us all equi-distant from each other. Is this repackaging? Of course not. It is a new reality, though. </P>

<P>And now, because governments have joined corporations in developing electronic presences and using massive civilian connectivity, they are added - automatically - to the potential 'hit list' by hackers and such. We find that former Cold Warriors and technical experts engage in tactics once relegated to the rarefied world of Le Carre and Ludlam spy novels; except that companies and individuals are the targets. Is this infosec repackaged? Anyone believing so is blind to the realities we have unleashed upon ourselves.</P>

<P>I have read Special Reports on Information Warfare written by people without an earthly clue about the subject.</P>

<P>Information Warfare is not infosec repackaged. Information Warfare is far bigger than infosec ever was, or could ever hope to be. Information Warfare is not a cute sound byte meant to increase specific departmental infosec budgets. Nor was it a master plan by me an my cohorts to raise paranoia and increase the value of the Internet Index.</P>

<P>Information Warfare, in any of its definitions, is a subject that encompasses psychological operations, disinformation, jamming and a host of traditionally military concepts that now must be considered for sensitive corporate security environments. </P>

<P>Ultimately, though, Information Warfare is about the convergence of military and civilian security issues, and how we deal with them in a rapidly changing world. The military is finding that the way it conducts business is increasingly like the way the commerical sector does, and the commercial sector is learning that the militarty has a great deal to offer when it comes to security and defense. </P>

<P>Information Warfare is merely infosec repackaged? </P>

<P>Please. Don't be so naive.</P>

INFORMATION WAR - CYBERWAR - NETWAR</H2>George J. Stein<BR></Center>

<H4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<P>In Arthur Waley's Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China, Chuang Tzu tells the story of a simple gardener who was shown a new tool which promised to change gardening.  He laughed scornfully and replied, "I used to be told by my teacher that where there are cunning contrivances there will be cunning performances, and where there are cunning performances there will be cunning hearts.  He in whose breast a cunning heart lies has blurred the pristine purity of his nature; he who has blurred the pristine purity of his nature has troubled the quiet of his soul, and with one who has troubled the quiet of his soul Tao will not dwell.  It is not that I do not know about this invention; but that I should be ashamed to use it."1 </P>

<P>Strategy, according to the Department of Defense, is the "art and science of developing and using political, economic, psychological, and military forces as necessary during peace and war, to afford the maximum support to policies, in order to increase the probabilities and favorable consequences of victory and to lessen the chances of defeat."2   For most of us it is obvious that the political and economic aspects of the national security policies of the United States are developed by the national political authorities, the President and the Congress, and, in dealing with foreign states or groups, executed by the Departments of State, Commerce, Agriculture, or whatever.  Policies for the development and use of military forces are, likewise, formulated by the national political authorities and conveyed to the armed forces through the Secretary of Defense.  Few people, however, have paid much attention to just how and by whom psychological forces are to be developed to support national policies and, more importantly, what are psychological forces, by whom will these forces be used, with what authority, and to what ends.  The development of new tools and technologies for communication, especially those based on computers and other aspects of information technology,  has created the potential for a new form of  psychological warfare to a degree only imagined in science-fiction: that is, "Information Warfare."  It may be that when we come to know the Tao of such an invention as Information Warfare, we should be ashamed to use it.   </P>

<P>The futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler have argued in their recent book War and Anti-War that the United States armed forces need to develop a "systematic, capstone concept of military knowledge strategy" which would include clear doctrine and policy for how the armed forces will acquire, process, distribute, and project knowledge and information to serve national strategy.3  Quoting from the "Memorandum of Policy No.30" (6 May 1993) of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Tofflers argue that the U.S. military is expanding the concept of Information War to include psychological operations aimed at influencing the "emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior" of others.  Such an expansion would mirror the evolution of traditional warfare in the direction of Information War as now foreseen by the armed forces.  It also mirrors the historical transformation of the means of generating wealth from land through natural resources and industrial infrastructure to knowledge and the manipulation of data and information as the new creators of wealth.  As "first wave" wars were fought over land and "second wave" wars were fought over physical resources and productive capacity, the emerging "third wave" wars will be for the access to and control of knowledge.   And, in the Tofflers construct, as the "combat form" in any society follows the "wealth-creation form" of that society, the wars of the future will be increasingly "Information Wars."</P>

<P>Currently, although Information Warfare is the hot topic in the strategy community, there is nothing remotely resembling formal military doctrine or official definitions of Information Warfare.  Common terms include information war, information-based warfare, command and control warfare, information operations, electronic warfare and, in Russian usage, sixth-generation warfare.  But, despite the tortured terminology and computer-nerd jargon involved, the idea of Information Warfare has not only captured the attention of military analysts, it also poses important policy questions.  Given the lack of authoritative definitions, Netwar and Cyberwar are emerging as key concepts in discussing Information War.  Originally these ideas seem to have come from the science fiction community as, for example, in the very thought-provoking future war suggested in Bruce Sterling's Islands in the Net.4  More recently, the concepts of Netwar and Cyberwar have been developed by John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt in their important essay "Cyberwar is Coming!"5  Their suggestions provide a thoughtful starting point for exploring the military and civil/military issues of Information War.</P>

<P>Netwar, according to Arquilla and Ronfeldt, is a "societal-level ideational conflict waged in part through internetted modes of communication."  Netwar is about ideas and epistemology, what is known and how it is known, and would be waged largely, but not entirely, through a society's communication systems.  Netwar, then, is most likely to be a nation-against-nation strategic level conflict and is the new form of psychological warfare.  The target of netwar is the human mind and, as such, represents an exponential increase in the opportunities for strategic psychological warfare.  One could argue that certain aspects of the Cold War had the characteristics of a dress-rehearsal for future netwar: Radio Free Europe, the Cominform, Agence France Presse, or the U.S. Information Agency.  But clearly, netwar may describe more than traditional state-to-state conflict: the mushrooming of non-state political actors such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International, through ideologically inspired movements such as survivalist militias or Islamic revivalists, all with easy access to world-wide computer networks for the exchange of information or the coordination of political pressure on a national or global basis, suggests that the "government" of a "nation-state" may not be the only parties among whom "war" is waged.</P>

<P>Cyberwar, on the other hand, is the application of the same electronic tools and techniques to military operations in the traditional sense.  Called command and control warfare or C2W by the armed forces, cyberwar uses the new opportunities for internetted communication to amplify the battlefield application of the more traditional war-fighting techniques of operations security, electronic warfare, psychological operations, deception, and physical destruction of enemy communications to achieve information dominance in the battle.  Cyberwar or C2W is not the key issue: netwar is.</P>

<P>At first glance, netwar may appear to be a computer-nerd word for good, old-fashioned propaganda.  It would be comforting to believe that the technology to manipulate propaganda has just improved a bit and the same "tried and true" methods (and limitations) still worked.  As the Tofflers suggest however, the recent Gulf War showed both Saddam Hussein and the Alliance were still mostly in the old school.  The war contained many elements of classic propaganda: atrocity accusations of bombed baby-milk factories and stolen baby incubators from Kuwaiti hospitals, inflated rhetoric and inflated stakes of the conflict with the future of the new world order and the mother of battles for the future of Islam in the balance; the classic "us or them" polarization in which "neutrality" or unenthusiastic support was decried. Only one element of traditional propaganda was absent: while Saddam Hussein became the new Hitler and President Bush was the "Great Satan," the Gulf War is unusual in that there was far less demonization or dehumanization of the opponent.  Perhaps the multicultural nature of the American-led alliance precluded turning the Iraqi army into something subhuman.  Indeed, there may have been a spark of netwar genius in treating the Islamic Iraqi soldiers as "brave men put into an impossible situation by a stupid leader."  No dishonor in surrendering then.  And, there may have been a glimpse of the netwar future when, thanks to the technologies available for cyberwar, it is rumored that Baghdad Radio signed on one morning with "The Star-Spangled Banner."</P>

<P>Traditional propaganda, however, was usually targeted via mass media to influence a mass audience.  One consequence of contemporary technologies is the potential for customized propaganda, or in the Toffler's lexicon "de-massified" propaganda.  Anyone who has received individually targeted advertising from a company specializing in "niche" marketing has had a momentary shudder upon realizing there are private companies who seem to know everything about our buying habits and tastes.  Contemporary data bases and the constantly expanding multiplicity of sources, media, and channels for the transmission of information have created the opportunity and target sets for custom-tailored or precision netwar attacks.  Computer bulletin boards, cellular telephones, video-cameras, fax machines -- all provide an entry point and dissemination network for customized assault by governmental, commercial, and private interests.  </P>

<P>A major new factor in Information War results directly from the world-wide infosphere of television and broadcast news.  Many people have begun to realize that governmental decisions are becoming increasingly reactive to a "fictive" universe created, among others, by CNN and its various international competitors.  This media-created universe is dubbed "fictive" rather than "fictional" because while what is shown may be "true," it is just not the whole, relevant, or contextual truth.  And, of course, the close etymological relationship between fictive and fictional suggests how easy it is to manipulate the message.  Nevertheless, this fictive universe becomes the politically relevant universe in societies in which the government or its military is supposed to "do something."  Somalia gets in the news and the United States gets into Somalia despite the reality of equally disastrous starvation, disorder, and rapine right next door in Sudan.  There were no reporters with "skylink" in Sudan as the government of Sudan issued no visas to CNNs reporters.  The potential for governments, parties in a civil war such as Bosnia, rebels in Chiapis, or even non-state interests like Greenpeace, to manipulate the multi-media, multi-source fictive universe to "wage societal-level ideational conflicts" via the Internet and the World Wide Web should be obvious.6 </P>

<P>Fictive or fictional operational environments, then, whether mass-targeted or niche-targeted, can be generated, transmitted, distributed, or broadcast by governments or all sorts of players through increasingly diversified networks.  The niche-manipulation potential available to states or private interests with access to the universe of internetted communications such as the networks over which business, commercial, or banking information are transmitted to suggest that Mexico is about to devalue the peso could easily provoke financial chaos.  The target state would not know what had happened until too late.7  Direct satellite broadcast to selected cable systems, analogous to central control of pay-per-view programs, again offers the potential for people in one province or region of a targeted state to discover that the maximum leader has decided to purge their clansmen from the army.  To put it in the jargon of the info-warriors, info-niche-attack in an increasingly multi-source fictive universe offers unlimited potential for stealthy and precision strike societal-level netwar .</P>

<h4>PICTURES WORTH A THOUSAND TANKS</h4>

<P>When the new, but already well understood, simulation technologies of the Tekwar and MTV  generation are added to the arsenal of netwar, a genuinely revolutionary transformation of propaganda and warfare becomes possible.  Traditional propaganda, as in World War Two, might have attempted to discredit an adversary's news media by showing, for example, that as the official German losses in the Battle of Britain were demonstrably false, all "news" from the German government was equally false.  The credibility of the opponent was the target and the strategic intention was to separate the government from the people.  </P>

<P>Today, the mastery of the techniques of combining live actors with computer-generated video graphics can easily create a "virtual" news conference, summit meeting, or perhaps even a battle which exists in "effects" though not in fact.  Stored video images in governmental and commercial data bases can be recombined endlessly to produce any effect chosen.  Now, perhaps, "pictures" will be worth a thousand tanks.  Of course, "truth will out" eventually, but by the time the people of the targeted nation discover that the nationwide broadcast of the conversation between the maximum leader and Jimmy Carter in which all loyal citizens were told to cease fighting and return to their homes was created in Hollywood or Langley, the war may be over.  Netwar is beginning to enter the zone of illusion.</P>

<P>This is not science fiction; these are, as anyone who has seen Forest Gump knows, the capabilities of existing or rapidly emerging technologies.  Heres how it might work: through hitching a ride on an unsuspecting commercial satellite, a "fictive simulation" is broadcast.  Simultaneously, various "info-niches" in the target state are accessed by our net-warriors via the World Wide Web and the Internet.  These info-niche-targets, and the information they receive, are precision tailored to the strategic needs of the moment: some receive reinforcement for the fictive simulation; others receive the "real" truth; others receive merely slight variations.  What is happening here?  </P>

<P>This kind of eletronic information manipulation elevates the strategic potential of propaganda to new heights.  This is not traditional propaganda in which the target is discredited as a source of reliable information.  Rather, the very possibility of  "truth" is being replaced with "virtual reality" that is, information which produces effects independent of its physical reality.  What is being attacked in a strategic level netwar are not only the emotions, or motives, or beliefs of the target population, but the very power of objective reasoning: this threatens the very possibility of rational state control.</P>

<P>Let us return to the previous scenario to play out its effects.  The fictive simulation of the maximum leader's call to stop fighting would, of course, be followed immediately by a "real" broadcast in which te Voice and Vision exposes the netwar attack as propaganda invented by culture destroyers in Hollywood.  Jimmy Carter is denounced as a hoax.  But the damage has already been done: it is all but impossible for the television viewers of the targeted state, including military commanders, to tell which broadcast is true and which fiction, at least in a timely manner.  In a society under assault across its entire infosphere, it will become increasingly difficult for members of that society, but essential for the military, to verify internally the truth or accuracy of anything.  Objective reasoning is threatened.  </P>

<P>At the strategic level, the ability to "observe" is flooded by contradictory information and data; more importantly, the ability to "orient" is weakened by the assault on the very possibility of objective reasoning as the known is replaced by the fictive; "decisions" respond increasingly to this fictive or virtual universe and; of course, governmental and military "actions" become increasingly chaotic as there is no "rational" relationship of means to ends.  It would seem, then, that strategic level netwar or Information War brings us within sight of Sun Tzus elusive "acme of skill" wherein the enemy is subdued without killing by attacking his ability to form or execute a coherent strategy.8   Reality, especially battlefield reality, may be far more complex than the Info-warriors yet imagine, and victory not so neat.  The idea of "societal-level ideational conflict" must be considered with all the care given to the conduct of nuclear war as the "end state" of netwar may not be bloodless surrender, but total disruption of the targeted society.  Victory may be too costly as the cost may be truth and social order.</P>

<h4WHAT IS TRUTH</h4>

<P>Any discussion of Information Warfare, netwar, cyberwar, or even perception manipulation as a component of command and control warfare by the armed forces of the United States at the strategic level must occur in the context of the moral nature of communication in a pluralistic, secular, democratic society.  That is, the question must be raised whether using the techniques of information warfare at the strategic level is compatible with American law, purposes and principles.  Likewise, the question must be raised whether the armed forces of the United States have the constitutional, moral or legal authority and, more importantly, the practical ability to develop and deploy the techniques of Information Warfare at the strategic level in a prudent and practical manner.  There are good reasons to be skeptical. </P>

<P>According to the philosopher Eric Voegelin, the moral basis of communication in any society can be discussed in terms of its substantive, pragmatic, and intoxicant functions.9  The substantive purpose of communication is the building or developing of the individual human personality.  It is the process by which a substantive, real-world community of "like-minded" persons is created, developed and sustained.  Simply, it is the glue which binds a society together and orients the societys members to decide and act in the world.</P>

<P>At the most trivial level, the moral purpose of substantive communication can be seen in contemporary American efforts to remove sexist or racist language from accepted use.  At a more serious level, the debates in American society about family values and prayer in the public schools illustrate a recognition of the substantive and formative nature of communication in society, as "private religious views," in the view of many, must not corrupt the public school formation of character for life in pluralistic, modern America.  Finally, any real world society rests on the substantive communication and understanding among its members.  Again, in Voegelins terms, society is no mere external structure of relationships; it is a "cosmion," a universe of meaning illuminated with meaning from within by the human beings who continuously create and bear it as the mode and condition of their self-realization. 10 Substantive communication makes a society and the personalities of the individuals in it.</P>

<P>The efforts of several nations such as China, Iran, or Saudi Arabia to insulate their societies from the effects of the global communications network illustrate their awareness that their cultures and societies depend on a shared, substantive universe of discourse distinctive to their societies.  Even within the West, the French are fully aware that the continued existence of France as a distinctive society organized for action in history may require state intervention in the substantive content of communication within society.11  That France seeks to limits the percentage of foreign broadcast material and American films in Europe illustrates the seriousness with which they consider the substantive nature of communication.  </P>

<P>The acknowledgment of a substantive function of communication is, however, problematic in American society as the ethos of much of the dominant political class has reduced "morality" or character formation to a question of private prejudice.12 Religious arguments that abortion is wrong as it violates "natural law" are marginalized politically as "private opinion."  How long the armed forces will continue to be permitted to discipline an officer on the basis of such a quaint concept as adultery remains to be seen.     </P>

<P>Voegelins second construct, identifying the pragmatic function of communication in society, is reasonably straightforward.  Pragmatic communication is defined by its goal and consists of the whole range of techniques designed to influence other persons to behave in ways the communicator wishes.  Only behavior matters.  Most political and commercial communication is merely pragmatic.  It is usually indifferent to the substantive moral content of the message and intends to mold perception, and consequently behavior, to the purposes of the communicator.  The target of pragmatic communication, real human beings, is reduced to an object for manipulation.  The morally dubious quality of an advertising industry devoted to the development of the personalities of Americans as consumers of superfluous material goods needs little comment.  The morally destructive quality of political advertising which reduces civic discourse to conditioned response to sound-bytes and slogans has been seen, correctly, as a threat to democracy.  This pragmatic use of communication as an attempt at perception manipulation is, of course, the central essence of Information War: its use by the government and the armed forces is, consequently, the real issue.</P>

<P>Finally, the intoxicant function of communication in American society is equally straightforward.  The addiction of a considerable part of the citizenry to talk shows, soap operas, romance novels, professional sports broadcasts, high-profile legal trials and other well-known forms of distraction and diversion is well catered to by the "entertainment" industry.  Whatever the morality of the entertainment pushers denounced by Senator Dole, the intoxicant quality of much contemporary communication may be more a commentary on the bored, empty and confused personalities of the addicts.  The cultural impact of the U.S. entertainment industry on other nations is, again, widely recognized and is seen, correctly, as a form of cultural imperialism.</P>

<P>For Voegelin then, civil communication or public discourse in contemporary American society is dominated almost entirely by the intoxicant and pragmatic modes.  More importantly, the serious lack of substantive communication in American public life is defended by much of the secular and liberal political class in the name of freedom, pluralism and multiculturalism.  Pluralistic America is supposed to be a society in which the formation of character or opinion is left, through the use of various means of communication, to private initiative.  Government attempts at "communication" in an Information War, especially if prosecuted by the armed forces, would raise serious legal and moral questions in a pluralistic, multicultural society. </P>

<P>The official military view of strategy, recall, is the "art and science of developing and using political, economic, psychological, and military forces as necessary during peace and war, to afford the maximum support to policies, in order to increase the probabilities and favorable consequences of victory and to lessen the chances of defeat."   Strategy is the means to achieve an end, with military strategy, as Clausewitz observed, serving political or policy purposes.  A slightly different view of strategy, as developed by Admiral J.C. Wylie, exposes the key problem with Information War.  If strategy is a plan of action designed to achieve some end; a purpose together with a system of measures for its accomplishment, the limitations of Infowar thinking are obvious.13  </P>

<P>Sound military strategy as a general theory of power control requires influencing the adversary decision-maker in some way that is not only advantageous, but reasonably predictable.  The goal is control, not chaos.  A national security strategy of Information War or netwar at the strategic level, that is, "societal-level ideational conflict waged in part through internetted modes of communication," and an operational-level cyberwar or C2W campaign to decapitate the enemy's command structure from its body of troops, may or may not be "advantageous" but, more importantly, are unlikely to produce effects that are reasonably predictable.  Conflict or war is about a determinate some thing, not an indeterminate any thing.  If the goal of influencing the adversary's ability to "observe" by flooding him with corrupted or contradictory information and data; disrupting his ability to "orient" by the elimination of thepossibility of objective reasoning; and forcing his "decisions" to respond to a fictive or virtual universe, actions will, of course, be produced. They may, however, be actions which are chaotic, random, non-linear and inherently unpredictable by our side for the simple reason that there will be no "rational" relationship of means to ends.</P>

<P>In the context of military operational-level cyberwar or C2W, this appears to the Info-warrior as an attractive military strategy.  The inherently unpredictable nature of combat, Clausewitzs notorious "fog and friction" of real battle, will be amplified a hundredfold for the enemy in a successful cyberwar.  A successful cyber-strategy depends on the ability of the local military commander to deploy his power assets, especially his combat forces, not merely to dominate the enemy decision-cycle {which, after all, has just been rendered chaotic}, but to exploit battlefield opportunities as they evolve unpredictably from the disoriented, decapitated or irrational enemy actions.  Whether, then, C2W can shape the battlefield or will merely generate chaos remains to be seen.  </P>

<P>Cyber-strategy is the control of the evolution of the battlefield or theater power distribution to impose the allied commander's "order" on the enemy's "chaos."  As Sun-Tzu observed, "those who are able to adapt to changes in the enemy and achieve victory are considered supreme."14  The threat exists, however, that the destruction of the enemys command and control systems, and consequently, his rationality, may collapse "battle" into mere "fighting" with no outcome but surrender or death.  Merely defeating hostile fielded military forces may be insufficient for strategic victory.  Sun-Tzu also observed that "when battles gain victories and attacks achieve occupations, yet these successes are not followed up, it is disastrous.  This is known as 'persisting turmoil'."15  Whether the recent Gulf  War was a strategic victory or only one "battle" between Iraq and the U.S. remains for historians to judge.  Operational-level cyberwar may, then, be that very "acme of skill" which reduces the enemy will without killing.  On the other hand, cyberwar may also be the abolition of strategy as it attacks the very rationality the enemy requires to decide for war termination.</P>

<h4>STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS</h4>

<P>The tools, techniques and strategy for cyberwar or C2W are being developed and, during wartime, should be employed.  In many ways, given the harsh requirements of war fighting, cyberwar is more demanding than netwar. Information-based cyberwar, as it will be increasingly the combat form of the future, should be supported politically.  The resources, organization and training needed for cyberwar will be provided once its war winning, and casualty reducing, potential is grasped by the national command authorities and the political leadership in Congress.  This development is certainly prudent as information dominance is essential for stealth, precision strike, and dominating maneuvre.  On the other hand, many of these very same tools and techniques of battlefield cyberwar can be applied to netwar or strategic-level Information War.  This, however, may not be prudent, as there are serious reasons to doubt the ability of the United States to prosecute Information War successfully.</P>

<P>First, at the level of pragmatic communication, the United States is an open society and may be too vulnerable to engage in netwar with an adversary prepared to "fight back."16  The communications infrastructure, the information highway is "wide open" in our society.  Both Vice Adm. John M.McConnell, Director of the National Secuity Agency and Adm. William Studeman, former Deputy Director of the C.I.A., have argued that the United States is more vulnerable that any other nation to this kind of warfare.  American society is vulnerable to a strategic netwar attack as physical control and security may be impossible for the domestic computer, communication, and information networks essential for the daily functioning of American society.  These systems, especially the militarys systems, are under constant attack and are vulnerable to penetration, manipulation, or even destruction by determined hackers.17  In the future, these may not be unstructured anarchic amateurs but well-paid network-ninjas inserting the latest French, Iranian, or Chinese virus into Compuserve or the Internet.18  A strategic Information Warfare attack on America's communication systems, including our military communication systems, air traffic control system, financial net, fuel pipeline pumping software, or computer-based clock/timing systems could have the strategic effect of infrastructure or societal paralysis.  </P>

<P>If the goal of pragmatic communication is merely behavior modification and if our open society pretends to resist all attempts at manipulation, the opportunity for "benign" attempts to shape perceptions and public opinion by little-regulated foreign interests, whether governmental, business, or "private," is, again, an important vulnerability.  Currently, for example, there are over 14,000 data-bases on Internet accessible and used by over 30 million people in over 90 nations world-wide.  There are over 1,600 known software pirates prowling the Internet, some no doubt, in the employ of hostile commercial or intelligence services.  The recent spy flap between France and the United States over alleged U.S. attempts to gather data on French Telecom may be indicative of the future.19   The Pentagons own netwar security technicians succedded in penetrating over 85% of the Department of Defense systems they hacked and, more importantly, were undetected in over 95% of their attacks.20  Infosphere dominance -- controlling the world of information exchange -- may be as complex and elusive as "escalation dominance" appeared to be in nuclear strategy.21  It will certainly be expensive: Assistant Secretary of Defense for Communications, Emmett Paige Jr., estimates the cost of defensive network security for the Pentagon at over $15 billion.  The U.S. business community, Federal, State and local governments, and the U.S. armed forces, are required to devote ever more resources and attention to computer, communications and data-base security.  The resources and skills required for battlefield cyberwar, whether defensive or offensive, are not insignificant; the resources and skills required to wage Information War, offensively or defensively, at the national strategic level would be massive.</P>

<P>Second, the political and legal issues surrounding Infowar are murky.  What of congressional oversight -- would one declare information war in response, say, to an Iranian-originated computer virus assault on the FBIs central terrorist data-base?  And what about preparing for it -- developing and implementing a national capability for defensive or offensive netwar?  The National Security Agency can assist the Pentagon with defensive information security but has no legal authority in the private, civil or commercial information universe.  The National Bureau of Standards, oddly enough, has some authority and is quite jealous of its prerogatives.  While theoretically a requirement to develop or implement a national Information War strategy, analogous to the nuclear-era Single Integrated Operations Plan, could be communicated from the President to the executive branch agencies, it is unclear whether there is adequate Congressional oversight.  Which committees of the House or Senate would have control and oversight of policies attendant to Information War or, for example, inquire into the judgment of a local ambassador or military commander who wished to use the tools of cyberwar for a benign netwar attempt at perception manipulation in peacetime to shape the potential wartime environment?22  The U.S. armed forces execute the national military strategy, they do not control it.  The armed forces are developing, quite appropriately, the tools, techniques and strategy for operational-level cyberwar or C2W to execute the national military strategy and, consequently, albeit unintentionally, are simultaneously developing the tools and capabilities to execute a national, strategic Information War strategy.  The former is their job under the Constitution; the latter may not be.  Congressional oversight of the development of a national strategic-level Information War capability is even more essential than oversight of the intelligence community.</P>

<P>Third, Information War seen as "societal-level ideational conflict waged in part through internetted modes of communication" may simply be beyond the competence of the executive agencies who would have to determine the substantive content to be communicated.  Pluralism is a great strength of American society, but perhaps a drawback in waging Infowar.  While diversity may make the formation and execution of domestic and even foreign policy more complex, it can be argued that the lack of a moral center or public philosophy in American society would render the political leadership nearly incapable of building a consensus on any substantive content for strategic level Information War policies.  Official American public substantive communication concerns essentially private or personal contending secular visions of America.  For some, enlightened self-interest is the substance of the good society.  For others, liberal individualism, technological progress, ethno-nationalistic racialism, New Age self-actualization, or Montana survivalism are the public project.  And, as "Moral Reason," in the classical or religious sense of the distinctively human mode of moral discourse, has been replaced by contending private moralities, even a national security strategy of Information War could be developed by the national security elite which related resources and effort to purposes or ends without substantive political, public, or moral debate.</P>

<P>Finally, however, a concrete real-world human society targeted for Information War aimed at influencing the "emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior" of either leaders, citizens, or subjects is still, as Eric Voegelin observed, a universe of substantive conversation "illuminated with meaning from within by the human beings who continuously create and bear it as the mode and condition of their self-realization."  The technological wizardry does not change the humanity of the target.  Unless the goal of Information War is merely to use the techniques of pragmatic communication to unhinge people from their ability to reason objectively, and, consequently, create an interesting problem for post-conflict reconstruction, any strategic-level netwar or Information War would seem to require the ability to communicate a substantive replacement for the discredited substantive content of the target society.  </P>

<P>If, say, an Information War were to be mounted against China to disrupt its drive for regional hegemony, the goal would be to "withdraw the Mandate of Heaven" from the rulers and "influence" the Chinese leaders and people to adopt the policies or behavior we find appropriate.  Put in terms of such a concrete policy goal, the philosophically problematic nature of Information War becomes outrageously obvious.  Does anyone really believe that the U.S. national executive agencies, including the armed forces or the Central Intelligence Agency, knows the substantive discourse of China sufficiently well to withdraw the Mandate of Heaven?  Worse: does anyone really believe that any set of officials in the U.S. government or military has the philosophical sophistication to project an alternative substantive discourse to replace, convincingly, the emotions, motives, reasoning, and behavior grounded in the Chinese reality we propose to "influence?"  Would our fictive creation really have virtual effects.  Would our fictive creation really have predictable effects.  We might be able to use the armed forces or CIA to destroy their objective reasoning through a "successful" Information War.  We might indeed be able to loose mere anarchy in a society, but that is not usually the political goal of war-fighting.</P>

<h4>SECOND THOUGHTS</h4>

<P>The techniques being developed by the armed forces for a more narrowly constrained operational-level cyberwar or C2W military campaign whose goal is to exploit disoriented enemy actions by superior ability to deploy allied military assets is appropriate and even essential in war.  This was demonstrated in the Gulf War. Translated to the strategic level, however, netwar or Information War is not a prudent national security or military strategy for the simple reason that neither the armed forces nor any other instruments of national power have the ability to exploit an adversary's society in a way that promises either advantageous or predictable results.  "Societal-level ideational conflict" must be considered with all the care given to the conduct of nuclear war as the "end state" of a netwar may not be bloodless surrender, but total disruption of the targeted society.  Conflict resolution, including ending wars this side of blasting people into unconditional surrender, assumes and requires some rationality -- even if it is the mere coordination of ends with means.  Moral reasoning and substantive communication may not be required; minimal reasoning and pragmatic communication are required.  A successful all-out strategic-level Information War may, however, have destroyed the enemys ability to know anything with certainty and corrupted his ability to communicate as a society to such a degree that his capacity for minimal reasoning or pragmatic communication is destroyed.</P>

<P> On the assumption that it was never the goal of U.S. national security policy to totally destroy the Soviet Union,  the "decapitation" of the Soviet military leadership in a hypothetical nuclear exchange was intended to defend the United States by preventing an escalatory or exploitative strike, nuclear or otherwise.  Precisely how war-termination would have been accomplished without an effective Soviet leadership will remain, hopefully, one of the great mysteries.  The "decapitation" of the leadership is, however, often proposed as a key goal of an Information War.  That is, the credibility, legitimacy, or even physical ability to communicate of the leadership/decision-makers will be compromised or destroyed relative to their own population and in terms of their own orienting world-view.  And, even if we merely electronically seize his communication system to substitute our reality into his society, with whom, then, do we negotiate the end of the conflict?  What confidence do we have that a call to surrender, even if communicated to the people by either the enemy leadership or our net-warriors, would be accepted as "real" and not another "virtual" event?  And, depending on the content, intensity and "totality" of a strategic Information War, the political equivalent of psychological inflation is a genuine possibility.  Personalities could be flooded with irrational or unconsciousness factors -- the clinical consequence of which is generally acute psychosis.  Many members of the Japanese military in 1945, including the war minister, were prepared for Japan to commit national suicide like a beautiful flower.   How do we do conflict resolution, war-termination or post-conflict reconstruction with a population or leadership whose "objective reasoning" has been compromised, at best?  </P>

<P>As the mutually destructive effects of nuclear war were recognized by rational American and Soviet decision-makers as disproportionate with the goals of almost any imaginable conflict, likewise, the mutually destructive effects of a "total" Information War exchange on the humanity and the rational foundation of communication in either society may be equally disproportionate with the any rational political goals of the conflict.  And, as the techniques of cyberstrike proliferate throughout the international system, the ability of even small powers, non-state actors, or even hacker-terrorists to gain the capabilities to do massive damage to the United States, mutually-assured-cyber-destruction may result in a kind of Infowar deterrence.  The Pentagons own Defense Science Board has admitted that Information Warfare technologies and capabilities are being developed in the open-market, beyond government control and that a Third World  nation could procure a formidable, modern IW capability virtually off-the-shelf. 23  Infowar deterrence or Infowar arms-race?  As Sun-Tzu observed, then, "without advantage, do not act; without gain, do not utilize; without crises, do not battle."24  </P>

<P>Information Warfare is the central national security issue of the 21st century and the United States must develop a coherent national-level policy on the military and strategic use of these new technologies and capabilities in peace and war.  The U.S. armed forces are developing, under the rubric of Command & Control Warfare, the technologies and systems needed to provide the needed capability for cyberwar.  The control and exploitation of information and information technologies to impose or adapt the local military commander's battlefield order to purposely generated stochastic chaos may be possible, then, in operational cyberwar.  Even here, there are some doubts.25  Most of these same electronic technologies and systems, however, can be used to develop a national-level strategic capability for netwar.  Here, there are genuine doubts.  The control and exploitation of information and information-based technologies to impose a form on the remnants of societies no longer capable of self-organization because their substantive universe of meaning has been destroyed or corrupted may, as Voegelin feared, not be possible.26  Few Info-warriors would claim the ability to re-orient the former Soviet Union into a liberal, Western society or influence the far more ancient barbarism in that Heart of Darkness - Rwanda.  Perhaps strategic-level Information War, netwar, is, indeed, like nuclear war: the capability must be developed if there is to be deterrence; its employment, however, would be the folly of mutually assured destruction.</P>

<P>If the United States is to build the capacity for Information War, in the sure and certain knowledge that the required technologies have already proliferated to both state and non-state potential rivals, a realistic national dialog must occur and a realistic, substantive consensus must be built.  It is useless and dangerous to pretend that the proliferation of these information warfare technologies will not provide capabilities to peer, niche, or even rogue competitors to do serious harm to American society.  It is useless and dangerous to pretend that military-based cyberwar or C2W capabilities will not be developed by potential enemies as there is almost universal recognition, even in the so-called Third World, that these capabilities are essential on the contemporary battlefield.27 It is useless and naive to pretend that cyberwar technologies could not be turned to netwar applications.  It is essential, then, that the armed forces, the foreign and domestic intelligence and law-enforcement communities, the Presidents National Security Council, the Congress, and, most importantly, the American public give serious and sustained attention to cyberwar, netwar and Information War.  Perhaps like Chuang Tzus gardener, we will say it is not that I do not know about this invention; but that I should be ashamed to use it. </P>

<h4>An Information Warfare SIIOP?</h4>


<P>The ability to create, disseminate, access, and manipulate information for one's own ends and to control information available to competitors or adversaries produces a potential for decisive advantage.</P>

<P>Global Presence Information operations are no longer a cost of doing business, but presence and warfighting methods in their own right.  They substitute for force in some cases, and increasingly serve as a multiplier when force is required.</P>

<P>The Honorable Dr. Sheila A. Widnall,  Secretary of the Air Force2Introduction	The post-World War II superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, danced an exhausting danse macabre for much of this century.  Some far future military or political historian may look back on the era and conclude that throughout the danse each partner took turns leading the other.  Stalin, this historian might offer as an example, danced in ways that had the unintended consequence of creating the United States' Strategic Air Command (SAC) in 1947.  The United States, it could be argued, waltzed in a manner that probably unwittingly led to creation of robust Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces.  Whatever else may be arguable, it cannot be argued that it was Gorbachev who ended the dance.  The demise of SAC followed the disintegration of the Soviet Union in tandem in 1992.  Any post-Gorbachev dance with Russia will be a new dance, since so much has changed on both sides of the Atlantic since 1992.  The dance of US and Soviet potential nuclear omnicide3 indeed may have ended, but somewhere in the background the soft strains of other kinds of conflict made with other kinds of instruments continue.  The partners may change, the instruments and music may change, but the United States must be prepared to dance.  Taking a leaf from a past relationship suggests that new weapons and emerging capabilities may invite a return to old forms.  Organizational entities like SAC and the Joint Strategic Planning Staff, properly modified, may be useful models still.  </P>

<h4>The Management of "Force"</h4

<h4>Concentrating Power</h4>

<P>	During its life SAC existed to pose the credible threat of extinction to the Soviet state and hundreds of millions of its comrade-citizens.  It did this by readiness to strike them with large numbers of the most powerful weapons of mass destruction available in its time.  Any serious international misbehavior of the Soviet state carried with it the risks of greater death and destruction than Russia experienced in the entire Stalin era, including collectivization, purges, World War II, and the years of the gulag.  Non-combatants had little or no sanctuary.4  We called this threat "deterrence": a form of fire prevention made possible by the credible threat of arson.  The conception of nuclear deterrence spawned the SIOP (Single Integrated Operations Plan).5  The SIOP was the United States' single and dominant plan for marshaling all of its most powerful weapons--nuclear weapons--to concentrate them, when and if necessary, against the Soviet state, its citizens, and its satraps.  Yet the SIOP, supporters and commentators relate, need not have been just an Armageddon plan.  The SIOP allowed for tailoring or customization of attacks.  Its attacks could be unlimited, or they could be limited.6   The SIOP's advantages were that it was one plan, integrated, synchronized, and carefully maintained.  Nuclear weapons command respectful attention.  They remain powerful still, but a greater and more usable power may exist.  That power is the power of information weapons and information warfare, new instruments for a new dance.  This essay argues that information warfare eventually needs its own SIIOP (a term I will explain later) to employ information weapons.  Further, the essay inquires into some of the possible features of that SIIOP using the nuclear SIOP as an analogy.  The questions raised are, and must be, left unanswered for the present.  </P>

<h4>Information Power Defined</h4>

<P>	What is information warfare and what are information weapons?  Information warfare is warfare waged against the epistemology, the entire structure of knowledge and beliefs, of an adversary.  Information war, like execution of the SIOP, could be total war but need not be.  The object of information warfare, unlike nuclear warfare, is to subdue hostile will utterly, but without, or with little, physical fighting.  (In this regard, if Desert Storm was the first organized information war, then(and given such capabilities as described by Winn Schwartau7 and others(it merely might have been the "beta" version.)  The target sets of information warfare are the minds of adversary leaders and adversary citizens: the humans that add the hostile will transforming a state or group into a hostile one.  To subdue hostile or non-cooperative will, information warfare attacks the mind, that complex of protein and synapses and nerve bundles and electro-chemical functions that host the will and determine human behavior.  Information warfare is "neocortical warfare."8  Attacks against the mind of the adversary, particularly the minds of adversary decision makers, formerly were prosecuted indirectly or circuitously.  That is, to reach and change the mind of the adversary, warfare attacked the "body" of the adversary with physical force.  The body's sensory circuits relayed messages to the "will," trusting that the will would yield when the body had been damaged sufficiently.  Taken together, this body was any or all of the components of the Clausewitzian trinity: the people, the armed forces, or the government.  </P>

<P>	While Clausewitz concentrated his study on the armed forces, he acknowledged that the aim of fighting between opposed remarkable trinities was political.  That is, warfare aimed to force the people-army-government trinity of an adversary state to yield to the will of our state's people-army-government by opposing the adversary's hostile will with physical force.  The most effective way to do that in the last century was to vitiate hostile means in physical battle, preferably Hauptschlacht, one great decisive battle.  The means destroyed, the will would surrender.  Yet today one may speculate that information weapons technologies may exist and may be emerging that offer the promise of subjugation with less violence.  These information weapons and employment schemes theoretically may aim directly at the adversary's mind.  This is, excuse the pun, heady stuff.  </P>

<h4>What are Information Weapons?</h4>

<P>	Information weapons are any tools intentionally employed to affect the mind of the adversary with minimum physical force and in such a way as to have a high probability of compelling the adversary to do our will.  It is critical to understand that information warfare is not just command and control warfare.  Command and control warfare is a very small and specific form of information warfare waged with very unsophisticated weapons.  The tools and aims of command and control warfare are modest.  Nonetheless, a brief examination of these tools is an instructive introduction into the larger universe of information warfare.  </P>

<P>	The Joint Staff describes these tools as deception, psychological operations, electronic warfare, physical destruction, and operations security.  Their orchestrated use aims to affect adversary decision making and troop control during engagements between hostile military forces or when an engagement is imminent.9  Command and control warfare--like the information warfare of which it is a part--appreciates that the decision making process, as described by John Boyd, requires observations of the external world, some orientation to internally generated or externally sensed phenomena, a decision to act based on these observations and orientation, and action.10  	Deception aims to corrupt enemy observations.  Sensory phenomena are magnified, reduced, hidden, or otherwise changed.  The enemy sees or hears things that are not there or does not see or hear the things that are there.  Exploitable mismatches arise.  Psychological operations affect the adversary's orientation and decision making.  Psychological operations attempt to change the enemy's orientation in both the long and short term, thereby modifying adversary decision making and affecting enemy actions.  Electronic warfare disables or diminishes the enemy's radio-electronic capability, whether that capability is used for sensing, weapon guidance, or for communications.  Destruction can eliminate decision makers, equipment used for observation or for relaying decisions, or even some of the forces taking action.  Operations security simultaneously protects friendly forces and amplifies the intended effects of deception, electronic warfare, and psychological warfare operations.   </P>

<P>	Command and control warfare is military stuff.  The elements of command and control warfare seem to require an acknowledged state of hostilities between belligerents or actual combat.  The principal objective of command and control warfare is to enhance the military capabilities of friendly forces while simultaneously reducing the command and control capabilities of the adversary.  Thus, and no matter how wonderfully done, command and control warfare is fighting done too late and only capable of achieving tactical effects.  Strategic level information warfare would be much less modest in that it could aim for more profound effects.  The larger aim, and one suspects presently unappreciated aim, of strategic information warfare requires much more sophisticated weapons than "force-enhancing" command and control warfare.  At the zenith in the arsenal are, or would be, undetectable information weapons employed so elegantly that the adversary retains the illusion of choice throughout the force application or "combat."  </P>

<h4>What is Combat?</h4>

<P>	Combat itself requires new conceptions in information warfare, the horrified protestations of military historians notwithstanding.11  Combat in this new view is any interaction wherein the aim of the activity is for the collective national security forces of the United States to change the mind of an adversarial state or group without fighting.  Although waging strategic level information warfare would be a seat-of-government decision in the United States, the target need not be another state.  The target could be an adversary like a  terrorist group.  The target could be an economic entity, a competitor, and the combat theoretically could be a "trade war."  Strategic level information warfare does not even require a publicly declared state of hostilities.  Strategic level information warfare could be waged as a preventative to a more conventional kind of warfare.  Information warfare, fully exploited, eradicates the demarcation between peace and war, between military and civilian, between combatant and non-combatant.  Just as the SIOP planned, if necessary, to take on the entire Soviet state with nuclear weapons, information warfare could engage the entire adversary state or group with its weapons.  Just as the SIOP could limit its attacks, so too could information warfare.  </P>

<P>	The weapons of information warfare are not just those things affected by physical or materiel information systems: computers, software, telephony, telecommunications, electrical power generation, and so forth.  Nor would information combat necessarily be restricted to information-based systems such as banking, finance, credit, air traffic control, and the previously mentioned command and control or troop control apparatus.  The weapons of next generation information warfare also could include tools designed to enable entering and affecting the brain: sounds, smells, images, tastes, and feelings.  They might include drugs.  They might include pheromones.  They most certainly would include pixels, and zeroes and ones, and images.  Because information weapons and information warfare can include so much, strategic information warfare would seem to require a Single Interagency Information Operations Plan for its most effective employment.  That SIIOP appears to be lacking.  Unlike the SIOP, which was a military attack plan produced with some civilian oversight, a SIIOP must be, from the beginning, an interagency plan.12  Today the lack of a single, interagency information operations plan may not be a serious shortcoming.  But, if information weapons and information warfare have the potential for revolutionizing conflict, the process of orchestration needs to be considered.  Orchestration will be difficult.  We are not without either historical data or service cultural norms to examine in this regard.  </P>

<h4>What Should We Expect from the Services, CINCs, and Agencies?</h4>

<P>	If the past is any guide, and as with any discovery of potential new weapons or a potential new warfare form, we can expect the armed forces initially to employ the novel to enhance the already-existing old and familiar.  A special cell or group of experts will arise--artillerists, a Signal Corps, an Air Corps, the 509th Bomb Group, SAC, a Space Command, an Information Warfare Center, and so forth.  These out-of-the-mainstream experts will be charged to apply the new to improve the old.  Concentration on command and control warfare as a means of force enhancement, for example, is explained by the logic of the model of previous behavior.  The original view of nuclear weapons, it should be noted, was that they were nothing more than very powerful conventional bombs.  Congressional testimony provided during the 1950's,13  as well as the nuclear weapons tests conducted using some of our own uniformed (and uninformed) citizens as clinical material, illuminate this view.</P>

<P>	As with nuclear weapons or any other new weapon technology, we can count on the services, being federated (and presently not unified or integrated), to charge off somewhat helter-skelter and in a disintegrated way with their own programs and their own new organizations for new weapons technology.  Each service can be expected to make its own discoveries regarding weapons and weapons employment schemes.  Most often this will be done within the boundaries of "my mission" or "to enhance forces operating in my assigned warfare media."  Each service might attempt to hide these discoveries from the other services.  Missions are money, and it is money, as Cicero observed, that constitutes the sinews of warfare.14  	The commanders-in-chief of the unified commands, the CINCs, will learn of discoveries from their parent service and attempt to acquire and assimilate these new capabilities in their functional or geographical area of responsibility.  (It is a fiction to believe that CINCs are mysteriously transformed into the Prodigal Sons of their parent service after confirmation as CINCs.)  When CINCs acquire a new capability, usually they are insistent that they simultaneously acquire the authority to employ it "should conditions warrant."  Other government agencies will follow similar approaches: discovery, development, perhaps even limited deployment.  If the Central Intelligence Agency makes an information warfare discovery, for example, the Agency is not necessarily obligated to share it with the Department of Defense.  </P>

<P>	The arsenal of such weapons and capabilities could grow in the process, but until marshaled and integrated, will be less effective than it might have been.  Worse, the commercial sector, especially those segments of it expert in communications, computing machines, entertainment, and the mind, will also discover what could become weapons and weapon employment schemes.  Hollywood and Wall Street, for example, had little interest in acquiring nuclear weapons.  Information weapons may be different.  There might prove to be, for example, scant differences between "marketing" and "propaganda," or between "advertising" and "psychological operations."  There also may be scant difference between entertainment and propaganda, or between "infomercials" and some aspects of "information warfare."  </P>

<P>	How and by whom can the resources for strategic information warfare be marshaled?  Lacking a National Security Decision Memorandum (NSDM), a Presidential Directive (PD), a Presidential Decision Document (PDD), or the contemporary analog of a Gates Commission, a Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (JSTPS) for information warfare cannot be created.  Lacking this JSTPS, neither seat-of-government guidance, nor the advice and consent of the Legislative branch, nor the judgments of the Judicial branch, nor a data base of targets and an integrated plan to attack them will emerge.  Lacking an integrated plan, we remain incapable of prosecuting strategic level information warfare against hostile, or potentially hostile, states or groups.  Worse, we run the risk of being very seriously disadvantaged should we encounter an adversary nation or group that has a strategic information operations plan and its attendant capabilities.  The ubiquity of information technology and reliance on it, the apparent growing importance of economic vitality, and the awareness that, at some point, we may approach the limit of the planet's resources and carrying capacity, makes pessimistic forecasts possible, if not quite yet worrisome.  Some one out there might be hateful or desperate enough to attack us.  "Hackers" may be the precursor model.  </P>

<h4>Converting the SIOP Lexicon for the SIIOP</h4>

<P>	Information technology is ubiquitous and can create asymmetries between opposing forces or groups.  An adversary capable of waging information war need not be an easily recognizable great military power.  Presuming that such an adversary exists or will emerge (perhaps as the much discussed, much feared "niche" or "peer" competitor of the Revolution in Military Affairs), and presuming a NSDM or PD eventually were forthcoming, what employment doctrine would national leadership espouse through this directive?  Would we take a counterforce approach, limiting our offensive operations to retaliation against the adversary's information systems?  Would we be directed to take a countervalue perspective and attack the minds of the adversary more directly?   Would we aim to deter information warfare?  Would we opt for mutual assured information destruction?  Or should we build our information forces for flexible or selective response?  Would it be wise to have some limited information warfare response options?  Would execution authority reside with the person of the President of the United States, or would the president delegate the authority for some attacks against adversary epistemology to military commanders or even to the commercial sector?  Would we be prepared for protracted information warfare?  </P>

<P>	What would the military and non-military force responsible for executing the SIIOP look like?  Which service or agency would provide the Director of Strategic Target Planning?  How would this force integrate with non-military forces: the entertainment industry, the press, commercial telecommunications industries, the biomedical industry, the Central Intelligence Agency?  Who would prepare the catalog of targeted installations, or targeted epistemologies?  How would the catalog be modified, updated, or revised?  To whom would the SIIOP revision be briefed for approval?  What would it look like?  How would targets be categorized?  Would forces be on alert?  What would these alert forces look like?  What would generated forces look like?  How does the SIOP notion of range or refueling apply to information operations?  Does misinformation extend the range of information, for example?  What is an information operations sortie and how are sorties deconflicted to prevent fratricide?  How do notions of positive and negative control apply to strategic level information warfare?  Would some information warfare weapons require permissive action links, or PAL?  What is information warfare escalation?  What are the escalation control mechanisms?  With whom would we establish an incorruptible communications link similar to MOLINK, and what would it look like?  </P>

<P>	What does precision mean as it applies to information warfare attacks?  Are there precision guided messages (PGM) that could be aimed at single minds?  Does the notion of circular error probable become the idea of calculated error probability (CEP) through the statistical technique of Markhov-chaining in information warfare?15  What are the canons of epistemological damage expectancy or probability of damage?  What is information collateral damage and how would it be controlled?  What is the information equivalent of fallout and what would a fallout shelter look like?  Is there any civil defense against strategic level information warfare?  What science, technology, or arcane art would provide the machine necessary to assure us that truth or validity had not been corrupted?  Is there a dosimeter awaiting discovery?  Could attacks against some areas or categories of targets be withheld in a globally-internetted infosphere?  What is information warfare termination and how would it be managed and by whom?  During the heyday of the danse, a special office of the Joint Staff annually created a Red Integrated Strategic Offensive Plan, or RISOP--essentially a notional Soviet SIOP--to assess the consequences of attacks against the United States.  What would be the equivalent of an information warfare RIISOP, a "Redoubtable Integrated Information Strategic Offensive Plan"?  And who would create the RIISOP?  What would an information strategic defense initiative look like?  Should we opt for area defenses--banking and finance, our free press--or do point defenses--the National Military Command Center, The National Inquirer(, the Federal Reserve--seem to make more sense?  </P>

<P>	In the wake of massive information warfare attacks would some earnest scientists warn of an information winter, a global epistemological condition wherein "truth" is largely destroyed?16  Would some argue for an information freeze or information-free zones?  Would the bishops of one faith group assert that information warfare was only moral if it existed to deter?17  Would another faith group issue a document entitled In Defense of Truth?18  These and many other questions come to mind as the future possibility of strategic level information warfare is contemplated.  </P>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<P>	We likely have some time to ask and answer these and other questions.  If our national security strategy summons us to "engagement," however, we must offer to dance.19  If we dance, what will our partners do to affect our steps?  Information technology engages us everywhere with everyone, and that technology is characterized by tremendous daily "enlargement."  How do we know that someone is not already fighting with us?  That possibility is to be expected.  The question to which we must attend is what is the organizational structure that protects us and allows us to deter or fight back most effectively?  Studying the development of nuclear weapons, the creation of the JSTPS, and the old SIOP may provide clues.  It would seem to be wiser to have a new Single Interagency Information Operations Plan (SIIOP) sooner rather than too late.  Or, we might reject the entire notion, trusting that nations and groups are becoming the long-heralded global village.20  Which course appears to be the wiser one?  To not decide yet is, of course, to make a decision.  Some decisions, good or bad, are definitive.  Word Count: 3,679 (4,500 or so with Endnotes)</P>

Boyd suggests that the way to win is to operate (that is, to observe, get oriented, decide, and act) more quickly than an adversary.  Ways to do this include depriving the adversary of essential information, overloading the adversary with puzzling or difficult to interpret information, using the adversary's "genetic heritage" or "cultural tradition" so that the enemy is self-disoriented or self-deceived, frustrating adversary actions, or denying the enemy feedback, or accurate feedback on the consequences of action taken.  All of this is designed to "Generate uncertainty, confusion, disorder, panic, chaos. . . ."  All of this is designed to "shatter cohesion, produce paralysis, and bring about collapse."  <BR>

THE THICKNESS OF CONCRETE ON THE MAGINOT LINE

<p>As the traditional military and law enforcement minds confront the threats of information terrorism,  the most likely reaction will be to call for more procedures, better technologies, more exhaustive checklists, tighter specifications, regulations, laws and budget increases.</p>
<p>Somehow this reminds me of how the Maginot Line was built. The thickness of the concrete and the configuration of the steel reinforcement were specified in exquisite detail. The defenders were sealed behind heavy steel doors that met the best banking vault requirements.</p>
<p>It also reminds me of the Baldrige Prize. </p>
<p>The Department of Commerce has assembled the most comprehensive catalogue of what experts believe to be prescriptions for excellence. It is the check-list to qualify for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, instituted by Congress in 1987 and administered by the Department of Commerce at a cost of $3.4 million per year. Applying for the Baldrige involves an elaborate process. Specially appointed examiners assign prescribed ratings to hundreds of acts before they can agree that an organization has earned the nomination. </p>
<p>From 1988 through 1995 there were 23 Baldrige Award recipients. Ten organizations are privately held or have been merged so that financial data are not available. One of these firms, Wallace Co., won the Baldrige in 1990, only to file two years afterwards for bankruptcy protection as the expense for  keeping up their meritorious habits soared.</p>
<p>Of the remaining thirteen, only two show a positive Economic Value-Added for the seven year period from 1988 through 1994. The Solectron Corporation and Corning, Inc. added $134 million to the U.S. economy. Eleven of the winning firms  such as Armstrong World Industries, Motorola, Eastman Chemical, Xerox, Federal Express, Texas Instruments, Westinghouse, General Motors and IBM, all show negative Economic Value-Added and detracted a total of $100,678 million from the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Implications for the Information Defenses</p>
<p>There is a mentality that will always invest enormous efforts in coming up with lists of the best generic policies how to protect our institutions. These are admirable endeavors, which are comparable to an encyclopedia of every conceivable idea that someone thinks as having merit. </p>
<p>However, following every one of such prescriptions will not  guarantee security, because  implementing all of the good ideas will be neither feasible nor affordable. Specifying, in sublime detail, operating practices - such as escrow keys and mandatory encryption algorithms - so that they can be checked off against government policies and directives  is futile and most likely counterproductive. The government would make a far better contribution by working on a framework and process how organizations can specify the desired levels of security assurance and how management can then establish what levels of security assurance are worthwhile. Only after that is done would commercial organizaitons be in a position to look up the catalogue of technological fixes and great ideas to find which ones will fit reality of specific situations, such as in banking, electric power distribution, telephony, etc.  Only after industry groups in negotiating protection practices which they cannot manageon their own. The cops are called by banks only after the bank's own protective measures have failed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, along the precedents set by the builders of the Maginot line, we will pour lots of "quality concrete" into holes that our adversaries will simply overlook as irrelevant.</p>

<p>This is only the BBC intro and two paragraphs from the article.  Full text is available through Lexus Nexus or other content providers.</p>
<p>BBC Summary of World Broadcasts (August 1, 1996)</p>
<p>Source: 'Jiefangjun Bao', Beijing, in Chinese 21 May 96 p6</p>
<p>China has established a Military Strategies Research Centre in which the emphasis will be placed on winning the " information warfare  of the information age" . According to an article in the Chinese army newspaper 'Jiefangjun Bao', China needs to develop an "oriental military strategy" based on the needs of the new era. The following is the text of an article by Zhang Feng entitled: "PLA [People's Liberation Army] military strategic study enters new phase: round-up of speeches of experts and scholars delivered at founding ceremony of Military Strategic Research Centre":</p>
<p>"After the Gulf War, when everyone was looking forward to eternal peace, a new military revolution emerged. This revolution is essentially a transformation from the mechanized warfare of the industrial age to the  information warfare of the information age.  Information warfare  is a war of decisions and control, a war of knowledge and a war of intellect. The aim of  information warfare will be gradually changed from "preserving oneself and wiping out the enemy" to "preserving oneself and controlling the opponent" .  Information warfare includes electronic warfare, tactical deception, strategic deterrence, propaganda warfare, psychological warfare, network warfare and structural sabotage, all of which have something to do with strategy. </p>
<p>The "all-conquering stratagems" of Sun Zi more than two millenniums ago, such as "vanquishing the enemy without fighting" and subduing the enemy by "soft strike" or "soft destruction" , could finally be truly realized under today's technological conditions.  Information warfare  needs oriental military strategy. Oriental military strategy must be based on the needs of the new era,needs to be developed with the help of new technological conditions and needs to move towards a new stage."

<p>We are at the dawn of a new age, one that will have a profound impact on the way we live, work and fight.  No longer is military effectiveness simply a function of delivering ordnance to target.  The evolving art of "information warfare" offers the promise of an entirely different means of ensuring national security and the defense of national interests.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Information plays a crucial role in the conduct of warfare. In fact, the evolution of warfighting can be traced more readily through advances in information systems than through advances in weaponry.</p>
<p>The agrarian revolution of mankind's early history was based on ploughs and the animals that pulled them.  Metal-working ability was a prerequisite, which in turn led to the development of armor, swords, etc.  Wars were fought primarily by non-professional militia forces, and standing armies were practically nonexistent (a notable exception is the Spartan land  armies of the fifth century B.C.).[1] </p>
<p>Warfare during this epoch was conducted on a comparatively  small scale.  For instance, the entire Athenian army at the start  of the Peloponnesian War in 431 B.C. was roughly as large as a contemporary infantry division.  Information was derived empirically,  and transmitted either by hand or by some limited form of long distance communication (e.g., smoke signals). The industrial revolution, based on engines and the fuels that fed them, vastly increased a society's production capability as well as its capital.  This creation of a large, powerful middle class led to the establishment of massive professional armies that numbered (in some cases) in the millions.  The concept of _levee en masse_, promulgated during the French Revolution, made "total war" a reality.  The conduct of warfare was ferocious, as evidenced in the battles of Gettysburg, Verdun  ("_On ne passe pas!_"), and Stalingrad. Today, the information revolution -- rooted in computers and the networks that connect them -- is undoing the ills of the industrial revolution.  The ability to instantaneously transmit information to anywhere on the globe has made Napoleon's strategy of applying massive force at decisive points obsolete and morally unpalatable.</p>
<p>The Clausewitzian trinity of the political leadership, military and populace has shifted dramatically to the people. No longer will populations stand for the wholesale slaughter and destruction of strategic bombing campaigns, such as those conducted in Japan during World War II (which left over eight million homeless and killed hundreds of thousands).[2]  In Operation DESERT STORM, the world was offered a glimpse of the future's potential: precision-guided munitions minimizing collateral damage; intelligence networks providing realtime information relay (cf. CNN); and crippling blows dealt to key decisionmaking nodes in order to minimize retaliation.  The prospectus for the 21st century is that he who wins the  information war will be the victor.</p>
<p>Information warfare offers many prospects for non-hard kill engagements that prevent a shooter from ever getting int  a position to fire.  However, though the United States has a doctrine for all elements of hard kill warfare, "[w]hat is missing ... is doctrine for information."[3]</p>

<h4>Global Outlook</h4>

<p>Several factors will have a significant impact on warfighting in the 21st century.  Among them are the demonopolization of information, the proliferation of technology and manufacturing expertise, and the likelihood of combating adversaries equipped with assets of blue manufacture.  In addition, the political stresses associated with renascent nationalism will have a debilitating impact on global stability and the traditional means of coalition warfare. The end of the Cold War has witnessed the decreasing prevalence of nation-states with absolute geographical boundaries as mechanisms of political power.  Nation-states gained predominance as a political entity following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 and the model regime of Louis XIV, who established a centralized bureaucracy with administrative control over a geographical concentration of people bound by a common culture.  </p>
<p>Due to the limited methods of communication and information dissemination -- usually text printed on a Gutenberg-style press -- collocation was vital. Telecommunications technology is eliminating the boundaries of knowledge and thought.  "Nations" (i.e.,collections of people with common political interests, such as the Palestine Liberation Organization) no longer presuppose geographical collocation.  The ability to instantaneously transmit information from one location to any other on the globe, coupled with the renascent nationalistic fervors (in locales as diverse as Abkhazia, Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Timor, Ghana and Bosnia-Hercegovina), will have a profound impact on the very nature of the threat to America's national interests.</p>
<p>The greatest threat to national security in the 21st century will come not from an industrial power mobilizing massive conventional forces (and providing extensive strategic warning), but from geographically-dispersed "cyberwarriors" operating on the world's information superhighways seeking to upset fragile communications links. The cyberspace of information warfare promises to become the principal "battlefield" of the 21st century.</p>

<h4>Prospectus</h4>

<p>The center of gravity of modern militaries is shifting from large force concentrations to the fragile command and control networks that relay vital information to deployed units --be they small infantry units, fighter squadrons performing defensive counter-air missions, or destroyers creating an ASW picket.  Every element of warfighting is increasingly dependent on information obtained from both organic and nonorganic sensors.</p>
<p>Information warfare constitutes an entirely different method of warfighting.  While the revolution of air power earlier this century gave operational commanders new ways to perform the traditional task of delivering ordnance to target, the developments of the information revolution will give the "C4I warrior" the ability to prevent a shooter from ever coming close to delivering weapons.</p>
<p>Beyond simply spoofing "bogeys" with false track information so their precision-guided munitions go astray, lines of supply and logistics networks can be upset long before an engagement seems imminent.  Imagine the havoc that would ensue  if an electronic requisition for spare parts of a critical system component (e.g., o-rings) was clandestinely decreased by several orders of magnitude -- or if a request for a particularly expensive component were similarly increased. The purveyors of information warfare must be highly specialized, joint operators.  Information warfare _demands_ jointness.  Interoperability and portability among Navy battlegroups, Army and Marine divisions, Air Force wings and even Coast Guard assets is essential if the U.S. is going to be an effective combatant in the battlefields of the 21st century. Failure to do so will result in too many varying protocols to be effective, and a lack of synergy in an extranational engagement.</p>

<h4>The C4I Warrior</h4>

<p>In their landmark document entitled "C4I for the Warrior,"  the Joint Staff (J-6) established a precedent for integrating  modern information technologies into the warfare environment.  Acknowledging that teamwork is the key to achieving the vision of a joint, interoperable architecture, Admiral Richard C. Macke, USN (then Director, J-6; currently U.S. CINCPAC) identified the warrior's needs as "a fused, realtime, true representation of the Warrior's battlespace -- an ability to order, respond and coordinate horizontally and vertically to the degree necessary to prosecute his mission in that battlespace."[4]</p>
<p>The proliferation of information processing technologies -- already a _fait accompli_ -- is fulfilling the vision of J-6, creating an entity that can be described as the "C4I Warrior."  While information processing and dissemination was once the sole purview of operations specialists and other technically-oriented billets, the warfare environment of the 21st century will require that everyone be competent in the art of information war.The C4I Warrior is representative of any warfighting element that uses, creates or manipulates information in order to gain an operational or a tactical advantage.  The spectrum encompasses elements as granular as a ten-man infantry squad outfitted with position locating and reporting transceivers (PLRS) to those as grandiose as an amphibious ready group with a Marine expeditionary unit and integrated tactical flag command center (TFCC).</p>
<p>Some Principles of Information Warfare</p>
<p>The technological developments of the transistor age have undermined the traditional focus of warfare on elements of space (_vice_ time).  Clausewitz's distillation of Napoleon into theory, and Mahan's extension of Clausewitzian concepts to naval warfare, both focused on the spatial elements of warfare --the massive accumulation of force at decisive points, the military control of spatial dimensions, and the demands of logistics manifested in "culminating points."</p>

<p>However, more appropriate to the modern age of warfare is a balanced, "spacetime" approach akin to Sir Julian Corbett's principles of maritime strategy.  While Mahan wrote of sea control in a context that was pervasive in its spatiality (asserting continuous control of the seas, forcing an enemy back into his ports where his ships could be dealt with at the leisure of his opponent), Corbett introduced temporal considerations -- i.e., "sea denial" -- to maritime strategy.  Rather than expending resources to constantly secure vital sea lines of communication (SLOCs) by way of "positive sea control," Corbett admonished naval  strategists to instead work toward denying an adversary critical  access to his own SLOCs.  An enemy who lacks control of his own sea lanes lacks the means by which to threaten others. To paraphrase Corbett, "The object of information warfare must always be directly or indirectly either to secure the command of information or to prevent the enemy from securing it."[5]</p>

<h4>Strategies of the Offensive</h4>

<p>A key element of the information warfare environment is the participants need not possess superpower status.  Any power (even those not considered nation-states) with a modicum of technology can disrupt fragile C2 networks and deny critical information services.  Rather than a Mahanian "information control" strategy that attempts to dominate all segments of the information spectrum, though, a more realistic strategy for U.S. forces is one of "information denial" (i.e., the denial of access to truthful information).</p>
<p>As technology has grown, so too have the dimensions of the engagement envelope.  Over-the-horizon weapons, "fired and forgotten," are commonplace on the modern battlefield -- as is the operators' reliance on the veracity of their sensor displays. The inability to empirically confirm or deny the presence of a threat has created a new sense of "truth" -- that which corresponds to the perception of sensor data. Manipulation of an adversary's data in order to provoke (or deny) a reaction is not a new idea.  However, rather than flooding the electromagnetic spectrum with broadband energy -- as dictated by current electronic warfare doctrine -- more elegant methods of information warfare subtly manipulate the signals an enemy's sensors provide to his decisionmaking </p>
<p>Such forms of "very soft kill" can be accomplished remotely through any networks to which an adversary may be connected, or locally by embedding malicious signals into a carrier wave to be detected by enemy sensors. Other means of "very soft kill" of information systems include overload (e.g., filling a message buffer with superfluous electronic mail messages so as to diminish its efficiency) and denying services by electronically "cracking" a system and altering file structures.</p>
<p>The offensive opportunities of the information revolution will allow global disruption of critical C2 networks, effectively "cutting an enemy's head off and leaving his body to die."  Soft and very soft kill techniques are also a veritable means of hard kill avoidance, thereby minimizing collateral damage. As Corbett prescribed methods of "sea denial" in pursuit of maritime supremacy, U.S. forces should focus on "information  denial" as a means of both protecting their own information  networks and preventing an adversary from being able to deliver ordnance to target.</p>
<p>While simply disrupting information flow (via jamming or other soft kill means) alerts an adversary to the presence of a threat, the surreptitious alteration of the very information he perceives can cause him to make incorrect decisions.  Such an accomplishment -- achieving victory without bloodshed -- is what the ancient Chinese warrior-philosopher Sun Tzu called "the acme of skill."[6]</p>

<h4>Quo Vadis?</h4>

<p>The stunning technological breakthroughs of the information age are revolutionizing the means and methods of warfighting.  Gone are the days of massive armies engaged in a perpetual "tug-of-war" across trench lines.  Warfighting in the 21st century will be won not by he who can deliver the highest tonnage of ordnance, but by he who wins the information war. To be prepared for this new dimension of warfare, the U.S. needs to reexamine its force structure at all levels to ensure that every sailor, soldier, airman and Marine is proficient with information technologies.  At the policymaking level, a doctrine for information warfare must be developed jointly by all services. </p>
<p>Given the recent reorganization of Department of Defense information agencies under the single umbrella of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), logic dictates that any DoD information warfare doctrine originate from there. By elevating the position of Director, DISA to a four-star billet with a seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in addition to establishing a civilian counterpart to interface with the service Secretaries, the U.S. will take a proactive approach towards influencing the principle means of warfighting in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The United States has the most capable, best trained fighting force in history.  For that legacy to continue, the U.S. must awaken from the dogmatic slumbers of hard kill overdependence and embrace a new era of warfighting.</p>

 One of the most curious characteristics of the United States
military establishment since World War II has been its tendency
to become slavishly addicted to fads. In the immediate aftermath
of World War II, fascination with nuclear weapons to the exclusion
of almost everything else led the Army to such unhappy experiments
as the &quot;pentomic division&quot; and the &quot;Davy Crockett.&quot;
1 The Air Force, not to be outdone, put nuclear weapons on fighters.
 All of this had the result of leaving the services poorly prepared
to fight a limited conventional war in Korea and a limited unconventional
war in Vietnam.2  Then during the late 1970s and the heyday of
the military reform movement, maneuver warfare and mission-oriented
tactics became the buzz words. The new enthusiasts held up  the
German army of World War II as a military paradigm, its capabilities
misunderstood by many people who had little or no knowledge of
the primary German sources.3
<P>
 Now, in the aftermath of the Gulf War, the United States military
is once again awash in such catch phrases. Perhaps the first to
weigh in was  John Warden III, a USAF colonel who even before
the war had posited the idea that air forces could essentially
win wars  alone by conducting &quot;parallel war.&quot; This notion,
combined with the apparent success of the air campaign in the
Gulf and some very dubious historical interpretation, has given
lots of ammunition to those who would accuse air forces of engaging
in muddled thinking.4  Another even more amorphous term is information
war. Although it has been defined in several different ways, the
term has appeared increasingly in books, articles in professional
military journals, and official publications.5
<P>
  This article proposes to investigate this notion and its validity,
at least as  manifested in the open literature. We are well aware
that there is much additional material, including the very definition
of information warfare, lurking beneath the shroud of official
secrecy. This article, therefore, will deal with basic concepts
and assumptions instead of specific capabilities and vulnerabilities
that remain classified.
<P>
 For many true believers, the foundations of information war can
be found in a book by Alvin and Heidi Toffler's War and Anti-War:
Survival at the Dawn of the Twenty-first Century. 6   The Tofflers
describe human history as going through a series of waves.  Each
wave and its wars are based on the means by which wealth is created.
Thus, the first wave, starting at the beginning of civilization
and lasting to some time in the nineteeenth  century, was based
on agriculture.  The second wave, beginning as early as the Rennaissance
and lasting through today, was based on manufacturing.  Finally,
the third wave, which we are now entering, is based on information.
The Tofflers' book, although not  widely reviewed in the scholarly
literature, has received tremendous attention and acclaim within
the government, gaining the approbation of people as influential
as the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Tofflers have
been most successful in getting the military, especially the Army
and the Air Force, to accept the basic premises of their &quot;wave&quot;
theory.7  Alvin Toffler has been a guest lecturer at Army War
College and at the Air War College for two years running. Students
at both institutions, as well as the Naval War College,  read
War and Anti-War as part of the curriculum. At the Air Force Academy,
an elective course is offered on information war, with a set of
readings including large sections of War and Anti-War, as well
as some other readings discussed in this article.  Although the
Army is somewhat more sceptical of the Tofflers' notions, the
&quot;wave&quot; theory  was essentially adopted officially in
Army Focus 94: Force XXI.8
<P>
 The rise of this book to prominence within the country's military
hierarchies at the same time that the academic world gives it
little notice is a strange phenomenon.  The very simplicity of
the Tofflers' theory makes the book highly attractive.  However,
War and Anti-War is a book full of mistakes.  Any historian seeking
to bring out these errors would find War and Anti-War, to use
an Air Force term, a target-rich environment.   The Tofflers'
theory, a neo-Marxist concept combining economic determinism with
an overarching chronological framework, is reminiscent of elements
of The Communist Manifesto.9  In order to make history fit into
their theory, the Tofflers are willing to reduce all societies
(not to mention all wars between societies) to one of their simplistic
broad characterizations and to rearrange certain chronologies
so that events develop in the proper sequence.   Unfortunately
for those seeking comfort in the uncertainties of the ages, any
system that seeks to grossly simplify something as complex and
 nuanced as the entirety of human history is bound to founder
on those immovable obstacles, the facts. 
<P>
 This leads them into some erroneous notions.  Here are a few
examples. The depiction of the second-wave, industrial North overruning
the first-wave, agrarian South  is an idea that serious scholars
of the Civil War have long abandoned. No Confederate army  was
ever compelled to surrender because it lacked the means to fight.
Even at Appomattox, the Army of Northern Virginia had plenty of
small-arms ammunition for the infantry, plus an ample supply of
artillery ammunition.10 Likewise, to imply, as the book does,
that Napol&eacute;on's armies were a product of second-wave mass
production is simply contrary to every established fact about
the period. The book's account of the origins of AirLand Battle
is largely incorrect, neglecting the most important elements of
the new doctrine, ignoring the purpose of change, and attributing
the substance of change to the wrong people.11
<P>
 Equally flawed is the notion advanced by the Tofflers that &quot;nationalism
is the ideology of the nation-state, which is a product of the
industrial revolution.&quot; 12 Nationalism is hardly an ideology,
although it can be an important component of one.  Here too their
facts and chronology are wrong.   Nation-states became clearly
 recognizable entities during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
well before the industrial revolution took hold across Europe
or the world; and to attribute something as complex as nationalism
to a single factor distorts the past. The Tofflers are no more
successful when they venture into the realm of intellectual history.
 Two of the most consequential ideologies to emerge from the nineteenth
century were Marxism and Nazism.  Marxism was avowedly antinationalist;
and the  intellectual progenitor of Nazism, German v&ouml;lkish
ideology,  was based on the notion of the agriculturally based,
racially pure community rather than a nation-state governed by
a liberal constitution.
<P>
 Two streams of thought have emerged on the nature and uses of
information war.  The most common, tied directly to recent technological
innovations and the experiences of the Gulf war, stresses digitization
of the battlefield and incremental improvements to smart weapons,
improved intelligence devices, deeper and even more precise strikes,
and so forth. This view is particularly dominant in the Army's
literature, though it finds its advocates in the Air Force as
well.13
<P>
 The more radical and speculative view is that information warfare
is becoming an alternative to more traditional forms of war, a
theory that would therefore discard much of the information-based
weaponry of the first interpretation.14   This notion, based on
the Toffleresque idea of the third-wave, information-based society,
holds that information can be used as a weapon. By wielding information
as a weapon through the use of computers, the Internet,  satellite
communications, and so on, one could influence the decisions of
an enemy.15  Some writers have suggested using subtly altered
images  broadcast over TV as a means of undermining a nation's
will or the perceptions of its leaders, a process described rather
opaquely as &quot;neocortical warfare.&quot;16
<P>
 This approach to information war has several problems. Although
imaginative, most of the suggestions on potential measures, enemy
reactions, and ultimate consequences are speculative beyond plausibility.
 The accompanying conclusions, sometimes given only by implication,
are generally favorable to the author's thesis.  In many cases,
these articles suggest that electronic measures taken against
certain military or civilian targets would result in catastrophic
and irreparable damage to key &quot;information systems.&quot;
 These suggestions  almost invariably lack any technical foundations
and fail to consider countermeasures while assuming total system
vulnerability.  The various articles frequently advocate actions
that allegedly might paralyze or confuse an adversary, but they
fail to consider that the same measures  might  just as easily
lead to entirely unanticipated results or even to consequences
that would be inconsistent with or counterproductive to the original
intent.
<P>
 This is especially important when one considers that if these
types of measures are to be undertaken to influence the thinking
and behavior of foreign leaders, it would require a level of understanding
of a country's history, culture, politics, and mind-set at the
very least, which seldom exists in government, and even in academe.
Consider, for example, if we had decided to undertake these kinds
of measures against the Soviet Union during the cold war. Whose
advice should we have taken on how to implement these measures
and what the anticipated reaction of the Soviet leadership might
be?  Many &quot;experts&quot; on the Soviet Union, including Strobe
Talbot, who currently is in charge of administration policy on
Russia, made a great many pronouncements about the reaction of
the Soviet leadership to Reagan administration policy in regards
to the Soviet Union.  The course of the 1980s and the collapse
of the Soviet Union proved many of these prognosticators were
wrong.   We should also remember that the Soviet leadership was
comparatively stable. How can one predict the behavior of such
unstable characters as Muammar Qadhafi,  Kim Jong Il, or Saddam
Hussein?  If academe cannot provide the kind of expertise needed
to wage this kind of &quot;information war,&quot; what can we
expect from the government?
<P>
 Accompanying this speculation is the search for supporting statements
from distinguished military writers. In that group,  Sun Tzu has
suddenly become more quotable for those seeking ways to avoid
traditional warfare rather
<P>
than ways to conduct it more effectively.   Sun Tzu's argument
that &quot;to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of
skill&quot; by attacking his strategy is perhaps the favorite
aphorism.17  Of course, this assumes that your enemy is willing
to allow himself to be subdued without fighting. History tells
us that governments are seldom so cooperative. Sun Tzu aficionados
also seem unconcerned that he  wrote these words in the context
of ancient Chinese society, something of  which we have only a
limited knowledge and which may have no relation to us.18
<P>
 Further difficulties appear when we take a more extended look
at Sun Tzu.  As a perceptive critic noted in a review of a book
on Sun Tzu,  Carl von Clausewitz,  and Antoine Henri Jomini, 
 all of Sun Tzu that comes down to us amounts to about 100 pages,
as opposed to 600 pages of Clausewitz' s writing and some 20 separate
volumes published by Jomini.19 In addition, if one reads Sun Tzu
with care, it reads more like a series of aphorisms, some of which
are relevant, many of which are not, as opposed to the more systematic
treatment of war in all its facets afforded by Clausewitz.  One
could perhaps speculate that it is the aphoristic style of Sun
Tzu that makes him more attractive to readers who lack the patience
to deal with the more sophisticated Clausewitz.  Someone has suggested
that Sun Tzu should be studied instead of Clausewitz because,
among other things, Sun Tzu is shorter.20
<P>
 A more serious problem in the ideas of those who would substitute
information war for traditional conflict concerns the issue of
what constitutes war and what this implies for politico-military
relations.   In an article in a recent Airpower Journal, Col Richard
Szafranski defines warfare as &quot;the set of all lethal and
nonlethal activities undertaken to subdue the hostile will of
an adversary or enemy.&quot;21  Although Szafranski is thoughtful
enough to attempt to differentiate between warfare and war, his
definition still causes problems. If warfare includes all nonlethal
activities, does this include means such as diplomacy and policy?
Perhaps policy would become the continuation of war by other means.
The idea that war is the normal state of affairs and that all
actions of state and society must serve that master is a discredited
notion.22 
<P>
 Equally unsettling is the internal aspect of this redefining
of the relationship between politics and war. The danger of reversing
Clausewitz's ideas on civil-military relationships clearly emerges
in the writing of another &quot;information war&quot; advocate,
who argues that one of the promises of information war is that
&quot;at last, our military planners can be freed of political
constraints.&quot;23
<P>
 This concept of information warfare is  very dangerous from a
civil liberties point of view.  In an article in a recent issue
of Airpower Journal, Col Owen E. Jensen wrote that in order to
ensure our survivability in an information war, the military should
make use of all &quot;national assets and use all sectors of society.&quot;
This would include, he said, all privately owned computers, fax
machines, computer bulletin boards and so on, including even the
assets of international corporations. In fighting lowintensity
conflicts against second-wave or first-wave opponents, Jensen
advocates the use of bugging and various means of electronic surveillance.24
<P>
 This notion is both impractical and dangerous. It is impractical
because the vast differences in privately owned computer equipment
and software make interoperability highly unlikely. In addition,
the inclusion of so many computers would make the insertion of
viruses a virtual certainty, since not everyone is as meticulous
about the condition of his software as he should be. By contrast,
a military system, unable to interface with any other computer
system and to which only limited access is allowed, would be virtually
impervious to the kinds of attacks envisioned by the proponents
of information war. Even if the government mobilized all these
computers, who would operate them?  To press their owners into
service would be ridiculous, as they have neither the training
nor experience to allow them to operate in a military environment.
 You cannot take the designers of the latest computer version
of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; and set them to work on creating
a new battlefield simulation.
<P>
 Given the impracticality of this from a military point of view,
about the only thing that would come of it would be a massive
intrusion on the part of the federal government into people's
privacy.  Any attempt  by the government to mobilize the nation's
privately owned computer assets, as Jensen advocates, carries
with it a whole range of civil liberties questions that must be
addressed.  We should think very seriously about the possibility
of surrendering some of our precious freedoms for a set of theories
based on a concept of history unsupported by facts.
<P>
 Unfortunately, information war has become so expansive a term
that it now threatens to become a tautology by encompassing nearly
everything beyond the most primitive forms of combat. Some include
traditional intelligence as information warfare, while others
include the capabilities inherent in certain weapons systems.
 Others see the decision to interfere in Somalia as an example
of successful information war, presumably by the administration's
internal foes who preferred that we intervene there rather than
in Sudan, the site of much worse disasters.25  This logic could
be extended to acts of politics, advances in weaponry, and uses
of propaganda.  Indeed, the use of high-tech propaganda, some
quite fanciful,  is a major theme of some information war advocates.
<P>
 This reliance upon new and old forms of propaganda, while attractive
for those who wish to substitute a new form of mind control for
violence,  is yet another weakness of information war.  Propaganda,
unfortunately,  has frequently been of only limited utility. 
It  has been used since the dawn of organized warfare in both
a positive and negative sense. It has always been designed to
either inspire confidence in one's own people and leaders  and
to alternatively ridicule, frighten, or demonize one's enemy.
As such,  it has always occupied a supplemental  place in war,
but that is all.  The US decision to enter World War I, for example,
was not influenced by British-inspired stories about Germans bayoneting
Belgian babies as much as it was by the simple fact that the United
States could not tolerate German domination of Europe. For all
of Stalin's hypocritical appeals to Russian patriotism, a much
greater compelling factor for Russians to fight against the Germans
was the brutal behavior of the German occupation authorities.
The ultimate problem with even the slickest propaganda is that
it does not always work, and even when it does, its effectiveness
is limited.
<P>
 The second approach to information warfare is often dismissed
by some proponents as merely &quot;digitizing the battlefield.&quot;26
 This concept of information war concerns the importance of information
in conventional  war.  In this regard, perhaps the most significant
statement comes from Alan D. Campen, in the preface to the book
he edited, The First Information War: &quot;The outcome [of the
Gulf War] turned as much on superior management of knowledge as
it did upon performance of people or weapons.&quot;27  A number
of articles have also emphasized this. The coalition forces, aided
by superb communication networks, data links, satellite intelligence,
and so on, were able to defeat the Iraqi forces, which had been
rendered informationless by high-tech allied weaponry aimed at
taking out Saddam Hussein's communications and early- warning
systems.  This view, too, conceals more than it reveals. The expanding
and improving scholarship on the Gulf War is rapidly undercutting
the simplistic, optimistic views that were prevalent immediately
after the war.28
<P>
 The raising of information to the place of highest performance
in war has dominated military thinking in recent years.  Some
advocates of the new theory have sought historical examples to
justify their position and have proved quite able to oversimplify
or play loose with the facts.   Consider, for example, the following
passage from Army Focus 94: FORCE XXI explaining how Robert E.
Lee was able to defeat Joseph Hooker's Army of the Potomac at
Chancellorsville:
<P>
Subsequently, Lee's cavalry brought him the information that Hooker's
right flank was three miles east of Chancellorsville.  Lee acted
on this information and inflicted a resounding defeat. Lee won
his information war, and it led to victory on the battlefield.29
<P>
 It would be an understatement to say that this kind of oversimplification
is intellectually dangerous. It overlooks the many factors that
determined why Lee won and Hooker lost. Hooker, for example, was
as well-informed of Lee's movements as Lee was of Hooker's. The
Union commander simply misinterpreted the Confederate movements
as a retreat. He did, however, alert Maj Gen Oliver O. Howard,
commander of the XI Corps and defender of Hooker's right flank,
and ordered Howard to be prepared for a Confederate move against
him, an order which Howard ignored.30  The Confederate reconnaissance
party looking for the end of Hooker's flank included both Stonewall
Jackson and J. E. B. Stuart, the two senior Confederate leaders
charged with delivering the attack. While reconnoitering, the
group came under artillery fire from a masked Union battery. Although
the reconnaissance party took some significant casualties, both
Jackson and Stuart remained unscathed.31  How would the course
of the battle have been different if some lucky shells had disabled
both Jackson and Stuart?  If any of these factors had gone in
Hooker's favor, what good would Lee's &quot;information advantage&quot;
have been to him?  The reduction of an event as complex and uncertain
as Chancellorsville to &quot;information warfare&quot; should
stand as an example of one-sided thinking.  The ForceXXI document,
 in which the Army formally adopts the Toffler &quot;wave&quot;
theories of history, is equally off base when it implies that
the United States and its Allies won World War II because of the
intelligence advantages stemming from Ultra.32
<P>
 The dangers of embracing this technical version of information
war are fairly obvious to anyone with an appreciation of history.
One of the developments hailed by some adherents of information
war concerns the improvements in communications and the advantages
they confer.33  Yet every improvement in communications has always
carried with it the dangers of micromanagement, a peril that generally
gets only lip service from information war advocates.34  The recent
literature on information warfare offers a particularly instructive
example of distorting the historical record in the search for
examples to support the new ideas.   In a recent article, George
Stein, using a lengthy paraphrase and quotation from a speech
by Speaker of the House  Newt Gingrich , cites Prussian general
Helmuth von Moltke as someone who was able to harness the emerging
technologies of railroads and telegraphs in the nineteenth century
and create a new General Staff system accordingly.35 Along the
way, Moltke conveniently uses words that any information warrior
would be proud to utter.   It is highly doubtful that Moltke ever
actually spoke the words attributed to him in this case. This
question aside,  these &quot;statements&quot;  represent a very
one-sided view of Moltke's opinions.36   
<P>
 Moltke designed his system of giving orders not because information
was readily dispatched over the new telegraph lines, but because
it was not.  Thus, he stressed subordinate initiative rather than
the transfer of information.  Moltke was in fact very suspicious
of excessive reliance upon communications and fully understood
the dangers posed by a capable telegraph system.  He warned that
the &quot;most unfortunate commander of all&quot;  was the one
with  &quot;a telegraph wire attached to his back.&quot;37  Stein
has misquoted Gingrich, who paraphrased Moltke's talks with himself.
 Evidently,  neither Gingrich nor Stein   checked the possible
sources or placed Moltke's alleged statements in their historical
context.  Meanwhile, the readers of the professional literature
have two new sets of erroneous &quot;facts&quot; ready to be mobilized
in the war for information warfare.
<P>
 The improvement of communications at the disposal of political
leaders and military commanders has always carried the danger
of disrupting the chain of command.  Hitler, Stalin, and most
recently Saddam Hussein have been held up as models of this. 
Lest one think that this applies only to dictators, the facts
show that it goes for democracies as well.  In the Civil War,
both Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln interfered with the conduct
of military operations. So did Secretary of War Edwin Stanton
and Ulysses S. Grant as commander in chief of the army, often
driving commanders in the field such as William S. Rosecrans and
George Thomas almost to distraction.38  During World War II, the
combination of wireless radio, a fertile imagination, and a stubborn
personality made Winston Churchill almost as dangerous at times
to the Allies as he was to the Axis powers.39  Who can forget
the image of Lyndon Johnson essentially conducting the defense
of Khe Sanh from a sand table in the White House basement?  Thus,
every improvement in communications always carries this danger,
which can be averted only if the higher commanders show the discipline
required to avoid micromanagement.
<P>
 Another danger posed by this emerging version of information
war is data overload. Again something that has only been given
lip service, the danger now is that commanders will be so bombarded
by a blizzard of largely extraneous or even unessential data that
it will obscure the real issues that have to be dealt with.  One
of the important distinctions that some information war advocates
fail to make here is that between data and information. In order
to be information, to have content, data must be interpreted and
thus is subject to the imperfections of human beings.  For example,
the matter of the accuracy of bomb damage assessment is  one of
the hottest arguments still raging concerning the Gulf War.  
In addition, all the intelligence data collection in the world
could not solve some problems. For all the technological wizardry
and intelligence at our disposal, the coalition forces probably
failed to find and kill a single mobile Scud missile launcher.40
 For all of the data collection undertaken by the Stasi, the East
German authorities never had the slightest clue that their whole
system would come crashing down so quickly.
<P>
 The reverse of data overload is also a problem. What should 
commanders do if they do not have all the data or information
they want or think they need or have learned to depend on in peacetime
training?  If information is the most important thing in modern
warfare, does its absence give an irresolute commander the excuse
to do nothing? History tells us that the great captains have always
sought information concerning their opponents.  Ultimately, however,
they had to make decisions in the &quot;fog of uncertainty,&quot;
to use Clausewitz's phrase.41  The real factor of importance here
is that all commanders must share a characteristic, moral courage,
something that all the information in the world cannot replace.
What would all our technology have meant to us in the Gulf if
George Bush had taken the counsel of his fears even before humanitarian
concerns halted the allied offensive?
<P>
 There are several other things that information cannot replace.
In this regard, Campen's claim that the Gulf War victory was as
much the result of the management of information as the performance
of people and weapons grossly overstates the importance of information.
The allied victory was due to the superior training, planning,
and execution of all the components involved in  Operation Desert
Storm. All the information in the world will not help poorly motivated,
badly trained, and undisciplined soldiers led by indecisive leaders
fighting without a sound doctrine, particularly under the unique
circumstances of the Gulf War.  The Tofflers, for example, extol
the Russian Nomad satellite surveillance system's capability of
imagery resolution down to about five meters.42  How much good
did it do the poorly motivated conscripts fighting in Chechnya?
<P>
When asked why the Confederates lost the battle of Gettysburg,
George Pickett is said to have answered, &quot;I think the Union
Army had something to do with it.&quot;43  In looking at the Gulf
War, Pickett's alleged comment is worth remembering.  It should
be borne in mind that for the coalition forces, largely based
on those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) , Iraq
was the perfect enemy in the perfect environment.  What essentially
happened was the military equivalent of &quot;wish chess&quot;
against an opponent accurately described by a perceptive critic
as a &quot;third-class Soviet clone.&quot;44 More formidable,
better-trained armies have often been able to fight on when their
communications were inoperative. During the Normandy campaign
in 1944, for example, the Germans often had to fight under conditions
of radio silence.45 Yet sound tactical doctrine, good leadership
at the lower levels, and sheer rock-ribbed toughness allowed them
to fight the numerically vastly superior Allies to a stalemate
for almost two months before attrition finally ground the German
forces down.  In the Pacific, the Japanese  were able to refine
their tactics late in the war to a point where they were able
to inflict serious losses on American forces at Peleliu, Iwo Jima,
and Okinawa.46
<P>
 Information war has been subsumed into a somewhat broader notion,
the revolution in military affairs (RMA). Briefly put, this concept
holds that advances in technology, especially information technology,
have rendered existing methods of warfare as obsolete.47  Although
the term was introduced before the publication of War and Anti-War,
some believers in the RMA have completely adopted the Tofflers'
framework.  Now many articles on this subject are loaded with
references to &quot;second- wave&quot; and &quot;third-wave&quot;
warfare.48 Proponents of the RMA such as Andy Marshall, head of
the Office of Net Assessment, argue that the period we are now
in is similar to that between the world wars, when developments
in aviation, internal combustion engines, radar, and radio led
to the creation of strategic bombing in the United States and
so-called &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; in Germany.49 Some authors, reading
the current theory backward  into history, now see military revolutions
everywhere.  This has led to some rather odd linguistic formulations
such as &quot;Napol&eacute;on took full advantage of the evolving
revolution in military affairs.&quot;50
<P>
 History, however, again exposes the  weaknesses in this kind
of simplistic thinking.  Before strategic bombing could be executed
in World War II, its theoretical foundation had been laid prior
to the advent of the required technology. Likewise, the tactical
concepts the German army used in World War II had really been
developed in the later stages of World War I. These concepts were
then wedded to the strategic theories and related ideas of Clausewitz,
 Helmuth von Moltke, Alfred von Schlieffen, and Schlichting. In
no way did Hitler impose any ideas on the German army in the interwar
period, as some have alleged.51  In fact,   taking the long view
that history provides, we can see that the nature of war is far
more evolutionary than revolutionary. 
<P>
 All of this is not to say that we are mindlessly against technology.52
 If emerging technology can be harnessed to enhance our ability
to defend the nation, it should be.  History has shown repeatedly,
however, that technology is best incorporated in the context of
enhancing such methods that have already proven successful.  This
can only be accomplished through a rigorous and integrated study
of military affairs. In their excellent book on military disaster,
Eliot Cohen and John Gooch write that military organizations should
inculcate in their members a      relentless empiricism, a disdain
for a priori theorizing if they are to succeed. The `learners'
in military organizations must  cultivate the temperament of the
historian, the detective, or the journalist, rather than the theoretical
bent of the social    scientist or philosopher.53
<P>
 What is so disturbing about information warfare and the RMA is
that some of its adherents have done precisely what Cohen and
Gooch properly warn against. If the facts get in the way of a
theory, then the theory should be discarded, not the facts of
history.  Some have privately expressed to the authors their defense
of the inaccuracies of the works cited here with the argument
that the facts are unimportant. This is, of course, nonsense.
 One does not base grand theories on false facts; nor does one
prepare for the future by distorting the past.

were influenced by their earlier book, The Third Wave (New York:

<P>
In a speech to National Defense University on 3 May 1994, Rep
Gingrich argued that Clausewitz is outdated because he is tied
to the concepts of Napoleonic warfare, while omitting the fact
that Sun Tzu came from a society that has no relation to us in
any way, shape, or form.  Rep. Newt Gingrich, &quot;Information

 Briefly stated, Trotsky held that in order for Russia to go forward,
it had to be part of world revolution. In addition, if a country
were to avoid the dangers of &quot;bureaucratization,&quot; it
had to remain in a permanent state of revolution. Leon Trotsky,
Permanent Revolution (Calcutta, 1947).  Ludendorff's ideas of
&quot;total war&quot; fall into the same category. Erich Ludendorff,
Der totale Krieg (Munich: Ludendorffs verlag, 1935). The English
version, The Nation at War, translated by A. S. Rappoport (London:
Hutchinson, n.d.)  clearly presents Ludendorff's views that everything
must be subservient to war. Hitler's thinking on this subject
can be found in his sequel to Mein Kampf, published in the United
States as Hitler's Secret Book, (S. Attanasio translator), (New
York, 1961), pp. 5-7.

 Colonel Owen E. Jensen, &quot;Information Warfare: Principles
of Third-Wave War,&quot; Airpower Journal, Vol. VIII, No. 4, (Winter
1994): p. 42.  Jensen's article, packed with historical inaccuracies,
is a classic case of the dangers of applying the Tofflers' neo-Marxist
framework to real problems. The phrase &quot;industrial-age Napoleonic
France&quot; should suffice as an example.

A good study on the use and limitations of Ultra in World War
II is Ralph Bennett, ULTRA in the West, (New York, 1979). The
ghastly losses suffered by the German Army and Air Force on the
Russian Front may also have had something to do with Germany's
defeat in World War II.
<P>
Most of the artricles in the Campen book deal with this issue.
In fact, an uncharitable reader might be inclined to dismiss The
First Information War as nothing more than an encomium designed
to serve the agenda of the Army Signal Corps.

Stein's quotation relies on the speech by  Gingrich given at National
Defense University on 3 May 1994, for which no transcript was
available at the time. Through the assistance of Professor Daniel
T. Kuehl at National Defense University, we were able to obtain
a transcript. A study of the transcript leads these authors to
two conclusions. First, it is quite clear that Stein, in attempting
to quote from memory, accidentally misquoted Gingrich. Compare
Stein, &quot;Information Warfare,&quot; p. 36 with Gingrich speech,
p. 3. The second conclusion is that Gingrich distorted the historical
record on Moltke. Although Moltke was a prescient individual,
he did not possess the Nostradamus-like vision Gingrich attributes
to him. Also although Moltke did make some money by investing
in railroads, he certainly did not become wealthy by it. He gained
much more wealth through the donatives he received from the government
after the FrancoPrussian War.

 <P>MOSCOW, July 25 (Itar-Tass) -- The Federation Council upper house of 
parliament today held hearings about new threats to Russia's security in
the time of instability and uncertainty at home and the transition to a 
multi-polar world in the international arena. </P>
  <P> As concerns external threats, first deputy general-director of the
Federal Government Communications and Information Agency (FAPSI) Vladimir
Markonenko pointed out that the U.S. intelligence services are working on
methods of penetrating the computer networks of potential enemies and
implanting viruses and "logical bombs" for future activation in the event
of a crisis. </P>
  <P> Such time bombs can disorganise defences and the state government
system,  as well as transport and energy infrastructure, Markonenko said. </P>
   <P>He noted that "the danger of an information war breaking out is coming
to the fore, and information warfare will soon rank second only to
thermo-nuclear war by its consequences." </P>
  <P> Markonenko said, "the danger of unsanctioned intervention in the
operations of information systems has increased abruptly." </P>
<P>   An analysis of the state of information security in Russia has revealed
that "the threats to the country's closed telecommunications systems are
real and it is necessary to take adequate measures without delay." </P>
  <P> According to Markonenko, "the foreign special services focus first of
all on ways of gathering information about the activity of the supreme
bodies of state authority of Russia, as well as on ways of influencing the
country's financial, economic, and banking systems." </P>
  <P> Markonenko noted that the protection of confidential national
information has become one of priorities in the state policy of many
developed countries. He recalled that six federal laws on combatting crime
in this sphere were already effective in the United States and four - in
Germany. </P>

<P>GLOBAL BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE '96</P>

A One Day Affiliated Conference at OSS '96<BR>
September 18, Wednesday  9:00 AM to 5:00 PM<BR>
Registration from 8:00 AM<BR>
Sheraton Premiere Hotel, Tysons Corner, Virginia<BR>

<P>Morning Workshop: The Threat Posed to Company's Intellectual Property by the
Operations of Business Intelligence Departments .....and, What You Can Do
About It!</P>

<P>Competitive intelligence is the fastest growing profession in the business
world today.  The Society of competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP)
boasts some 4,000 members worldwide in over 35 countries.  Ninety percent
(90%) of the Fortune 500 are represented and international chapters are
located in Mexico, Japan, Australia, China, and most European countries.
SCIP members pride themselves in conducting their operations legally and

<P>Paper presented in the Panel entitled, Interdisciplinary Perspective on 
INFOSEC

<P>17th National Computer Security Conference, 11-14 October, Baltimore 
Convention Center, Baltimore, MD

<P>Copyright 1994 M. E. Kabay. All rights reserved.

<P>Permission is granted to post this article intact as long as the 
copyright statement is included.

<HR>

<P>Cyberspace, the realm of computer networks, voice mail and long-distance 
telephone calls, is increasingly important in our lives. Unfortunately, 
morally immature phreaks, cyberpunks and criminal hackers are spoiling 
it for everyone. Security professionals must speak out in the wider 
community and change the moral universe to include cyberspace.

<P>We are seeing today a period of exploration and development in a new 
realm reminiscent of the colonization of North America by Europeans. As 
in the American exerience of the frontier, there are colonists and 
Amerinds, soldiers and outlaws, priests and thieves. The frontier is 
cyberspace: that immaterial world where we have phone conversations; 
where credit card information travels while we wait for approval of a 
purchase; where our medical records and sometimes our credit records 
paint a picture of our pains.

<P>For an increasing number of us, cyberspace is also the place we meet new 
friends and keep in touch with old ones, learn more about our hobbies 
and out professions, and work for social and environmental change. 
Electronic bulliten board systems have mushroomed throughout the world, 
ranging from country-clubs like CompuServe and Prodigy through the 
grungy cafes of the hacker underground and on into the pullulating 
bazaar of the great Internet, where philosophers rub shoulders with 
dropouts and where age, gender and race are only as visible as you want 
them to be.

<P>Unfortunately, the spectacular growth of cyberspace has not been 
accompanied by rules for civilized behavior. Cyberspace at the end of 
the twentieth century resembles the frontier at the beginning of the 
eighteenth: bullies and criminals swagger electronically through the 
commons, stealing what they want, breaking what they don't, and 
interfering with decent people's activities. Far from helping to set 
standards of mutual respect, some government agencies have been acting 
like totalitarians rather than democrats. For all these reasons, we 
citizens of cyberspace must evolve guidelines for civilizing our new 
frontier.

<P><B>THE GRANDDADDY OF ALL NETWORKS</B>
<P>The Internet is possibly the most complex and rapidly-growing construct  
humanity has ever created. The cathedrals of medieval Europe pale in 
comparison with the electronic edifice that is the Internet. The 
Internet grew out of ARPANET, funded in the late 1960s by the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This experimental network 
linked a few universities and research laoratories electronically. 
ARPANET begat the Internet when the National Science foundation (NSF) 
decided to make internetworking possible for many more universities than 
the first-tier institutions that had been in from the beginning. ARPANET 
itself disappeared as a formal entity in 1990.

<P>From the very beginning, the group inventing ARPANET had a refreshingly 
non-bureaucratic attitude towards their work. For example, meetings of 
the network coordinators at Bolt Beranek and Newman in 1968 had two 
ground rules: Anyone could say anything; and nothing was official. The 
current management style of the Internet reflects the belief in 
unhindered engineering excellence as the best way to find solutions for 
technical problems. This tradition of frank criticism and unfettered 
creativity has been misinterpreted by some newcomers to the Internet as 
an excuse for frank rudeness and unfettered criminality.

<P>The internet todya functions like a combined mail route, supermarket 
bulliten board, and library. Electronic mail (e-mail) is much faster 
than paper mail ('snail mail' as it's derisively termed on the Net). 
Electronic Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs), Special Interest Groups (SIGs) 
or Forums allow us to post electronic notes asking for advice, help, 
friendship, and all the other dimensions of social interactions. There 
are electronic equivalents of newspapers ('newsgroups') and magazines 
('moderated newsgroup digests') dealing with interests from the sublime 
to the prurient. Scientists from distant institutions collaborate 
fruitfully on research without concern for geographical barriers. 
Textbooks and novels are posted on 'the Net' (the affectionate term for
the entire Internet and all the networks connected to it in anyway) for 
enjoyment and comment, sometimes coming out better for the free flow of 
criticism and advice. So many repositories of information are on the Net 
that doing research without using its resources is unthinkable for a 
growing number of enthusiats.

<P>Because the Net has grown by cooperation and consensus rather than 
legislation and government regulation, there is no way to know exactly 
how many people use how many computers on this fishnet of the mind. 
Generally-accepted estimates are that there are about 13 million regular 
users linked via roughly 1.3 million computers ('hosts'). Registration 
of hosts has exploded since the Internet community agreed to allow 
commercial firms to join.

<P>According to the document, (named, in typical style, 
'/infosource/internet_info_for_everybody / 
how_big_is_the_internet/domain-survey-jan93') from the Network 
Information Systems Center at SRI International in Palo Alto, 
California, there was an 80.6% increase in the number of hosts in 1992. 
Of the 1,313,000 hosts, 410,940, or about a third, were in the 
educational ('.edu') domain. Some 347,486, or about a quarter, were in 
the commercial ('.com') domain. The annual growth rate in 1992 for .edu 
was 69%, but the growth in .com was 92%. The advent of users from .com 
has elicited howls of protest from some quarters on the Internet; 
however, commercial users may bring new standards of behavior to the Net.

<P>The total rate of information transfer in the Internet is unknown; 
however, it appears to be Terabytes (Tb) per day. This number, 
1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes, cannot reasonably be apprehended. A byte 
corresponds approximately to a character of text. This article has about 
50 thousand bytes. A 1,000 page textbook might have a few million bytes 
(Mb) of text; that there are a million Mb in a Tb. Even more astounding, 
the total traffic is growing by about 25% every month, a 14-fold 
increase in a year.

<P><B>A MORAL VACUUM</B>
<P>Cyberspace is growing fast, and the values which inform our lives in
hysical communities have not yet found their way into cyberspace. Just as
n the physical world, unethical, immoral, and illegal behavior threaens the
greements that allow people to li
ve and work together in peace.

<P>Many users of cyberspace are well-behaved. They are sensitive to nuance, 
capable of expressive and articulate prose, careful not to hurt 
feelings, and responsible in spreading verified information and not rumor.

<P>However, we also find the cyberspace equivalents of slum lords, drug 
pushers, boors and bully-boys. There are people running private BBSs 
that cater to thieves, drug users, Nazis, and paedophiles (sic). People 
who might never think of insulting a stranger to her face write nasty and 
juvenile notes.

<P>Diferent service providers adopt different stances about the content  of 
communications on their network. For example, the commercial value-added 
networks (VANs) Prodigy and CompuServew are among the most custodial in 
their attitude towards the message base. These sevices employ system 
operators (Sysops), volunteers who manage specific sections by 
monitoring traffic, responding to questions and cooling tempers. Some 
Sysops on commercial services and private BBSs explicitly censor 
unacceptable or irrelevant contributions, usually to howls of protest 
and hyperbolic invective from the censored authors. These howls are then 
themselves removed from view, prompting yet more appeals to First 
Amendment rights. As a Sysop myself, I have had to explian that the 
forum or SIG is not public and that the Sysop has a responsibility to 
maintain a professional tone and to prevent abuses such as posting text 
files or software without permission of the copyright holders. Some 
moderated newsgroups on the INternet also have strict enforcement. For 
example, the RISKS Forum Digest is tightly controlled by its moderator, 
who personally determines whether any given message reaches the members.

<P>At the other extreme, there are networks, Forums, SIGs and BBSs where 
anarchy reigns. Contributions are unfiltered, unfettered, frequently 
ungrammatical, and sometimes illegal. Some boards and groups pander to 
unusual sexual orientations, with hundreds of pornographic text and 
picture files available online. Others specialize in stolen or malicious 
software, and instructions on picking locks, stealing services and 
building bombs.

<P>Such rude, unethical, immoral and illegal behavior puts the entire Net 
at risk from self-apointed as well as legally-delegated guardians of 
public morality and corporate interests. I fear that politicians looking 
for an easy target may impose restrictions on the content of electronic 
ommunications. Legislative interference would likely include 
requirements for paperwork and would render the volunteer job of Sysop 
impossibly demanding. The ultra-religious forces of intolerance could 
also seize the opportunity to attack a new den on iniquity, whipping up 
their doctrinaire supporters to acts of harrassment, sabotage and even 
physical violence.

<P><B>CRIMES IN CYBERSPACE</B>
<P>What kinds of problems are there? The issues boil down to theft of services
and software, invasion of privacy, outright damage, and threat of terrorism.

<P>In a landmark study, John Haugh and his colleagues at Telecommunications 
Advisors Inc. of Seattle, WA, have recently built up a staggering 
picture of the extent of toll fraud (using someone else's telephone 
services illegally) and teleabuse (using one's employer's phone service 
wthout authorization). Haugh et al. consider that the total losses to 
the econmomy from toll fraud and abuse of corporate telephone systems 
are in the $2-8 billion range per year. Toll fraud rings using stolen 
telephone credit card numbers have been operating virtually unchecked in 
all major urban centres (sic). The cycle often begins with 'shoulder 
surfing,' in which someone watches as a victim punches their access 
codes into a public telephone in a public place. Organized gangs of 
youths have been caught in New York's Grand Central Station and La 
Guardia Airport. Within days, the credit card can be used for hundreds 
of long-distance phone calls generating thousands of dollars of expense 
for the victim. Although the phone companies generally do not insist on 
repayment, these calls do cost the US economy something: inter-carrier 
charges must be paid to the national telephone services of the countries 
of destination. Most of the stolen calls go to South American drug 
havens, certain Caribbean islands, and to the Indian subcontinent.

<P>Some criminals use control codes or special tone generators ('Blue 
Boxes' and others) to steal telephone services; others dial into 
corporate phone switches using public 800 numbers, then use outbound 
lines for long-distance calls. Some victims have had more than a quarter 
million dollars of calls placed in a single weekend. The invoices from 
the phone companies sometimes fill several crates with thousands of call 
details - all fraudulent. 

<P>Voice mail subversion is another tactic used by 'phone phreaks.' Voice 
mail systems allow callers to leave messages for specific employees. 
Unless supervisors pay close attention to usage statistics, a voice mail 
system can become host to dozens of unauthorized accounts for strangers, 
thus putting an unexpected load on phone lines and consuming storage 
space on the voice mail computers.

<P>By far the greatest problem caused by criminal hackers is the loss of 
confidence in your system integrity. Take for example a computer system 
used for production of mission-critical information. There can be no 
tolerance for error. Programs written for such a system are subjected to 
strict quality-assurance procedures; every program must pass extensive 
testing. When the operating system (the software that coordinates 
communication among programs and regulates access to different kinds of 
computer resources) has to be changed ('updated'), many system managers 
run acceptance tests over an entire weekend to ensure that there will be 
no glitches once production starts up again. It is considered normal to 
forbid programmers to modify production databases; and careful audit 
trails are usually kept to track exactly which specific user altered 
what specific records at any given time in the files.

<P>Discovering unauthorized use causes chaos in the production shop. A 
hospital pharmacy discovers the transposition of two digits in its 
pharmacy database, leading to potentially fatal errors in drug 
administration for patients. A faulty program in a telephone switching 
center disrupts phone service over an entire geographical region. Since 
there is no way of what intruders have done (criminal hackers do not 
leave neat system alteration notices), the only reasonable response to 
intrusion is to audit the entire production system. That means 
time-consuming, mind-numbing labor to run verification programs on all 
the data, careful comparison of every program with a good-known copy to 
see if it has been altered illegally, and hours of overtime for 
quality-assura nce and system management personnel.

<P>Credit records are relatively easy for criminal hackers to find, 
although it's much harder to modify them. Patient files are supposed to 
be pretected yet many hospitals have rudimentary safeguards that do not 
deter determined hackers. On another front, government employees have 
disclosed confidential information such as tax files and criminal 
records. In some cases the theft of data was for many (a few dollars for 
reports to unethical private investigators) and in others merely for fun 
(printing tax files for the rich and famous to impress one's friends). 
These are the electronic equivalent of breaking and entry in the 
physical world.

<P>Another area of concern is eavesdropping. Industrial espionage is 
growing as competition heats up, especially across international 
borders. In he US, Symantec and Borland have been at loggerheads over 
the alleged theft of confidential information by an executive who 
defected from one company to the other. In Europe, General Motors and 
Volkswagen have been denouncing each other over allegations of a similar 
theft by a high-placed official.

<P>The last decade has witnessed a troubling proliferation of malicious 
software such as viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, and logic bombs. A 
computer virus is a program which adds itself to executable code 
(programs and boot sectors on diskettes and disks). When the infected 
code is loaded into main memory (usually on a microcomputer such as an 
IBM-compatible PC or an Apple Macintosh), the virus can both reproduce 
by infecting other programs and also deliver its payload. Virus payloads 
range from the merely annoying (e.g., the STONED viruses usually put a 
plea for the legalization of marijuana on the screen) through the 
irritating (the Autumn viruses make the letters on one's screen drop to 
the bottom like so many leaves) to the destructive (viruses written by 
Bulgaria's Dark Avenger tend to cause random changes in data and programs 
anywhere on disk, leading to unpredictable and pernicious damage.)

<P>Depending on how one judges variations to be different, there are from 
two to four thousand recognizable viruses circulating in cyberspace. 
About 30 virus types account for almost all the virus infections that 
ordinary users are likely to encounter. STONED and JERUSALEM alone 
account for about five sixths of all infections. Unfortunately, 
criminals have put virus-writing kits into the underground networks, so 
even now incopmpetent programmers can create mutating ('polymorphic') 
viruses that employ sophisticated techniques ('stealth') to avoid detection.

<P>Recent industry surveys suggest that the risk of virus infection of 
microcomputers (PCs and Macintosh) is a few percent per year per 
computer. There are currently no viruses found on user systems which 
infect large (mainframe) computers. There are only a few which affect 
UNIX operating systems or local area network operting systems.

<P>The most widespread computer crime is software theft. Estimated rates of 
theft range from about 35-40% in the USA to 99% stolen in Thailand. 
Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance, reports 
that more than 80% of the computer programmes (sic) in China are 
pirated, making it one of the worst stealers of software in Asia and 
costing the worldwide industry US$500 million a year. Sometimes stolen 
programs are available in Asia before they are released legally.

<P>Apparently China is now concerned about copyright violations in part 
because its own software industry is being harmed. Yang Tianxin, chief 
of the computer division of the ministry of electronic industry, claims 
that China is just beginning to attack this problem using criminal 
penalties and education.

<P>Western nations also need to integrate respect for intellectual property 
into normal morality. Too many managers, teachers, technicians and just 
plain users are stealing software by making unauthorized copies of 
copyrighted programs. It's no wonder children trade pirated copies of 
computer games with no awareness of doing wrong.

<P>Most computer crimes are not perpetrated by criminal hackers. Recent 
surveys suggest that about 85% of all computer-related crimes are 
committed by personnel authorized to use the computers they abused. The 
probability of being attacked by outsiders is only 1 or 2% per system 
per year.

<P>Within organizations, programmers occasionally write malicious software. 
'Trojan Horses' are programs which have secret functions (e.g., keeping 
a record of passwords) along with their ostensible purposes. The AIDS 
Information Diskette which circulated worldwide a few years ago was a 
trojan which pretended to offer information about the dread disease, but 
then scrambled the user's disk directory and tried to extort payment for 
a recovery utility. Trap Doors involve programming secret entry points 
for later unauthorized use; the password 'Joshua' was part of a trap 
door left by the creator of a top-secret government system in the movie 
'War Games.'

<P>Logic bombs are sections of program which check for particular 
conditions and then wreak havoc in the system. In the film, 'Single White 
Female,' a programmer leaves a logic bomb in her code to wipe out her 
creepy client's entire fashion database because he hasn't paid her full 
fee. In November 1993, a Manhattan programmer and his technician were 
accused of planting a logic bomb in a client's software when he refused 
to pay the full cost of the package. Some programmers insert logic bombs 
in their code as a matter of course.

<P>The cyberspace equivalent of vandalism occurs when intruders or 
disgruntled employees deliberately damage or destroy information. The 
414 gang (so named from the area code of their Milwaukee homes) damaged  
clinical research data in their forays through the networks in the early 
1980s. Two teenagers from Staten Island caused $2.1 million of damage to 
the voice-mail system of a publisher by erasing orders for advertising 
and leaving obscene messages which offended clients. When they were 
finally tracked down and arrested, the 14- and 17-year olds admitted 
that their depredations were revenge for having failed to receive a 
promised poster from the publisher.

<P>In a report at the 16th National Computer Security Conference in 
Baltimore, MD in September 1993, an investigator whose team tracks the 
underground BBSs revealed that detailed instructions for weapons of 
terrorism are freely available in cyberspace. The published recipes for 
home-made bombs were evaluated by professionals from military special 
forces and were pronounced to be workable, albeit dangerous for amateurs.

<P>Some administrators at universities with Internet connections have been 
put under opposing pressures because of the availability of graphic 
pornography graphics. There have been threats of lawsuits for allowing 
such materials to enter the campus systems and threats of lawsuits for 
forbidding such materials to enter the campus systems. Smoe paedophile 
(sic) BBS operators have been found to use their systems to entice 
youngsters into meetings by offering illicit files and cheap stolen 
hardware and software.


<P>It is easy to create false identities through electronic mail. Some 
denizens of cyberspace use one or more psuedonyms ('handles'). A major 
hacker conference was announced on the Internet by 
'drunkfux@cypher.com' with no other identification made available. Some 
'cypherpunks' insist that there should be no interference with this 
practise (sic), arguing that any attempt to enforce identification would 
be a gross infringement of their privacy.

<P>Advocates of anonymous and pseudonymous postings defend their preference 
by pointing to the long-standing acceptance of pseudonyms in print. I 
wonder if they would defend wearing face masks during face-to-face 
conversations?

<P><B>WHO ARE THESE TECHNOPATHS?</B>
<P>Because of the shadowy nature of the computer underground, where real 
names are few and role-playing is the norm, it is hard to find reliable 
statistics about the demographics of what famed Bulgarian anti-virus 
researcher Vesselin Bontchev (now at the University of Hamburg) has 
called 'technopaths.' The consensus in the computer underground is that 
they are predominantly teenage boys and young men. These maladapted, 
undersocialized, emotionally-underdeveloped individual apodt 
nom-de-guerre ('handles') like Phiber Optik, Acid Phreak, Dark Avenger, 
The Leftist, The Prophet, The Urvile, and Necron 99. They form 
electronic gangs with ludicrous names like Masters of Deception and 
Legion of Doom. Much of this adolescent pusturing; as one member of the 
latter group commented, 'We couldn't very well call ourselves the Legion 
of Flower-Pickers.'

<P>Several popular books have provided insights into the psychology of 
criminal hackers. One of the best is by Katie Hafner and John Markoff, 
Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier. (Touchstone 
Books, Simon & Schuster (New York, 1991). ISBN 0-671-77879-X. 368 pp. Index).

<P><B>ARE HACKERS CRAZY?</B>
<P>The standard reference work on psychiatric disorders (DSM III; APA, 
1980) defines the Narcissistic Personality Disorder in these terms:

<P>'The essential feature is a Personality Disorder... in which there are a 
grandoise sense of self-importance or uniqueness; preoccupation with 
fantasies with fantasies of unlimited success; exhibitionistic need for 
constant attention and admiration; characteristics response to threats 
to self-esteem; and characteristic disturbances in interpersonal 
relationships, such as feelings of entitlement, interpersonal 
exploitativeness, relationships that alternate between the extremes of 
overidealization and devalu ation, and lack of empathy....

<P>...In response to criticism, defeat or disappointment, there is either a 
cool indifference or marked feelings of rage, inferiority, shame, 
humiliation, or emptiness.... Entitlement, the expectation of special 
favors without assuming reciprocal responsibilities, is usually present. 
For example, surprise and anger are felt because others will not do what 
is wanted; more is expected from people than is reasonable.

<P>Sound like hackers?

<P>During the 1990 December holiday season, some 25 hackers gathered for 
their 'Christmas Con' in a hotel near Houston airport. After consuming 
too many beers and pulling fire alarms, the group was evicted from the 
hotel. This sort of behavior is associated with Antisocial Personality 
Disorder, whose '...essential feature is... a history of continuous and 
chronic antisocial behavior in which the rights of others are 
violated....' (DSM III; APA, 1980). In 1993, some of the 200 attendees 
at HoHoCon in Austin pulled fire alarms after a night of drunken 
carousing and viewing pornographic movies.

<P>In the Austin HoHoCon in December 1993, criminal hackers discussed 
cracking cellular phones, shared information on new techniques fro 
stealing long-distance services, and boasted of posting anarchist files 
on BBSs. When I challenged "Deth Vegetable" for having posted 
instructions on how to make bombs out of household cleaning supplies, 
his friends glared angrily at me and hissed, "It wasn't illegal. He had 
a right to post whatever he wanted." Deth Vegetable rejected 
responsibility for the consequences of his actions; although he 
regretted that two children had recently destroyed their hands in an 
explosion while following the details of his file, he sneered that 
perhaps it was evolution in action. He admitted that maybe it seemed 
wrong, but he didn't know why. "And anyway," he shrugged, "who's to say 
if it's right or wrong?" 

<P>The culture of criminal hackers seems to glorify behavior which would be 
classified as sociopathic or frankly psychotic. These behaviors must not 
become normative.

<P><B>TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS</B>
<P>Technical approaches to behavioral problems have a limited scope. Some 
attempts to protect cyberspace concentrate on making it harder to do 
harm. For example, system managers are supposed to pay strict attention 
to how people can enter their systems and networks; this area of concern  
is known as access control. Some of the more successful methods 
currently in use include one-time password generators. Such hand-held 
units, about the size of a credit card, generate random-looking codes 
which can be used for logging into computer systems and networks, but 
which are valid for only one minute.

<P>Modems which garble transmissions make it impossible to crack systems 
using brute force methods. Instead of trying hundreds of passwords 
without hinderance, criminal hackers would be forced to turn to the much 
slower techniques of lying and spying (social engineering). Even if 
criminal hackers were to enter a secure system, encrypted data would 
severely interfere with their ability to cause trouble. Unfortunately, 
encryption is still not in general use in the business community.

<P>Finally, if more victims of computer crime were to report what happened, 
the computer security industry could develop the same kind of shared 
expertise as the insurance industry's actuaries. It would help 
immeasurably to have a library of documented case studies of computer 
crime available for study by computer science students, sociologists, 
criminologists and security experts. All organizations hit by computer 
criminals are encouraged to report what happened to the Computer 
Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT-CC) at Carnegie Mellon 
University in Pittsburgh, PA.

<P><B>HUMAN SOLUTIONS</B>
<P>Technical solutions appeal to the rational propensities of security 
specialists. But since people are at the core of computer crime, 
psychological factors must be at the core of efforts to contain it.

<P>Security is the tooth-flossing of the computer world: it's boring and 
repetitive, slightly distasteful, and has no obvious, immediate 
benefits. Even worse, the better the implementation, the less frequently 
problems arise. Security cannot be achieved by superficial changes of 
stle. Just as the Total Quality Management movement emphasizes that the 
concern for qualit must pervade all aspects of working culture, 
information security must become part of the corporate culture.

<P>Security professionals have to deal with the psychological difficulties 
of trying to change long-rooted patterns of social behavior. For 
example, a typical security policy states that no one may allow another 
employee to 'piggyback' into a secure area; that is, each person 
entering through a secured door must use their own access-control 
device. However, politeness dictates the opposite: we hold a door open 
and invite our friends and colleagues to enter before we do. To learn 
new habits, it is useful to address the conflict directly: acknowledging 
that the policy will be uncomfortable at first is a good step to making 
it less uncomfortable. For example, employeesshould participate in 
role-playing exercises. First, they can practice refusing access to coll
eagues who accept the policies graciously, then move on to arguments 
with less-friendly colleagues. Finally they can learn to deal with 
confrontations with colleagues who pretend to be higher-rank and 
hostile. Managers should practise (sic) being refused access to secured 
areas.

<P>In grade schools, high schools, colleges and universites, students are 
introduced early to computer systems and expected to master and use 
computers in their studies. All too aften, however, ethical issues about 
computer usage are neglected. Some instructors blatantly steal 
copyrighted software or tell their young charges to do so ('Here, copy 
this diskette and return the original'). Other children entrain their 
younger contemporariesinto the glitzy world of computer virus exchanges 
and virus writing. There's always the allure of computerized pornography 
on local bulletin boards--an allure enhanced by the lack of knowledge of 
parents and teachers about the very existence of such sources.

<P>Lonnie Moore is computer security manager at the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory. With the help of Gale Warshawsky, an employee who 
happens to be an experienced puppeteer, More has created an appealing 
and entertaining security awareness security awareness video for children 
in elementary schools. The heroes are Chip, the friendly computer, and 
Gooseberry, the hapless untrained user. The villian is Dirty Dan, the 
nasty hacker. Dan drops crumbs into Chip's keyboard, destoys files and 
makes Chip cry, then makes Chip dizzy by feeding him a virus from another 
computer. Moore explains, 'What we are trying to do is learn from the 
mistakes that have been made. They understand good guys and bad guys. We 
also teach them to try to have some feeling for the others involved.'

<P>A major telephone company in the US has created a video for 
middle-school children which addresses telephone fraud in an 
entertaining and informative way.

<P>The Computer Ethics Institute in Washington, DC, has published the Ten 
Commandments of Computer Ethics.

<P>Efforts such as these are the beginning of a response to lawlessness in 
cyberspace. Operating at the human level, they are ultimately as 
important as technical solutions to computer crime.

<P><B>THE MORAL UNIVERSE OF COMPUTER USERS</B>
<P>It takes time to integrate morality into our technological universe. 
Twenty years ago, many drivers felt that driving under the influence of 
alcohol was adventurous. Today most people feel that it's stupid and 
irresponsible. Smoking in public is becoming rare. Many of us in Nortern 
cities have witnessed exiled smokers huddled together in the cold 
outside buildings where they once lit up with impunity.

Similarly, we need a consensus on good behavior in cyberspace.

<P>Criminal hackers who break into computer systems and roam through user's 
private files should be viewed as Peeping Toms. Criminals using 
computers to extort money or steal services should be recognized as 
thieves. Those who destroy records, leave logic bombs, and write viruses 
should be viewed as vandals. Hackers who smear obscenities in source 
code should be seen as twisted personalities in need of punishment and 
therapy. Government agencies proposing to interfere in electronic 
communications should be s ubject to scrutiny and intense lobbying.

<P>Beyond such prohibitions and inhibitions of taboos, cyberspace needs the 
electronic equivalent of Emily Post. We need to discuss the immorality 
of virus writing, the ethical implications of logic bombs, and the 
criminality of electronic trespassing. We should teach children how to 
be good citizens of cyberspace--and not just in schools. We should sit 
down with computer-using youngsters and follow them through their 
adventures in cyberspace. Parents should ask their teenage whiz-kids 
about hacking, viruses, software theft and telephone fraud. We must 
bring the perspective and guidance of adult generations to bear on a 
world that is evolving faster than most of us can imagine.

<P>Participants in the National Computer Security Conferences should be at 
the forefront of efforts to reach out into the wider community. If 
experts in security cannot express their values, who will?

<P>The adolescent confraternity of criminal hackers and virus writers have 
already begun developing totems: the personae of Dark Avenger and Acid 
Phreak loom over youngsters much as Robin Hood once did for another 
generation.

<P>What we need now are taboos to match the totems.</P>

SPA vs. Site with Hack links? Private Big Brother?
</H3>
</Center>
<BR>
<P>A really close friend of mine was INVESTIGATED not for hosting a site but
for providing DNS for a web site that was on hacking. Not Software piracy
but hacking. Information on how to hack things like telephones etc. Pure
information. No software, no files and full disclaimers.

<P>He gets a call and a letter from the SPA who tells him that he is going 
to be investigated unless he cuts the link. He cuts the link and they 
send him a document to sign that releases him of his responsiblity 
regarding the situation. These people were literally ready to 
storm-trooper into his home, search his premises, search his place of 
employment and most likely get him fired.

<P>It totally blew me away that the SPA has this power to chill free speech
and expression on the net. Hot damn, they are international as well.

<P>If anyone starts an anti-SPA group, I'll join. :)</P>

Hackers crack CIA home page code.
</H2>
</Center>
<BR>
<P>This morning, hackers did a number on the CIA home page, altering it, adding
some obsecentities and changed the title to "Central Stupidity Agency."   It
was stated that a tipster call CNN Interactive in Atlanta  and said that the
break-in was done by Swedish hackers.   The phone call was received about
5:45 a.m. EDT. When asked what the hackers had done to the page, the man
said, "I think you  should just take a look at it."   Withour further
comment, he hung up.</P>
<BR>
>The hackers appeared to have obliterated the CIA's entire <BR>
>site, replacing it with their own design. The site greeted <BR>
>Internet surfers with: "Welcome to the Central Stupidity <BR>
>Agency," followed by the intriguing statement, "STOP LYING BO <BR>
>SKARINDER!!!"<BR>

<P>The hackers were kind and provided several links underneath the greeting
including  Playboy, Hackerz.org, Flashback Magazine and protocols from The
Swedish Hackers Association.

<P>The group who did this dastardly deed called themselves."Power Through
Resistance," left an obscenity-laced message at the bottom of the page.

<P>CIA officials were not immediately available for comment.

<P>Internet break-ins have become an increasing concern for U.S. defense and
intelligence agencies. Last month, hackers broke into the Justice
Department's Web site, adding swastikas, obscenities and a picture of Adolf
Hitler to the page. 

<P>Justice officials were quick to state that the hackers did not gain access
to criminal files and pulled the plug on the site.

Hacker alert.  <BR>
<P>OSS '96, the annual gathering of spies,
librarians, military and law enforcement analysts, and
the occasional corporate electronic security person, is
offering free seats for up to ten hackers endorsed by
Emmanuel Goldstein, Erik Bloodaxe, Rop Gonggrijp, or
Glenn Tenney, as bona fide.  Get a free ride (costs
corporation $1000) and come hear and challenge people
like Ira Winkler from NCSA (on his billion dollar heist),
Paul Strassmann (on informatoin terrorism and information
crime), and so on.  For a complete copy of the program,
send blank email to <OSS96@oss.net>.  Check out our Web
site at <a href="http://www.oss.net">http://www.oss.net</a>, or send email directly to
Robert D. Steele (keynote speaker at many hacker 
cons, coined the phrase "hackers are a national resource
because they show us the emperor is naked"), at
<a href="MAILTO:ceo@oss.net">ceo@oss.net</a>.  Rise up!  Come strut your righteous stuff.
Hotel rooms can be made available.</P>

<h2>Cyber-Christ meets Lady Luck</H2>
<H4>	July 22-24, 1994</H4>
	by Winn Schwartau<P>
</Center>



Las Vegas connotes radically different images to radically different folks.  The Rat Pack of Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. elicits up the glistening self-indulgent imagery of  Vegas'  neon organized crime in the '50's   (Ocean's Eleven displayed only minor hacking skills.)<P>

Then  there's the daily bus loads of elderly nickel slot  gamblers from  Los Angeles and Palm Springs who have nothing better to  do for  twenty out of twenty four hours each day.  (Their dead  hus bands were golf hacks.)   Midwesterners now throng to the Mississippi River for cheap gambling.<P>

Recreational vehicles of semi-trailor length from East  Bullock, Montana  and Euclid, Oklahoma and Benign, Ohio clog routes 80  and 40  and 10 to descend with a vengeance upon an asphalt home away from home in  the parking  lot  of Circus Circus.  By cultural demand, every Rv'er worth his  salt  must, at least once in his life,  indulge in the depravity of Glitter Gulch.  <P>

And so they come, compelled by the invisibly insidious derelict attraction of  a desert Mecca whose only purpose in life is to suck the available cash  from addicted visitor's electronic purses of ATM and VISA cards. (Hacker?  Nah . . .)<P>

Vegas also has the distinction of being home  to the largest of the  largest  conventions  and exhibitions in the world.  Comdex is the world's largest computer convention where 150,000 techno- dweebs and silk suited glib techno-marketers display  their  wares to a public who is still  paying  off  the 20% per annum debt on  last year's  greatest  new  electronic gismo which  is  now rendered thoroughly obsolete.  And the Vegas Consumer Electronic Show does for consumer electronics what the First Amendment does for  pornography.  (Hackers, are we getting close?)<P>

In  between,  hundreds  upon hundreds of  small  conferences  and conventions  and  sales meetings and annual excuses for excess all  select  Las Vegas as the ultimate host city.  Whatever you want, no matter how decadent, blasphemous, illegal or immoral, at any hour, is  yours for the asking, if you have cash or a clean  piece of plastic.  <P>

So, it comes as no surprise, that sooner or later, (and it  turns out  to  be sooner) that the hackers of the world,  the  computer hackers, phone phreaks, cyber-spooks, Information Warriors,  data bankers,  Cyber-punks,  Cypher-punks,  eavesdroppers,   chippers, virus writers and perhaps the occasional Cyber Christ again picked Las Vegas as the 1994 site for DefCon II. <P>

You  see, hackers are like everyone else (sort of) and  so  they, too,  decided  that  their community was also  entitled  to  hold conferences and conventions.<P>

DefCon (as opposed to Xmas's HoHoCon), is the premier mid-year hacker extravaganza.  Indulgence gone wild, Vegas notwithstanding if  previous Cons  are any example; but now put a few  hundred  techno-anarchists  together  in sin city USA, stir in liberal doses  of  illicit controlled pharmaceutical substances, and we have a party that Hunter Thompson would be proud to attend.<P>

All the while, as this anarchistic renegade regiment marches to the tune of a 24 hour city, they are under complete surveillance of the authorities.  Authorities like the FBI, the Secret Service, telephone security . . . maybe even Interpol.  And how did the "man" arrive in tow behind the techno-slovens that belong behind bars?<P>

They were invited.<P>

And so was I.  Invited to speak. (Loose translation  for standing up in front of hundreds of hackers  and being verbally skewered for having an opinion not in 100% accordance with their own.)   <P>

"C'mon, it'll be fun," I was assured by DefCon's organizer, the Dark Tangent.<P>

"Sure fired way to become mutilated monkey meat," I responded.  Some hackers just can't take a joke, especially after a prison sentence and no opposite-sex sex.<P>

"No really, they want to talk to you . . ."<P>

"I bet."<P>

It's not that I dislike hackers - on the contrary.  I have even let a few into my home to play with my kids.  It's just that, so many of  antics that hackers have precipitated at other -Cons have earned them a reputation of disdain by all, save those who remember their own non-technical adolescent shenanigans.  And I guess I'm no different.  I've heard the tales of depraved indifference, hotel hold-ups, government raids on folks with names similar to those who are wanted for pushing the wrong key on the keyboard and getting caught for it.  I wanted to see teens and X- generation type with their eyes so star sapphire glazed over that I could trade them for chips at the craps table.   <P>

Does the truth live up to the fiction?  God, I hope so. It'd be downright awful and unAmerican if 500 crazed hackers didn't get into at least some serious trouble.  <P>

So I go to Vegas because, because, well, it's gonna be fun.  And, if I'm lucky, I might even see an alien spaceship.  <P>

For you see, the party has already begun.<P>

	<H4>HOPE - Hackers On Planet Earth</H4>
	New York City - August 13-14, 1994
	by Winn Schwartau</Center><BR>

[This is Part II. <a href="cc1short.html-ssi">Cyber Christ Meets Lady Luck</a> is where is all began.]<P>

Las Vegas is a miserable place, and with a nasty cold no less; it took me three weeks of inhaling salt water and sand at the beach to finally dry up the post nasal drip after my jaunt to DefCon II.  My ears returned to normal so that I no longer had to answer every question with an old Jewish man's "Eh?" while fondling my lobes for better reception.   <P>

New York had to be better.<P>

Emmanuel Goldstein -aka Eric Corely - or is it the other way around? is the host of HOPE, Hackers on Planet Earth, a celebration of his successfully publishing 2600 - The Hackers Quarterly  for ten years without getting jailed, shot or worse.  For as Congressman Ed Markey said to Eric/Emmanuel in a Congressional hearing last year, and I paraphrase, 2600 is no more than a handbook for hacking (comparable obviously to a terrorist handbook for blowing up the World Trade Center) for which Eric/Emmanuel should be properly vilified, countenanced and then drawn and quartered on Letterman's Stupid Pet Tricks. <P>

Ed and Eric/Emmanuel obviously have little room for negotiation and I frankly enjoyed watching their Congressional  movie where communication was at a virtual standstill: and neither side understood the viewpoints or positions of the other.  <P>

But Ed is from Baaahhhsten, and Eric/Emmanuel is from New York, and HOPE will take place in the Hotel Filthadelphia, straight across the street from Pennsylvania Station in beautiful downtown fast-food-before-they-mug-you 34th street, right around the corner from clean-the-streets-its-Thanksgiving Herald Square.  Geography notwithstanding, HOPE promised to be a more iconoclastic gathering than that of DefCon II. <P>

First off, to set the record straight, I am a New Yorker.  No matter that I escaped in 1981 for the sunny beaches of California for 7 years, and then moved to the Great State of the Legally Stupid for four more (Tennessee); no matter that I now live on the Gulf Coast of Florida where the water temperature never dips below a chilly  98 degrees; I am and always will be a New Yorker.  <P>
It took me the better part of a decade of living away from New York to come to that undeniable and inescapable conclusion: Once a New Yorker, always a New Yorker. Not that that makes my wife any the happier.<P>

"You are so rude.  You love to argue.  Confrontation is your middle name."  Yeah, so what's your point?<P>

You see, for a true New Yorker these aren't insults to be re- regurgitated at the mental moron who attempts to combat us in a battle of wits yet enters the ring unarmed; these are mere truisms as seen by someone who views the world in black and white, not black, white and New York.<P>

Case in point.<P>

I used to commute into Manhattan from the Westchester County suburb of Ossining where I lived 47 feet from the walls of Sing Sing prison (no shit!).  Overlooking the wide expanse of the Hudson River from my aerie several hundred feet above, the only disquieting aspect of that location were the enormously deafening thunderclaps which resounded a hundred and one times between the cliffs on either side of the river.  Then there was the occasional escapee-alarm from the prison. .<P>

So, it was my daily New York regimen to take the 8:15 into the city. If the train's on time I'll get to work by nine . . .<P>

Grand Central Station - the grand old landmark thankfully saved by the late Jackie O. - is the nexus for a few hundred million commuters who congregate in New York Shitty for no other reason that to collect a paycheck to afford blood pressure medicine.  <P>

You have to understand that New York is different.  Imagine, picture in your mind: nothing is so endearing as to watch thousands of briefcase carrying suits scrambling like ants in a Gary Larson cartoon for the nearest taxi, all the while greeting their neighbors with the prototypical New York G'day! <P>

With both fists high in the air, middle fingers locked into erect prominence, a cacophonous chorus of  "Good Fucking Morning" brightens the day of a true New Yorker.  His bloodshot eyes instantly clear, the blood pressure sinks by 50% and already the first conflict of the day has been waged and won.<P>

Welcome to the Big Apple, and remember never, ever, to say, "Have a Nice Day."  Oh, no.  Never.<P>

So HOPE was bound to be radically different from Vegas's DefCon II, if only for the setting.  But, I expected hard core.  The European contingent will be there, as will Israel and South America and even the Far East. All told, I am told, 1000 or more are expected.  And again, as at DefCon II, I am to speak, but Eric/Emmanuel never told me about what, when, or any of the other niceties that go along with this thing we call a schedule. <P>

<P>

<BR>
<BR>
<I>In this chapter, the focus of this ethnographic study is broadly
described, the purposes and significance of the study delineated,
and the structure of the report overviewed.</I>
<P>
<I>The chapter also conceptualises and defines hacking. This is
done by considering the historical development and conceptualisation
of hacking in symbiosis with the development of computer technology.
The current literature's descriptions of hacking, the players
who are involved in hacking (such as hackers and security people),
and the groups into which hackers have been divided are then described.
This follows with a list of perceived threats and examples of
the dangers which hackers pose to the technological world.</I>
<P>
<I>(It could be argued that this chapter should be part of Chapter
2 - The Literature Review. However, because of the conceptualisations
which are developed here, it was felt more appropriate to keep
it as a separate chapter.)</I>
<P>
<B>1.1 BACKGROUND</B> 
<P>
The concept of the historical development of hacking, in symbiosis
with the development of computer technology, is presented in this
section.
<P>
The computer can be considered as a calculating machine, its history
stretching back thousands of years to the abacus; 'a calculating
frame with balls sliding on wires' (Garmonsway 1965, p1). Calculating
machines, e.g., Babbage's Difference Engine of 1822 and the slide-rule,
may also be described as computers. More recently the computer
was defined as 'an electronic calculator' (Wright 1951, p31);
'a machine which &quot;memorises&quot;, sifts, analyses and correlates
data, and produces selective data as required.' (Garmonsway 1965,
p148); however, today the term is usually limited to those electronic
devices that are 'given a program to follow, data to store or
calculate with, and means with which to present results or (other)
stored information' (Yule 1979, p136).
<P>
Computer technology continues to evolve at an accelerating rate
and with it society has developed new roles and professions to
address the emerging specialisations within the computing field
(Chantler 1992a). The advent of the small business computer, followed
by the proliferation phenomena of technology in the 'home' or
'personal computers' (PCs), leading to the 'portable' then 'laptop'
and currently the 'notebook' PCs, has seen the emergence of a
corresponding social phenomena, that of the 'computer hacker'.
<P>
Levy (1984) in <I>Hackers, Heroes of the Computer Revolution</I>presents
hackers as the original gurus of computing. At their 'birth' in
the late 1950s, they were portrayed as the people who actively
sought new ways to improve the hardware and the software, often
to make it perform in ways that were far beyond what they were
originally designed to do. They were the enthusiasts who were
totally absorbed by the fascination of their work. 'Hackers' today,
in the broadest sense of the word, are considered as computer
enthusiasts who, using their home PC and a telephone modem, illegally
'break-into' computer systems that belong to the large multi-national
corporations and government agencies (Jones 1993).
<P>
The researcher (the term 'researcher' hereinafter is used to refer
to the writer of this thesis) suggests that as information-technology
continues to invade our private lives, the scope for hacker-crimes
also increases: the temptation is there to penetrate fax machines,
electronic funds transfer (EFT) systems, electronic mail systems,
PABXs (telephone exchanges: Private Automatic Branch eXchange),
VMBs (voice mail boxes) and remote controlled security systems.
To do so is illegal and these illegal activities have branded
hackers as criminals. Hackers actively create an increasing number
of problems in our computer-dependent society.
<P>
An early article (Electronics Australia 1975, p28), titled 'How
Safe are Computers from Sabotage?', details the threats to information
systems. These range over a broad spectrum including natural catastrophe;
sabotage; theft of data, theft of application software and theft
of hardware; bugging; accidental disclosure and physical assault.
Two examples of computer crimes are also presented to illustrate
the need for more stringent security precautions: the first one
is described as 'a now classic and very imaginative example of
computer crime' which was carried out by a young electrical engineer
on the West Coast of the USA. Posing as a customer, he discovered
a way to log-on to the computerised central supply division at
the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company. Before someone betrayed
him, he had illegally ordered over $1 million worth of equipment
without paying for it. The second example details 'a weak spot'
in a banking computer system which was found by a clerk in a Washington
DC bank. Noting that the bank's computer only checked the magnetically-coded
deposit numbers on the bottom of the incoming deposit slips, he
replaced the usual supply of deposit slips on the customers' desks
with his own account number. Depositors, using forms from the
lobby desks, unknowingly added money to his account. A few days
later he withdrew the money and disappeared.
<P>
It is interesting to note that in both of these examples, the
word 'hacker' does not appear. However, these specific cases have
since been referred to in more recent times (Yovel, Oren and Klein
1989) as the activities of 'computer hackers'. Now, over twenty
years later, the word 'hacker' is seen to be synonymous with such
activities.
<P>
The extent of the phenomena of 'hacking' has been further dramatised
by the media, the security and intelligence agencies, the police,
and telephone companies. Legislation has evolved and specialised
computer security services have been built to address the problems
caused by hackers (Parker 1993, p1). Because of this exposure,
much of the current knowledge about hackers has come from 'the
popular press'; police and security agencies, computer security
specialists, and also from those hackers who have been caught.
However, because of the clandestine nature of much of their activity,
the world of the computer hackers and their activities are mainly
unknown.
<P>
<B>1.2 RESEARCH GOALS</B>
<P>
This ethnographic study is about computer hackers and the threats
and risks which they are purported to pose.
<P>
Because of the links that tie hackers to the media, the researcher
will utilise some 'press' material. Normally this would not be
viewed as 'academic' enough to use as references. However, with
the lack of other more 'formal' information and because the researcher
is restricted in the use of classified information from defence
services and intelligence agencies, these are valid reasons for
its utilisation.
<P>
The media continually present us with reports on the exploits
of computer hackers. The majority of these reports appear to capitalise
on sensationalism. Hackers are described as 'whiz-kids, code-junkies,
cyberspace-jockeys, crackers, feral technocrats, fone-phreaks
or cyberpunks'. They are presented to us in a 'picture' which
indicates that they can penetrate all types of electronic information
systems and cause millions of dollars worth of damage; access
sensitive classified data; manipulate and steal money through
EFT (electronic funds transfer); compromise the nation's military
secrets; conduct fraud on a large scale; and, halt corporate businesses.
<P>
The research goals for this project are as follows:
<P>
1. To complete an ethnographic study devised to explore popular
perceptions of hackers and what they do. ('Living with the hackers'
to explore their 'world', forms a major part of this program.)
<P>
2. To determine the veracity of the perspective of the press by
examining the role of the media in the development of the perceptions
of hackers.
<P>
3. To determine the extent to which the hacker society poses as
a threat/risk environment and to examine their impact to electronic*
systems.
<P>
* The word 'electronic' is used as a blanket statement to cover
all the systems which are of interest to hackers. The author's
studies indicate that hackers are interested in a range of technical
targets; at one end of the scale, business information systems
(by far the highest percentage of interest) and at the other end
of the scale (for example), magnetic-stripe fare-tickets, typically
used for passenger rides on the underground rail links and the
Sydney Harbour ferries.
<P>
<B>1.3 OBJECTIVES</B>
<P>
The objectives of this research are:
<P>
to review the literature in the area of 'computer hacking';
<P>
to describe the 'hacker' environment;
<P>
to identify the characteristics of 'hackers', particularly with
respect to motivation;
<P>
to develop a model of hacker information processing;
<P>
to generate hypotheses with regard to the genesis, functions and
limits of hackers with particular respect to the threats/risks
which they pose;
<P>
to define the difference between a risk and a threat in this context;
<P>
to propose the components which constitute a threat;
<P>
to quantify the qualitative data collected about hackers into
risk/threat levels; and,
<P>
to propose methods to control the threats.
<P>
These objectives are addressed by observing hacker activity (through
computer communication), interviewing hackers and examining their
artifacts (the programs, notes, games, utilities etc., that they
develop). In particular, the artifacts are analysed to provide
a reflection of the hacker society and its complexity. These artifacts
also reflect the development of hackers, their intellectual ability,
knowledge base, level of sophistication and affective drives.
<P>
<B>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</B>
<P>
An extensive research of existing literature on this subject,
indicates that, contrary to popular opinion, there has been little
formal or systematic research with respect to hackers. There are
many snippets of information which appear in the press which may
give the opinion that 'everyone knows about hackers': illegal
access to computer systems; theft of computer-time and information;
copyright infringements; sale of user access codes and passwords;
modification of operating systems; damage of data; the writing
of 'rogue code' (computer viruses, worms etc.); credit card fraud;
'fone phreaking'; trading in subversive, terrorist information
and pornography. (James and Chantler 1994) However, these are
the 'end products' and their appearance in the majority of articles
that label perpetrators of an alleged computer crime, do not give
any insight or understanding into the 'world' or culture of hackers.
<P>
The study reported in this thesis addresses the gap in the research
by providing a thorough and systematic study of hackers. It describes
the 'world' of the hackers, their culture, characteristics, thinking
in terms of information processing, and their motivation. No previous
study has been traced to date that has interviewed hackers or
utilised observations and examined their artifacts in relation
to the points above. Hence the study is significant because of
its innovation.
<P>
By the nature of their activities, some hackers can represent
a threat to those aspects of government and the corporate sector
that deal with the protection of computer systems and the security
of information. There are many technological solutions to combat
these threats, to protect individuals and organisations. These
solutions are available from security specialists, consultants
and the suppliers of the information-technology hardware. Most
are costly, time-consuming and can become an irritation in the
day-to-day management of such systems (James and Chantler 1993).
The continued 'explosion' in numbers of PCs throughout society,
suggests that there is a growth in computer literacy, and with
it an increasing number of hackers within society. Rather than
following a 'treat the symptom' approach to security breaches
by spontaneously 'grabbing' at solutions from security specialists
(as mentioned above), it is more efficient to 'treat the cause'.
Hemmel (1994) stated in his opening address of a recent Security
Research Symposium, that 'Security begins with society; society
can be reached through education'. It would appear that another
way to control the threat from hackers is to effect the growth
of hacker groups and their aspirations through education. For
instance, approaches such as introducing 'ethics' into computer
classes, or ensuring that educators and educational practices
are ethically based, could create a greater responsibility amongst
students of information-technology. Therefore, this study is significant
because its results may assist in addressing the current problems
that exist for national and corporate security, the theft and
damage of information and aspects relating to the Privacy/Freedom
of Information Acts, which Chantler has previously mentioned in
reports to the government (Chantler 1988a, 1989, 1990a, 1991a,
1992b).
<P>
The author of this thesis is in a unique situation to be able
to research hackers. He was formerly the head of computer security
for the Australian Army. (The relevance of mentioning this precise
position is that computer hackers show an attraction for military
sites. Accordingly the author is well-placed to be within an environment
that is 'rich' for hacker connections.) He is now in the Army
Reserve and still directly involved with computer security. In
these positions, he has been able to have access to computer-to-computer
communications between hackers. He has formed relationships with
twenty-three confirmed hackers (Chantler 1992c). He has also gained
insight into understanding the hacker from earlier research involved
with his Army Intelligence positions, which has been presented
in various ABC radio and television interviews (Chantler 1990b,
1991b, 1992d, 1993a,b,c, 1994a,b,c,d). Hence, the credentials
of the author and researcher also add significance to this study.
<P>
In summary, this study is important through its contribution to
information systems security and business security management,
together with contributions in varying degrees, to a wider range
of fields (education, criminology, psychology, sociology and information
technology). Specifically,
<P>
it provides the first comprehensive description of hackers and
their environment based on formal research;
<P>
it provides a model of the genesis of hackers (i.e., what internal
and external aspects of an individual's life impact on their development
as a hacker);
<P>
it identifies the characteristics of 'hackers', particularly with
respect to motivation;
<P>
it proposes a model of hacker information processing;
<P>
it identifies their functions and their limits with respect to
the threats/risks which they pose;
<P>
it identifies a list of hacker 'targets' - assets vulnerable to
hacker attack;
<P>
it defines the difference between a risk and a threat (in this
context), and also proposes the components which constitute a
threat;
<P>
it identifies a categorisation of the types of hackers based on
their functions and limits;
<P>
it proposes a method of quantifying qualitative data about hackers
into risk/threat levels for use in security assessments of information
technology environments, with proposals on providing a better
control over the threats;
<P>
it describes the hacker 'nether world', often referred to as Cyberspace;
<P>
it proposes a 'model of motivation' for educators to enable positive
components of hacker motivation to be transferred into other subject
areas (the author's previous research found hackers to be highly
motivated, to the extent of bordering on becoming obsessed with
their 'hack' task); and,
<P>
it provides information technology educators with a greater awareness
of the need for a focus on teaching the ethical use of computers,
personal standards and responsible role models.
<P>
<B>1.5 OUTLINE OF THE CHAPTERS</B>
<P>
<B>1.5.1 Chapter 1 - An Introduction to The Study - The Concept
of Hacking</B>
<P>
The focus of the study is broadly described, the purposes and
significance of the study delineated, and the structure of the
report overviewed. This chapter, also conceptualises and defines
hacking. This is done by considering the historical development
and conceptualisation of hacking in symbiosis with the development
of computer technology. The current literature's descriptions
of hacking, the players who are involved in hacking (hackers,
security people, etc.), and the groups into which hackers have
been divided are then described. This follows with a list of perceived
threats and examples of the dangers which hackers pose to the
technological world In other words, the world of hacking is conceptualised
in this chapter.
<P>
<B>1.5.2 Chapter 2 - Literature Review</B>
<P>
The literature about hackers is reviewed to determine specific
areas for consideration in this research (e.g. scope of knowledge,
motivation, information processing, education, modus operandi,
etc.). Hacker types are identified along with various traits and
conceptions. Initial categories and models are developed. Hacking
as a compulsion is noted to other addictive behaviours, e.g.,
alcoholism and drugs. Finally, implications for the study are
drawn from the literature.
<P>
<B>1.5.3 Chapter 3 - Research Design</B>
<P>
The research methodology is described in detail and the reasons
for selecting a qualitative study and an ethnographic approach
are presented. Factors detailing how the hacker 'tribe', as an
ethnographic case study, is different from traditional form, e.g.,
studies of social constructs such as schools or street gangs,
are also addressed. The hackers and the other stakeholders are
the subjects of this research. Observations, surveys, interviews
and artifact analysis form the instruments; whilst the procedures
and analysis of data may be described as conventional in keeping
with qualitative research design. There is also an element of
quantitative research used in this program. This relates to using
conventional statistical analysis in the quantification of qualitative
data with respect to the level of threats posed by hackers.
<P>
<B>1.5.4 Chapter 4 - Observations</B>
<P>
The behaviours observed are described. These include computer
to computer 'live' communications and BBS (bulletin-board systems)
messages and communications. Inferences are drawn from these observations
in terms of knowledge, information processing, motivation and
threats .
<P>
<B>1.5.5 Chapter 5 - Surveys and Interviews</B>
<P>
Results of the surveys and the interviews conducted with hackers
and stakeholders are described. The development of the surveys
and interviews scripts are described and the form, structure and
content of each survey and interview are defended. The results
are discussed, with reference being made to specific survey responses
and interviews, and then the hacker survey and interview responses
are compared and contrasted with the non-hacker stakeholder interview
responses. The results are collated and displayed in tables. Commonalities
are identified to assist with analysis of certain categorisations
(e.g. knowledge and motivation).
<P>
<B>1.5.6 Chapter 6 - Artifacts</B>
<P>
The range of hacker artifacts is described and analysed for the
knowledge, the information processing and the motivation that
lies behind them.
<P>
The artifacts include:
<P>
computer programs, challenges and tests;
<P>
electronic (underground) magazines;
<P>
conventional (printed) hacker magazines (e.g. '2600', 'TAP');
<P>
notes, communications and messages;
<P>
rogue codes;
<P>
pornography;
<P>
virtual reality;
<P>
technical information on: explosives, anarchy, fone phreaking,
and 'sensitive information';
<P>
new languages, slang, and hieroglyphics.
<P>
The outcomes will provide evidence to further support, or dispel
the facts which emerge from the observations and surveys for comparison
with the findings in the literature review. Details of aspects
that address the notion of 'cyberspace' will also be collected
to define and clarify the term 'cyberspace' from the hacker viewpoint.
<P>
<B>1.5.7 Chapter 7 - Cyberspace, The Computer Underworld</B>
<P>
The notion of 'cyberspace' is investigated and the particular
'cyberspace' inhabited by the hackers of this study is described.
(This term 'cyberspace' often appears to become confused when
presented in the press. This is because of the inaccurate definitions
and the close associations which the term has with 'the information
superhighway', 'internet', 'cybernetics' and 'virtual reality'.)
The reason for including this chapter in the thesis is based on
the perceived connection between hackers and 'cyberspace' which
seems to be repeatedly presented in the popular press.
<P>
<B>1.5.8 Chapter 8 - Risks &amp; Threats: Application of Hacker
Attributes into Risk</B>
<P>
<B>Assessment Security Surveys</B> 
<P>
This chapter discusses risks and threats, and how they differ.
The components of a threat, along with a methodology to transform
the qualitative hacker data into a quantitative form, are presented
for inclusion into existing security survey methodologies. Suggestions
are also made to address the various threats which hackers pose.
<P>
<B>1.5.9 Chapter 9 - Conclusions, Limitations and Implications
</B>
<P>
Conclusions are described and the limitations of the study and
its implications for further research are delineated. Implications
are also proposed for handling hackers in terms of security. This
chapter summarises what research was conducted, what was found,
what the implications are, and future directions.
<P>
The results from each of the chapters: 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are further
analysed, discussed and compared with each other, along with data
from the literature.
<P>
<B>1.6 THE HACKING CONCEPT AND THREAT</B>
<P>
<B>1.6.1 The Origin of Hacking</B>
<P>
The term 'computer hacking' originates in 1958. The first description,
that shows a link between technology and hacking, is found in
Stephen Levy's book <I>Computer Hackers: Heroes of the Computer
Revolution</I> (Levy 1984). Levy describes a student called Peter
Samson who is in his freshman year at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) in 1958-59. The student is depicted wandering
along the labyrinth of laboratories and storerooms in building
26 when he discovers the EAM room (Electronic Accounting Machinery),
'a room that housed machines which ran like computers'.
<P>
Peter Samson is also a member of the Technical Model Railroad
Club (TMRC). He, and others, have a thirst for knowledge to know
how electro-mechanical machines work. They are much more interested
in what goes on under the model train set, than what is above
it. There are plenty of other people in the TMRC who are much
more interested in what is above, on the tables; the exactness
of the scenery, the perfection in art and historical replicas.
Underneath, there are the neat regimental lines of switches, regular
rows of relays and long rambling tangles of wire. Here is a classic
example, perhaps for the first time, where we see people from
the Arts and the Sciences being drawn together by a common technological
interest.
<P>
Levy (1984) continues to describe how Samson and his friends are
intrigued by a keypunch machine in the EAM room. The keypunch
machine punches holes into cards for the 'hulking giant' on the
first floor, an IBM 704 computer. It can also read and sort cards
and print a listing. The control of this machine can be changed
by wiring up a plugboard, a small plastic square with a mass of
holes in it. By putting hundreds of wires into it, in a certain
order, it is possible to change the machine's characteristics.
It could be made to do whatever you want it to do.
<P>
The same thing is true of the TMRC. The Signals and Power sub-committee,
of which Samson is a member, are continually improving, revamping,
perfecting and sometimes 'gronking' (in club jargon, screwing-up)
the workings under the display. When a piece of equipment isn't
working, it is 'losing'; when a piece of equipment is ruined it
is 'munged'; and a project undertaken or a product built not solely
to fulfil some productive goal, but with some wild pleasure taken
in mere fulfilment is called a 'hack'
<P>
While someone might call a clever connection between relays a
'mere hack', it would be understood that to qualify as a hack,
the feat must be imbued with innovation, style, and technical
virtuosity. Even though one might say he is 'hacking away at the
system' (much as an axe-wielder hacks at logs), the artistry with
which one hacked was recognised to be considerable. The most productive
people working on the Signals and Power called themselves 'hackers'
with pride. This often took long hours of dedication, almost to
the extent of being seen as an addiction. It is interesting to
note the term hacker is derived from the word 'hackney', which
means drudgery, 'hackneyed' means 'worn out from overuse'. An
old worn out horse is defined as a 'hack' (Schwartau 1994).
<P>
Thus the adoption of the word 'hack', over thirty years ago, has
now evolved to 'hackers' and 'hacking'.
<P>
<B>1.6.2 Hacking as a Developing Culture</B>
<P>
It has been suggested by Bowcott and Hamilton (1990) that Charles
Babbage, the nineteenth-century English mathematician, was arguably
the first hacker, using the term in its computer sense. He devised
principles and constructed working models which were accepted
as the forerunners of the modern computing machines. Babbage set
out a series of definitions of a machine which would take the
drudgery out of mathematical calculation and eventually, he hoped,
improve on human accuracy. His work was encouraged and supported
by Lady Ada Lovelace, the poet Byron's daughter and a contemporary
mathematician often described as the world's first programmer.
(As a tribute to her, the name Ada was later used for a defence
computer programming language developed in the 1960s.)
<P>
The <B>first generation</B> of computers in the 1940s, that we
have come to accept as the forerunners of the computers of today,
operated on thermionic valves or vacuum-tubes. The <B>second generation
</B> used transistor based technology. The <B>third generation
</B> relied on ICs (integrated circuits), also called silicon
'chips'. The <B>fourth generation</B> computers of today, are
using new technologies where more and more circuitry is being
squeezed onto the 'chip', VLSI, (very large scale integration).
<P>
Just as computer technology has developed, to become more and
more sophisticated, so too have hackers. The first hackers appeared
with the second generation computers. They were intimately connected
with the development of computers, either by research or directly
to a firm, for they were the privileged few who studied and worked
within this new world of high technology (Levy 1984, p7). Today,
few hackers have any commercial connection to a computer industry
(Simmonds 1993, p16).
<P>
The first hackers were 'die-hards' and were committed to advancing
technology. They are still with us today and are considered as
the 'High Priests' of hackers. Similarly, there were two other
'classes' or types of hackers that match the third and fourth
'generations' of computers. Consequently, hacker culture has developed
from those early days of 'isolated gurus' into a sophisticated
network that reflects its own culture within society.
<P>
Clough and Mungo (1992) describe the hacker culture in terms of
the development of different generations. The first generation
hackers were based on the East Coast of America, developing software;
the second-generation, 1970s hackers were on the West Coast, developing
hardware. The next generation, the third, was based both in North
America and Europe. These were young adolescents, mostly males,
who had inherited technology's 'gift' of the personal computer
and were copying and selling the first computer games. Their motivations
were described as being 'often a fast buck, and their instincts
entirely commercial'. The fourth generation, had inherited a world
in which technology was rapidly converging around the new standard-bearer,
the IBM PC. This new generation shared the same 'obsessions' as
their predecessors, but now they took 'hacking', previously an
'honourable trade', and made it into a form of breaking and entering.
The higher principles of hackers were summed up in a draft declaration
prepared at a national hacker meeting (the 'Galactic Hacker Party')
and circulated among delegates for their signatures; it stated
that the free and unfettered flow of information is an essential
part of fundamental liberties, and shall be upheld in all circumstances,
computer technology shall not be used by government and corporate
bodies to control and oppress the people.
<P>
Stang and Moon (1993, p196) propose that the hacker culture is
not just a single group united in motive and mission;, for they
consist of the following subgroups:
<UL>
<LI>Hackers; devoted to breaking into and exploring mainframes.
<LI>Phreaks; specialising in mastering the telephone system.
<LI>Codes kids; who run code snatching programs, looking for calling
card and PBX numbers.
<LI>Cybercrooks; criminals who have learned computing to steal
cash any way they can.
<LI>Wares dudes; specialising in collecting and trading in pirated
software.
</UL>

<P>
The future should bring about even more complex changes within
hacker culture. The expansion of the mind through the use of computers
is becoming more apparent than ever before. People now see computers
as an opportunity to link their ideas and interests to their imagination,
particularly with VR (virtual reality). This 'science fiction'
perspective sees the application of new technology as creating
new realms. (This aspect will be addressed later in greater detail;
see Chapter 7 on Cyberspace.)
<P>
In the 1990s, PCs are more commonplace and hackers are becoming
younger. As Bowcott and Hamilton (1990, p43) have stated, young
hackers are 'Kids with PCs no longer but hackers worth their salt
with intelligence data and a copy of the <I>Unix System V</I>book
beside them ... The development of technology has fed imaginative
minds ...'.
<P>
<B>Figure 1.1</B> indicates <I>The Development of Hacker Culture
</I>, and provides a graphical representation on the development
of the hacker culture. It presents a conceptual model of the phenomena
of the hacker culture based on the expansion of the 'areas of
interest to hackers'. This is shown in relation to a time-line
with the development of computer technology, showing the different
generations of computers, as previously mentioned. As technology
has developed, it has given birth to the phenomena of hackers.
As it continues to expand, so does the opportunity to increase
the scope of topics that are of interest to hackers. (The 'areas
of interest' to hackers are the result of previous work completed
by the author. This work consisted of a study where all the areas
of study were considered for each of the time-slots 1958, 1973,
1978 and 1994.)
<P>
The first computer crime is presented on the time-scale at 1973.
This was a fraud case in America where a computer was used illegally
to generate a large number of bogus accounts. It was considered
that the crime could not have been committed without the use of
a computer and therefore it became known as the first 'computer-crime'.
<P>
It is open to conjecture as to whether this was really 'the first
computer-crime' particularly if we consider some of the elements
that we now believe constitute a computer-crime; <I>viz</I> eavesdropping,
intrusion into computer information systems, theft of data, espionage,
sabotage, decoding of encrypted data, etc. In this light, it could
be argued that an 'acceptable' form of 'computer crime' has been
with us long before 1973.
<P>
From the 1940s to the present day, governments have used computers
for eavesdropping and code-breaking. Recently (Rhodes 1995) there
is the sanctioned use of internet by the American CIA and DIA
(Defense Intelligence Agency). So why is gaining unauthorised
entry by intelligence agencies not a crime? 1955 1960 1970 1980
1990 2000

<P>
Perhaps this is because it is not an individual <I>per se</I>,
but rather a department or organisation which has the appropriate
sanctions. This aspect will not be considered further, on the
basis that it is a nation's right to decide what is ethical and
what constitutes a crime. Therefore, given that hacking is not
necessarily 'criminal' but merely innovative, crime in this context
reflects the 'laws in force' in the countries where hackers exist.
<P>
<B>1.6.3 Hacking Defined</B>
<P>
Early descriptions of hacking are considered to be the results
of innovative enthusiastic people who explore technology. In the
1960s and 1970s they were not always linked to computers. 'Hacking
also meant anything either particularly clever or particularly
wacky, with or without a computer, as long as the manipulation
of a complex system was involved' (Hafner &amp; Markoff 1991,
p11).
<P>
In 1958 (Levy 1984) hacking was considered to be innovative and
a positive force in computing; hackers were 'heroes'. This view
has remained to some extent, as can be seen in the status given
hackers in contemporary films such as <I>War-Games</I> (1983),
<I>Prime Risk</I> (1984), <I>Sneakers</I> (1992) and more recently
<I>The Net</I> (1995). However, in the 1980s, hacking became linked
to crime (even though the first recorded incident of computer
fraud occurred in 1973, it was not linked to hacking). The press
used it to define 'password pirates and electronic burglars'.
As a result, the public's perception of hackers were no longer
seen as benign explorers, but 'malicious intruders' (Hafner &amp;
Markoff 1991, p12).
<P>
Recent statements from around the world have defined hacking as:
<P>
'to scan files containing confidential information and ex-directory
telephone numbers ... to hack into military systems, credit companies'
records and university files' (Press Association 1994, p3);
<P>
'causing losses of billions of dollars from telephone toll fraud
and theft of telephone services through company PABXs, and causing
expensive litigation in disputes between telephone companies and
their customer over who is to pay for the stolen services ...
engaging in piracy of commercial software products and computer
games causing losses on a similar scale. Credit card numbers are
stolen, traded, and used for fraudulent telemarketing purchases.'
(Parker 1993, p1);
<P>
'branching out into producing and distributing contraband literature'
(Simmonds 1993, p16);
<P>
'running-up bills worth thousands of dollars...known as phreaking
... sending codes to telephone exchanges which are recognised
as legitimate.' (Giles and Clayton 1993, p31); and
<P>
'to gain unauthorised entry ... infiltrated secret American FBI
and NASA computer data.' (Dibben 1993, p15).
<P>
All of the activities, within these recent statements, are defined
as illegal or criminal acts. Throughout the progression and development
of the hacker culture, there appears to be an underlying and increasing
fascination with 'forbidden areas' that link into the 'dark' side
of our society.
<P>
<B>1.6.4 Threat Metamorphosis and Future Threats</B>
<P>
Initially, it seems that hackers were secretly admired for their
exploits, particularly where some ingenuity was displayed at overcoming
the defences of the multi-national or government organisations.
It now seems that hackers have progressed from a 'fun' stage through
a 'nuisance' phase, a vandalism phase, and are now perhaps moving
towards the more sinister role of corporate crime and information
warfare.
<P>
A recent typical indicator of this point was the front page headlines
of the British newspaper <I>The Independent</I> on 24th November
1994 (Kelsey 1994), which read 'Revealed: how hacker penetrated
the heart of British Intelligence'. The article, which continued
on pages 2 and 3, describes how a hacker broke into British Telecom's
(BTs) main database and copied telephone numbers and addresses
of 'MI6, MI5, many secret Ministry of Defence installations and
other very sensitive information.' (telephone numbers of the royal
family, politicians, secret US installations in the UK). 'one
of the most serious breaches of national security in recent years'
The thousands of pages which were copied were then sent out on
Internet, a global network of computers, to which any one of 35
million users would 'potentially have access'. The article then
describes how it was able to verify that the information was bona
fide, and quotes one of Britain's leading computer security experts
as saying that 'it is the most serious breach of computer security
I have ever heard of.'
<P>
In this instance it is interesting to note that the article also
says 'the information was copied by the hacker without any special
technical expertise'; and from the information collected that:
<P>
'MI5 phone bills are being paid by the Home Office not the Ministry
of Defence';
<P>
One MI5 location is described as 'shoe shops' and another as 'textile
warehouse';
<P>
'The MI6 training establishment, 'school for spies' , sits next
to a pub in a nondescript building on a busy street in South London.'
<P>
One gets the feeling that again the journalist reporting this
incident is capitalising on a good story; it therefore follows
with the question, 'then just how reliable is it?'. The background
and grass-roots of this story are that a computer enthusiast (Steve
Fleming), who uses Internet, posted an electronic message (e-mail)
to other enthusiasts to confirm or deny the activities of hackers.
A hacker found lax security on British Telecom's computer system
and copied some information, sent it to Steve Fleming and another
sensational hacker story was born.
<P>
Some critical points emerge from this example:
<P>
it appears that hackers may be induced into sensationalism by
the press;
<P>
it was an easy penetration of a government computer system by
the hacker;
<P>
the hacker capitalised on lax security procedures;
<P>
the hacker does not appear to have had a more sinister motive;
<P>
the hacker is a thrill-seeker looking for a challenge, a way to
prove themselves, but never-the-less is basically 'honest';
<P>
the hacker did not 'rush in' or make an opportunist snatch at
data; this was a planned attack; and,
<P>
it seems that it was the computer enthusiast, with a link to journalism,
who conducted a crude analysis of the information received.
<P>
Further aspects dealing with these points will be covered later
in this research.
<P>
<B>1.6.5 The Players and the Hacker Domain</B>
<P>
With the increasing numbers of people who use computers, it seems
that there are a greater number that are being 'drawn' into hacking.
For this description of the flow and migration of people into
'Hackerdom' (the hacker domain), it is possible to categorise
hackers into two groups: the '<I>Malhacks'</I>, representing 'the
hackers of today' - the 'bad hackers'. These can be seen to be
distinct from the purist hackers typified by those of the 1960s
and 1970s, called the '<I>Bonhacks</I>', representing the 'good
hackers'. This conception of growth in the hacking community is
presented in the following <B>Figure 1.2</B> <I>The Growth of
Hackerdom,</I> which shows a proposal for the evolutionary lines
and migration of PC users into 'Hackerdom'.
<P>
The different thickness in arrows represents the numbers of people
involved. A thick arrow indicates <I>many</I>, a thin one <I>few
</I>. It can be seen, that since the mid 1970s, there has been
an increase in the number of PC Users, some of whom have entered
Hackerdom, with the majority of them joining the <I>Malhacks</I>and
a few becoming <I>Bonhacks</I>. This does not imply that these
groups are 'static', for it seems that there is a continual entry
and exit migration which occurs, albeit small.

<P>
&#169; N. Chantler 1995
<P>
<U><B>Figure 1.2 The Growth of Hackerdom</B></U>
<P>
Within the realm of hackers, a survey based on 284 reports of
hacking, Chantler (1993d), showed that there are three main groups
of people (<B>Figure 1.3</B>.) involved within the hacker's domain
<I>Students:; Criminals</I>; and <I>Others</I>. The <I>Students
</I>included people from primary, secondary, tertiary and other
educational environments. In the context of the survey, a <I>Criminal
</I>was identified as person who had been found guilty of 'the
crime' and who was clearly only interested in pecuniary gain.
<I>Others</I> covered a wide range of other people who were all
involved with these incidents, but were of a much smaller percentage
to be considered on their own, e.g. computer-security specialists,
information system administrators, law-enforcement personnel,
journalists and authors).
<P>
It could be argued that journalists and authors should be distinctly
identified here, for they often seem to have a high impact in
the involvement with hackers. However, because of their small
numbers they have been grouped with <I>others</I>.
<P>
<B>STUDENTS CRIMINALS</B>
<P>
<B>OTHERS</B>
<P>
<U><B>Figure 1.3. The Main Groups of People within the Hacker
Domain</B></U>
<P>
It is interesting to note that this grouping is not static. For
example, Chantler (1993d) found that students may move from within
the student 'circle' into the criminal 'circle', while others
may have a 'foot in each camp', etc.. <HR>

<P>
<U><B>Figure 1.4. Player Percentages</B></U>
<P>
The 'Player' percentages (<B>Figure 1.4</B>.) are taken from the
same source (Chantler 1993d). The survey was based on the reports
of hacking incidents and who was involved. This covered the period
from March 1991 to March 1993. It is important to appreciate that
these percentages are based only on the reported events. It must
therefore be considered that this may prevent a distorted view,
based on the idea that more is known about 'student' hacking than
is known about 'criminal' hacking.
<P>
<B>1.6.6 Implications</B>
<P>
The contemporary world is increasingly reliant computers and information
systems. It is logical to accept that with more computers, there
will be a corresponding growth in computer literacy, a continual
growth in hacker numbers and therefore a continued growth in the
threats to these systems. It would appear, based on the majority
of press reports, that students become major players in the hacker
domain; this is of concern. This is particularly so, when considering
that the majority of hackers seem to commit illegal or criminal
acts. Is this a reflection of the education that we give them?
Why do they find 'forbidden areas' of knowledge so interesting?
Do we address ethics within information-technology education?
These points, and others, are addressed within the bounds of this
research.

Quotes on the Department of Justice Web Site Hack.
</H2>
</Center>
<BR>
CNN recently aired a story on the DoJ WWW hack.

<P>Here are some quotes that are appearing across cyberspace.</P>
 
Declan McCullagh:<BR>
<P>"After all, would you trust your data to the same executive branch that can't
even keep some hackers out of their own government computers?"</P>

Glenn Hauman<BR>
<P>"The highest law-enforcement office in the land has just been shown to have a
major vulnerability in defending itself from outside attack. That the attack
appears to be not from a concerted terrorist group but whimsical pranksters is
even more embarrasing.</P>

<P>"It is the same action that news crews across the country demonstrated by
smuggling explosives onto planes in the wake of the downing of TWA 800, namely
that the emporer has a nonexistent wardrobe. If anything, this event should be
used to illustrate the DOJ has a complete lack of understanding when it comes
to the issues of the Internet. It also illustrates the need for stronger
crypto, particularly one without key escrow in the hands of the government,
which can't even protect its own computers from outside action.</P>

Frank Stuart:<BR>
<P>"The fact that even the U.S. Justice Department is unable to adequately
protect it's own site from intruders underscores the need for widely-available
strong encryption.</P>

</P>"While this is certainly a major embarrassment for the Justice Department, at
least the mandatory "key escrow" program the Clinton administration is
insisting upon has not yet been implemented; no private citizens' data appears
to have been compromised this time.</P>

<P>"It's doubtful that a new law or government bureaucracy would have prevented
this from happening but it's entirely possible that tools such as strong
encryption could have.  It's ironic that the U.S. Government is focusing on
the former while fighting use of the latter. </P>

Takedown</H2>
by Tsutomu Shimamura with John Markoff<BR>
A review by Winn Schwartau<BR></Center>

<P>Markoff is a good guy and we get along well. I know and like Tsutomu and respect his capabilities. I like thrillers. I like technical books. I looked forward to reading his book on a recent plane trip. However, "Takedown" is a 300 page tome with 280 pages of excruciatingly unnecessary minutae. Here's his story.</P>
<P></P></P>
<P>Tsutomu wants to spend the winter skiing in Tahoe.</P>
<P>His computer gets hacked. and he takes it personally.</P>
<P>He reluctantly returns to San Diego to roller blade around Miramar Lake.</P>
<P>He drives through heavy snow, eats french fries, and picks up his quasi-girl friend at San Francisco Airport after she hiked the peaks in Nepal.</P>
<P>Tsutomu eats fish tacos at Rubios.</P>
<P>He drives his Acura to his beachfront condo and plays with his home computer network to find out what the hacker did.</P>
<P>Tsutomu gets irritated he can't ski.</P>
<P>He gets hacked some more and eats healthy food while watching his computer screen.</P>
<P>He discusses his future with Julia, while erstwhile friend John Gilmore loses her to him.</P>
<P>He eats Thai food.</P>
<P>Tsutomu puts together an anti-hacker team to trace down the intruder. They write some software to do the job.</P>
<P>He eats french fries, but no burger.</P>
<P>He goes to a conference and sits in a hot tub eating.</P>
<P>Tsutomu tells us about spelunking on Princeton University campus buildings. He tells us what a smart guy he is. He disses friends and acquaintances.</P>
<P>He's very irritated he can't ski. So he skis.</P>
<P>He discover the IP Spoofing attack.</P>
<P>He helps the "We Have No Security" WELL prove they have no security.</P>
<P>One morning he wakes up with Julia.</P>
<P>Another day he didn't have time to change his lycra cross-country ski clothes.</P>
<P>He calls the FBI to aid in the Great Hacker Hunt.</P>
<P>Tsutomu and Julia eat lunch at the WELL. Mild Chinese scallops, shrimp, snow peas and kung pao chicken.</P>
<P>He writes more software to chase Mitnick. Mitnick continues to taunt Tsutomu. </P>
<P>Markoff joins the hunt. He was hacked, too.</P>
<P>Tsutomu watches Mitnick's movements on the Net and then goes to dinner with Julia at 10PM at a Mexican restaurant where Carlos Santana's father once played in a Mariachi band.</P>
<P>He disses more friends (or ex-friends)</P>
<P>He and Julia hate the Holiday Inn so they move in with Dan Farmer.</P>
<P>Julia avoids a crisis. Tsutomu hates Botony.</P>
<P>Tsutomu skates in circles while waiting for Julia at the bottom of the hill.</P>
<P>After skating, he and Julia went to Sumarai, a Japanese restaurant in Sausalito, without taking a shower.</P>
<P>The Colorado SuperNet, an ISP is apparently a victim of Mitnick as well. </P>
<P>Tsutomu says that Emmanel Goldstein and Phiber Optik live "in one of the Internet's more seedy neighborhoods." </P>
<P>Tsutomu angrily tells his loyal aid never to use the word 'assume' ever again.</P>
<P>John Gilmore invites Julia to a funky '60's style resort for the weekend. She vascillates.</P>
<P>Tsutomu puts off the Wired photographer. He eats a burrito in Julia's antique Mazda. </P>
<P>He gets funding from Netcom to pursue the hacker - allegedly Mitnick.</P>
<P>Tsutomu disses the Well. He likes the NetCom guys.</P>
<P>Oh, oh. Mitnick seems to be in Rahleigh, North Carolina.</P>
<P>Tsutomu disses GTE.</P>
<P>They do a lot of technical stuff. Step by step. He calls the intruder an "anklebiter."</P>
<P>After borrowing equipment from Sun,they all pile into a shiny blue-green Mustang to go to a brewery. Someone ate horseradish mashed potatoes.</P>
<P>Tsutomu and crew work late doing techy stuff. They nearly run out of caffeine.</P>
<P>Tsutomu titles a chapter, "You Lamers."</P>
<P>He gives Robert almost $6 for breakfast.</P>
<P>Tsutomu eavesdrops on net conversations between Mitnick and an Isreali ally. Reading other people's email is the highlight of this book.</P>
<P>Tired, Tsutomu and friends go to Hobies and eat veggie burgers and fruit smoothies.</P>
<P>They sleep in Julia's car. Sleeping bags cover them.</P>
<P>Tsutomu calls GTE engineers 'bozos.'</P>
<P>He tells us about Mitnick's upbringing and brushes with the law then he disses Mitnick's skills as a hacker.</P>
<P>Markoff joins Tsutomu to eat at Bucky's; a V.C. hangout and restaurant. He tells Tsutomu his soup is getting cold.</P>
<P>Tsutomu disses Pei of the WELL.</P>
<P>They eat at Round Table Pizza.</P>
<P>Tsutomu and telco engineers play a game of Battleship and figure Mitnick really is in Rahleigh.</P>
<P>He flies to Rahleigh in first class, and discovers someone put apples and bananas in his day pack. He wears his Birkenstock sandals to the frozen East Coast in winter. No socks either. </P>
<P>Julia almost goes to Denver instead of Rahleigh. Her weekend with John did not go well.</P>
<P>Tsutomu disses the FBI to make them look foolish.</P>
<P>On the trail of Mitnick in Rahleigh, they stop at a 7/11 for coffee.</P>
<P>They get close, but the feds play a turf game.</P>
<P>Julie shows up and wakes Tsutomu gently.</P>
<P>After a snooze, they meet Markoff at the Sheraton Restaurant. Julia eats a white-bread club sandwich. Tsutomu ate grilled cheese. Markoff ate a chicken breast sandwich.</P>
<P>Andrew nearly blows the investigation. More FBI agents arrive.</P>
<P>They eat at Ragazzi's. The bread was fresh; the salad was strictly iceburg.</P>
<P>The FBI and Markoff and Tsutomu go after Mitnick. The FBI figure out John Markoff is with the New York Times. He splits. The FBI yells at Tsutomu. "What's your agenda?" They are suspicious of his motivations.</P>
<P>While waiting for warrants for Mitnick, Julia gets hungry. She buys Subway heros for all.</P>
<P>They play more warrant games, get ready to strike, and order in Chinese food.</P>
<P>They wait. Andrew screws up again.</P>
<P>The FBI locate Mitnick using direction finders and cell phreaking. They bust in on Mitnick.</P>
<P>Mitnick vomits on his living room floor.</P>
<P>In Court, Mitnick tells Tsutomu he respects his skills.</P>
<P>Tsutomu and Julia spend the day in their hotel room.</P>
<P>They go out to dinner.</P>
<P>I think Tsutomu got the girl.</P>

<P>I just saved you $24.95</P>

<P>"Takedown," by Tsutomu Shimomura with John Markoff, 1996, Hyperion ISBN 0-7868-6210-6 $24.95</P>

The Fruit of the Poisoned Tree:</H2>
<h4>Why Criminal Hackers Must Not Be Rewarded</H4>
Mich E.  Kabay, Ph.D.
Director of Education
National Computer Security Association</Center><BR>


<P>Should criminal hackers be treated as valuable contributors to national and corporate security?</P>

<P>Absolutely not.</P>

<P>If you needed to evaluate the security of your home, which would you hire:  a burglar who claimed to be an ex-burglar or a bonded security specialist with no criminal tendencies?  The fundamental problem with hiring criminal hackers is their complete lack of credibility.  Criminal hackers believe in lying and cheating as a bedrock of their hobby; they misrepresent themselves to the security system and to the human beings they can trick into revealing privileged information.  Their credo is tainted by the video-game fallacy:  if it is possible to do something, it must be right.  Morality exists as a technical constraint:  if something is wrong, make it impossible to accomplish.</P>

<P>So if you hire a criminal hacker to review your system security, you will make him (usually him) sign a non-disclosure agreement. Right.  Criminal hackers believe that unless you can force compliance, there is no obligation to comply with agreements and rules.  I have met hackers who claim that if they can break into your house, it's OK.  The same mentality is at the basis of every criminal act:  stop me if you can.  These are people with no connection to the rest of society.  They are arrogant, twisted creeps who sneer at trust, despise agreements, and look down at honesty. They call us losers.  They describe our belief in honour as lame. And these are the people you expect will honour non-disclosure agreements?  You believe that and I'll find you a nice bridge to buy.</P>

<P>Some criminal hackers have all the hall-marks of the addict.  They spend hours--days, even--obsessively attacking systems.  They live in a subculture where dishonesty is the norm, where the rest of society is seen as lame-brain jerks who don't know enough to protect themselves.  So what makes you think that they will change?  If you pay them to hack, why would they deal honestly with you when honesty is foreign to their view of the world?  You may as well trust an unrecovered alcoholic or an active drug user. Putting confidential information within reach of a criminal hacker is like putting children within sight of a paedophile.  You'd be crazy to do it.</P>

<P>The next problem is that anyone who has been as anti-social as an expert criminal hacker is subject to blackmail.  One of the reasons no one hires convicted felons for work requiring them to be bonded by their employer is that criminals have done bad stuff--and not all of it is necessarily in the public record.  To compromise a person with a tainted background, an enemy can dig up some dirt and threaten to reveal it.  Given the moral flabbiness of criminal hackers, it's hard to imagine they'd resist pressure very well.  The same problem would arise if you were to hire drug addicts and pushers to work in anti-drug operations; or if you used car thieves to stop car theft; or if you hired embezzlers to write your accounting code.  It just doesn't make sense.</P>

<P>On a broader scale, consider the message you would be giving some thirteen year old proto-hacker.  These kids, like most kids, are tremendously susceptible to peer pressure.  They already find criminal hacking attractive because it's viewed as today's counter-culture--something fairly harmless (compared with other stuff like dealing drugs) but exciting because it's illegal.  Now imagine that the older creeps can announce that they've just been hired by The Man (i.e., authority figures) to work in counter-intelligence, snooping in foreign companies' files for money (you don't imagine they'd keep it quiet, do you?).  Oh man--not only is criminal hacking glittering with the allure of the forbidden right now, but you can hope to earn money with it from the government!  K001.</P>

<P>The children and emotionally arrested adolescents involved in criminal hacking already have a love/hate attitude towards The Man.  Many of them claim that they'd like to work for security firms when(if) they grow up.  This myth that criminal hacking is a reasonable basis for work in security would become even more pernicious if it were known that more hackers had in fact been regularly used by government or corporate organizations.  Using such people would reinforce the attractiveness of criminality.</P>

<P>Consider the outcry if the U.S. military actively solicited murderers to be soldiers.  The great challenge of military training is to temper savagery with honour; to provide a moral framework within which war is viewed as undesirable, killing as regrettable, and honesty as the bedrock of all service to the nation.  A soldier who lies is a stain on his unit's honour.  A soldier who steals is a wretch who deserves expulsion.  And a soldier who breaks his word is a traitor to his nation.  And so how shall we deal with people whose entire way of life is to lie and to steal and to cheat?</P>

<P>I say they're unfit to serve.</P>

<P>At the most fundamental level of all, the end does not justify the means.  To use criminals, to honour them, to praise them, to pay them:  this would be yet another blow against morality and decency.  And it would be a blow without even the justification of necessity.  We do not need criminal hackers.  Information security can be strengthened using the skills of honest people--hackers, if you like, not criminal hackers.  We should be encouraging children who enjoy using computers to learn more, to learn deeper.  We need school teachers who have more than a passing knowledge of the user interface; we need books for children that teach operating systems fundamentals and database theory in an enjoyable, challenging way; we need recognition of the gifted, support for the oddballs who prefer trackballs to basketballs; we need summer jobs for brilliant kids with a knack for security.</P>

<P>What we don't need is reward for dishonesty and praise for sociopathy.</P>

<P>Over two thousand years ago, Cato the Elder ended every speech--on whatever topic--with the declaration, "Ceterum, censeo Cathaginem esse delendam."  "Besides, I think Carthage must be destroyed."   Let me follow in his tradition. </P>

<P>Criminal hacking must be destroyed.</P>

<H4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<P>Computer hackers are now appearing on the front page of all major newspapers. Stories about computer intrusions are now commonplace in the newspapers, and are becoming increasingly popular in books and movies. The media portrays hackers as geniuses who can penetrate systems at will. While there are hackers who are geniuses, the majority of hackers do not fit into this category.</P>

<P>Computer hackers are wreaking havoc on computer systems that contain private and sensitive information. It appears that no system is safe from these hackers, and that individuals are at their mercy. While the public might believe that it takes a genius to attain these accomplishments, what it really takes is very persistent people with sufficient time to learn their craft. Additionally, the ranks of hackers have grown to include Organized Crime, spies, and terrorist organizations. </P>

<h4>CATEGORIES OF HACKERS</h4>

<P>Most hackers seem to fit the stereotype of a teenage to college age male that has the perseverance to sit at a computer for hours at a time. These people usually have the financial freedom to wander through computer networks, because they are in environment (i.e., a college or their parents' home) that does not require them to work. Despite the stereotype being generally true, all hackers are not alike. By all accounts, most hackers do not intend to steal or cause any harm. Unfortunately for the benevolent hackers, any computer intruder is considered to be a hacker. The term "hacker" is used within the hacker community to refer to an individual that intrudes into computer systems to learn about computer systems. Hackers do not intend to profit from their efforts, nor do they intend to do any harm. This does not mean that hackers are immune from criminal actions. In most cases, any computer intrusion is a criminal offense. Additionally, many inexperienced hackers may inadvertently damage the computer systems that they access, and as will be discussed later, they may pass on information to criminals.</P>

<P>"Cracker" is the term used for criminal hackers. These individuals do intend to use their hacker skills to profit from their efforts or to cause harm to individuals or organizations. Cracker ranks include petty criminals, loosely organized groups of criminals, major organized crime rings, the Russian Mafia, Drug Cartels, terrorists and foreign governments. These are the Information Warriors of the future. As the value of information and communications ability increases, these information warriors will become more active and pose one of the greatest threats to world prosperity and security.</P>

<P>The term "Phreaker" is used to differentiate a computer hacker from an intruder that specializes in compromising the national and international telephone systems. The activities of "phreakers" may be criminal or benign. Phreakers have previously rerouted telephone lines, sold wire taps, disconnected telephone lines, etc. They have performed these functions to elude police, steal telephone services, and for fun and profit. Many of the original hackers were phreakers, because the costs of communications services were too expensive to allow them to stay on computer systems across the nation for extended periods of time. Today, the Internet and other worldwide computer networks provide hackers with the cheap connectivity that they require. However, there are a significant number of phreakers that are still drawn to the challenge, and profit, that a successful attack on the telephone system can provide.</P>

<h4>HOW HACKERS LEARN THEIR CRAFT</h4>

<P>To non-computer professionals, hacker attacks seem to be very sophisticated, and require a very detailed knowledge of computer systems. However, most successful attacks rely upon brute force methods, such as attempting to access default accounts with default passwords. Unfortunately, the information required to attack a system is very readily available. If an attacker needs additional information, they can exploit the information they already have to attain additional information, or they may ask the targeted organization for the information.</P>

<h4>Unethical Sources</h4>

<P>There are electronic hacker gathering places on the Internet, the X.25 networks, private computer systems, etc. At these gathering places, information is exchanged about what systems have recently been compromised, along with a cookbook for how the compromise occurred. An attacker interested in a specific target can ask others how to attack the target. These gathering places maintain databases, so that the information is available for future attackers.</P>

<P>Hackers bulletin boards generally provide system documentation that includes system level accounts and default passwords, known system vulnerabilities, and a variety of other information that facilitates an attack. Bulletin boards also have a variety of tools available that also facilitate an attack. The tools, such as SATAN, provide a user friendly method for even the most inept hackers to take advantage of known vulnerabilities. Different tools have different functionality. For example, there are some tools that look for known vulnerabilities in systems and other tools that attempt to obtain a user's password.</P>

<P>While there are many people that contribute information to these gathering places, only a minority of these people intend to distribute the information for illegal purposes. There is a unique sense of morality among the hacker community. They believe that they are just searching for knowledge, which should be freely available to all. While they understand that some people may use the information for illegal purposes, they assume no responsibility for the results, but state that it is the victim's fault for letting it happen. In many cases, they might rationalize that the victim deserved to be attacked, because they treat their employees unfairly, they charge excessive prices, etc. To an outsider, it appears that majority of the hacker community has no sense of responsibility, and no understanding of the consequences of their actions.</P>

<h4>Legitimate Sources</h4>

<P>There is also extensive information about system vulnerabilities from a wide variety of legitimate sources. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), out of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Melon University, regularly informs people about security vulnerabilities, as well as the fixes, of specific system types. This information is distributed to protect systems throughout the world, unfortunately the hackers are more familiar with the information than the intended recipients. Many manufacturers publish similar information, however the hacker community is also well informed of this information and attempts to exploit the information before system administrators fix the problem. There are a wide variety of publications for computer professionals that also report vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. The primary problem associated with the legitimate reporting of system vulnerabilities is that the information reaches the attackers more efficiently than it reaches the intended audience.</P>

<P>There are many other sources of information that can be used to exploit a target. Newspapers reporting specifics about a potentail target can provide a wealth of information about their computer systems, corporate strategies, corporate executives, etc. For example, Information Week, a magazine for computer professionals, regularly details the Information Technology strategy of large organizations as a feature for its' readers. While seemingly insignificant, the articles identify the types of computer systems used, communications protocols, customer organizations, etc. There are a wide variety of information services available on the Internet that can provide an attacker with similar information. Traditionally, this type of information is referred to as Open Source Information (OSI).</P>

<h4>The Target as a Source</h4>

<P>When an attacker faces technical challenges that cannot be quickly overcome, they might contact the target to ask them for information. Public organizations will freely distribute their Annual Report, which could provide a wealth of information about corporate structure, senior executives, and information technology strategies.</P>

<P>The attacker may also utilize Social Engineering, which is the use of non-technical methods to obtain information. For example, an attacker may randomly telephone employees of a company, and through a variety of ruses, get an employee to give the attackers their passwords. While this may sound ridiculous, previous studies by the author have indicated that over 90% of employees contacted will divulge this information. Having the log in information for a valid account will render millions of dollars of information security technology useless. </P>

<P>Social Engineering can take on many forms. Attackers have resorted to methods that border on the ridiculous as well as espionage. In many cases, attackers have gone through the garbage of a targeted organization to obtain any information that they can. It was going through the garbage at the New York Telephone Company that provided phreakers with system level passwords for the national telephone system. This information allowed the phreakers to totally compromise the telephone systems. The magazine 2600: The Hackers' Quarterly, which is a publication targeting computer hackers, recently published an article on how to obtain a job as a janitor in a targeted organization. There have been many cases where attackers have obtained jobs as janitors, security guards, programmers, etc., so that they may obtain insider information on how to break into computer systems. The payback is exceptionally high if the intention is theft of funds. Many people would not think twice about taking a job as a janitor for minimum wage, if they could steal millions of dollars several months later. Besides of funds, attackers have acquired a variety of sensitive company data that can cripple a company. The sensitive data could include customer lists, employee information, executive travel plans, strategic marketing plans, etc. This is information is given out by employees attempting to be helpful to someone that apparently has a need for the information. Poor security procedures allow Social Engineering attacks to flourish.</P>

<P>Due to the potential profit of a successful computer intrusion, it is very possible that an attacker may resort to physical break ins to obtain information. Lapses in physical security can provide attackers with a unique opportunity to obtain information. Additionally, attackers may attempt to recruit current employees of an organization to assist in computer related thefts. Many companies have offices throughout the world, in many areas that do not think well of foreign corporations. Additionally, an attacker will offer a potential recruit much more money than they will ever make under the employ of the company. Financial incentive, coupled with a poor loyalty to the employer leaves many people susceptible to recruitment. It must also be considered that attackers have compromised credit reporting agencies. Attackers are able to select the recruits that are having financial difficulties, and who are more likely to welcome a new income opportunity.</P>

<P>There are thousands of sensitive documents throughout all organizations. Unless these documents are securely controlled 24 hours a day, and are properly destroyed, it is very likely that some of the documents will fall into the hands of attackers.</P>

<P>After a hacker has achieved an initial foothold inside the target's computer systems, an attacker may use tools that are commonly available from other attackers to obtain more information from the systems. For example, initial attacks into a company's computer system may provide hackers a small but insignificant foothold on the systems. The hackers can then install a sniffer that allows them to monitor system users' keystrokes. It is likely that the information learned from the sniffer will allow the hackers virtually unlimited access to the computer systems compromised.</P>

<h4>HACKER MORALITY</h4>

<P>As previously discussed, hackers do not believe that their computer intrusions are wrong. Even a U.S. Senator, Patrick Leahy, implied that hackers should be allowed to explore so that they may learn. To understand these beliefs, you must understand how people learn what is right and what is wrong.</P>

<P>Usually people learn what is right and wrong from their parents. They are told not to steal and not to do drugs. Parents usually do not tell their children that it is wrong to break into NORAD computer systems and start a nuclear war, nor do parents tell their children that breaking into a computer system is as bad as breaking into someone's home. Parents do not consider talking to their children about these things, because they never thought their children could do these things.</P>

<P>This leaves morality to be learned on the streets, or in this case, cyberspace. Hackers learn morality from other hackers, who learn it from other hackers. A morality of this type only perpetuates the morals that best suit the participants. It would be as difficult to convince a hacker that computer intrusions are wrong, as it would be to convince a minister that his/her religion is wrong.</P>

<P>From an outsider's viewpoint, it appears that a traditional hacker's fundamental beliefs include: 
<UL>
<LI> hackers have a right to "explore" all computer systems that they can compromise, 
<LI> hackers have a right to attempt to compromise any computer system, 
<LI> anyone that would try to prevent them from breaking into computer systems is compromising their First Amendment rights, 
<LI> hackers should share information about computer intrusions with anyone except people that would try to stop the intrusions, and 
<LI> hackers should not steal nor cause harm. <BR></UL>

Unfortunately, there are other groups of hackers that would also contend: 
<UL>
<LI> hackers must take revenge on anyone that would try to stop them, 
<LI> it is acceptable to steal or cause harm if the victim has done something that they believe to be wrong, and 
<LI>it is acceptable to steal if the theft supports a hacker's ability to hack. <BR></UL>

While traditional hackers would frown upon these opinions, they will not take actions against anyone performing malicious actions. This implies that hackers are not self policing, which harms the image of the majority of hackers and has created an outcry from the general public that something must be done to crackdown on all hackers.</P>

<P>It is extremely difficult to distinguish a well meaning hacker from a malicious one. Unfortunately, they both present a danger to any computer system. If a non-malicious hacker successfully compromises a computer system, hacker protocol and pride dictates that they must tell another hacker how they accomplished the intrusion. The information generally proliferates throughout the hacker community, and eventually falls into the wrong hands. Many hackers say that they are necessary in cyberspace, because they help to identify vulnerabilities. However, there have not been any documented cases of a hacker contacting a Systems Administrator to tell the administrator how they compromised the system. </P>

<h4>THE FUTURE INFORMATION WARRIORS</h4>

<P>The traditional criminal elements are now beginning to realize and exploit the potential financial and political gain associated with computer crimes. Criminal organizations are hiring many experienced hackers to attack very well capitalized commercial firms. In many cases, they enlist the help of naive hackers to help them obtain information the electronic exchange of information allows anonymity for the criminal elements, and the ill-informed hackers are duped into providing information to criminals.</P>

<P>Hacker knowledge may not just come from the traditional hackers. The collapse of the Soviet Union has left many extremely talented computer and communications professionals out of work and penniless. When the former Soviet Union collapsed, the funding for many technology-based programs was lost. Hard working, well meaning people were without jobs, and were forced to take jobs outside of their trained professions. These people are very easily recruited by Organized Crime and terrorist elements. In many cases, they are facing the same traditional enemy, except now they are being paid better. These people represent a tremendous threat, because now their missions are not as focused and they work for less disciplined employers with potentially erratic motives.</P>

<P>Intelligence agents from the former Soviet Block are also going to new employers. These people are extremely well trained in electronic intrusion techniques, and can be expected to find new jobs working for criminal organizations or foreign governments. Former Soviet agents have advertised their services in a variety of publications throughout Europe.</P>

<P>Even friendly governments have acknowledged and established efforts that target U.S. based computer systems to gather economic intelligence. Countries that have acknowledged support for hacker efforts include Germany, France and Japan. These countries clearly target U.S. corporations and probably target the U.S. Government. Economic losses to U.S. corporations are estimated to be in excess of $1,000,000,000 annually.</P>

<h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4>

<P>The hacker community is a very diverse group that shares a common interest in exploring computer systems throughout the world. These people also share the knowledge of where to go to give and get information on vulnerable computer systems. It is this information that presents what could be considered the most ominous emerging threat to U.S. security and prosperity. The information is available to anyone in cyberspace that is believed to be a real hacker. </P>

<P>It is the indiscriminate exchange of information that is cause for concern. The information is available not only to non-malicious hackers, but to all types of criminals and foreign governments. While the criminal elements provide an obviously direct threat to computer systems, it is the non-malicious hackers that are usually the most aggressively pursued. The criminals tend to attack known vulnerabilities, while the non-malicious intruders desire the challenge of finding new vulnerabilities. The new vulnerabilities tend to be readily shared with the hacker community as a whole. The non-malicious intruders find the keys that are used by the criminals to open the doors. Until the indiscriminate exchange of information is halted, all intrusion attempts represent a possible criminal action that must be handled appropriately.</P>

<P>The traditional hackers, who represent the first generation of Information Warriors, are now being joined by a new group of people that are actually interested in Information Warfare. Organized Crime is realizing that not only can they profit from criminal cyber activities, the can extort money and retaliate against their enemies using Information Warfare. Terrorists are learning that destroying information targets can be more devastating than destroying physical targets. Foreign companies know that acquiring specific information can give them a tremendous competitive advantage. National governments are researching how they can cripple an enemy through Information Warfare alone. The traditional hackers have identified and scouted out a new battlefield, and the implications of their activities have become enormous.</P>

<P>All right.  Well go ahead and test it.  Thanks a lot for  your help.</P>
<P>All right man.</P>
<P>Bye Bye.</P>


<H4>Example #3</H4>
<P>This is (name blanked).  Can I have your area code and telephone number please?</P>
<P>Hi Steve.  How ya doin? </P>
<P>Good.</P>
<P> This is Ron Contour over at Sprint Social Engineering.  How ya doin?</P>
<P>Good Ron.</P>
<P>Hey.  Is CIS up for you guys over there?</P>
<P>It is.</P>
<P>All right.  Ah... Oh no.... I think its coming up now over here.</P>
<P>Were you all down? Or..</P>
<P>Well, it was down over here.</P>
<P>Ah..... actually its coming up so I wont even waste your time.  I am going to go ahead an do this myself. Thanks anyway.</P>
<P>Weve had a good day with CIS though ..</P>
<P>Oh- have you.</P>
<P>Yeh.. today.</P>
<P>No way!</P>
<P>Well, yesterday was our bad day.</P>
<P>Actually man.....its not even coming up over here.  Ah.  Ok.   It looks like youll have to help me out anyway.</P>
<P>What ya got?</P>
<P>I got an account number here.  I just need to see if you ah...show it in the system or not.</P>
<P>OK.</P>
<P>OK.  What I actually   Acutally, What I  need here first cause I tried to do this yesterday and wasnt able to.  Couldnt find information.</P>
<P>OK</P>
<P>Do you have the number for the CNA that handles area code 313?</P>
<P>Let me get it.</P>
<P>All right.</P>
<P>Also, we have been having problems with data loss between CIS and the switch which likes really sucks.</P>
<P>Dont tell me those things....(jokingly)  I dont want to hear those problems.</P>
<P>(Both men begin laughing.)</P>
<P>Ah...The 313 in Michigan is CNA #810-424-30900.  </P>
<P>All righty....and the pin set?</P>
<P>Is 61-314.</P>
<P>PIN. What does PIN stand for?</P>
<P>Personal Identification Number.</P>
<P>Is that like private?  I dont really know.</P>
<P>Anyway, weve been having problems with data loss between CIS and the switch.</P>
<P>Ok.</P>
<P>And uh....what I need you to do is to log totally out of CIS...</P>
<P>Ok.</P>
<P>and then log back in.</P>
<P>Ok.</P>
<P>Ah... like totally out.</P>
<P>And then as you log it in, say each key as you hit it so  we can check for the ADs.</P>
<P>Ok.</P>
<P>And then let me know at what point you get out.</P>
<P>Ok.</P>
<P>I sign out of every session, right?</P>
<P>All right.  Right.</P>
<P>Ya... you see sometimes what happens a lot of times, CIS messes up when it like sends data to the switch and then someone will process phone card stuff, and the call, like they might cancel a card and the call, the switch will still put the calls  through.  We definitely do not want that happening.</P>
<P>(Sound of computer keys clicking in the background)</P>
<P>You out?</P>
<P>Ah... one more screen.</P>
<P>All right.</P>
<P>Hold on one second.....(Yells to man in background). Yes Scott, check that third trunk.  Yeh.  Its circuit ID Q3X..Right?</P>
<P>Im ready.</P>
<P>Ok.  Go ahead log back in but type slowly and say each key you hit as you hit it.</P>
<P>OK.</P>


<H4>Example #4</H4>
<P>This is  (name blanked)....may I have your area code and telephone number please?</P>
<P>Hey.........  This is Troy Corbett over at US Sprint Systems Maintenance. How ya doing?</P>
<P>Im good. </P>
<P>Ah..  need you log out of CIS and then then log right back in.</P>
<P>OK.  (Laughs)   Is there something wrong with my computer?</P>
<P>Ya... Well we think there is something wrong with the whole system so we need to check.</P>
<P>OK.  So you need me to log out of CIS...just my A frame and my E frame?</P>
<P>Thats fine.</P>
<P>Ok.  And then log back in?</P>
<P>Ummmm  but let me know when your out though.</P>
<P>Ok.  You want me to do it as we speak?</P>
<P>Please.</P>
<P>Ok.</P>

<P>Ok.  I am logged out of A.   And Im going to my E frame.</P>
<P>Ok.</P>
<P>And Im logged off E.</P>
<P>All right.</P>
<P>Ok...now I need you to log back in.  But ah do it slowly and as you do, say each key you hit before you hit so we can see that the data is passing correctly.</P>
<P>Ok.  Say that again.  As each ...Say that again..</P>
<P>Say each key ya hit right before you hit it so that we know you are hitting the key.</P>
<P>M-E-N-U   Enter</P>
<P>1 Enter  </P>
<P>Hmm</P>

<P>All right.</P>
<P>Enter,  N-A-C-L  Enter  and P-S-2.</P>
<P>All right.</P>
<P>And  CASC ... go to the main frame, and  I am in on my A screen.  I am in.</P>
<P>OK.  Ah..I dont think  hmm. .hold on..  (speaks to background).. did you guys see any data loss?</P>
<P>Hmmm.  It looks like were doing ok.   They got you guys sing your first name as passwords there?</P>
<P>No....everybody uses different ones.</P>
<P>Oh well.  Ok....You might want to change it but I guess no one is going to have access anyway.  So it really doesnt matter.  </P>
<P>I dont think they will.....</P>
<P>Ok Felecia.   How ya doing tonight?</P>
<P>Well, the calls are coming in kinda fast.  Ya think you could slow those down?</P>
<P>Ha  Ha.   I wish....  How was your Holloween? </P>

<P>Although many concepts of the information warfare (IW) are known in many
commercial enterprises and in their MIS departments, most corporations and
their information personnel are still quite unfamiliar with the terminology
and most fundamental concepts of the information warfare and its
applications in commercial enterprises and business activities. The quality,
accuracy, reliability and timeliness of the information and any related
analysis have become increasingly important in the dynamic and fast changing
global business environment. The protection of this valuable and often
costly asset have become very important for most companies, CEOs, MIS
personnel and information security specialists. The purpose of this brief
newsletter is to bring up some important issues and concepts of the IW and
some basic elements of information protection systems and methods to
minimize negative impacts of the IW on the company's information assets.

<P>The information warfare can be used as an integral element of any strategy
to influence the market place, competitors, customers, general public and
suppliers to achieve the business objectives. Basic concepts of the IW may
include 1. the distribution and dissemination of the disinformation and
misinformation, 2. the destruction or modification of some key information,
3. unauthorized uses or theft of the valuable data and information and 4.
the penetration of competitors' or other opponents' information systems and
databases. The intent of the IW is often to penetrate the company's
information processing systems and to influence key decision making
processes in ways that are beneficial for an organization that is organizing
the IW campaign against another organization. The methods of the IW may also
include many traditional problem solving methods such as law suits or
lengthy arbitration processes to delay R&D projects or other development
activities. No matter what techniques and methods are chosen for the IW, it
is important that these methods are integrated into the company's tactical
and strategic communication processes to implement effectively the company's
business strategies and tactics.

<P>The information and communication processes have become increasingly
important and critical for any international business. In addition,
processes and systems that show how the information is used and processed
have become more complex and dependent upon advanced technologies that
provide many efficient ways for decision makers to obtain and process the
quality information and then make accurate and reliable decisions on
specific business matters. This reliance on the information and related
processes has also created new threats for many organizations globally.
International businesses can use some elements of the IW against their
competitors, competitor's suppliers or other related organizations and
individuals. These IW attacks may establish new barriers for market entry,
limit the accurate and quality information that is available for individual
decision makers about some market place and specific industries and cause
other harmful impacts on these international businesses such as the misuse
of corporate financial resources and assets. In addition, some international
organizations may operate together with governmental agencies to collect the
information and to initiate programs and activities to destruct or steal the
information assets, destruct decision making processes or other analytical
processes resulting in ill-advised and incomplete decisions and business
activities. 

<P>It shall be important for any organizations to implement management systems
and techniques to prevent any harmful impacts from the hostile IW attacks.
These systems may include various strategic and risk management systems such
as the Information Security Systems (ISS), Business Intelligence Systems
(BIS), Quality and Environmental Management Systems (Q&EMS), specific
Internal and External Communication Systems, Legal Management Systems and
many others. In most of these systems, the assigned Management
Representative and/or Officer is responsible for ensuring that the system is
established, implemented and maintained. Specific procedures and
instructions shall be developed and implemented for specific elements of the
systems and the effectiveness of these systems should be reviewed
periodically by the executive management and if necessary, additional
improvements can be initiated to improve the effectiveness and performance
of the system. The scope of some systems can be broader than others and they
may be integral elements of other strategic management systems. For example,
some elements of the ISS such as tape backups and the information
classification can be a part of the Quality Management System to prevent the
accidental or intended unauthorized deletion, destruction or modification of
the quality data and information. These systems should be integrated into
one strategic management system to collect, obtain, analyze, disseminate and
protect the key information and intelligence and then to make sound and
quality decisions on various business, market and competitiveness related
issues. In addition, encryption, cryptography and other information
protection applications can be used to prevent any unauthorized monitoring
and eavesdropping and protect the information and intelligence during its
communication and delivery processes from its generators to its receivers.

<P>How would the IW attack affect your organization, if this attack would
destroy the major portion of your key business information or if it would
delay the availability of this information for several months? Would you be
prepared to lose millions of dollars, when your decisions are based on the
disinformation or other harmful influences? These are the questions that
every international business should be concerned about and evaluate serious
applications and techniques on how to prevent and minimize impacts of these
IW attacks or influences. CEOs and lead MIS personnel should assess their
organizational environment and specific threats from competitors or from
other market place players. The defensive IW strategy should be integrated
into an overall business strategy by the top executives to maintain and
improve the company's competitiveness in the market place and to ensure fair
and unharmed commercial trade practices. The strategic management systems
can be established and implemented to ensure the protection, reliability,
accuracy and quality of the business information and to minimize actual and
potential risks. It shall be important for any international organization to
use the defensive IW against any hostile and harmful competitors or other
organizations and agencies. 

<P>To obtain additional information about some strategic management systems
that were addressed and discussed in this article, please, send your email

<P><B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>Today, despite the end of the Cold War, there continues to be no shortage
of threats to stability and security across the globe. A consensus is
forming which defines many aspects of these emerging threats. The most
obvious thing about the entire gamut of threats is that many of them are
essentially stateless in origin and devolutionary in nature. Many of these
current threats are smaller in scale, befitting actions originating at the
lower end of the spectrum of conflict championed by stateless actors.

<P>Martin Van Creveld in his seminal work, "The Transformation of War",
contends we are seeing the end of a monopoly on violence by larger nation-
states. This monopoly is being replaced by a panorama of stateless actors
responsible for threats to our security.

<P>The stateless actors largely responsible for these threats might represent
a relatively wide-spread movement with global reach and significant
resources though with no single identifiable nation-state or government
to support them. They might be an isolated small group with few resources
save the willingness to inflict damage, injury or death in the name of a
cause or for criminal gain. Witness the activities of international gangs.
Finally, the threat from rogue states is onerous as well.

<P>Central Intelligence Agency Director, John Deutch while recently
addressing Congress notes the recent proliferation of biological,
chemical, and nuclear weapons is accentuated by the growing danger
posed by so called rogue states like Iran, Iraq, and Syria. All seeking
to acquire weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

<P>One of the most important things to keep in mind is that we shouldn't go
overboard on hysteria and fear mongering in the face of all this. The
horrors implicit in various emerging threats are, unfortunately, relatively
easy to perpetrate and, if attempted, likely to capture the attention of
the media.  If proof of that statement is needed, observe the surprising
number of journalists in the past few months who have taken it upon
themselves to 'test' the security of various airports by wandering
into off-limits areas unchallenged, secreting fake bombs or smuggling
fake weapons into controlled areas or even aboard aircraft.

<P>All these escapades have been carried out against a backdrop of terrorism
theories surrounding the recent downing of aircraft and bombings both home
and abroad. 

<P>Let's face it, if someone seriously desired to perpetrate terrorist acts,
the newspapers would be full of headlines of such horrors every day. Due
care and vigilance is indeed necessary to prevent the most common acts,
and alert security personnel and modern equipment and security techniques
foil a significant number of would-be terrorists every year.

<P>Even so, we cannot afford to be complacent about existence of an emerging
threats. Going on a permanent war footing both at home and abroad is
hardly a reasonable response. Calm, cool, reasoned evaluation, threat
assessment and planning are in order here. Over reliance on technology
is not a prudent response either, as reflected by General Krulak's remarks
in Defense News (7 Oct). The human factor- supplemented with good planning,
training, and useful equipment- is the most likely counter to these
emerging threats.

<P>It seems reasonable to assume that if the emerging threats are
devolutionary, the only successful responses will be devolutionary
in nature as well. The ability to identify, anticipate and cope with
emerging threats will have to be moved downward to the level at which
initial contact with the threat is likely to present itself. Infrastructures
allowing an escalating ability to respond rapidly to isolated incidents of
any sort which may be quite serious will have to be developed or refined
as necessary.

<P><B>DOMESTIC ISSUES</B>
<P>Many small town fire departments, as well as some Guard and reserve units,
with their 'mutual aid' response agreements and compacts, demonstrate a
good example of the basic concept. Escalating capabilities that allow a response 
to contact and expand as needed should be developed and made accessible
in both civil and military areas.

<P>Domestically the areas of civil utility systems (water, power,
transportation etc.), financial institutions, population centers
and other vulnerable areas require threat assessment and response
planning. Law enforcement, fire/rescue, Guard/Reserve as well as
other governmental and non-governmental assets must anticipate and
prepare to cope with new threats and different responsibilities involving
a variety of contingencies perhaps involving biochemical, nuclear, and
conventional EOD incidents along with evacuation operations.

<P>Flexible, multitiered response plans to a variety of contingencies must
be developed, enhanced, coordinated and simulated. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) is the logical federal lead agency to drive this
planning, working down through state government to the level of local
governments. Again, small town fire departments, with their 'mutual aid'
response agreements, demonstrate a good example of the basic concept.
Escalating capabilities that can contact and/or expand to meet the situation
must be planned for and executed when needed.

<P>The capabilities in areas of selected types of domestic emergency responses
such as SWAT, hostage rescue, medical rescue disaster and firefighting have
received more emphasis in most localities and infrastructure exists which
allows escalating levels of response to meet various levels of need for
incident response and management. That capability should be expanded and
broadened to include emerging threats as well.

<P>Attempting to centralize public safety and RC/Guard capability to respond
to threats or attacks will likely result only in extended response times,
inadequate response to multiple incidents and the creation of yet another
inviting target. Plans for various biochem and emerging domestic
contingencies should be developed and domestic contingencies exercised
to surface planning shortfalls and familiarize various agencies with
unforeseen demands arising from the necessity of working together
in major domestic emergencies.

<P>Assuming at face value that in many domestic emergencies "only the
military can handle that "it's too big a problem for the civilian
sector" is not prudent. If that's the case, we need to train and
develop the capability in the civilian sector where it can handle
most domestic incidents.

<P>"All of this points out the need for immediate funding of new and
different kind of training and equipment for local Police/Fire/EMS
personnel," comments Clark Staten of the Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI). 
"They are the front-line
of defense if the unthinkable happens...and some fanatic were to
attack our country with these weapons of mass destruction (WMD),"
he added. "Bottom-line... we need to develop an totally integrated
response against terrorists and terrorism...this must include local
emergency agencies, the military, and the medical  research community...
if we are to be truly prepared for the threat of a chemical or biological
attack," Staten concluded.

<P>If effective integrated response and recovery abilities are to be made
possible, they will have to be created at the local and state level in a
building- block approach. The beginnings of the training infra-structures
are already in place with Reserve and Guard units located all across the
country. Nevertheless, more work is needed to coordinate and field
capabilities that may prove necessary.  OSD can play a significant
role in the coordination and facilitation of this effort. However,
response and execution must remain at the local level.

<P>One of the areas where there needs a great deal of legal and operational
thought with respect to identifying emerging threats is the thinning line
between police and military activities domestically in combating these
threats.

<P>The use  of military forces in any continuing capacity within the borders
of this country raises questions. If additional civil manpower, training
or equipment is needed, means should be found to provide. Paul Anderson,
ENN Associate Editor, suggests expert help that local agencies would need
must come from the Center For Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, the U.S
Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at
Ft. Derrick, Maryland, or a new specially trained team of U.S. Marines
called the Chemical/Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF). Unfortunately,
it might be several hours before these highly trained specialists could arrive on
the scene of the incident. In the mean time, local fire, EMS, and law enforcement
agencies would be responsible for the management of the emergency.

<P>Nevertheless, if additional manpower, training or equipment is needed for
domestic emergencies, means should be found to provide it, to include
planning and coordinating with Navy, Marine, Reserve Components and Guard 
forces in appropriate roles. Likewise, the collection and analysis of domestic
intelligence to thwart domestic terrorism must be conducted responsibly
to avoid abuses of civil liberties and privacy.

<P><B>FORCE PROTECTION</B>
<P>Today the threat of domestic terrorism is fueled by the threat of terrorism
overseas. Deployed DoD personnel are increasingly inviting targets and must
be secured as well. In the wake of the terrorist attack at the air base
in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon is undertaking initiatives to
provide quick and effective response to protect DoD personnel around
the globe. New policy avenues must be explored to allow a more adequate
range of responses to threats from beyond our shores.

<P>A good deal of work has gone into this area already and some successes
have resulted. Cooperation between military assets and civil law
enforcement overseas has been heightened in order to better confront
the threat.  Increased military emphasis on conflict at the lower end
of the spectrum is necessary to more ably cope with emerging threats,
and has yet to be adequately emphasized. This often means people intensive
efforts (HUMINT, patrols, infiltration, psyops, civil affairs, security
details) not high technology per se is required to address some of the
emerging threats sponsored by stateless actors.

<P>Many difficult policy decisions will have to be made by the OSD leadership
before putting military personnel in harm's way again in the future. Factors
too numerous to discuss here enter into those decisions. Military personnel
thrust into many of the scenarios envisioned by the theoreticians and
associated with emerging threats will need different equipment, training
and support in addition to that which is currently in place.

<P><B>SUMMARY</B>
<P>The solutions to the problem of protecting ourselves and our society from
emerging WMD threats will be complex and demanding. We think that is one
of the few certainties in the whole equation of the emerging threat.

<P>A great deal of effort will have to be focused on understanding the origin
of these emerging  threats and of negating them without violence wherever
and whenever possible. Discovering the existence of real threats is
necessary but essential privacy and other such civil liberties must
not be sacrificed in the attempt. Likewise we cannot afford to run
roughshod over other nations abroad.

<P>At some times and in some circumstances happier solutions will not be
possible and violence will have to be met with violence. When that is
the case it must be applied within the bounds of legitimate use-of-force
doctrine, with civil law enforcement officers and military personnel
subject to strict accountability.

<P>We understand clearly that this is a very tall order. Yet to fail in the
direction of over control and invasiveness will certainly cause larger
problems and more surely damage our society as we know it than any possible
amount of terrorism.

<P>The causes that brought these emerging threats to the forefront took a
long time to develop. They will take an even longer time to solve as well.

<P>Thank you to ENN for permission to share this.</P>

November 26 1996<BR>
<P>The world is moving toward new warfighting paradigms, and the electromagnetic spectrum holds the key to DoD's successful use of technological advantages of today and tomorrow. 

<P>Volume 11, Number 83


<P>Prepared remarks by Emmett Paige Jr., assistant secretary of defense for command,control, communications and intelligence, to the Armed Forces Communications Electronics Association Spectrum Management Symposium, Washington, July 10, 1996.


<P>The focus of my remarks today is on the radio frequency, or RF, portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. I will touch on some of the characteristics of the spectrum, review its importance to the DoD and outline how the DoD's experience and expertise in using the electromagnetic spectrum efficiently can point the way towards technical approaches that will ensure adequate spectrum
access for both the private sector and the public sector of our society.

<P>My objective today is to leave no doubt whatsoever about the importance of the spectrum to defense and national security.

<P>I am not here to sell you some wolf tickets, but to give you the facts from the [perspective] of the person in DoD who has the charter responsibility. 

<P>Let's begin with some of the unique characteristics of the electromagnetic spectrum. We human beings cannot perceive it --- we cannot see it, taste it, hear it, smell it or feel it. Yet our everyday lives are tremendously affected by our use of the spectrum.

<P>I'm talking about television, cellular telephones, weather satellites, cruise missiles, microwave ovens, the air traffic control system, police radars, tornado tracking Doppler radars, MRIs [magnetic resonance images], baby monitors, command and control systems, car radios, pagers and reconnaissance/strike systems.

<P>Through our toolmaking creativity, we have taken an intangible resource, the electromagnetic spectrum, and developed systems and devices that have immense tangible impact on our society and our national security. We may not be able see the RF spectrum, but we can see its utility. It is intangible, but it has immense value. Today, that value is measured not only in what we can do with
the spectrum, but also in monetary value of that utility, both in terms of revenues for the U.S. Treasury and the market place value of spectrum use licenses.

<P>This intangible but immensely useful resource, the electromagnetic spectrum, has another key characteristic -- it is finite. We have today all the spectrum we are ever going to have. But because of its immense utility, our use of the spectrum is growing every day, and by "our" I mean everybody: the private sector; local, state and federal government; domestic and international alike.

<P>This seeming paradox -- ever greater use of a finite resource -- is made possible by our technological advances. We are able to exploit the spectrum wisely and ever more efficiently. Through technological advances, such as the digital communications techniques initially developed by the military, we as a society are able to do more with the same amount of spectrum. It is this technology-enabled increase in efficient use of the spectrum that has enabled humankind to wring
ever increasing usage out of the finite electromagnetic spectrum. So let there be no doubt that the spectrum is an intangible and finite resource of ever increasing utility and ever increasing value to all of us. I am convinced that we still have a lot to learn and a long way to go in terms of getting more effective and more efficient use of the overall spectrum.

<P>We in the Department of Defense and the intelligence community fully understand the ever increasing utility and ever increasing value of the electromagnetic spectrum. The DoD's needs are increasing too. Our tasks for the nation have become more challenging since the end of the Cold War, for we are being called upon to do more things in more places than ever before. Right now,
the department has efforts under way across the breadth of the world, involving peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, disaster relief, counterterrorism, counternarcotics, counterproliferation, regional security and the protection of U.S. citizens. All of this is occurring while we are also maintaining our readiness to fight two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts and continuing our deterrence of
nuclear conflict. 

<P>These diverse and far-flung activities share at least two common features: First, they are being accomplished in defense of our nation and its citizens; second, they cannot be accomplished without use of the electromagnetic spectrum. That's a hard, cold fact that everyone must face up to. We are not "blowing smoke."

<P>As our use of technology has advanced, enabling us to have greater impact with fewer forces, our dependence on the electromagnetic spectrum has increased.

<P>Our military, just like much of our modern society, simply cannot function without adequate access to the electromagnetic spectrum. What does loss of spectrum access mean to our nation's military capability? 

<P>Essentially, the impact of diminished spectrum access will be a reduction in the effectiveness and overall capability of our military forces. It will impact our capacity to efficiently execute our mission. Losing spectrum is like losing any other resource, it costs. 

<P>Less spectrum access yields an increased expenditure of time, funds and other resources to develop, test and field alternative capabilities or work-arounds that in many cases will be less effective than the capabilities they replace. 

<P>Less spectrum access yields a degradation of military readiness while alternative capabilities are developed and due to more complicated training requirements. Each work-around is one more thing our young people must learn and remember, perhaps while under fire. Each time we are forced to "adjust" training in the United States away from operational norms to accommodate domestic spectrum constraints, our training realism and hence training effectiveness suffers.

<P>Loss of spectrum access forces us to expend other resources to compensate or make expenditures that do not advance our capabilities.

<P>The issue of spectrum stress is as great at home as it is with our deployed forces. With our permanent overseas presence significantly reduced, 85 percent of our forces train and exercise in the continental United States. If we cannot train as we fight, no matter how advanced our equipment may be, there can be little doctrinal development or organizational changes, and in the mind of the warrior, no confidence [in] the use of those advanced systems. As a result, our great
technological advantage is squandered.

<P>The reallocation of government spectrum executed over the past decade and the upcoming reallocation of spectrum associated with Title IV of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 are already forcing DoD to re-engineer or replace equipment that is still effective and long before the end of its planned life cycle. 

<P>From my perspective, the DoD and the nation are losing in two ways: the cost in lost military effectiveness and the financial cost of re-engineering, redesign or replacing existing systems. The ability of our target acquisition radars, remotely piloted vehicles, missile systems, shipboard air traffic control radars, long-range air surveillance radars and tactical radio relay to perform as
intended in both peacetime and conflict is being directly affected. Further, we have not yet felt the impact of the 235 MHz [megahertz] reallocation of Title IV as those frequencies are not yet being used by the private sector. The department is concerned that even more reallocation and system relocation will be demanded before the impact of the 235 MHz reallocation of Title VI has been
realized. We are concerned that decisions will be made without adequate consideration of impact on military capability and of the cost to relocate systems. I have the feeling that there are many folks on the [Capitol] Hill and in this country that do not care or at least do not believe us when we tell them that their military forces will be impacted.

<P>The department fears the spectrum upon which our ability to execute national security missions depends will be reduced to the vanishing point; reduced to the point that we cross the threshold being unable to provide adequate support to our young men and women in the field and the units to which they are assigned. A hasty decision to reallocate government spectrum will be costly for the
department -- costly financially, costly in readiness and costly in our ability to defend the nation.

<P>There are some, not realizing these costs, who have suggested that we in the military just move our systems to "some other" frequency bands or replace existing systems with new ones using other bands of frequencies, but they are not the same folks who authorize and appropriate funds to DoD.

<P>I submit that there are factors in addition to cost that must be considered. First, in some cases we use the bands we do because they are the frequencies that work for the purpose at hand. The physics of radio wave propagation is not something we can change. In other cases, our use of the spectrum is bound by international agreements since DoD operations are conducted worldwide.
Relocation of systems is not trivial because each piece of equipment interacts with many others. Relocation and adjustment can have a domino effect. Changes in any single part of the system can force changes in other parts of the integrated military system. Then there is the cost factor. Changing the operating frequency of a piece of equipment is a re-engineering effort; replacing
perfectly effective equipment just to effect a frequency change is costly. This is particularly difficult in an era of declining budgets. Lastly, the spectrum we move to often is less optimal for the functions concerned that the spectrum we leave. Hence, not only do we spend more, we get less. 

<P>There are some who accuse DoD of hoarding spectrum. This simply is not true. In the first place, DoD owns no spectrum. We are permitted access to specific bands of frequencies by joint agreement with NTIA [National Telecommunications Information Administration] and the FCC
[Federal Communications Commission]. Overseas, we have similar agreements with each host nation within whose borders we operate. In the United States our frequency assignments are approved by NTIA. DoD has access to spectrum, we do not own it. Today, in the most desirable bands of frequency below three GHz [gigahertz], 30 percent of the frequencies are reserved for the
exclusive use of the private sector. The private sector and the federal government share access to 56 percent of the frequencies. Thus, only 14 percent of the frequencies below three GHz are reserved for federal use. Over 86 percent of this valuable part of the RF spectrum is today available to the private sector, and that percentage will increase when the provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 come into effect.

<P>The need to review spectrum usage, to clearly articulate requirements and identify opportunities for sharing does not fall upon the DoD and other federal users alone, but also upon all users of the spectrum in the United States. Spectrum sharing is a way to satisfy the growing demands, both private and government, for this finite and increasingly important resource. We know this can be
done because the Department of Defense does it daily. Our definition of sharing is using technology and coordination to enable disparate users to exploit the same spectrum; multiple users of the same frequencies whose individual uses are technically compatible; multiple reuse of the same frequencies
through physical separation of users. We develop and implement technical spectrum sharing criteria among the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. There has never been an abundance spectrum. We have never been able to give each individual system or individual user the luxury of their own unshared frequency bands. We carefully examine the functions to be performed. We
separate the high-powered or highly critical spectrum uses from other uses to prevent interference. We collocate compatible uses. We engineer our systems to operate compatibly -- tolerant of other uses in the same or nearby bands. We also employ dynamic management to maximize frequency reuse to meet our extensive requirements. To meet emerging military and intelligence data transfer
requirements, which are expected to exceed multigigabits of information, demands effective spectrum utilization on our part. We know that sharing of spectrum works because we do it every day throughout the world. Outside of the DoD in contrast, sharing often means highly inefficient band segmentation in which individual users are provided their own piece of the spectrum, often
with additional, valuable spectrum squandered as unused "guard bands." Lastly, we know that spectrum sharing will work even better in the future with the advent of digital communications technology.

<P>Drawing from DoD's national and worldwide experiences, two essential elements for successful spectrum sharing are performance criteria and standards for the technical design of receivers as well as transmitters. We have and use performance standards and receiver standards within the DoD. Many other nations in the world have both receiver standards and transmitter standards.
Today, the U.S. employs only transmitter standards. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 did include language on the adoption of receiver standards. To date, the FCC has taken no action on this. ... The United States needs to implement and enforce such standards to ensure that
commercial, federal and military systems can operate harmoniously when used within the United States or in other countries. The adoption of such standards by the United States would also aid the international competitiveness of our industry's spectrum-dependent products.

<P>The Department of Defense is concerned that we are viewed as the only, or as the principal, source of reallocatable spectrum for meeting the growing needs of the private sector. Instead of a national review of all spectrum use, there has been a persistent erosion of government spectrum and the apparent adoption of an implicit policy that concentrates on government spectrum as the default source to satisfy new private sector needs.

<P>Our worldwide experience convinces us there is a better way to ensure adequate spectrum access for all users than the "zero sum game" of reallocation. But if that is the reallocation approach taken, it must be taken with great care. As Secretary [of Defense William J.] Perry stated in his Nov. 4, 1995, letter to Sens. [Trent] Lott [Miss.], [John] McCain [Ariz.] and [Kay B.] Hutchinson [Texas], before any further government spectrum is reallocated, target bands must be carefully reviewed. Consideration of the impacts on cost, military operations, intelligence operations and ultimately national security must be a priority.

<P>The Department of Defense knows the value of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the gulf war, the coalition's first attacks were aimed at Iraq's use of the spectrum, Iraq's radars and communications. We sought to render our adversary blind, deaf and dumb by denying him access to the electromagnetic spectrum. 

<P>Without the spectrum, the Iraqis could not mount a coordinated offense and could not sustain any defense. Without immediate access to spectrum, neither could we.

<P>The issue is more complex than summary statements regarding the relative ease or difficulty of reallocating DoD spectrum. [Army] Gen. [John M.] Shalikashvili [chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff] strongly asserts that coalition warfare is our preferred strategy. Much of our current spectrum access is linked to international access afforded our alliance and coalition partners worldwide. Loss
or reallocation of this access would have significant repercussions in our ability to operate effectively with other nations. As we shift to other less advantageous areas of the spectrum, our allies are left with awkward choices. Our commanders in the field and at sea must not be limited in either operational flexibility or ability to operate with allies.

<P>Well over a decade ago, a Soviet general reportedly said something like "to prevail in the next conflict, one must control the electromagnetic spectrum." That statement proved true in the Bacca Valley and on deserts in Iraq.

<P>The Department of Defense is committed to ensuring that "in the next conflict" it is we who will control the spectrum. We know its value.

<P>Gen. Shalikashvili is fond of noting that the nature of war is unchanged, but its character is in constant change. He is exactly right. We are moving toward new warfighting paradigms. These opportunities are available only to those willing to boldly exploit the technological advantages of the type that we currently hold. 

<P>Remember that the electromagnetic spectrum hold[s] the key to our successful use of our technological advantages of today and tomorrow.

Effects of the Next Cycle of Solar Interference

<P>[Source: Coming solar cycle may pose problems, AP item, 19 Nov 1996, 
PGN Stark Abstracting and Excerpting Service.]

<P>Cycle 23 of solar interference activities is building up, and is expected to
have considerable effects on our planet around the year 2000, according to a
panel of government researchers.  (Cycle 22 was at its peak in July 1989
[see RISKS-8.38, 39 on electric currents induced in power lines, blacking
out Quebec, and RISKS-8.72 for a more detailed retrospective article]; the
strongest cycle to date was in November 1957.)  In particular, many new
industries have emerged that were not subjected to previous solar effects --
and they have not anticipated the risks to their systems and their
businesses.  Navigation and communications are considered to be particularly
vulnerable.  For information on the report, you might try contacting Air
Force Col. Jud Stailey, assistant director of the Office of Federal
Coordinator for Meteorological Services, a 13-agency panel housed in the
offices of the National Weather Service, or Ernie Hildner, director of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Environment Center
in Boulder, Colo.

<P>Potential problems to anticipate include damage to computers and other
electrical systems in satellites; expansion of the Earth's atmosphere,
slowing down satellites and pieces of space debris, making them harder to
track; induced currents in pipelines and other large arrays of metal;
disruption of signals for the inexpensive single-frequency global
positioning system satellites; interference with the newly developed
satellite cell-phone system; changes in the Earth's magnetic field,
interfering with signals used to direct oil drilling bits deep underground.

<P>  [An obvious question for RISKS readers is which will have a more dramatic
  effect, Y2K or Cycle 23?  Perhaps we will have Murphy-slaw and each will
  reinforce the other on the same day!  PGN]</P>

From: Hal Finney <hal@rain.org><BR>
To: cypherpunks@toad.com<BR>
Subject: National Emergency<BR>

<P>Michael Froomkin posted to the cyberia list a pointer to the Clinton
administration's new export policy.  He has a copy on his web site at:
<a href="http://www.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/nov96-regs.htm">http://www.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/nov96-regs.htm.</a>  The thing I found interesting is that it refers to the fact that we are currently
living under a state of national emergency!  I searched on the whitehouse
web site and couldn't find the executive order referred to (maybe it was
classified) but did find this one:</P>
<BR>
<CENTER>For Immediate Release &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; June 30, 1994</CENTER>
<BR>

<CENTER>			  Executive Order<BR>
			      #12923</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>			   - - - - - - -</CENTER>

<P>	     Continuation Of Export Control Regulations


<P>	  By the authority vested in me as President by the
	Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
	including but not limited to section 203 of the International
	Emergency Economic Powers Act ("Act") (50 U.S.C. 1702), I, William
	J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, find that
	the unrestricted access of foreign parties to U.S. goods,
	technology, and technical data and the existence of certain
	boycott practices of foreign nations, in light of the expiration
	of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.
	App. 2401 et seq.), constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat
	to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
	United States and hereby declare a national emergency with respect
	to that threat.

<P>Apparently this state of emergency is still in effect.  This is what
gives the President the power to unilaterally make changes in the export
policy.  It would be nice if our congresspeople would take some
responsibility in this matter.</P>
<BR>
Hal<BR>

<H2><center>Executive Order</H2> 
<B>July 15, 1996
Establishment of  President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection ("Commission").</B></Center>
<BR>

Certain national infrastructures are so vital that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the United States.<P>

These critical infrastructures include:
<UL>
<LI> telecommunications,<BR>
<LI> electrical power systems,<BR>
<LI> gas and oil storage and transportation,<BR>
<LI> banking and finance,<BR>
<LI> transportation,<BR>
<LI> water supply systems,<BR>
<LI> emergency services (including medical, police, fire, and rescue), and<BR>
<LI> continuity of government.<BR>
</UL>

Threats to these critical infrastructures fall into two categories:<P>

1. physical threats to tangible property ("physical threats"),<P>

2. and threats of electronic, radio-frequency, or computer-based attacks<P>
on the information or communications components that control critical<P>
infrastructures ("cyber threats").<P>

Because many of these critical infrastructures are owned and operated by the private sector, it is essential that the government and private sector work together to develop a strategy for protecting them and assuring their continued operation.<P>


NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:<P>


Section 1.  Establishment.  There is hereby established the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection ("Commission").<P>

        (a) Chair. A qualified individual from outside the Federal Government shall be appointed by the President to serve as Chair of the Commission. The Commission Chair shall be employed on a full-time basis.<P>

        (b) Members.  The head of each of the following executive branch departments and agencies shall nominate not more than two full-time members of the Commission:<P>

<UL><P>
       <LI> (i)     Department of the Treasury;<BR>
        <LI>(ii)    Department of Justice;<BR>
       <LI> (iii)   Department of Defense;<BR>
        <LI>(iv)   Department of Commerce;<BR>
        <LI>(v)    Department of Transportation;<BR>

Countering Non-lethal Information Warfare:</H2>
<h4>Lessons learned on foiling the Information Superhighwayman of  the North American public switched telephone network.</h4>
<i>Hank Kluepfel CPP<BR>
Science Applications International Corporation.</I></Center>
<BR>



The United States relies for its very existence--economically, socially, and politically--on an extraordinary sophisticated and intricate set of long-distance networks for energy distribution, communication, and transportation.  Because these networks also rely upon each other, a truly serious disruption in any one will cascade quickly through the others, rending the vital fabric of our nation at its most crucial points.  Under these circumstances, the ability to respond to national security crises will at least be severely constrained and may be completely interrupted for some crucial interval.  Thus, in addition to their serious vulnerabilities to accidents and nature, these networks present a tempting target to terrorists and to any antagonist contemplating an international move contrary to U.S. interests.1  <P>

<h4>	    America's Hidden Vulnerabilities, CSIS, 19842</h4>

While warnings such as the one cited above predicted potentially catastrophic consequences, the fragility of  today's global networks of computer based systems, used to business process re-engineer America's industrial and military infrastructure into lanes on the Information Superhighway,  together with  concerns over information warfare, are  taking  front burner attention on the agenda's of military and civilian agencies within the United States.  A September 1993  Department of Defense report said it best:  "if hired by terrorists,  hackers could cripple the Nation's telephone system, create significant public health and safety problems, and cause serious economic shocks." 3<P>

This paper will, hopefully describe and help to further set the stage for the establishment and realization of a defensive information warfare security baseline architecture for the NII Information  Superhighway and its global partners and components throughout their lifecycle, from research and development to deployment and beyond. <P>


<h4>The best offense is often a  good defense</h4>


Pogo said it best, "we have met the enemy and it's us." Following a rash of intrusion incidents into Unclassified but sensitive  Department of Defense computers systems, the DOD is now taking positive Defensive Information Warfare 4 steps to assess and correct its potential information warfare vulnerabilities.  For the past year hired hackers within various agencies of  the Department of Defense have  been conducting "sweeps" and vulnerability assessments  of agency sites and network systems connected to MILNET/Internet.  According to <P>
new reports posted to the SPACE Warfare Website, http:\\ infosec.nosc.mil/infosec.html-ssil, the testing consisted of  making use of the same types of tools that hackers use when they penetrate into systems connected to the Internet.  Although the specific results of such testing are restricted to the affected sites and the infowarriors conducting the tests, general findings present a dour state of readiness and response to information warfare on the information superhighway.<P>

While much has been learned over the last ten years in securing the information superhighway's public switched network infrastructure, even greater emphasis must be placed on addressing security in cyberspace. <P>

Security  and Information Assurance  as it applies to telecommunications in Defensive Information Warfare may be viewed as  classical quality problem.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Lack of constancy of purpose: There must be a clear goal related to security, privacy,  and assurance beyond the immediate and often short term, reactive efforts. <BR>

<LI>Emphasis on short term results:  Security is seem as a destination rather than a journey.<BR>

<LI>Audits and Self Assessment Deficiencies: Auditors find  and report on troubling exploitable vulnerabilities and  inadequacy of controls only to have the reports collect dust waiting for the second and third follow-on report to find exacerbated vulnerabilities.  Self Assessments are often inadequate in scope and depth, often tending to tell management  want they want to  hear.  On the contrary, when people in the organization clearly understand corporate objectives, they measure themselves against those objectives.6  Unfortunately, security objectives for industry or government are not well defined and understood with respect to the robustness issues in a heterogeneous, multi-vendor, multi-carrier/service provider environment of the NII.<BR>

<LI>Mobility of Management: Does not  imbue trust in employees, contractors and vendors; or offer long term assurances that the problem is being adequately addressed in emerging technologies.<BR>

<LI>Measurements are Meaningless:  Since less than five percent of intrusions are ever detected by systems administrators, and only five percent of those detected ever get reported to management,  law enforcement or other incident tracking system, striving for "Zero incidents" may realize the narrow focused objective only to leave the infrastructure even more vulnerable to compromise.<BR>

<LI>Recovery costs far outweigh prevention:  Numerous studies of software quality and physical design have shown that designing it right the first time is far more cost effective than piecemeal reinforcements and recovery efforts.<BR>

<LI>Excessive potential liabilities:  The potential for product liability and negligence often keeps security on the hush for fear of potential consequences if the vulnerabilities be known or inadequate corrective actions applied. <BR>

</UL>

As the information  superhighway e.g., national, defense and global information infrastructures, becomes the metaphor of choice, for the potential virtual infrastructure of electronic commerce, many believe that privacy and security will become the linchpin of this 21st Century vision for a National Information Infrastructure, NII. <P>

A new report issued by the Clinton Administration, summed it up this way: <P>

If the NII is to succeed, a structure or a collection of structures -- a security architecture -- must exist to ensure security. The NRC report states: <I>"This security architecture must include technical facilities, recommended operational procedures, and means for recourse within the legal system."  </I> This architecture will be based on a variety of public and  private institutions and policies.  Although an architecture will define how institutions, policies, and technologies interconnect, a sound security architecture will consist not of rigidly prescribed technologies or solutions, but must be able to flexibly adapt to change.  The report also notes that such an  architecture will require research and development over time.  <P>

     As the United States as a whole becomes increasingly reliant on the NII for communications and information, other key components of the U.S. infrastructure will become dependent on it.  For example, the power grid, transportation systems, financial institutions, and economic transaction data will all be dependent on the NII.  Security weaknesses in the NII can place  those infrastructure elements at risk.  Hence a significant attack on the NII would be a threat to our national security in addition to the significant personal and economic harm it would cause.8<P>

In an international economy and social infrastructure that is growing more dependent everyday on its communications networks, more attention must be placed on the security and integrity of the components and interfaces of those critical structures by all interconnected service providers, vendors and users.  The old adage that the chain is only as strong as the weakest link has never been as true as it is today when applied to the issue of network security and integrity. It is with that tone that this paper is written to help identify the potential information warfare threat and address the  cascading  vulnerable infrastructure  on which the information superhighway is being built. <P>

<h4>Information Superhighway Field of Dreams</h4>

Over the last twenty years the number of compromised systems, routers, networks and development systems supporting   the developing information superhighway have escalated and may very well approach nearly  a quarter of a million nodes.<P>

<h4>Dialing for data in  the Public Switched Network</h4>

While there is no definite intruder threat profile for the PSN, many are adults with previous criminal records for computer related crimes committed when they were juveniles.  In 1987, Herbert Zinn, a 17 year old  hacker who called himself Shadowhawk electronically broke into logistic support systems of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO,  AT&T #5ESS installation systems for the AUTOVON systems at Robins Airforce Base  and several  AT&T Operations Support Systems R&D  data bases and support systems, stealing source code to 55 programs ranging from development code for installing switching systems to Artificial Intelligence, AI, language.  He was detected by AT&T's investigations into allegations of  threatening messages  left by Shadowhawk on a hacker bulletin board in Texas.<P>

  Shadow Hawk was later found guilty of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 in Federal District Court in Chicago and sentenced to nine months in prison.  In addition to a prison term, he was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine, and serve two and a half years of federal probation when released from prison.  That case was a foretelling of the more serious  LOD and MOD incidents to follow.9  While no classified material was obtained, the government viewed the $21,000 in software programs stolen from the computer used by NATO as "sensitive". <P>

Kevin Lee Poulsen, AKA Dark Dante, a 31 year old individual, with a long history of computer hacking going back to age fourteen, currently under indictment in California for espionage is charged with breaking into computer systems of  Pacific Bell and wiretapping the contents of sensitive communications including US  Air Force Classified Information on planned targets in the event of a war.<P>

Intruders often align themselves into groups of individuals with similar interests and skills, e.g., the Master of Deception or MOD who were convicted in Federal Court in New York City  for  breaking into some of the nation's most sophisticated computer systems  to gain illegal access to the computers of  Bank of America, Southwestern Bell, Martin Marietta, TRW Information Services and New York University, among others.  The five were also accused of selling information, such as people's credit reports, that they obtained illegally from the systems.  The hackers, an ethnically mixed group from working-class neighborhoods around New York City, defied the stereotype of young computer aficionados as affluent suburbanites.  They met through computer bulletin boards, and knew one another by nicknames like ``Outlaw,'' ``Corrupt'' and ``Acid Phreak.'' <P>

In a written statement submitted to the federal district court, Corrupt admitted to illegal activities as a member of MOD: <P>

<Cite>1)  I agreed to possess in excess of fifteen passwords which permitted me to gain access to various computer systems including all systems mentioned in the indictment and others. I did not have authorization to access these systems.  I knew  at the time that what I did was wrong.<P>

2)  I used these access devices and in doing so obtained the value of time I spent within these systems as well as the value of the passwords themselves which I acknowledge was more than $1000.<P>

3)  I intentionally gained access to what I acknowledge are Federal interest   computers and I acknowledge that work had to be done to improve the  security of these systems which was necessitated by my unauthorized access.<P>

4)  I was able to monitor data exchange between computer systems and by doing so intentionally obtained more passwords,  identifications and other data transmitted over ...net and other networks.<P>

5)  I acknowledge that I and others planned to share passwords and  transmitted information across state boundaries by modem or telephone   lines and by doing so obtained the monetary value of the use of the    systems I would otherwise have had to pay for.
<P>

Among the ways I and others agreed to carry out these acts are the following:<P>

  1.  I was part of a group called MOD.<P>

  2.  The members of the group exchanged information including passwords  so that we could gain access to computer systems which we were not authorized to access.<P>

  3.  I got passwords by monitoring ...net, calling phone company employees and pretending to be computer technicians, and using computer programs to steal passwords. I participated in installing programs in computer systems that would give the highest level of access to members of MOD who possessed the secret password. I participated in altering telephone computer systems to obtain free calling services such as conference calling and free billing among others.<P>

Finally, I obtained credit reports, telephone numbers and addresses as well as other information about individual people by gaining access to information and credit reporting services.  I acknowledge that on November 5, 1991, I obtained passwords by monitoring ...net.<P>

</Cite>
Corrupt and his MOD colleagues  had apparently gained access to a vendor supported  Operations, Administration, Maintenance and Provisioning,  OAM&P,  "debug" port to telephone companies backbone networks.  By exploiting the group based or default password for the diagnostic tool, the intruders then executed the packet monitoring program to read the data traffic at various points in the telco's PPSN, e.g., X.25 multiplexers.<P>

By reading the data on the X.25 nodes and gateways the intruders were able to capture logins and passwords transiting over or used within the packet network.  With the help of the compromised logins and associated passwords, the intruders then attacked the downstream systems and networks.<P>

All five of the defendants subsequently plead guilty and were sentenced to varying degrees of punishment ranging from probation to 14 months in a Federal Penitentiary followed by three months of home incarceration, followed by two years of probation and up to 600 hours of community service.<P>

In another case, three adults and one juvenile, all members of the hacker group known as the Legion of Doom,  were convicted and sentenced to prison in the Fall of 1990 in Federal court in Atlanta for their part in compromising the computer systems of BellSouth.<P>

The defendants, who used the handles Leftist, Urvile, Prophet and Fry Guy admitted accessing the carrier's internal backbone X.25 packet network to penetrate the carriers OAM&P centers, systems and databases  to  affect fraudulent service creation and modification, add call forwarding to customer lines and monitor customer communications. <P>

In yet another case, a hacker based in Europe claimed to have the ability to shut-down a major computer based financial network located in the United States by affecting environmental support systems such as power, cooling/heating and ventilation systems.  Telco and financial community investigations  found a related security risk involving  building environmental systems, which allowed potentially vulnerable remote access to heating, air conditioning, humidity, power and elevators alarms and control settings.  Since many of the network nodes supporting the PSN and its customers are designed to operate in controlled environmental conditions, a potential vulnerability existed which if exploited by an intruder could cause catastrophic troubles to the network.<P>


Intruders believe that the three  easiest ways to penetrate a system are:<P>

Many of the U S based hackers who have been apprehended and prosecuted for their crimes were found to have had indirect electronic association with hackers in Germany,Australia and Great Britain.  The individuals located in<P>
Germany are the same espionage operative hackers described by Clifford Stoll in his best selling book entitled "The Cuckoo's Egg." Known objectives for the attacks include financial gain, malicious destruction, and invasion of privacy.<P>

It has become increasingly apparent that, without adequate attention to security, systems and networks are vulnerable to service quality impacting intrusions by unauthorized individuals (e.g., hackers) and groups (e.g., the hacker groups known as the Legion of Doom, 8LGM and Master of Deception).  Such computer crimes always involve unauthorized persons, or persons who exceed their authorization, with adequate SKAM (Skills, Knowledge, Access and Motive) acting on exploitable vulnerabilities .Knowledge and access are often afforded the would-be intruder through the compromise of system security bulletins often found in public sources and redistributed by the hackers on their own cites in cyberspace such as <a href="http://www.8lgm.org/advisories.html-ssi">http://www.8lgm.org/advisories.html-ssi</A>  <P>

In the past, since it was very often not economically feasible to prevent intrusions, most service providers often focused their efforts on controlling losses through reactive deterrent and control measures.<P>

Accordingly, and in recognition of the significant damage which might occur from such intrusions, a number of telecommunications carriers around the nation12  have begun to assess the effectiveness of security mechanisms in-place to protect the critical common environments supporting the interconnection of the global public  network.<P>

If we assess the current wave of Internet attacks and fraud on the growing volume of electronic commerce transactions  we find surprising similar root causes. <P>


It is easy to project that chaos is certain if we as a nation, industry and government do not clearly define, support and affect a holistic approach to network and information security focusing on root causes to intrusion to the NII/DII/GII. Technologies such as Asyvhronous Transfer Mode, ATM, are seen as the platforms of choice for the fastlane of the Information Superhighway.  Yet effective solutions and standards have not been developed to address the authentication of the source of OA&M cells which could affect the integrity of  network management controls  and features such as switched virtual circuits, SVC. <P>

Saying it another way, absent effective security policies, requirements, standards, working agreements for vulnerability closure information sharing, and penalties for non-conformance, chaos is certain and secure recovery readiness a necessity. <P>

So great was the potential societal impact of such widescale outages that the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States revamped its Telecommunications Strategic Plan to significantly reinforce its reliability and security requirements. Realizing that the security threat to air traffic control has changed in character, as computer and telecommunications technologies have grown more powerful, the FAA  created a multipoint plan document to address security throughout the lifecycle of its future telecommunications environment.<P>

<p><B>WASHINGTON, June 25 (UPI) </B>-- Traditional methods by the nation's intelligence agencies are not enough to stave off attacks by terrorists or hackers on vital U.S. computer systems, CIA Director John Deutch said Tuesday. Deutch, testifying before a Senate panel on actions taken by the CIA and other intelligence agencies to combat so-called "cyber attacks," called for the government to establish "deep cooperation" with the high-tech industry to protect the nation's information infrastructure.</p>
<p>Deutch said a growing dependence worldwide on telecommunications and computer networks has fostered with it a vulnerability to attacks that could in essence cripple the backbone of the nation's communications infrastructure. "Both nations and terrorist organizations can, with relative ease, acquire the techniques to penetrate information systems," Deutch said. "That is what is different about this category of threat to our infrastructure from other kinds of threats; the conventional explosives or nuclear, biological and chemical" weapons.</p>
<p>Deutch told members of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs Tuesday that U.S. defenses have not caught up to the rapid growth of computer technology that has presented the CIA and the Pentagon with a new range of security concerns to counter.</p>
<p>"We are not well organized as a government to address these issues," Deutch said. "Traditional government methods are not enough. What is required here is a very intense and deep cooperation with industry, those who own, build and operate the civilian infrastructure and those who are closer to the very rapid technological change which is occurring."</p>
<p>Through such weapons as computer viruses transmitted through the Internet, such attacks could shut down international commerce and funds transfers, knock out systems guiding commercial air or rail traffic, cut power supplies, or even prevent the Pentagon from giving orders to its forces. "The electron, in my judgment, is the ultimate precision-guided munition,"Deutch said. "International terrorist groups clearly have the capability to attack the information infrastructure of the United States, even if they use relatively simple means," Deutch said.</p>
<p>Information warfare methods used by terrorists could include vehicle-delivered bombs directed at major telephone switching centers, Deutch said. Successful attacks against communications systems through the Internet, however, require more than basic computer literacy. "It requires sophisticated computer programming technique, it requires detailed information about the character of the target, the computer network or telecommunications system that you are addressing, and it does in some sense require access to the target, whether by physical or electronic means," Deutch said.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups are increasingly using the Internet for communications, Deutch said, and paid computer hackers could provide them with the skills needed to launch a cyber assault. "Hackers, with or without their full knowledge, may be supplying advice and expertise to rogue states such as Iran and Libya," he said. Deutch said he believes "foreign organized crime" is behind some of the many intrusions committed by hackers on U.S. banks and telecommunications companies.</p>
<p>Last year, a 16-year-old London resident gained access to a sophisticated U.S. defense computer system causing U.S. intelligence agencies to scramble. The youth was charged with carrying out a series of attacks on a highly classified Defense Department computer facility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A 21-year-old resident of Wales was arrested last weekend, accused of tutoring the youth how to conduct the attacks. Adding to the intrigue of the case, the 16-year-old has been accused of acting with others in a conspiracy to carry out the attacks, however, no others have been tied publicly to the incident.</p>
<p>"Could they have been foreign intelligence operatives or agents of a hostile foreign government, or were they just youthful hackers?," said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., committee chairman. "In the cyber world, it could be possible that the two arrested may not even know the identity of their fellow co-conspirators." Nunn said the case "highlights the need for sound policy, for intelligence, and for response planning." The CIA chief said the intelligence community has taken measures to estimate both the intent and capabilities of foreign entities to attack U.S. communications targets.</p>
<p>Deutch said an inter-agency Critical Infrastructure Security Group, made up of the CIA, the Pentagon and the FBI, has been established to identify vulnerability in the domestic infrastructure. The group is scheduled to release a security threat assessment by Dec. 1. The National Security Agency is presently reorganizing specifically to address information warfare, Deutch said, and is creating an Information Warfare Technology Center in Fort Meade, Md.</p>
<p>Deutch said details for the center must still be worked out, but it is being designed as "more of a place to build a toolbox to threat assessment, do analysis, rather than a place to get involved in actual law enforcement or operational decisions."

<a href="http://samsara.law.cwru.edu">For More Information On This Law Suit</a> <BR>

<p>A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict his ability to teach a course in computer law.  Peter Junger, a twenty-five year veteran of the law school faculty, will file a federal civil rights action this afternoon in the United States District Court in Cleveland.  The suit names the Department of State and the secretive National Security Agency, which administer federal regulations limiting Professor Junger's ability to teach.</p>
<p>The case involves the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, federal regulations which restrict the export of military technology.  Under the ITAR, cryptographic computer software, which encodes text to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet, is considered a "munition" and subject to strict export control. The regulations raise significant First Amendment questions by defining "export" to include discussing technical information about non-classified software with foreign nationals, such as students registered for Professor Junger's course.</p>
<p>In recent months, the State Department has sent a series of letters threatening possible criminal action to a Florida man who posted a simple cryptographic algorithm to the "sci.crypt" Usenet Newsgroup, an Internet site popular with cryptography enthusiasts.  These and similar incidents have caused Professor Junger to limit his discussions of cryptographic material with foreign colleagues, for fear of violating the ITAR.  Penalties for unlicenced disclosure of cryptographic information are severe: federal law provides ten year prison terms and One Million Dollar fines for those convicted of violating the Arms Export Control Act, the legislation under which the ITAR was promulgated.</p>
<p>Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses on the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans to turn away any foreign students who register for the course this fall, largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach, and to whom.</p>
<p>The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of State, in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security Agency, the organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign governments.   Under the ITAR, Junger may not teach foreign students about even simple software capable of encoding messages. Such software is vital to maintaining the privacy of communications and financial transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes that lawyers need to understand how it works in order to prepare to practice in an increasingly technological world.</p>


<P>The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available on the Internet and elsewhere. "It's
not as though we are talking about classified information," explained Gino Scarselli, one of three
lawyers representing Junger in the case. "The material at issue in this case can be found in any
university library, but the regulations make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"
Scarselli noted. The lawsuit does not challenge the government's right to restrict access to classified
information. 

<P>Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis O'Neill, two Cleveland
attorneys with considerable experience in First Amendment issues. As Vasvari explained, the suit
presents important First Amendment questions about the government's ability to regulate academic
life. "These regulations allow the government to dictate what a professor may and may not teach,
even though the material involved poses no threat to national security," Vasvari explained. 

<P>The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal license to discuss cryptography with
foreigners, the government is violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits the
government from imposing prior restraints on expression without clear, narrowly drawn standards
distinguishing prohibited expression from permissible speech. The United States Supreme Court has
consistently held that such prior restraints face a heavy burden in court, and that standardless
licencing schemes allowing officials broad discretion in restriction speech are unconstitutional. 

<P>Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role in the economic development
of the Internet, the case is being closely watched. Scarselli has worked closely with attorneys
affiliated with the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier Foundation in preparing the suit, and
Junger and his lawyers have been in frequent contact with John Gilmore, formerly of Sun
Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a technical advisor in the case. 

<P>At issue is not only Junger's right to discuss cryptography with foreigners, but also his and other's
right to publish and distribute such information both in traditional forms and on the internet. 

<P>Professor Junger's suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, prohibiting the government from
interfering with his, or any other person's, discussing non-classified cryptographic information with
foreign persons or from publishing that information. Lawyers for Junger have moved the court for a
preliminary injunction. Junger's course begins in the fall semester, later this month.

October 31, 1996

<P>You've got your passport. You've got your airline tickets. You've got your
notebook. You're a high-tech road warrior, ready to take off and take on the
world. But do you have the Executive Notebook Computer Travel Kit? Without it,
or a similar collection of the bits and pieces contained therein, you
might not be able to power up, or jack in, when you arrive at destinations that don't
celebrate Independence Day on the 4th of July. 

<P>A surprising number of business people are still surprised to find that many
countries in the world don't use RJ-11 sockets to plug in phones and modems. 
And even though a lot of today's notebook computers automatically adjust to a wide
range of voltages, many countries don't dish up the juice in familiar U.S.
sockets. For business travelers whose laptop batteries need charging at least
daily, and for those who can't work without frequent email pickup and
delivery, the worldwide array of socket and plug combinations is a serious impediment. 

<P>Some have already adopted a piecemeal approach to the problem, buying country
specific adapters as needed. But this can be expensive if you have to
travel to more than a couple of countries. For example, at Fry's Electronics in Silicon
Valley you can buy adapters at $10-$15 per country, economical if you are only
going to one country, but costly if you are on a 7 country swing through the 
EC, where "community standards" is an oxymoron, at least when it comes to
electricity and telephones.

<P>Fortunately, there is a pretty comprehensive solution right around the
corner at the Computer City chain of stores (see <a href="www.computercity.com">www.computercity.com</a> for the store
nearest you or call 817 390 2700).

<P>They now sell something called the Executive Notebook Computer Travel Kit,
a neat zippered bag of tricks, custom made in
China for this retail division of Tandy Corp. Unzip the bag and you get
several compartments where adapters are grouped by region. You will find power plug
adapters for just about anywhere in the world, with a handy chart of voltages
for those who have 110 only devices (sorry, no power conversion, that
requires a separate transformer). 

<P>The Executive Notebook Computer Travel Kit includes country specific phone
adapters for Belgium, France, Germany (which requires 2 deceptively similar
versions), Italy, and Australia. These are all made so that you can unplug the
phone, then plug in the adapter, your modem, and the phone. There is also a UK
adapter that works in New Zealand as well, plus a selection of RJ-11 adapters
(in-line, line doubling) that should handle just about anything in Asia and
South America, not to mention older hotels in North America. A couple of phone
patch cords are also included, plus a compact parallel printer cable, which
ingeniously converts to a null modem cable. 

<P>At $49.95 for all this, the Executive Notebook Computer Travel Kit strikes
this particular traveler as a bargain. Successfully collecting my email from the
other side of the world still gives me a real rush. And it sure beats 
collapsing into a hotel room at the end of a long day's travel, only to find I can't
connect my laptop to anything useful. From now on I am going to pack this
particular bag on every trip.

<P>Stephen Cobb, CISSP, was born in Britain, has lived in four countries and
travelled to fifteen. He has also visited 47 of the 50 states that constitute
the country of which he is now a citizen.

<P>  ( Pricing Schedule at: <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/prices.html">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/prices.html</a>)

<P>   The Defense Technical Information Center gathers, catalogs and makes
available literally millions of documents (classified and unclassified)
generated as a result of research, testing, development, training and
scholarship done by or sponsored by the Department of Defense. Many of these
documents deal with subjects likely to be of interest to listmembers here.
As a teaser I have included a relatively short list of documents on the
subjects of Terrorism/ Antiterrorism from the "Hot Topics" on the DTIC home
page at <a href="http://www.dtic.mil">http://www.dtic.mil</a>.

<P>   I am often surprised at the resources various individuals (myself most
definitely included) fail to use simply because they don't know these
treasures exist. DTIC is relatively high on the list of underutilized
(though I doubt the staff there think so) resources, and it definitely
counts as a treasure. If you knew about it already, good- if not, get busy.
Registration information is appended at the bottom of the list. Someone in
your organization (library, publications, etc.) may already have a DTIC
account you can share- ask around before you begin the registration process.</P>

PERSONAL AUTHORS:  DIPAOLO, PETER J.<BR>
REPORT DATE:  JUN, 1995<BR>
PAGINATION:  134P  MEDIA COST:  $11.00<BR>

<P>DESCRIPTORS:  *NUCLEAR WEAPONS, *TERRORISM, UNITED STATES,
  POLICIES, NATIONAL SECURITY, THESES, WESTERN SECURITY(INTERNATIONAL).
<P>IDENTIFIERS:  *NUCLEAR TERRORISM.
<P>ABSTRACT:  THE DEMISE OF BIPOLARITY CREATED NEW SECURITY CONCERNS
  FOR THE UNITED STATES. TERRORISM NOW THRIVES IN THE NEW WORLD
  ENVIRONMENT. WHILE MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ON TERRORISM, THE SPECTER
  OF NUCLEAR TERRORISM IN THE UNITED STATES HAS RECEIVED LITTLE
  ATTENTION. NUCLEAR TERRORISM CANNOT BE LOOKED AT THROUGH THE
  TRADITIONAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS PARADIGM NOR CAN IT BE VIEWED WITHIN
  THE CONFINES OF THE TRADITIONAL TERRORISM PARADIGM. THERE CURRENTLY
  ARE TWO PERSPECTIVES ON NUCLEAR TERRORISM: THE OPTIMISTS, WHO DO
  NOT SEE IT AS A THREAT, AND THE PESSIMISTS, WHO SEE IT AS
  INEVITABLE. EACH VIEW HAS ITS MERITS BUT NEITHER ALONE CAN EXPLAIN
  THIS SECURITY CONCERN. MERGING OF THE TWO VIEWS IS REQUIRED TO
  UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND THIS POTENTIALLY
  HORRIFIC PROBLEM. A BRIEF HISTORY OF U.S. POLICIES ON NUCLEAR
  WEAPONS AND TERRORISM IS OFFERED TO EXPLAIN WHY THERE HAS NOT BEEN
  A U.S. POLICY ON NUCLEAR TERRORISM. THE POSSIBILITY OF NUCLEAR
  TERRORISM IS REAL. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE NUCLEAR TERRORIST
  MINDSET IS REQUIRED IF EFFECTIVE POLICIES ARE TO BE DEVELOPED.</P>

<P>IDENTIFIERS:  SADDAM HUSSEIN.
<P>ABSTRACT:  THE PERSIAN GULF HOSTAGE CRISIS BEGAN ON 09 AUGUST 199O,
  ONE WEEK AFTER IRAQ'S INVASION OF KUWAIT, WITH THE IRAQI ANNOUNCEMENT
  THAT THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS AND OTHER FOREIGNERS STRANDED IN IRAQ
  WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO LEAVE. IRAQ'S INVASION OF KUWAIT CAUGHT MOST
  U.S. POLICY MAKERS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL OBSERVERS BY
  SURPRISE AND  MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE PRE-CRISIS PHASE. THE HOSTAGE
  CRISIS CONTINUED THROUGH 06 DECEMBER 1990, WHEN SADDAM ANNOUNCED THE
  RELEASE OF ALL FOREIGNERS. THE POST-CRISIS PHASE, CONSISTING OF THE
  PERSIAN GULF WAR, CEASE-FIRE, AND ONGOING ATTEMPTS TO FORCE IRAQ TO
  FULLY COMPLY WITH ALL UNITED NATIONS RESOLUTIONS, HAS PROVIDED THE
  SETTING FOR THE NEXT HOSTAGE CRISIS, GIVEN THE WILLINGNESS OF THE
  IRAQI GOVERNMENT, AGAIN LAST MONTH, TO TAKE AMERICANS HOSTAGE.</P>

TITLE:  RESPONSES TO LIBYAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM (1980 - 1994): A
  COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS.<BR>
PERSONAL AUTHORS:  VOIGT, BRADLEY D.<BR>
REPORT DATE:  DEC, 1994<BR>
PAGINATION:  101P  MEDIA COST:  $11.00<BR>
<P>REPORT CLASSIFICATION:  UNCLASSIFIED
<P>DESCRIPTORS:  *LIBYA, *RESPONSE, *COUNTERTERRORISM, *TERRORISM, EUROPE,
  ECONOMICS, THESES, CASE STUDIES, HYPOTHESES, INDICATORS, IMPORTS.
<P>IDENTIFIERS:  UNILATERAL RESPONSE, MULTILATERAL RESPONSE.
<P>ABSTRACT:  THIS THESIS EXAMINES FOUR RESPONSES TO
  LIBYAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM: THE 1982 AMERICAN EMBARGO, THE 1984 AMERICAN
  REQUEST TO EUROPE FOR ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, THE 1986 AMERICAN BOMBING RAID
  ON TRIPOLI, AND THE 1992 UNITED NATIONS ECONOMIC SANCTIONS. THE
  RATIONALE LEADING UP TO EACH RESPONSE IS ANALYZED FROM AMERICAN
  POLITICAL, DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY POINTS OF VIEW. TWO MEASURES ARE
  DEVELOPED TO JUDGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH RESPONSE: AN ECONOMIC
  INDICATOR WHICH DETERMINES THE IMPACT OF EACH RESPONSE ON LIBYAN
  EXPORTS, AND THE RISE OR FALL IN LIBYAN-SPONSORED TERRORIST
  INCIDENTS BEFORE AND AFTER EACH RESPONSE. FIVE HYPOTHESES ARE
  INTRODUCED WHICH ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE INTERACTION OF STATES IN
  THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM WHEN FACED WITH ALLEGED STATE-SPONSORED
  TERRORISM. EACH RESPONSE IS CRITIQUED USING THE FIVE HYPOTHESES AND
  ALSO THE MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS. FOLLOWING THIS CRITIQUE THE
  THESIS CONCLUDES THAT A FIRM MILITARY AND FLEXIBLE DIPLOMATIC
  RESPONSE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO STATE-SPONSORED
  TERRORISM.</P>

TITLE:  CRIMINAL ACTS AGAINST CIVIL AVIATION.<BR>
REPORT DATE:  1994<BR>
PAGINATION:  101P  MEDIA COST:  $11.00<BR>

<P>DESCRIPTORS:  *CIVIL AVIATION, *CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS, SOURCES,

  ACCURACY, AERONAUTICS, CASE STUDIES, SURVEYS, SYMBOLS, RECORDS,
  DOMESTIC, AVIATION SAFETY, AIR TRANSPORTATION, BOMBING, AIRCRAFT
  HIJACKING.
<P>ABSTRACT:  CRIMINAL ACTS AGAINST CIVIL AVIATION SINCE 1986, THE
  FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION'S OFFICE OF CIVIL AVIATION SECURITY
  HAS BEEN PUBLISHING AN ANNUAL REPORT ENTITLED CRIMINAL ACTS AGAINST
  CIVIL AVIATION. THIS REPORT IS A COMPILATION OF CRIMINAL INCIDENTS
  AGAINST CIVIL AVIATION AIRCRAFT AND INTERESTS WORLDWIDE. AS IN
  LAST YEAR'S PUBLICATION, THE 1994 ISSUE CONTAINS FEATURE ARTICLES
  AND GEOGRAPHIC OVERVIEWS. INCIDENTS ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE OVERVIEWS,
  AND THE FEATURE ARTICLES FOCUS ON SPECIFIC AVIATION-RELATED ISSUES
  OR CASE HISTORIES. THERE IS ALSO A SECTION IN WHICH INCIDENTS ARE
  COMPARED FOR THE 5-YEAR PERIOD, 1990 TO 1994. CHARTS, GRAPHS, AND
  MAPS APPEAR THROUGHOUT THE PUBLICATION. NEW TO THIS YEAR'S EDITION
  IS A PRODUCT SURVEY, WHICH APPEARS ON THE LAST PAGE OF THE BOOKLET.
  THIS QUESTIONNAIRE CAN BE SEPARATED AND RETURNED. THE INFORMATION
  CONTAINED IN THIS PUBLICATION IS DERIVED FROM A VARIETY OF FOREIGN
  AND DOMESTIC SOURCES. IN MANY CASES, HOWEVER, SPECIFIC DETAILS OF A
  PARTICULAR INCIDENT, ESPECIALLY THOSE OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE UNITED
  STATES, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. WHILE THE FAA MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO
  PROVIDE COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION, IT IS NOT ALWAYS
  POSSIBLE TO VERIFY ACCOUNTS OF SOME INCIDENTS. THE FAA MAINTAINS RECORDS
  OF AIRCRAFT HIJACKINGS, BOMBING ATTACKS, AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL
  ACTS AGAINST CIVIL AND GENERAL AVIATION INTERESTS WORLDWIDE, WHICH ARE
  USED TO COMPILE THIS REPORT. OFFENSES SUCH AS THESE REPRESENT SERIOUS
  THREATS TO AVIATION SAFETY AND, IN THOSE INCIDENTS INVOLVING U.S. AIR
  CARRIERS OR FACILITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, ARE OFTEN INTENDED AS
  SYMBOLIC ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.</P>

<P>ABSTRACT:  THE REPORT BOMBING OF THE FEDERAL BUILDING IN OKLAHOMA
  CITY HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE COMPLEXITY OF POLITICAL EXTREMISM. UNTIL
  THEN, THE UNITED STATES FOCUSED ITS ATTENTION ON FOREIGN TERRORISTS,
  PARTICULARLY THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS. UNDUE
  EMPHASIS ON THIS "FOREIGN CONNECTION" CAN MAKE IT APPEAR THAT ONLY
  MIDDLE EASTERN TERROR IS OF CONSEQUENCE. THIS REPORT RESULTED
  FROM A NOVEMBER 1994 CONFERENCE COSPONSORED BY THE STRATEGIC
  STUDIES INSTITUTE; THE INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES AT
  THE U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY; AND THE GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.
  A NUMBER OF TERRORIST-RELATED ISSUES WERE CONSIDERED. THE EMPHASIS
  WAS ON INTERNATIONAL TERROR, BUT THE THREAT OF DOMESTIC EXTREMISM
  WAS ALSO EXAMINED.</P>

<P>ABSTRACT:  TERRORISM IS A QUINTESSENTIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATION
  INVOLVING THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO CONVEY A MESSAGE TO MULTIPLE
  AUDIENCES. AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATION, TERRORISM PRODUCES TWO
  EFFECTS; ONE PROPAGANDA AND THE OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE. THE
  PROPAGANDA EFFECTS ARE INFORMATIVE, PERSUASIVE, OR COMPELLING AMONG
  NEUTRAL, FRIENDLY OR POTENTIALLY FRIENDLY TARGET AUDIENCES. THE
  PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE EFFECTS ARE PROVOCATIVE, DISRUPTIVE, AND
  COERCIVE AMONG ENEMY OR HOSTILE TARGET AUDIENCES. BY COMPARING THE
  ZIONIST AND THE PALESTINIAN TERRORIST CAMPAIGNS, THIS THESIS
  DEMONSTRATES HOW TERRORISM PRODUCES PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND
  PROPAGANDA EFFECTS ON MULTIPLE AUDIENCES AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF
  EACH. THE SUCCESS OF THE JEWISH RESISTANCE RESULTED FROM A STRATEGY
  OF TERRORISM THAT IDENTIFIED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL VULNERABILITIES OF
  CERTAIN AUDIENCES, CONTROLLED FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND
  PROPAGANDA EFFECTS ON THOSE AUDIENCES, AND ANTICIPATED AUDIENCE
  RESPONSE. BY COMPARISON, THE PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE DID NOT CONTROL
  FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AND PROPAGANDA EFFECTS ON MULTIPLE
  AUDIENCES. PALESTINIAN TERRORISM WAS EXCLUSIVELY PSYCHOLOGICAL
  WARFARE, WHICH FAILED TO PROPAGANDIZE THE CAUSE BEYOND THEIR
  NATIONAL CONSTITUENCY. IN EITHER CASE, THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF
  TERRORISM SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IN PART BY VIEWING THEIR CAMPAIGNS
  OF TERROR THROUGH THE PRISM OF PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS. JEWISH/

<P>ABSTRACT:  THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE SOVIET UNION AND THE
  DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF ITS FORMER SURROGATES, MAY INCREASE THE NEED
  FOR AN EFFECTIVE MILITARY DETERRENT TO COMBAT TERRORISM. A REVIEW
  OF ROGERS RANGERS DURING THE FRENCH & INDIAN WAR (THE FIRST USE OF
  CRISIS-RESPONSE TYPE FORCES IN 'AMERICA') IS USED FOR HISTORICAL
  REFLECTION. ROGERS INTERDICTED 'TERRORISTS' WITH GREAT STRATEGIC
  SUCCESS. THE KEY TO THEIR OPERATIONAL SUCCESS WAS: THE FLEXIBILITY,
  SPECIAL TRAINING, PRECISE PLANNING AND EXCELLENT LEADERSHIP. A
  COMPARISON OF THE MAYAGUEZ INCIDENT IN 1975 AND THE ACHILLE LAURO
  HIJACKING IN 1985, IS USED TO CHART THE DIRECTION OF U.S. CRISIS
  RESPONSE AFTER DESERT ONE. THE MAYAGUEZ, REPRESENTED AN AD HOC
  APPROACH USING THEATER BASED FORCES. THE ACHILLE LAURO, REPRESENTED
  A RELATIVELY MATURE APPROACH FOLLOWING LESSONS-LEARNED FROM DESERT
  ONE. BOTH THE MAYAGUEZ AND ACHILLE LAURO INCIDENTS REQUIRED SUCH A
  RAPID RESPONSE THAT POSITIONING A MILITARY FORCE (REGARDLESS OF
  TRAINING OR LOCATION) PROVED NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. COMPLICATIONS
  INCLUDE HOST NATIONS SENSITIVITIES, LACK OF FLEXIBLE TRANSPORTATION,
  AND THE GROWING SOPHISTICATION OF TERRORISTS. INTELLIGENCE REMAINS
  THE KEY LIMITING FACTOR. CRISIS-RESPONSE FORCES MUST CONTINUE TO
  DEVELOP FAST, FLEXIBLE TRANSPORTATION, ACCESS TO TIMELY
  INTELLIGENCE AND CONCISE DETAILED PLANNING. THE HISTORICAL WINDOW
  FOR SUCCESS IS THE 5 TO 7 DAY POINT --NOT THE 48-60 HOUR WINDOW OF
  THE MAYAGUEZ OR ACHILLE LAURO. U.S. POLICY SHOULD LOOK TOWARDS THE
  INTERDICTION OF SUCH TERRORISTS AS ROGERS RANGERS DID ON THE
  AMERICAN FRONTIER.</P>

<P>ABSTRACT:  THE UNITED STATES ATTACK ON LIBYA ON APRIL 15, 1986 WAS
  THE CULMINATION OF A SERIES OF DEVELOPMENTS IN U.S. FOREIGN POLICY
  AND MILITARY STRATEGY INTENDED TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.
  IT WAS THE CULMINATION OF THE U.S. ATTEMPT TO USE BOTH NON-
  MILITARY AND MILITARY METHODS TO COMBAT TERRORISM. THIS PAPER
  EXAMINES THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE AS AN APPROPRIATE MEANS TO
  COMBAT TERRORISM. IN PARTICULAR, THE 1986 CONFLICT WITH LIBYA IS
  EXAMINED CONCENTRATING ON THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS: WHETHER
  OPERATIONAL LEVEL OBJECTIVES CONTRIBUTED TO ACHIEVEMENT OF
  STRATEGIC GOALS; AND THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE AS AN EFFECTIVE
  INSTRUMENT IN THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM. THIS PAPER CONCLUDES THAT
  THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE (ALONG WITH THE EUROPEAN NON- MILITARY
  RESPONSES) WAS AN EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT IN THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM
  AS MEASURED BY THE DECREASE IN LIBYAN SPONSORED ATTACKS FROM 1986
  TO 1991. HOWEVER, THE U.S. ATTACK ON LIBYA IS STILL AN ISOLATED
  EVENT AND DOES NOT PROVIDE A SUFFICIENT BASIS FOR A DOCTRINE OF
  MILITARY RETALIATION AGAINST TERRORISM.

<P>We know this isn't exactly an infowar issue - or is it? Please do let us know by 
posting your responses to <a href="MAILTO:infowar@infowar.com">infowar@infowar.com</a>

<P>We were asked to help out Insignia Publishing Company who originally brought 
these now unclassified files to light. For reasons, and by persons unknown, 
Insignia Publishing was hacked on November 1, 1996 and all of the files and 
orders for the book "Gassed in the Gulf: An Insider's View of the DoD-CIA 
Cover-up of Gulf War Syndrome,"  by Patrick G. Eddington were erased. 

<P>The book is currently under CIA review. Orders are being taken in prepublication 
mode.  Call 800-606-BOOK (2665).  The  URL for Insignia is  
<a href="http://www.insigniausa.com/">http://www.insigniausa.com/</a>
The site has been restored.  </P>

<h4>Background history, GulfLINK files by Bruce W. Kletz, Insignia Publishing : </h4>

<P>On July 19, 1995 The Department of Defense posted numerous files in its GulfLINK 
Website. On November 3, 1995 Paul F. Wallner, Staff Director, Senior Level 
Oversight Panel, Persian Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, wrote a memo ordering the 
flagging of "potential sensitive reports or documents on GulfLINK. . . .to begin 
preparation of a response on particular 'bombshell' reports." To view this memo 
click here: <a href="Wallner.html-ssi">Wallner Memorandum.</a>

<P>On February 8, 1996, DoD removed 308 files claiming that the files must undergo 
rigorous review for classified information despite their earlier electronic 
publication. Under pressure from veterans groups and the raised visibility of 
front page coverage in the New York Times, DoD returned 88 of these files to the 
website on August 30, 1996. The rest of the missing GulfLINK files remain hidden 
behind vague claims of national security.

<P> All 308 of these files are republished here. The files are presented here as 
they were on the GulfLINK website. The cryptic file names make it difficult for 
first time perusers to navigate the collection, however, <a href="gulflink.txt">partial document titles</a>
are provided to provide some relief. Those files returned to the DoD GulfLINK 
website are marked with an asterisk.

<P>Infowar.Com thanks Mr. Kletz and Insignia Publishing for their permission to 
mirror and offer these files. Their website offers the files for MAC.

<P>   A number of books and periodical articles have appeared in the past few
years which offer insight into a chilling vision of the future of conflict.
It is a vision in which the past more than ever serves as prelude, but with
ample amounts of modern technology folded into the mix. It conjures up
nightmare scenarios of warlord armies, bands of tribal warriors and renegade
banditti spreading death and disorder. At the same time tiny terrorist
cells, renegade computer crackers, mafia- ridden governments, druglord
armies, and religious or political extremists of one stripe or another run
amuck. It promises the continued decline in power and influence of the
nation- state as an entity. It offers deliberate shutdowns, sabotage or
destruction of entire critical networks such as utilities, communications
or transportation. It promises unprecedented damage and casualties from
weapons of mass destruction employed by subnational entities.

<P>   This grim view of the future bears several names. For a good while the
U.S. Marine Corps has called it "fourth generation warfare." A recent
occasional paper from the Association of the United States Army referred to
it as "fourth epoch war." Current military jargon refers to some aspects of
it as "gray area phenomena," "operations other than war," "other military
operations," "peace operations," or "stateless warfare." The National
Strategy Information Center calls it 'global ungovernability.' It hardly
seems proper to call it warfare at all since so much of what goes on can be
categorized more properly as crime, genocide, terrorism, insurgency, revolt,
rebellion or resistance. Since the term "conflict" generally covers all of
the above and more, several of the writers listed below have chosen to use
it to describe this new order of threats.

<P>   This concept of future conflict leaves increasingly little room for most
of the "conventional" military thought encompassed in much of the literature
of the Revolution in Military Affairs, Force XXI or even the AANP (the U.S.
Army War College Strategic Studies Institute's Army After Next Project). A
lot of it goes back to the conflict continuum which was widely used a few
years ago. According to this continuum, as the level of intensity of
conflict increases, the likelihood of it happening decreases. The writers
below believe to one degree or another that we now face a whole new universe
of threats at the low intensity end of the continuum for a number of
reasons.

 <P>  The concepts listed below are drawn from the material mentioned in the
attached bibliography, from hearing certain of the writers speak, and from
conversations and correspondence carried on for about two years now with a
variety of individuals with an interest in the subject. No really simple
synthesis or outline of the concepts involved here exists that I have seen,
thus this effort to create one. Briefly, the important factors defining
future conflict are these:</P>

1) Decline in power and prominence of the nation- state as an entity and the
increasing number of substate entities (breakaway territories, tribes,
warrior bands, terrorist organizations, criminal enterprise armies, etc.)
involved in conflicts. The fragmentation, collapse or increased weakness of
existing nation- states leads to more and more political, economic and
social upheaval or outright violence. It often contributes to genocide,
famine or pestilence, producing additional numbers of starving or diseased
refugees- witness Angola, Lebanon, Biafra, Ethiopia, Liberia, Rwanda,
Burundi, Somalia, the Philippines, Chechnya and the former Yugoslavia among
others. 
<BR>
<BR>
2) Decreasing likelihood of strategic (i.e., nuclear) warfare or
conventional (non- nuclear) major regional conflicts (like Desert Storm)
between nation- states. The probability of other MRC's cannot be totally
ruled out due to certain continuing threats like Iraq or North Korea. Even
so, the near future will likely see fewer "real wars" between or among
nation- states but much more violent conflict on a smaller scale.
<BR>
<BR>
3) Seriously damaging attacks from substate entities are now much more
likely to occur. Such attacks are increasingly possible due to several
important factors, which encompass the classic trilogy of motive, means and
opportunity:
<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
 a) "Trickle- down" of weapons of mass destruction- chemical, biological and
 nuclear. Note the Japanese subway attack, the Tamil chemical attack on the
 Sri Lankan army, the Moscow "park surprise" of ionizing material which the
 Chechens threatened to spread with conventional explosives, the recent
 threat to irradiate local U.S. government officials by someone who did have
 radium, the recent deliberate poisoning with nuclear material of a lab
 worker, etc. It is a real surprise that no identifiable non-state use of
 biological agents has taken place recently, though reports indicate that
 certain fringe  groups are definitely giving thought to the possibility.
 Arrests have taken place fairly recently in the U.S. of people possessing
 or transporting biological materials.   
<BR>
<BR>
 b) Increasing availability of "talent" looking for any paying job or
 willing to serve because of personal ideology provides greater access to
 knowledge and skills for substate entities. This includes trained
 intelligence and security operatives as well as nuclear engineers,
 biologists, chemists, etc.
<BR>
<BR>
 c) Increasing availability of tactical light and heavy weapons to anyone
 with the money to purchase them- note especially the recent offers from
 Chinese arms merchants to sell assault rifles, light machine guns, RPG's,
 shoulder- launched SAMs and even tanks in the U.S. Likewise note the
 continued willingness of certain "rogue states" to supply arms and high
 explosives to terrorist groups.
 <BR>
<BR>
 d) Increasing access to the amount of funds needed to mount significant
 attacks. Even though much state sponsorship has dried up, extortion,
 kidnapping, robberies or drug related activities can easily fund substate
 efforts. Also, ideologically motivated groups can and will do more on a
 shoestring- note the World Trade Center and OKC bombings as examples.
<BR>
<BR>
 e) Increased difficulty by potential victims in targeting small substate
 entities either in time to prevent an attack or to retaliate after one has
 happened.
<BR>
<BR>
 f) Increased willingness of substate groups to carry out significant
 attacks for ideological reasons or for profit in the absence of controls
 formerly exercised by the major Cold War participants or by strong central
 governments now weakened or collapsed. The fragmentation of nations and the
 political, ethnic or religious factionalization of groups of people make
 tensions more likely to result in violence. 
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
4) Increasing urbanization of populations on a global scale concentrates
greater numbers of people in smaller geographic areas, vastly increasing
their vulnerability to attacks on infrastructure (power, water,
transportation, communications). Crowded cities are also most vulnerable to
attacks by weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, biological),
even if these attacks are carried out in relatively unsophisticated fashion.
Given the increasing weight of urban areas as centers of gravity, urban
combat is increasingly likely.
<BR>
<BR>
5) Strategic and heavy conventional arsenals can provide little or no
deterrent to prevent substate entities from mounting significant attacks
since they cannot be brought to bear successfully on targets impossible to
identify or separate from the surrounding population of innocents. A
developing interest in nonlethal or less than lethal technologies is a
direct result of this problem.
<BR>
<BR>
6) Infowar threats are increasingly visible, possible and some
significant attacks are happening now. Since this is a relatively cheap and
often nearly invisible method of attack, with good potential for success
if mounted correctly, it is bound to continue and grow more popular. In
addition, the Internet is increasingly being used as a vehicle for garnering
political support and spreading propaganda as well.
<BR>
<BR>
7) Casualty avoidance has become a major though seldom addressed issue.
Searing images of American casualties dragged through the streets have an
impact on the American public that heretofore has not come into play to such
a degree.
<BR>
<BR>
8) The "CNN effect" is now an issue. The public at home can see disturbing
battlefield images with unprecedented rapidity, approaching real-
time. Whether the casualties and damage displayed by the media are inflicted
on allies or enemies, the effect of seeing them is unsettling to many and
the political repercussions of this are well understood by many groups
seeking media attention.
<BR>
<BR>
9) Resource scarcity, natural disasters, population pressures, endemic
corruption, new plagues and economic problems place more strain on nation-
states, making local or regional violence more likely and its spread to
adjacent areas more of a threat. Up to a certain point political pressure
will demand American intervention in certain of these areas, putting U.S.
nationals at risk of attack from disgruntled groups or exposure to other
hazards. This will lead either to wider involvement in difficult situations
and subsequent additional casualties or embarrasing withdrawals, making
policy decisions ever more critical and complicated.
</UL>

<P>   What is the upshot of all this? Assuming the writers below are correct,
the future promises to hold a great many instances of natural disaster,
epidemic, famine, political collapse, social disruption and violence. Many
of these problems by definition fall squarely into the lap of U. S. Army
Special Operations Forces. At a time when these new threats seem to be
emerging over the distant horizon the forces most capable of dealing with
them increasingly face budget constraints and personnel cutbacks. Political
pressures will almost certainly result in a degree of American
involvement in at least some of these situations for the forseeable future.

<P>   Individually none of these threats are necessarily dangerous to U.S.
national security, but taken together as indications of developing trends
they threaten to be collectively overwhelming. The old assumption of
"Fortress America" is no longer tenable either, as porous borders,
relatively large ethnic populations and dissent and divisiveness make
abundantly clear. There are some significant decisions to be made in the
very near future, and some of them will no doubt be unpleasant. The worst
thing we could do would be to allow ourselves to be taken unaware as a
result of failing to make some hard choices while there's time.

<P>   New tanks, stealth planes, arsenal ships or missile defense systems won't
mean much to a couple of extremists with a truck bomb, a computer virus or a
container full of anthrax, either here or abroad. The RMA continues along
the trajectory of preparing for the next MRC, and that is a good and
necessary idea. Unfortunately it is not likely to be enough by itself. The
writers below tell us that we must prepare for a new order of threats from
unexpected quarters by unsuspected means on the lower end of the spectrum of
conflict. As always, the odds are that's where the greatest number of
potential problems lie, though they might not be as serious as a MRC.

<P>   New responses to new- order threats and new answers to old problems will
be necessary if these threats are to be successfully met. Unbounded hysteria
and irresponsible fearmongering are not productive approaches to a set of
problems which call for calm , responsible reasoning, careful planning and
thorough preparation. The writers below do a good job of defining these
threats. It's now up to the political leadership and to law enforcement and
military officials to determine how best to counter them- without damaging
or destroying the society they're trying to save in the process.

<P>  
This form allows you to search and retrieve White House documents on
the basis of their electronic publication dates and their categories.

<P>Overview:  This computer-generated form allows you to find documents
published between certain dates according to the categories for the
document. After you submit this form, the mail server will process your
search and return to you another form containing the matching documents.
To obtain the actual documents, you will need return the second form
after selecting the documents of interest.

<P>For best results, please try to answer the questions using the narrowest
time period and the most precise category specification.  This will
produce faster turn around time and a smaller number of documents.

<P>The categories used in this form are the same ones used to distribute
documents.  A brief listing of the categories is provided in this form,
but if you want a more precise search, you may wish to obtain the
detailed explanation of the categories, available on the ROOT
form or via the subject line command, SEND CATEGORIES.

<P>This form provides services based on your answers to a series of
questions.  Each question has instructions explaining what it does and
the valid responses. Normally, you need to answer only those questions
related to the specific service that you want.  After the valid
responses, each question has a prompt, which is a series of CAPITALIZED
WORDS surrounded by arrows. Do NOT erase these important symbols,
because the computer needs them to recognize your answer.  Please type
your selection from the valid responses immediately after the second
arrow at each prompt.  Unless otherwise indicated, your responses should
be on the same line as the prompt.  In most questions, answers are case
insensitive, and multiple choices are delimited by spaces or commas.

<P>After you have filled out the form, mail it back to the publications
mail server that automatically processes your requests:</P>

<P>   This year I had the honor to be an invited speaker at the 50th annual 
Asilomar Conference of the World Affairs Council.  This year's topic: 
"Hard Copy" or Hard News? - Media & Foreign Affairs.

<P>I gave a guided tour of the Internet, "live," followed by some very 
lively Q&A.  I've appended the 50 Urls from my hand-out as being of 
possible interest to some members of this list:

<P>... some think tanks, Rick Smolan's recent experiment in multimedia 
publishing (24 Hours in Cyberspace ~ now out as a book with an
enhanced CD-ROM), some megasite jumpstations, news feeds, web zines,
news paperless, Howard Frederick's Communications class' home page
at Emerson College, etc.

<P>Oh, and by the way, if you're ever at Asilomar, (Pacific Coast), 
I *highly* recommend their regular "Nature Walk with Ranger."

<P>   CIABASE is a computer data base on the Central Intelligence
Agency that provides a vital, easy-to-use, historical resource for
policy makers, academicians, journalists, activists, and students.</P>

<P>   CIABASE consists of ten plus megabytes of data, divided into 100+
categories containing over 33,000 annotated and sourced entries,
for hard disk IBM compatible and MACINTOSH personal computers.</P>

 <P>  CIABASE provides data on the CIA and other individual or
organizational entities, from information gleaned from 850+
sources of various political ideologies -- congressional
reports, newspapers, and magazines, including more than 500
books.

<P>   CIABASE provides rapid access to specific data, scanning in
seconds the entire collection for word, or word-combinations, plus
date requests; e.g."Covert Action" "China" "94-95," or, "Domestic
Operations," "96." Results can be displayed, printed, or sent to
user-named files for editing or transmitting.

Users comments:

<P>   Professor of intelligence at American University, and formerly
Commandant of the the Defense Intelligence College, John Macartney,
said "CIABASE remains a one-of-a-kind, extraordinary resource for
serious scholars, journalists, and researchers, regardless of their
political leanings and research interests...there are no alternates
out there. If there were, they would undoubtedly sell for thousands
of dollars....I am in awe of the massive effort....in short I have
found CIABASE invaluable, indeed indispensable..."
Dr. John Macartney, American University.

<P>   "An outstanding job." Seymour Hersh, Pulitzer-prize-winning
journalist.

<P>   "A tremendously useful tool for any reporter or researcher."
The Nation.

<P>   "A powerful tool that includes obscure sources and a
comprehensive cross-index." The Progressive.

<P>   "An encyclopedia of CIA actions." San Francisco Chronicle.

<P>   "An amazing addition to the information world....
it is absolutely indispensable." Louis Wolf, editor
Covert Action Quarterly.

<P>   "Former CIA officer Ralph McGehee has recently updated his
excellent CIABASE system adding information from a number of new
on-line or printed publications..." "Intelligence" an on-line
magazine on worldwide developments in intelligence, 9/11/95.

<P>   The CIA called Ralph McGehee, who compiled CIABASE, an
analyst with few peers. McGehee served 25 years in the CIA,
14 years overseas as an operations officer and 11 years at its
headquarters.  Upon leaving the CIA, McGehee wrote the book
"Deadly Deceits" and began the multi-year process of compiling
CIABASE.  McGehee is a recognized authority on the CIA and has
testified many times both in Congress and in the courts and has
appeared numerous times on radio and TV.

<H4>Reporting Computer Crimes</h4>

If you are the victim of any kind of computer crime or other violation in Cyberspace, report it.

If there's any question about who to report it to, call your local police department, your state police or the FBI and ask for help.  While most computer crimes do invite investigation, jurisdiction is sometimes confusing, so you may have to stick with it until you find the right group.<P>

<P><CENTER>DISCUSSION FORUM FOR USER INPUT NOW AVAILABLE
FROM THE INTERNET'S PREMIER SOFTWARE SITE </CENTER>

<P>AUSTIN, TX (November 11, 1996) -- The world's premier web site for Internet 
applications announced today a 
new conferencing system that will allow users to share their opinions on 
applications and software 
packages freely available on the World Wide Web. The Consummate Winsock Apps 
List (The CWSApps List), in 
partnership with the Spring World Wide Web site, offers the new system as an 
extension of its already 
free Internet software services. In addition to previously offering users 
up-to-date information and 
reviews for the latest and greatest software available on the Internet, The 
CWSApps List will now be 
able to give its users a voice in the process as well. 

<P>Both novice and expert users will be able to benefit by having immediate access 
to input from one of the 
Internet's most respected software gurus as well as from the millions of users 
that frequent The CWSApps 
List. Applications reviewed and available for discussion at the sites include 
e-mail clients, WWW (World 
Wide Web) browsers, Usenet newsreaders, FTP (file transfer protocol) clients, 
HTML (Hyper Text Markup 
Language) editors, VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) browsers, and more. 
In addition, the sites 
offer auxiliary Internet applications including virus scanners, image viewing 
and manipulation tools, 
compression utilities, and spelling checkers. 

<P>Integrating users into the process of reviewing, categorizing, and rating 
Internet software is expected 
to be the primary benefit of the new conferencing section. In addition, novice 
users will find extensive 
resources for getting up and running with the best software for use on the 
Internet. Experts will be 
able to discuss with their peers the best uses for existing software, including 
new features that need 
to be added and existing problems that need to be addressed. The need for new 
applications to satisfy 
unmet user needs is another anticipated benefit. 

<P>New users to the system can browse the available topics but will first need to 
register in order to 
fully utilize the conferencing and input your own comments (registration is 
free). At this point, a user 
can access more than 300 individual forums based on the software applications 
reviewed by The CWSApps 
List. Access is available to each forum through the full review section for each 
application featured on 
the list. A comprehensive listing of conference areas is also available at 
<a href="http://www.spring.com/yapp-bin/public/browse/apps/all">http://www.spring.com/yapp-bin/public/browse/apps/all</a>. 

<P>No other service on the Internet will make it easier for users to obtain the 
newest applications, 
information on these applications, and opinions from both satistifed and 
unsatisfied customers. Both The 
CWSApps List site itself and the conferencing section will be updated daily in 
order to ensure that 
users have immediate access to the newest products and the latest information on 
their favorite 
applications. Help files and informational links to aid users in troubleshooting 
apps and learning more 
about clients will be provided as well as comprehensive reviews for more than 
300 different software 
applications. These free services will continue to be available to anyone with 
Internet access and a 
World Wide Web browser. Available Web browsers include Netscape Navigator, NCSA 
Mosaic, and Internet 
Explorer. 

<P>The CWSApps List is a World Wide Web site located at <a href="www.cwsapps.com">www.cwsapps.com</a> and 
<a href="www.stroud.com">www.stroud.com</a> that offers 
users links to the most popular Internet software clients on the net. In 
addition to providing easy 
access to these programs, The CWSApps List rates and reviews each application, 
providing critical 
information on each program including the newest version available, recent 
changes, home page links, and 
much more. The CWSApps List is, quite simply, the single most important 
reference for Windows 3.x, 95, 
and NT Internet applications on the World Wide Web. The CWSApps List currently 
has mirror sites at more 
than forty locations in twenty different countries. Together these sites receive 
over two million hits a 
day. The list is maintained in its entirety by Forrest H. Stroud, 
<a href="MAILTO:neuroses@tcac.com">neuroses@tcac.com</a>.

<P>The Spring is Austin, Texas version of the WELL.  The Spring supports 
conferences on many 
subjects of cultural, poltical, and educational interest.  Topics include tv, 
movies, books,
music, politics, cultures, spirit, the net, unix, vitual communities, sports, 
performing 
arts, the austin scene, and more.  </P>

<BR>
Conference, and Exhibition,<BR>
February 24-28, 1997<BR>
<BR>
Workshop for Senior Managers and IS Professionals<BR>
February 17-21, 1997<BR>
<BR>

The Inter-Island Hotel<BR>
Anguilla, BWI<BR>
<BR>

<P>The world's  first peer-reviewed conference on financial cryptography,
FC97, will be held Monday through Friday, February 24-28, 1997, from 8:30am
until 12:30pm, at the Inter-Island Hotel on the Carribbean island of
Anguilla.

<P>In conjunction with the conference, the Inter-Island Hotel will also be the
site of an intensive 40-hour workshop for senior managers and IS
professionals, during the week preceeding the conference (February 17-21),
and an exhibition for financial cryptography vendors, from 10am-6pm during
the week of conference itself.

<P>The goals of the combined conference, workshop, and exhibition are to
provide a peer-reviewed forum for important research in financial
cryptography and the effects it will have on society,  to give senior
managers and IS professionals a solid understanding of the fundamentals of
strong cryptgraphy as applied to financial operations on public networks,
and to showcase the newest products in the field. In addition, plenty of
time has been left open in the afternoon and evening for sponsored
corporate functions and activities, for business networking, and, of
course, for recreational activities on Anguilla itself.

<P>As one of the principals of the conference joked, "We hope that people will
treat the conference and the other activities more as a working vacation,
rather than, er, vacating work."

<P>Conference participants are encouraged to bring their families.</P>



<B>The Conference</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Ray Hirschfeld, the conference chair, has picked an outstanding group of
professionals and researchers, in financial cryptography, and in related
fields, to review the papers for this conference.</P>
<BR>
They are:<BR>

Chairman: Rafael Hirschfeld, CWI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands<BR>
<BR>
Matthew Franklin, AT&T Laboratories--Research, Murray Hill, NJ, USA<BR>
Michael Froomkin, U. Miami School of Law, Coral Gables, FL, USA<BR>
Arjen Lenstra, Citibank, New York, NY, USA<BR>
Mark Manasse, Digital Equipment Corporation, Palo Alto, CA, USA<BR>
Kevin McCurley, Sandia Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, USA<BR>
Charles Merrill, McCarter & English, Newark, NJ, USA<BR>
Clifford Neuman, Information Sciences Institute, Marina del Rey, CA, USA<BR>
Sholom Rosen, Citibank, New York, NY, USA<BR>
Israel Sendrovic, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, NY, USA<BR>
<BR>
<P>Some of the names may be recognizable to you. But, if they're not, included
in that list are the inventor of Millicent, the head of EU's CAFE digital
cash project, the holders of Citicorp's digital cash patent, two famous
scholars in cryptography and digital commerce law, the Chair of Eurocrypt
'96, and the Chairman of the Taskforce on the Security of Electronic Money
for the Bank for International Settlements.

<P>If we'd gotten any more talent, we couldn't have had a conference, because
the committee can't review the work of it's own members!

<P>The actual agenda of the conference will be determined by the papers the
program committee selects, so we won't have a final schedule for the
conference until the middle of January. However, the conference committee
is selecting papers in what it considers the union, and not the
intersection, of the fields of finance and cryptography.

<P>Examples of topics it will consider are:</P>
<PRE>
    Anonymous Payments                      Fungibility

<P>Financial Cryptography '97 is held in cooperation with the
International Association for Cryptologic Research. The conference
proceedings will be published on the web by the Journal for Internet
Banking and Commerce. <a href="http://www.arraydev.com/commerce/JIBC/">http://www.arraydev.com/commerce/JIBC/</a>.

<P>For further information on submitting a paper to the FC97, and other
details about the program of the conference, please see program committee's
web-page at <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/conferences/FC97">http://www.cwi.nl/conferences/FC97</a>.


<P>On the lighter side, the conference will be covered by Wired Magazine, and
will be the featured conference in it's January 1997, (ahem...) "Deductible
Junkets" section. So, you might want to register, and make your plane and
hotel reservations, before the rush begins...

<P>The price of a pass to the conference sessions and exhibits is $1,000 U.S.

<P>(Since we're on Anguilla, and there are no taxes of any kind, we thought
we'd keep prices in nice round numbers, just to make things interesting.
:-).)

<P>The price includes breakfast at the conference, some stipends for
presenters who need them, and the logistics of having a professional
conference with high-bandwidth internet connectivity in a location like
Anguilla. In looking around, however, the conference organizers *did*
notice that FC97 price is in keeping with other business and professional
technology conferences of similar total session length, so everything seems
to work out. The market *is* efficient, after all.

<P>You can register, and pay for, your conference ticket at:</P>

<a href="http://www.offshore.com.ai/fc97/">http://www.offshore.com.ai/fc97/</a><BR>


<BR>
<B>The Exhibition</B><BR>

<P>Concurrent with the conference will be the the FC97 Exhibition, a small
trade show for financial cryptography products and services. Each booth
will have high bandwidth access to the internet (yes, there *are* T1s in
Anguilla), and will get 2 conference passes. Booth prices start at $5,000
US. Please contact Julie Rackliffe at <mailto: rackliffe@tcm.org> for
further information . As space is limited, please register as soon as
possible if you plan to be there.</P>



<B>The Workshop</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>We are especially honored to have Ian Goldberg as the leader of the FC97
Workshop, which will run one week prior to the conference, February 17-21,
1997.

<P>Ian, the cryptographer at Berkeley who was made famous last year (in
articles in both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times) for
breaking Netscape's transaction security protocols, will be running an
intensive, 5-day workshop for senior managers and technology professionals.

<P>While the workshop is still being developed, and will depend on the skills
of the planned participants, workshop topics will include, but not be
limited to:</P>

The Internet (depending on the background of the participants)<BR>
Overview and background of cryptography<BR>
Survey of existing and proposed Internet payment systems<BR>
Details on some specific payment systems<BR>
Issues involved in setting up a secure Internet site<BR>

<P>And, depending on whether Ian finishes coding it (it looks likely), a
step-by-step walkthrough of setting up an ecash-enabled Web server.

<P>Ian has recruited strong roster of instructors with credentials similar to
his own, and, as he plans to maintain a 5-1 student/teacher ratio, the size
of the workshop will be restricted and 2 months advance registration well
be required.

<P>Further information about the workshop can be found at:

<P><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~iang/fc97/workshop.html">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~iang/fc97/workshop.html</a>

<P>The planned price for the workshop is $5,000. This covers lab space,
hardware, network access, software, and, of course, 40 hours of instruction
and structured lab activity. The lab itself will be open 24 hours a day, if
demand warrants it.

<P>Sponsorship Opportunities

<P>FC97 offers many exciting sponsorship opportunities at all levels.
Corporations are encouraged to to be an exclusive sponsor for lunch or
dinner, each of which will be followed by a recreational activity of some
kind. Sponsors will have the opportunity to permanently attach their name
to these important networking functions, which the organizers hope will be
a large part of the conference experience. There are 10 such events being
planned, and 10 corporations will be accepted for sponsorship. Corporate
sponsors of these events will also get a substantial initial discount on
exhibit space, and complementary conference tickets.

<P>In-kind sponsorship is available at all levels of support, with
opportunities for companies to provide networking, bandwidth, hardware,
radio pocket modems and equipment, as well as design and print services,
transportation, entertainment, catering, sunscreen and, well, if you've got
it and you think we'll need it, let us know about it -- we probably do.

<P>Please contact Julie Rackliffe at <a href="mailto: rackliffe@tcm.org">rackliffe@tcm.org</a> for further
sponsorship information.



<P>Air Transportation and Hotels

<P>Air travel to Anguilla is typically done through either St. Thomas for US
flights, or St. Maarten/Martin for flights from Europe. Several non-stop
flights a day from various US and European locations can be made to either
destination. Connection through to Anguilla can be made through American
Eagle, or through LIAT. See your travel agent for details. American Eagle
Airlines has agreed to increase their flights as needed to accomodate any
extra traffic the conference brings to the island.

<P>Anguilla's runway is 3600 feet, with a displaced threshold of 600 feet, and
can accomodate business jets. Obviously, you should talk to your own FBO
for details about your own aircraft's capabilities in this regard.

<P>Anguilla import duties are not imposed on hardware or software which will
leave the island again, so, as long as you take it with you when you leave
you won't pay taxes for leaving it there.

<P>Hotels range from spartan to luxurious, and more information about hotels
on Anquilla can be obtained from your travel agent, or at
<a href="http://offshore.com.ai/">http://offshore.com.ai/</a>.</P>



<P>Why Anguilla?

<P>We picked Anguilla for two reasons, both of them mildly political. The
first is, of course, the US ITARs, which classify cryptography as a
"munition" and restrict it's export. Thus, every effort will be made to
highlight the absurdity of these regulations through the use of foriegn
software, "leaked" software, and, of course, where necessary, US-exportable
"crippleware", in the networking and server software of the conference and
workshop. Of course, the conference content itself is not a violation of
the ITARs, as the "munitions" being exported are in the heads of the
attendees, or on paper, and thus not (typically!) subject to the US ITARs.
Consider it a mild tweak on the nose of the Clinton Administration, in an
era of 56-bit exportable keysize maxima.

<P>The other mildly political reason is that Anguilla is a tax haven. There
are no taxes except import duties. None. No income, capital gains, sales,
excise, or property taxes -- none. Anguilla's banking secrecy laws are about
the finest there are anywhere.

<P>This is important to the organizers of the conference because most of the
other proposed regulations of financial cryptography, particularly those of
"token", or "note" based systems, are because they enable cash settlement,
even perfectly anonymous cash settlement, of transactions of practically
any size. Economic reality is not optional; if, in fact, the significantly
reduced cost of these technologies make auditable "book-entry" transaction
settlement obsolete, then there isn't much that the taxation or
law-enforcement authorities of the world's nation-states can do about it.
We consider countries like Anguilla an existance proof of the concept. Any
attempt to restrict these technologies will only backfire on nations
attempting to do so. Nation-states will simply have to develop taxation and
law enforcement methods other than auditing book-entries. In fact, most
central bankers and financial crime enforcement professionals who
understand the technology also realize this, so, of course, our point is
only *mildly* political, at this stage of the argument, anyway.

<P>Of course, the fact that Anguilla's average daytime temperature in February
is in the low 80's farenheit, and that of, say, Boston, is in the low 20's,
and the fact that cyclonic storms are in the *other* hemisphere that time
of year, has *nothing*, we say, *nothing* to do with our decision to hold a
conference there. We're simply shocked you would suggest such a thing.
Neither, for that matter, does the fact that the average water visibility
on Anguilla's coral reefs can be measured in hundreds of feet (if you can
see that far for the blinding riot of color, that is...).</P>

<P>
Cryptography, the work of creating and deciphering coded information using
mathematical formulas, long has been the sphere of spies and the military.
But in the past 10 years private-sector use of cryptography has exploded as
a result of advances in electronic communications and information
technologies.  Decisions about national cryptography policy now have
important implications not only for national security, but also for U.S.
economic competitiveness, law enforcement interests, and the protection of
the privacy and other rights of individuals.  The Computer Science and
Telecommunications Board of the National Research Council recently
completed a congressionally mandated study to examine the issues and
conflicting interests involved in cryptography and made recommendations on
national policy in this highly controverial area.

<BR>
<P>

<P> Co-sponsored by the Communication, Culture, and Technology program of the Graduate 
School of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University</P>

<P>SATURDAY, OCTOBER 19</P></h4>
<P>KEYNOTE SPEAKER - RALPH NADER (invited); consumer advocate and
founder of the Center for the Study of Responsive Law; Green Party
presidential candidate.</P>

<P>THE COMMUNICATIONS TSUNAMI - In today's world of corporate mergers 
and the mega-packaging of services, what's at stake for consumers
and who will represent their views? What is the meaning of "public
interest" in the new digital environment? Panelists will examine
the ramifications and effects of the Telecommunications Act in such
critical areas as universal service, the opening of local exchanges
to competition, the provision of fair pricing rules, and the 
stewardship of the dazzling array of emerging broadband services. </P>  


<P>TOOLKITS FOR ACTIVISTS - Media giants and merger-mania dominate the
public dialogue on communications issues. How can activists at the
local, state, and national levels develop an effective voice in the
currently one-sided debate over changes in the marketplace and the
regulatory environment? How can community-based organizations use
the Internet as a tool for online organizing, enhancing public
interest campaigns and increasing the efficiency of their internal
communications?</P>

<P>THE INTERNET: COMMERCIALIZATION, GLOBALIZATION, AND GOVERNANCE - The
accelerating commercialization and globalization of the Internet
raises new and divisive problems of governance and control that
will profoundly affect the future of the net and all of its users.
What is the outlook in key areas like pricing schemes, access to
information and services, and Internet telephony?</P>

<P>INFORMATION RIGHTS - New information technologies and the policy
responses to them raise many critical issues related to information
rights on the Internet. Panelists will discuss these topics in
detail, including the Communications Decency Act and freedom of
speech online, copyright protection, and threats to privacy from
the collection of personal information online.</P>

<P>COMPUTERS AND ELECTIONS: RISKS, RELIABILITY, AND REFORM - There are
widespread, legitimate concerns about the accuracy, integrity, and
security of computer-generated vote totals. Panelists will explore
the technical, social, and political origins of these concerns
within the context of today's little-scrutinized election system.
They will also make recommendations for changes in the areas of
technology, election law, accountability, and oversight.  </P>

<P><b>SUNDAY, OCTOBER 20</b> will feature WORKSHOPS on: communications access
and the consumer; broadcasting and mass media; civic networking;
media tactics and outreach; Internet legal issues; and using the
Internet for political action. The 1996 CPSR Annual Meeting will
take place Sunday afternoon. All conference attendees are welcome.</P>

 Historically, civil defense has meant to protect citizenry against hostile 
military actions. Today, with the specter of Information Warfare representing 
new challenges to late-industrial and information age nation-states, the rules
have radically changed. Societies are rapidly migrating to increased dependance
upon four critical interrelated infrastructures and adequate methods of
protection must be developed:<P>

<UL> 

<LI>The Power grid is the basis of most of modern society. With it gone,
not much else happens.  If you think this is just a matter of building more
generators, think again--what happens if the factories that *make* the
generators are taken down, too? <BR>
 
 <LI>The Communications infrastructure: land, sea, air and satellite. 95% of
military communications go over the public networks, and 100% of all financial
and industrial communications. Is it worth protecting?
 <BR>
 <LI>The Global Financial structure depends upon the first two
infrastructures, and is perhaps the most vulnerable to theft and denial of
service attack.  99+% of all "wealth" is digital--what happens if it vaporizes?<BR>
 
 <LI>Transportation systems rely upon the other three. The air traffic
systems require both power and communications to manage the thousands of
airplanes in the sky.  What happens to the thousands of airplanes in the air
if air traffic control across an entire country goes down?<BR>
 
 Without all of these infrastructures properly and reliably functioning, the private sector and the national security community cannot function. No heat, no
air conditioning, no food distribution, no light, no radio or TV, no Internet.
Are we prepared?  Do we have a a crisis response for the day money as we  know
it vanishes?<P>
 
 Electronic Civil Defense will soon become a critical component of any nation's
well being while the needs of both the private sector and government converge.
The convergence of military and civilian interests that Mr. Schwartau predicted
two years ago is happening before our eyes. Defensive and commercial postures
have so intertwined as to make them indistinguishable.<P>
 
 This Fifth International Conference on Information Warfare is an unclassified,
open source forum, and will examine the myriad questions of Electronic Civil
Defense from the US, International and multi-cultural perspectives.
 <P>
 Our seasoned experts will work with InfoWarCon5 delegates to outline a
framework for the vulnerabilities, threats, risks and solutions for Electronic
Civil Defense.  From this conference participants will be able to draw critical
insights which will improve their own legislative, regulatory, financial, and
operational readiness and security.  Last year's Washington InfoWarCon brought
together over 600 people and was covered by CNN among other major media
organizations. This year key world players in information warfare from the
economic, military, and law enforcement communities of over 30 countries are
expected to participate.    Be prepared for highly interactive sessions with
plenty of audience participation.  Please bring  your opinions and be ready to
discuss them with us all!<P>

 	C4	USAF School of Advanced Airpower Studies<BR>
 			Moderated by Col. Richard Szafranski, USAF, Air War 
			College National Military Strategy<BR>
 <BR>
 	
Col. Szafranski and his top students will discuss their views, 
 opinions on Information Warfare.  The USAF SAAS has produced some of the
most revolutionary papers in IW, including the now globally recognized papers
on taking down telecommunications and national power systems.<P>

 				Dr. Dan Kuehl, NDU<BR>
 <BR>
 	While CNN is looking over your shoulder, as a  	military commander, here is your choice: either use a precision 
 	smart bomb which will immediately kill 20 civilians for the world 
 	to see. Or, use a non-lethal IW weapon, no immediate TV deaths, 
 	but a predicted 200 civilian collateral fatalities within 30 days. 
 	What do you do? The Ethical conundra of Information Warfare will 
 	be examined from all perspectives.  Or: you have been attacked
	anonymously--you suspect one party, without proof--another
	attack is coming.  What now?  Should we develop new intelligence
	capabilities to permit precision detection and response in
	cyberwar?<P>

				Carl Ripa, VP National Security/Emergency 
					Preparedness, Bellcore<P>

 	Experts from the major civilian infrastructures will discuss how 
 	past cooperation between industry and government has echoed 
 	economic realities. The bulk of the nations information 
 	infrastructure is not under the economic or regulatory control of the 
 	Federal government. So, how do we maintain a healthy balance 
 	between private initiative and legislative and regulatory
 	actions? Today there is no "due diligence" standard which
	requires that communications and computing services be guaranteed
	in terms of security and data integrity.  Our panel will provoke
	an active discussion of remedial cooperative measures.<P>

Interview:<BR>

<P>En hier is dan het eerste echte Giga-Interview. Niet zoals aangekondigd
met Dan Farmer, maar wel met Winn Schwartau, die zich bezighoudt met
Information Warfare.

<P>Als je daar meer over wilt weten kun je:
<UL>
- op Winn's site kijken, http://www.infowar.com/ ;<BR>
- zijn boek "Information Warfare, Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway"
  lezen (Thunder's Mouth Press, 1994). Dit boek is een droog verhaal
  over wat Information Warfare is en wat je ertegen kunt doen. Niet echt
  een aanrader;<BR>
- zijn boek "Terminal Compromise" (Inter.Pact Press, 1993) lezen. Dit is
  een echter techno-roman, onderhoudend en spannend. Wel een aanrader,
  temeer omdat dit boek ook het eerste shareware boek is, je kunt het
  gratis van Internet downloaden (bijvoorbeeld van ftp.eu.net als
   /documents/published/books/terminal-compromise/termcomp.zip).<BR>
</UL>
<P>Het interview is voornamelijk geschreven n.a.v. het boek "Information
Warfare".</P>

Walter=Walter Belgers<BR>
Winn=Winn Schartau<BR>

<P>Walter: The book "Information Warfare" is clearly written from the
US perspective. It repeatedly states the US are the victims of
information crimes. Don't you think every country in the world uses
information warfare in one way or another? Contrary to your beliefs
("Shouldn't we try to [..] do a little industrial and economic spying
of our own?") I think (know) that the US is involved in information
warfare and industrial spying at this very moment.

<P>Winn: The US perspective - yup; you're right. Any society or country
that depends upon its infrastructure for survival is just as
vulnerable as the US. And every day that is becoming truer and
truer. Infowar is only now coming out of the closet. Don't forget
that when I wrote it, Infowar was still classified by the US
military.  The book broke thru the veils of secrecy. Yes, we do
some spying, but not as an open collaboration between the government
and the private sector.  Spies may be willing to die for their
country, but not for IBM or Exxon. Our primary infowar capabilities
are for the military at this point. I am working with several
countries in this area to develop a greater convergence between
the government and private sector. Common electronic civil defense
is the answer.

<P>Walter: You say that people suffer from "Binary Schizophrenia",
they are afraid of the amount of control computers have, and that
they want to have control themselves. I see just the opposite,
people want to run Windows 95 on Plug & Play computers, and credit
cards and other things that make life easy (sic). What makes you
say they want control?

<P>Winn: Plug and Play is the problem, exactly. People do not really
know what is going on underneath the cover and behind the PLAY
button. They want the convenience without knowing the insides. And
when something goes wrong, they rightfully so, blame the computers.
The schizophrenia is "I need and want computers, but I hate them
at the same time." Only a very small percentage of the population
really knows the technology.

<P>Walter: What is your definition of a hacker? In "Information
Warfare", you say hackers cracked into hundreds of computer sites
in February 1994 and stole hundreds of thousands of passwords using
sophisticated software.  To me, those are not hackers but vandals.
I also think the software is not sophisticated. If somebody invents
a nail, and I put it on the road to cause flat tires, I'm just a
vandal that doesn't do anything sophisticated.

<P>Winn: Simplicity is the best way to commit a crime. The difference
between hackers and criminals is indeed gray. I prefer to think of
it as an issue of capabilities rather than intentions. And yes,
the lines are emerging: hacker, cracker, criminal, terrorist. In
Apollo 13, the NASA engineers hacked with the tools they had
available to them to save the astronauts lives. Hacking is the use
and stretching of technology to its limits.

<P>Walter: Some new threats you see in the information society are
HERF guns and van Eck eavesdropping. I first saw a demonstration of
van Eck on Dutch television in the early 80s, but recently I've
heard from several people who investigated van Eck that its practical
use is almost zero because of interference with other systems (it's
rare to have just one monitor in a room). Where did you get your
results?

<P>Winn: That statement is inaccurate. I have built my own Van Eck
devices and it is indeed easy to distinguish between monitors
because of differences in relative horizontal scan frequencies. At
trade shows we could pick and choose our targets from hundreds on
the floor, lock into the hotel systems or surveillance cameras.
Whoever hasn't played with these systems just doesn't understand
how they work.

<P>Walter: Who are the bad guys anyway? I don't think many Information
Warriors will cause great havoc if they're working alone. I'm afraid
of Information Warriors that get orders from big institutions/countries.
You even say the White House ordered the IRS to investigate tax
records.  One of the creapiest things I've ever seen was a movie
about the US having a military base in England where most satellite
traffic was intercepted and scanned for information. Should we be
afraid of people operating on the edge of the law when we're being
attacked by multinationals?

<P>Winn: The whole point is capabilities. Whether it's over exuberant
law enforcement, or big companies gone mad; or the White House
going over the edge, it's the same thing. This is about motivation
and intention - and that almost doesn't matter.  The bad guys are
anyone with the technology, the know-how and an attitude.

<P>Walter: Is there a way to protect yourself against an attack? You
say "most companies don't plan for one, much less two, disasters
at a time" but "We can defeat the Information Warrior". How can we
if we get, say, 10 disasters at a time? How can we protect against
EMPT/Y bombs?

<P>Winn: The first defense is a board or executive level policy which
says, "we recognize the value of our information and info-systems
and want to protect ourselves against our potential adversaries."
This must be a corporate mandate.

<P>Two, institute proper perimeter control mechanisms, firewalls,
replace passwords with decent idenfitication mechanisms, get rid
of floppy drives, train security guards properly, institute waste
management procedures.

<P>Three. Train, retrain and retrain again. Staff, management, lawyers,
accoutnants, human resources etc.

<P>Four. Develop contingency plans for the Acts of Man as well as the
Acts of God. Learn how to think like the Bad Guys.

<P>Against EMP and HERF? Today, it's too hard and expensive to defend
that at the front lines. If someone uses that, today, you have to
retreat, regroup and get a response mechanism in place. The technology
to defend is unwieldly, and is not perfect. But, we are working on
it.

<P>Walter: Can you still enjoy computers and computer networks?

<P>Winn: Yes, but only with adult supervision. :-)

<P>Walter: When you discuss a National Information Policy, you say
that encryption is something that should be regulated. Don't you
think encryption techniques are a great opportunity instead of a
threat? First of all there's an economic interest. The US have made
it impossible to develop encryption techniques as they cannot be
exported. Non-US encryption techniques however can be used all over
the world which gives non-US countries an advantage. Furthermore,
encryption provides a perfect way to ensure privacy in an age where
we trust almost everything to computers. If we use DigiCash instead
of real cash, our transactions are becoming even more private than
they are now! With encryption, I can authenticate myself, which I
can't when talking to a stranger on the phone, so that's a big
improvement.

<P>Winn: Crypto is a national issue for the politicians, civil
liberatarians and anyone else who cares. But to understand it, you
have to be able to switch hats.</P>
<UL>	1. Why would law enforcement want to permit the export or
	   unrestricted use of crypto which will only make their
	   job harder? That makes no sense.<BR>
	2. Why would a foreign country want the US holding the keys
           on a crypto system within their borders? They wouldn't.<BR>
	3. Why would any criminal worth his salt not super-encrypt
           any messages that use government approved crypto?
</UL>
<P>So, we switch hats and get different views.

<P>Then, anonymous transactions are a legitimate worry for nations;
drugs and illegal laundering of money. Of course they don't want
that to happen.

<P>I am not convinced that there is a sensible answer that will work
for us all. There needs to be compromise, but it is ultimately an
issue of power.

<P>So, the US cannot regulate foreign crypto. The US is not the smartest
in crypto. There are no borders. The proposed policies are generally
ineffective.

<P>Walter: I hear you have recently been a victim of information
warriors that have tampered with your phone. Why do you think they
picked you?

<P>Winn: I still have no real reason except that I am a high profile
target. Vengeance maybe? Jealousy? Maybe. Maybe they just need to
get a life. I recently received a WAV file with a fake interview
they constructed from TV bits I did and edited it so I said I
wanted to take down the telephone companies. Waste of their time.

<P>Walter: A few weeks ago, I read that cops in the US are testing a
HERF gun to stop cars that are being chased. What do you think of
this development?

<P>Winn: A potential for good, a potential for evil. So far this is
urban lore talking, and yes it works in labs, but we have political
questions that must be addressed before these systems can be
deployed. What happens if:</P>

        - the car goes of control?<BR>
        - You shoot the wrong car?<BR>
        - You fry the driver's liver with microwaves?<BR>

<P>A ways to go before the police deploy them.

<FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>inn Schwartau is considered by some to be one of the country's leading experts on information security and electronic privacy. He is often referred to as "<I>the civilian architect of information warfare</I>" by those who study United States national security in cyberspace. His writings and research have served to bring a previously classified subject into the "<I>commercial</I>," open source arena. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>s the President of Interpact, Inc., Mr. Schwartau provides valuable services to both private and public industry, as well as governments on Information Warfare, how it is waged and how to best defend against information attack. Mr. Schwartau has been working to establish US and International policies and standards with regards to electronic privacy and related issues. His work and clients have grown globally, and now span three continents. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>H</FONT>is non-fiction book, "<B>Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway</B>" is considered required reading on the subject. It is a compelling, analysis of personal privacy, economic and industrial espionage, national security and defense. Schwartau calls for the creation of a <B>National Information Policy, a Constitution in Cyberspace</B> and an <B>Electronic Bill of Rights</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>r. Schwartau also authored the novel "<B>Terminal Compromise</B>" which details a fictionalized account of an information war waged on the United States. This prophetic book predicted a number of cyber-events, including the Clipper Chip, illegal chipping, magnetic weapons assaults and data and hardware viruses to name a few. He has written articles for <I>Information Week, Network World, ComputerWorld, Network Security, Internet World, Infoworld, and PC Week</I>, and had a script called "<B>The Hackers</B>," produced on TV's <I>Law and Order</I>.
</BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Start Interview"></A>
<align="right"><B>SOURCES:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT> have to pose this to you this up front, given that <I>Wired</I> hasn't gotten around to reviewing, or, apparently, reading your book -- <I>Wired</I> recently opined that infowar is nothing more than a hyped meme that won't last another year; that it means nothing; that there is no such thing as information warfare; that it's not going to happen? What do you say to that notion given its being touted in such a popular journal of cyber culture?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCHWARTAU:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT> can't believe they're that blind. I don't know why, other than looking at some of the influences of the people that have been involved in <I>Wired</I>. For example, I gave one of the first speeches ever given in the U.S. on infowarfare, back in 1992, when the subject was still classified by the government. So, if it's a flash in the pan, it's been a flash in the pan now for four years, not eleven months. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>J</FONT>ohn Perry Barlow was in the audience, he was a speaker at the same conference, and I was sitting there describing my views on what's going to be happening, and he's shaking his head and holding his head in his hands, going "<I>no, no, no.</I>" The rest of the audience was understanding exactly what I was talking about, it was a heavily military and heavily intelligence-oriented group. I talked to John afterwards, and he didn't say so in exactly these words, but my impression was, was that he views this whole cyberspace thing, whatever you want to call it, as a panacea, as a great social wonderment, as the benevolent future, and he doesn't want to see any negative aspects of it. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he same thing occurred with Al Gore back in 1990 when he introduced the national information superhighway. I met with him, and I said "<I>what about the problems with it</I>," and he and those around him did not want to talk about the problems. My view was that, in Gore's case it was politically derailing for his initiative, with the Barlow's and the other people of the world who pooh-pooh my kind of work; they basically only want to look at the good side things and don't want to look at the downside risks.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SOURCES:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>hat's kind of the way Bob Steele sees this whole issue. What he told me recently is that he sees "<I>a complete lack of vision in the senior leadership positions and a strong reluctance to tell the President that we cannot defend our home electronics.</I>"
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCHWARTAU:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>teele and I agree on that 100% 
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SOURCES:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>f the intel community and the defense community understand the problems and the security and other issues, then why is there such a slowness in addressing this problem, addressing it adequately. You know, they've got some good people who understand the problem, like <B>Emmett Paige</B>, but as far as getting the momentum going it doesn't seem like it's happening.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCHWARTAU:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>G</FONT><B>eneral Edmonds</B> from <B>DISA</B> has some very good insights, and so, too, does Paige, they understand the problems very well, and there are a number of others. I think there are two fundamental problems: 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT>ne is that the senior leadership within the intel and military computer community tend to be a little bit older, and, that's not meant to be a criticism, but it's an observation that they have not grown up with this technology; they have not grown up in the environment. They don't live in cyberspace, and an awful lot of them still very much have a Cold War mindset. They're entrenched in the bomb and bullet scenarios, living in a bipolar, militaristic world, whereas <B>we are now moving into a world of distributed capabilities</B>. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he second issue is that the White House doesn't have a vision for this future. They're talking about creating jobs, and about reducing poverty, and, yes, these are all terrifically important things, I'm not going to downplay them at all, but I have not heard out of the <B>White House</B> or out of <B>Congress</B> any vision about where this country needs to go or how it's going to get there. They're not recognizing the very fundamental changes that are occurring. <B>This country's wealth is now based on its econo-technical infrastructure</B>. The econo-technical infrastructure is the fundamental '<I>framework</I>,' if you will, of our value-added wealth. And until they thoroughly understand that and until it has become part of their thinking and planning system, I believe it's going to be difficult for them to see the risks that are coming with this '<I>framework</I>.'
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SOURCES:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>s it going to take something cataclysmic? Steele says he's waiting for a major disaster and a totally new team to come in?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCHWARTAU:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT>ne of two things need to happen, and I've been saying this since 1990 when my first models on infowar came out. <B>It's either going to take a computer Chernobyl, or an electronic Pearl Harbor</B>, or it's going to take a lot of lawyers doing a lot of suing.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SOURCES:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hat do you think, if we do have an electronic apocalypse, where is it going to come from? <I>Wired</I>, you know, sarcastically wondered who would pull it off? Somalia? Where is this infowar battle going to come from as far as an attack on the U.S. or on some other industrialized western nation?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCHWARTAU:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>ell, there's different levels of it. We've already been involved to a certain degree in an infowar with Somalia, and the component of the infowar was in perception management and deception that occurred right before we went in and right after we left. The media was involved in this aspect of it, and the United States had public support behind it to go in because we saw pictures on television of some starving babies; food being diverted away from the people who needed it, and a country that was essentially in chaos and was being run by independent warlords. Okay, we were going to go in and straighten things out as peacemakers. However, one dead soldier being dragged across the TV screens of America was enough to make us pull out. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>o a certain extent that was information warfare and psy-ops, aimed at the population's perception and at the country's management. But, that kind of thing aside, Somalia is not going to be the one, I don't believe, that's going to launch a computer Chernobyl against us. As to who's going to do it, that's what the intelligence community is supposed to figure out. They're supposed to figure out who. I avoid that purposely, except in the most general terms, in my work. I don't worry about the intentions, I don't worry about who's going to be behind it. <B>I concentrate on the capabilities angle, looking at the structure of the organization that would be required to pull it off, the kind of resources they would need to do it, the kind manpower or army they'd have to have at their disposal in order to launch a sizable attack of this nature against us.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SOURCES:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>side from where the intel and defense communities are on this issue, what about the commercial sector, banking for instance. I'm now looking at a <B>Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council</B>, or FFIEC, memo on the control and security risks of electronic imaging systems. It talks a great deal about internal controls and such, <B>but says nothing about the risks from Van Eck eavesdropping</B>, for instance. This seems to me to be very naive and very shortsighted. It represents, I think, the shortsightedness and naivete that exists on the part of the banking regulators -- even down to the field examiner level. There seems to be a lack of training, but more than that, a lack of understanding of state-of-the-art, cutting-edge security risks. How do you view all this?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCHWARTAU:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>here's a lot of issues here. Number one, the way that we're teaching people as they go through college; we're teaching them how to use computers, how to use applications, here's how to program, now go out into the world and make some money. What we're not teaching them is what the totality of the cyberworld really is, when it comes to understanding the technology and all the various aspects of it. Again, we're teaching the "sweetness and light" side of it, but we're not teaching some of the downside risks and some of the vulnerabilities. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hen we look at the commercial world, they take an awful lot of their positions from authoritative sources, and they listen a good deal to the DOD and to the intel community. The strategy of the intel community has been to keep the nature of any threat highly classified, not to talk about it. DISA, however, has come a long way in exposing the threat. But until the DOD and the intel community realize that they and the commercial sector are on the same track, that there is a true convergence of interests, a true convergence of business models between the military and business, I think that we're going to have that perceptual separation between the two worlds.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>N</FONT>ow, let's get into banking for a moment. In the classic world of infosecurity, there's a triad, three legs on which security stands. And these three legs are confidentiality, keeping secrets a secret, integrity, and availability. From a confidentiality standpoint and an integrity standpoint, we essentially have the technology to solve most of those problems, by using cryptographic methods, decent key management, and well-administered sites. It's not necessarily going to be easy in all cases, but we have the fundamental technology to be able to solve these two problems of the triad. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>H</FONT>owever, when we get into availability, the ability of systems to stay up for businesses that rely upon technology, we have not addressed that. Denial of service has typically been a military model, in a situation where one blinds the enemy, or kills the enemy, or destroys his infrastructure. In all the work I do with corporate America, I try make this point, going after whether they've got their crypto and administration and the rest of that triad taken care of yet. I mean, when it comes to attacks, they have the acts of God covered. They can deal with 
hurricanes. They can deal with tornadoes. They can deal with earthquakes and floods, but they cannot deal with the acts of man. They do not have policies or procedures to deal with assault, with a concentrated, intentional assault against their facility, especially when it comes to their being denied service. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>arrying this idea one step further, and I'm not going to go into details because we're still finishing up the research -- some associates and myself -- but we have identified a means to literally destroy the entire global economy a lot simpler than we had ever before thought possible. An associate of mine did the primary research, and we're going to be coming out with it in the next several months.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SOURCES:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>hat's a frightening concept.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCHWARTAU:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hen I first met this gentleman and saw the research, my jaw hit the ground. It blew me away. There's just an absolutely stunning vulnerability that's been totally overlooked.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SOURCES:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hat about any U.S. offensive infowar capabilities? Paige said at a recent conference that I shouldn't bother taking any notes because no one's going to talk about it. 
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCHWARTAU:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>'m glad that you brought that up. I guess that's why I get brought into an awful lot of places, because I do talk about the offensive capability. Number one, I do not have a clearance, have never had a clearance, and have turned down opportunities to have clearances by a number of spook agencies because it would destroy my ability to work. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>e have some pretty interesting offensive capabilities. We have offensive capabilities in the software realm; remote software, viral, malicious software injection. We've got blinding capabilities [that can be applied] militarily against adversaries in theater. We've got the Van Eck remote eavesdropping capabilities. And then, of course, we've got the denial of service capabilities through magnetic weapons [directed energy weapons] and there's a whole arsenal of those, ranging from portable backpack versions up to trailer truck size. 
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>o we do have a wide range of offensive capabilities. We have the manufacturing capability, we have the distribution capability, we have the injection capabilities, we have the mapping and cracking capabilities.
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT> do not know whether our cyber forces are organized in any fashion yet, though, and would doubt it because the capabilities are so distributed throughout the various services and branches of the intelligence community. What I doubt we have is the capability to launch an effective 'exclusively cyber' war, without bombs and bullets, yet.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SOURCES:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>here is no cyber corps yet.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCHWARTAU:</B><BR> <FONT SIZE=+2>N</FONT>ot yet. It's still distributed, and that's one of the arguments that a lot of us are making, that we do need to examine in all seriousness the creation of a fourth force, a center of excellence for cyberwar.

From April of 1992 through October of 1995, I published Security Insider Report. Since then, Security Insider is part of the NCSA's monthly newsletter. <P>

During the next few months, we will publish the entire contents of all 30-something issues for you here on Infowar.Com. Please be patient. Much of it is older material (nonetheless useful) but it takes second seat to newer material for our readers.<P>

<h2><Center>Warp Speed Snail Mail:</H4>
PO'Net Comes to Life<BR>
by Winn Schwartau</Center>
<BR>
The  idea is to bring the National Information Infrastructure  to everyone.  <P>

So  who do they give the job to?  The United States Post  Office: the government's answer to "Oh, you expect us to deliver?"  <P>

Everyone  means everyone, according to the government,  not  just folks who can afford a computer and a modem.  I think.  Universal access  is the USPO's job in life  No matter how far out  in  the boonies you live, a mail box means that the Feds have to  deliver "snail  mail" to your door.  They have to have a man and a  truck and a road and distribute the mail to the Mayberry RFD address on the  envelop,  no  matter how far or  distasteful  the  location.  Inner city war-slums or poverty soaked Appalachia, the USPO  says their man has to be there, letter in hand. <P>

But with the electronic superhighway gaining momentum, the  folks with  the money have been driving the ship.  Even if  getting  on board  only  costs $10-$20 per month, the Feds say,  "That's  too much."   It's gotta be, well, close to free.  <P>

I've thought about this, and there is both good and bad.  Is  the USPO going to distribute mail by wire . . . string wires to every hamlet  and  lick from Alaska to Kentucky, and  as  suggested  by recent news, build their own network to the side of the  Internet and compete with Compuserve and PSI. You have to wonder what  the poor man's electronic mail box will consist of: a TV set with  an interactive  connection to the cable company?  Not if there's  no cable.   I  wonder about their motivations:  remember,  the  Post Office  has been claiming eminent domain over the  mails,  saying that  Federal Express intrudes on their Congressionally  provided mail  monopoly.   Once in the e-mail business,  would  they  then claim  they have exclusive rights to deliver electronic  mail  as well?  <P>

Imagine  the  concept  of the  information  disenfranchised.   If you're  poor, and can't afford a real connection to the 'Net  for e-mail, you have to resort to the class of service that the  USPO will offer. (I can just see 3 trillion undelivered e-mail letters stacked  in  a Chicago warehouse next to  the  undelivered  snail mail.)   <P>

But  the  USPO has equally daunting problems  to  consider.   The current  snail-mail is secure.  Confidentiality is  offered,  and under  universal electronic access, similar concepts must  apply.  The  private sector is working towards solutions which  will  fit the private sector's needs and meet the cultural ethos of  cybernauts.  What would the feds solution look like? <P>

I fear, more than anything else, the dreaded word: Clipper. <P>

What  better way to proliferate such an abhorred  technology  and permeate the digital life of every man than by the US Post  Office adapting  a Clipper-like technology to protect the integrity  and confidentiality  of the new federal e-mail system?   "Reach  out and  touch someone" takes on new meaning if  the  Clipper-critics are even just partially correct. <P>

Clipper  is voluntary (yeah, yeah) but the IRS is reported to  be readying  an electronic filing system that must use  Clipper/Capstone/Key Escrow approaches.  Nothing else will do.  So much  for voluntary.   And if the USPO takes a similar stance?  I pity  the Federal official who has to explain this one to America.  A month of  early retirement for each day of  public abuse would  be  the minimum bonus . . .<P>

Whatever  the  approach chosen, if the United  States  government gets  into  the e-mail business, we'll end up with  two  distinct classes  of people: those who use the 'Net and those who use  the PO'Net.   Say  that:  PO'Net, and  unfortunately  that's  exactly who'll be stuck using it. <P>

<H1>Beyond the Firewall</H1>
<H2>New Systems Watch Intruders and Strike Back</H2>
<I>by Winn Schwartau</I>
<HR>
Corporations worldwide understand that the Internet can provide a competitive edge by giving them access to valuable information and an instant communications pathway to reach suppliers and customers. However, the risks are high. Messages are intercepted regularly using so-called sniffing programs; passwords are stolen by the hundreds of thousands; and computer networks are entered illicitly, giving perpetrators a virtual free ride through a company's information infrastructure. Thus, millions of people and organizations who would like to avail themselves of the Internet's resources are being held back by fear. <P>
How can the business community use the Internet safely? The statistics are indeed disturbing and can dissuade the most persistent organizations from entering the Internet domain. Industrial espionage is up 260 percent to 350 percent since the late 1980s, and one government study found 97 percent of computer penetrations to be undetected. More alarming, over 1.2 million computer penetrations were reported in 1992. That astounding number begets the question, How many others were never noticed? <P>
Once firewall security is breached, a company's entire network is exposed. Companies that wish to avail themselves of the almost infinite supply of Internet resources are the ones that must legitimately worry about the consequences of getting on the Net. In the world of security, three fundamental goals follow three fundamental security issues:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Confidentiality. This means your secrets are kept secret. You don't want anyone intercepting data that you want to keep within the control of your organization. The general approach to solving confidentiality problems is the use of strong encryption and key-management systems. 
<LI>Integrity. This is the assurance that data has not been modified. 
<LI>Availability. This means your systems--from complex enterprise-wide internetworks to small company resources--are up and running when they are needed. </UL><P>
<B>Protect Yourself</B><P>
Connecting an organization's internal networks to the Internet evokes these basic security risks, and the company that wants to get onto the Net has to worry about all three. So it should be obvious that the first step to take before venturing into the cyberspacial realm is to make sure that your connection to the Internet is strong, reliable, and secure. <P>
Until recently, the safest way to establish a company domain on the Internet was to put up a so-called firewall between the external Net and the internal network to be protected. A software program in a Unix machine is hung between the two networks, and in theory, they are reasonably well isolated from each other. <P>
The problem with a conventional firewall approach is that a firewall is designed to let nothing in from the Internet while still permitting users behind the firewall to send messages out to the global network. But this solution does not meet the needs of today's globally minded networked organization, and that's been one of the biggest limitations firewalls have faced. Typically, security meant a loss of functionality, and that is clearly unacceptable. <P>
The next approach to come along was a combination firewall and router where, theory said, one could hide behind the firewall yet still permit selected Internet traffic to enter the organization's networks. It sounds like a good solution, but it is not adequate because the router approach filters data from the Internet based on packets located in the header of the messages. For example, a good router might restrict all traffic coming from any .edu site because security is still poor at many educational institutions. <P>
To a na&iacute;ve system administrator, this might sound like an effective means of automated system management, but let's look below the surface. Any computer enthusiast with a modicum of knowledge can modify the header packets to reflect whatever source address he chooses. This common technique, called spoofing (akin to a wolf in sheep's clothing), has been popular with hackers for years. The simple editing technique can alter the source location and routing information, as well as aliases and IDs, and a poorly configured firewall and router security system can be defeated. <P>
<B>Go Ahead, Make My Day</B><P>
This is where a recent development in firewall technology comes into play. Sidewinder is the brainchild of Secure Computing Corp. of Roseville, Minn., and is the outgrowth of 250,000 man-hours (that's 125 man-years) of government-sponsored research and development into how to permit classified and unclassified networks to talk to each other securely. <P>
The philosophical premise behind Sidewinder is fundamentally different than that of its firewall ancestors. Sidewinder (the name of both a vicious snake that bites its attackers and of a military missile system) is designed to be extremely difficult to attack. But instead of relying on human diligence, Sidewinder automates the process of intruder detection. Sidewinder prices start at $30,000 (see the Selected List of Internet Security Vendors on p. 66). <P>
While conventional firewalls act as a router to the addresses located in the headers of messages, Sidewinder is configured to reflect a company's security policy, which should deal with the day-to-day dynamics of the evolving global network. Sidewinder bases its decisions on the contents of a file and not merely the labeling of the electronic envelope. If Sidewinder spots something suspicious, it takes a closer look. <P>
It has been known for quite some time that an Internet host (and thus your computers behind it) can be attacked in a number of ways. Behind your electronic address also sits a telnet address that is a string of numbers. Any other Internet user can telnet to the front door of your computers and knock on the door. Your front door more than likely is ajar, if not open. <P>
Hackers, cyberpunks, and information warriors have extensive software toolkits to exploit the weaknesses, of most systems and open the doors completely. One of the greatest fears of a security administrator is that intruders will gain root access, which essentially is having total control over a computer. <P>
There also has been widespread use of Trojan horse software, which, once embedded in a system, captures the passwords of legitimate users. That information permits the bad guys to carry on throughout your systems and to use your computers as a stepping stone to other organization's computers where the damage continues domino-like. <P>
The list of risks goes on and on, and the results are ominously clear. The bad guys have a lot of tools in their arsenal; they know how to exploit weaknesses. Information security, unfortunately, is generally an afterthought--not important until something goes wrong. <P>
At the heart of this new approach is a technology called type enforcement, a patented security mechanism that is the result of a massive research effort. Type enforcement employs a technique called assured pipelines, which is directly responsible for content-based access control instead of conventional header-based approaches. <P>
When a program calls up a file--for example, a word processing document--the executable program and the file are said to touch each other. Large programs of several megabytes are comprised of modules that interact with one another invisibly, but are intended to optimize software operation. These modules also touch one another. <P>
The assured pipeline routes all Internet traffic, whether going to or coming from the Net, and looks at the content of the traffic to make decisions. Because the content of the information is being analyzed (and not just the addresses), the security administrator has almost total control over what information is permitted to touch other information. By the use of sophisticated electronic filters, all files that contain specific words might be flagged for particular treatment. <P>
The files, for instance, might be routed to the security administrator rather then merely pass through to the intended recipient, or all patient data files from a medical institution might be restricted from going to the Internet, thereby enhancing personal privacy. Although the principle is simple, the execution is difficult.<P>
Malicious software is merely a remote-controlled electronic intruder, and type enforcement can detect and react to such software intrusions. For example, in order for the Trojan horse to capture passwords, it must interact at the root level with specific password files. Type enforcement strictly prohibits certain activities to occur, regardless of the source or destination addresses on the electronic envelope. Thus, even identity spoofing is no help for such an attack. <P>
Type enforcement is an active deterrent to Internet security compromises rather than merely a passive observer capable of halting intruders that are using only the most primitive means of attack. And nowhere does this become more obvious than with the manner in which type enforcement responds to intrusions or attempted assaults. <P>
<B>Armed and Ready</B><P>
Wouldn't it be nice if a computer system attacked from the Internet responded to the attack by striking back at the intruder? This is exactly what Sidewinder's implementation of type enforcement does. If someone is trying to break into your computer, Sidewinder's type enforcement will detect the intrusion immediately because the contents-based assured pipeline real-time analysis examines all activities, not just the addresses. As soon as a violation occurs, a silent alarm system is automatically activated which then reacts according to your company's information security policy. <P>
Sidewinder and type enforcement can be configured to react in any number of ways once an attack has been detected. Type enforcement can detect an attack and merely shut the intruder down cold. It doesn't matter who is behind it or what the goals are, the attack is merely halted and the company can continue operations. <P>
Another reaction would invoke a mechanism that would record all the information from whence came the attack in an effort to identify the intruder. If automated attacks were used, Sidewinder would record the scripts, baring the hackers' tools and further rendering them useless. By luring an attacker into a false sense of security, the hacker would continue trying to break in, unaware that every step was being recorded. <P>
An organization under attack might also invoke a policy of retribution by feeding the intruder seemingly valuable but worthless information in the form of secret directories and files. This would be an invitation for a repeat visit on the intruder's part, but type enforcement mechanisms would ensure that subsequent visits were equally benign. <P>
This approach would capture enough information about the attack and the attacker to strike back and capture him or her. The electronic evidence would assist in almost any legal proceeding. To further the strength of defense through proactive strikes, a company might decide to seed the information the attacker acquired with information strings that were uniquely the company's own and could be demonstrated to come from its computers. Thus, when apprehended, the attacker would be in possession of electronic documentation that could only have come from the company's computers. <P>
<B>Safe and Sound</B><P>
Merely installing a type-enforcement-based Internet guard isn't enough. Other problems also must be addressed. You must consider an alternative means to the usual password approaches. Conventional schemes consisting of a user ID and a PIN (personal identification number) or password aren't strong enough for serious Internet business connections. The same weak passwords are reused over and over again and can be sniffed, spoofed, and snookered by a wealth of offensive software. <P>
An alternative method such as one-time, non-reusable sniffless challenge-response password systems are far superior. Because the passwords are never transmitted over the Internet and never used again, sniffer attacks are rendered impotent. The U.S. Department of Defense uses a system called Lock, which is also commercially available as an integral adjunct to type-enforcement mechanisms. Such a system provides a high degree of confidence with respect to identification of participants in electronic conversations. <P>
In mid-1994, Firewalls and Internet Security by Cheswick and Bellovin appeared on the scene and was quickly regarded as the definitive work on the subject of firewalls. The problem, however, is that the Cheswick/Bellovin book takes no note of type enforcement, assured pipelines, or the concept of defense in depth (willing to sacrifice a pawn to save the king). The entire solutions-oriented subject treatment is based on technology that has been largely superseded by the advanced principles of type enforcement. <P>
However, the authors do an excellent job of describing 42 so-called bombs that must be considered when implementing any Internet routing device or firewall. This is an education in itself, and despite its deficiencies the book should be on everyone's shelf. <P>
If you are considering connecting your company to the Internet, do not do so hastily. You can get on the Net safely, securely, and with a very high degree of confidence that your information assets will remain private and intact. However, as with anything, there is a right and wrong way. Here are some tips:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Consider your risks--honestly. 
<LI>Consider the benefits--conservatively and carefully. 
<LI>Make a plan--accurately and detailed to the last connector and RAM chip.
<LI>Provide an adequate budget for purchase, installation, maintenance, upgrade, and administration. If you're going to skimp, wait until the next budget cycle.
<LI>Administer correctly, regularly and follow corporate policy.
<LI>React quickly when under attack--and if so inclined, strike back. </UL><P>

<UL>

<LI>DefCon is the premier hackers conference held in Las Vegas every summer. Ask <a href="MAILTO:dtangent@defcon.org">Dark Tangent at DefCon</a> for complete information.<BR>

<LI>I've been working with Fred Villella and his <a href="MAILTO:ndi@aol.com">Hackers, Crackers and Sniffers</a> seminars across the country. Security and Infowar awareness training.<BR>

<LI><a href="MAILTO:conferences@ncsa.com">InfoWarCon VI, Brussels, May 1997</a> will be our next European Information Warfare conference.<BR>

<LI><a href="MAILTO:ceo@oss.net">Open Source Solutions</a> is Robert Steele's brainchild and held in DC this coming September. <BR>
</UL>

I get the opportunity to speak to audiences in the US and in Europe - often those early morning keynote speeches when we are all asleep. My job is keep them an me awake for an hour. It's about 50/50 between government/military and private business but that's that the convergence is all about now, isn't it?<P>

For specially tailored keynotes or full day seminars, focusing on the needs of your particular group, <a href="MAILTO:winn@infowar.com">Write and ask me</a>. We include a spectrum of multimedia on hackers, infowar, infosec, technology, policy - and deliver what you want and need for your audience. <P>

<p>Winn Schwartau, one of the country's leading experts on
information security and electronic privacy is often referred to
as &quot;<b>the civilian architect of information warfare</b>&quot;.
His writings and research have brought a previously classified
subject into the commercial open source arena. </p>


<p>As the President of <b>Interpact, Inc.</b>, Winn provides
valuable consultation services to industry and governments on
Information Warfare, enterprise information security, policy,
hackers, US and International policies and standards, electronic
privacy and related issues. His work and clients span three
continents. </p>


<p>His first non-fiction book, <b>&quot;Information Warfare:
Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway</b> (Thunder's Mouth Press,
NY, 1994) is the seminal work on the subject and became an
instant 'must-read' classic. It is a compelling, analysis of
personal privacy, economic and industrial espionage, national
security and defense. He calls for the creation of a <b>National
Information Policy, a Constitution in Cyberspace and an
Electronic Bill of Rights</b>. The sequal, <b>&quot;Information
Warfare: Cyberterroris, Second Edition,&quot;</b> was released in
November of 1996. Published in May of 1996, his <b>&quot;Complete
Internet Business Toolkit&quot;</b> is one of the first books to
ever be banned from export out of the United States.</p>


<p>Mr. Schwartau is also the author of <b>&quot;Terminal
Compromise&quot;</b> which details a fictionalized account of an
information war waged on the United States. This prophetic book
predicted a number of cyber-events, including the Clipper Chip,
chipping, magnetic weapons' assaults, data and hardware viruses,
to name a few. He other popular writings include <b>&quot;CyberChrist
Meets Lady Luck&quot;</b> and <b>&quot;CyberChrist Bites the Big
Apple,&quot;</b> which cover underground hacker events, <b>&quot;Firewalls
101&quot;</b> for DPI Press, <b>Information Warfare, </b>Mehrwert
Information (Schaffer/Poeschel, Germany)<b>, </b>for <b>&quot;Introduction
to Internet Security&quot;</b> for DGI and MecklerMedia, several
chapters for Auerbach's <b>Internet and Internetworking Security
Handbook</b> and <b>Ethical Conundra of Information Warfare </b>for
AFCEA Press.</p>


<p>He is currently writing <b>two more books</b> (to appear by
the end of 1997) and is working on two major movie projects about
Information Warfare and privacy..</p>

<P> 1. If the enemy is in range, so are you.

<P>2. Incoming fire has the right of way.

<P> 3. Don't look conspicuous, it draws fire.

<P> 4. There is always a way.

<P> 5. The easy way is always mined.

<P> 6. Try to look unimportant, they may be low on ammo.

<P> 7. Professionals are predictable, it's the amateurs that are
    dangerous.

<P> 8. The enemy invariably attacks on two occasions:</P>

         a. when you're ready for them.<BR>
         b. when you're not ready for them.<BR>

<P> 9. Teamwork is essential, it gives them someone else to shoot at.

<P> 10. If you can't remember, then the claymore is pointed at you.

<P> 11. The enemy diversion you have been ignoring will be the main
     attack.

<P> 12. A "sucking chest wound" is nature's way of telling you to
     slow down.

<P> 13. If your attack is going well, you have walked into an ambush.

<P> 14. Never draw fire, it irritates everyone around you.

<P> 15. Anything you do can get you shot, including nothing.

<P> 16. Make it tough enough for the enemy to get in and you won't be
     able to get out.

<P> 17. Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than yourself.

<P> 18. If you're short of everything but the enemy, you're in a
     combat zone.

<P> 19. When you have secured an area, don't forget to tell the
     enemy.

<P> 20. Never forget that your weapons are made by the lowest bidder, take
care        of them if you want them to take care of you.

<P> 21. If it's stupid...but it works, it isn't stupid.</P>

<P>Induhviduals Calling Tech Support
 ---------------------------------

<P> ...another true tale from tech support:

 <P>Tech Support:  "What does the screen say now."

<P> Induhvidual:   "It says, 'Hit ENTER when ready'."

<P> Tech Support:  "Well?"

<P> Induhvidual:   "How do I know when it's ready?</P>

 -----<BR>

<P> A co-worker was playing with an astronomy program called 'Distant Suns'
 when an Induhvidual walked by, noticed his monitor and inquired what he
 was doing. He replied that he was connected to the Hubbell telescope
 and was manipulating its view from his keyboard over the Internet. He
 even let this person take a try at moving our NASA's multi-million
 dollar telescope himself, just by clicking the mouse and the arrow
 keys! The person could not pry himself away, thinking he was working
 with the  Hubbell and could not wait to tell his wife what he had done
 at work.</P>

 -----<BR>

<P> An Induhvidual in my office was having trouble with his e-mail. I
 overheard him discussing the fact that people to whom he had mailed
 things yesterday had not yet received the messages.  I asked about the
 e-mail "outbasket" and he replied that there was nothing there because
 he had cleaned it all out this morning. A stunned silence followed
 while I  attempted to not laugh, and then I asked him if he meant that
 he deleted  everything in the outbasket. Yup. Oops.

<P> It must be rough being the new guy.</P>

 -----<BR>

<P> Several years ago we had an intern who was none too swift.  One day he
 was typing and turned to a secretary and said, "I'm almost out of
 typing  paper.  What do I do?"

<P> "Just use copier machine paper," she told him.

<P> With that, the intern took his last remaining blank piece of paper, put
 it on the photocopier and proceeded to make five blank copies.

<P> Hey, interns work free.</P>

 -----<BR>

<P> I was working the help desk.  One day one of the computer operators
 called me and asked if anything "bad" would happen if she dropped coins
 into the openings of her PC.  I asked her if this was something she was
 thinking of doing.  She said, "never mind" and hung up.  So I got out
 my  trusty tool kit and paid her a visit.   I opened her CPU case and
 sure  enough - there was 40 cents.

<P> [editor's note:  Maybe there was some confusion over the phrase "screen
 saver." ]</P>

 -----<BR>

<P> One of our servers crashed.   I was watching our new system
 administrator  trying to restore it.  He inserted a CD and needed to
 type a path name to  a directory named "i386".  He started to type it
 and paused, asking me, "Where's the key for that line thing?"

<P> I asked what he was talking about, and he said, "You know, that one
 that looks like an upside-down exclamation mark."

<P> I replied, "You mean the letter i?" and he said, "Yeah, that's it!"</P>

 -----<BR>

<P> I called a company and asked to speak to Bob.  The Induhvidual who
 answered said, "Bob is on vacation.  Would you like to hold?"</P>

<P>	 <P>	 The following 11 tips for Individuals are based on allegedly true
 stories reported from DNRC observers in the field.  If one Individual
 is stymied by something, it's a safe bet that they all are, so this
 should help a lot.


<P> 1.  If you're bidding on a job for UPS, don't send your bid by FedEx.

<P> 2.  If your computer says, "Printer out of Paper," this problem cannot
 be resolved by continuously clicking the "OK" button.

<P> 3.  If you want your refrigerator's ice maker to work, you need to hook
 it to a water source.  Air doesn't make good ice unless it is mixed
 with water.

<P> 4.  No matter how much data you add to your laptop, it will not get
 heavier.

<P>5.  A bad place to store your emergency backup diskette is on the
 underside of your desk drawer, secured by a large magnet.

<P> 6.  It's okay to use the Poloroid Land Camera on a boat.

<P> 7.  When the PC says, "Insert diskette #2," don't do it immediately.
 Remove disk #1 first, even if you're sure you can make them both fit in
 there.

<P> 8. When your PC says "You have mail," don't go to the company mail room
 and look for a package.

<P> 9.  The French version of Netscape Navigator doesn't translate English
 language web pages into French.

<P> 10.  If you're in the armed services, and it's April 1st, and you get
 an e-mail message to call Colonel Sanders for new orders, don't.

<P> 11.  If you go to the computer store to buy a mousepad, you don't have
 to specify whether it's for a Windows or a Macintosh.</P>

<P>Prank #1:

<P>Using the conferencing feature of your office phone, dial one
 Induhvidual, then while it's ringing dial another and conference them
 together.  Put your own phone on mute and listen to see how long
 they'll make small talk before figuring out that neither one placed the
 call.

<P> Prank #2:

<P> Microsoft Word has an autocorrect spelling function in its latest
 version.  This function automatically corrects spelling mistakes as you
 type.  The wonderful part of it is that you can add words to the
 autocorrect dictionary...including words that do not exist.

<P> If your co-worker leaves his computer unsecure, you're home free.

<P> For example, you could set it up so that the boss's first name, Bob, is
 autocorrected to Boob whenever the Induhvidual types it.  Or set
 paradigm  to autocorrect to "puredumb."  If you're good, you can get
 your co-worker  disciplined for sexual harassment plus any number of
 diversity-related violations.

 <P>Prank #3:

<P> Get a greeting card that plays an insidious tune.  Wrap the musicalchip
 in cotton and tape it in on top of a ceiling tile in the victim's
 office. Make it quiet enough that the victim only hears it when it's
 especially silent.  Act like he's crazy when he asks you if you hear
 music.

<P> Prank #4:

 <P>Put an official-looking sign over the control pad of your office fax or
 copy machine that says it is now voice activated.  The sign
 should direct the users to say their full name in a loud, crisp voice (for
tracking purposes of course) followed by the desired commands,
 e.g., "This is Bruce Induhvidual, give me ten copies, no staple."

<P> Prank Report:

 <P>(a DNRC field report from a mission completed)

<P> An Induhvidual left his e-mail account online after he left work. The
 next day his boss asked him why he sent a message asking to take a
 shower with him in the locker room.  The pranked Induhvidual could not
 remember sending out the e-mail containing that suggestion.

<P>Note: I myself wold never think of doing any of these.<g> Anyone want to see my
prank shutdown scrrens for 95?</P>

<P>	 God Created heaven and the earth. Quickly he was faced with a
 class action suit for failure to file an environmental impact
 statement. He was granted a temporary permit for the project, but was
 stymied with the cease and desist order for the earthly part.

 <P>Appearing at the hearing, God was asked why he began his earthly
 project in the first place. He replied that he just liked to be
 creative.

<P> Then God said, "Let there be light", and immediately the officials
 demanded to know how the light would be made. Would there be strip
 mining? What about thermal pollution? God explained that the light
 would come from a huge ball of fire. God was granted provisional
 permission to make light, assuming that no smoke would result from
 the ball of fire: that he would obtain a building permit; and to
 conserve energy, would have the light out half the time. God agreed
 and said he would call the light "Day" and the darkness "Night".
 Officials replied that they were not interested in semantics.

<P> God said, "Let the earth bring forth green herb and such as many
 seed". The EPA agreed so long as native seed was used. Then God said,
 "Let waters bring forth creeping creatures having life; and the fowl
 that may fly over the earth". Officials pointed out this would
 require approval from the Department of Game coordinated with the
 Heavenly Wildlife Federation and the Audubongelic Society.

 <P>Everything was O.K. until God said he wanted to complete the
 project in Six days. Officials said it would take at least 200 days
 to review the application and impact statement. After that there
 would be a public hearing. Then there would be 10-12 months before...</P>

 At this point God created Hell.<BR>

<P>	What better way to peruse a companys information systems!  Not only do you get to look at all the information, but all the source code as well.  How many companies are buying the services of others companies to fix their Year 2000 problems?  Have any of these companies thought about the security issues of letting a third party access to all their computer systems?

<P>	Now your information can be stolen without anyone having to break-in or social engineer their way into your company.  You just hired someone to fix the Year 2000 problem and possible steal your information.

<P>	I am sure someone has thought of this before, if not, someone will.  The information your company has must be worth more than $220,000 US!

<P>When someone discovers grandma's been locked in her apartment for four
days, who do you call? When a construction worker falls off scaffolding
straight down a manhole, who do you call? There's no 911 in Russia.

<P>But there is 007 -- the cellular phone number you can call to get retired
KGB officer Alexander Shabalov's company, Security Center of Flexible
Technology.

<P>On contract to the city to provide emergency rescue services, SCFT's
action teams come roaring to the rescue of Muscovites every day.

<P>They arrive in Shabalov's spy-fantasy "multifunctional vehicles" --
converted Land Rovers, bristling with high-tech readiness and emblazoned
with the company's winged logo that looks like Batman's.

<P>The rescue units are guided from Shabalov's headquarters by cellular
phones, and equipped for every eventuality: rappelling devices, winches,
scanners to detect listening devices in buildings, extinguishers for 11
different kinds of fires, satellite navigation systems accurate within 15
feet, and a contraption called "Diana," a 50-foot roadblock that
accordions out from the undercarriage of the Land Rover with
explosive-loaded spikes.

<p><B>KABINDA, ZAIRE--</B>In a move IBM offices are hailing as a major step in the company's ongoing worldwide telecommunications revolution, M'wana Ndeti, a member of Zaire's Bantu tribe, used an IBM global uplink network modem yesterday to crush a nut.</p>
<p>Ndeti, who spent 20 minutes trying to open the nut by hand, easily cracked</p>
<p>it open by smashing it repeatedly with the powerful modem.</p>
<p>"I could not crush the nut by myself," said the 47-year-old Ndeti, who added the savory nut to a thick, peanut-based soup minutes later. "With IBM's help, I was able to break it." Ndeti discovered the nut-breaking, 28.8 V.34 modem yesterday, when IBM was shooting a commercial in his southwestern Zaire village. During a break in shooting, which shows African villagers eagerly teleconferencing via computer with Japanese schoolchildren, Ndeti snuck onto the set and took the modem, which he believed would serve well as a "smashing" utensil.</p>
<p>IBM officials were not surprised the longtime computer giant was able to provide Ndeti with practical solutions to his everyday problems. "Our telecommunications systems offer people all over the world global networking solutions that fit their specific needs," said Herbert Ross, IBM's director of marketing. "Whether you're a nun cloistered in an Italian abbey or an Aborigine in Australia's Great Sandy Desert, IBM has the ideas to get you where you want to go today."</p>
<p>According to Ndeti, of the modem's many powerful features, most impressive was its hard plastic casing, which easily sustained several minutes of vigorous pounding against a large stone. "I put the nut on a rock, and I hit it with the modem," Ndeti said. "The modem did not break. It is a good modem."</p>
<p>Ndeti was so impressed with the modem that he purchased a new, state-of- the-art IBM workstation, complete with a PowerPC 601 microprocessor, a quad-speed internal CD-ROM drive and three 16-bit ethernet networking connectors. The tribesman has already made good use of the computer system, fashioning a gazelle trap out of its wires, a boat anchor out of the monitor and a crude but effective weapon from its mouse.</p>
<p>"This is a good computer," said Ndeti, carving up a just-captured gazelle with the computer's flat, sharp internal processing device.  "I am using every part of it. I will cook this gazelle on the keyboard." Hours later, Ndeti capped off his delicious gazelle dinner by smoking the computer's 200-page owner's manual.</p>
<p>IBM spokespeople praised Ndeti's choice of computers. "We are pleased that the Bantu people are turning to IBM for their business needs," said company CEO William Allaire. "From Kansas City to Kinshasa, IBM is bringing the world closer together. Our cutting-edge technology is truly creating a global village."</p>

<P>Mixed Messages: images, text and technology - a unique, cross disciplinary
conference is being hosted by the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte, on Oct. 11 - 13, 1997. The conference will explore the
boundaries, connections, disconnections and overlappings of image, text,
and sound and what changes affect our perceptions of each. The conference
promises to be an exciting exchange of ideas and information about the
changing nature of communications. The conference itself will be an
experiment combining  many forms of communications. We invite presentations
in the form of papers, studio art pieces, storytelling, video and computer
works, panel and roundtable discussions, etc. Proposals for conference
presentations are being received from Dec. 1, 1996 - Jan. 31, 1997. 

<P>For further information contact Frances Hawthorne, Art Department, UNCC, 9201
University Blvd., Charlotte, NC 28223 or visit the conference web site at

<P>03 November 1996

<P>The journal NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE is planning a special issue on THE
POLITICS OF CYBERSPACE for its Fall 1997 issue.  The editors are Chris
Toulouse (Hofstra University) and Tim Luke (Virginia Tech).

<P>    Any matter of relevance to the general field will be considered,
although we want to give preference to articles exploring the impact of
the world wide web on the political process.  Submissions should take
the form of an article, no longer than 25 double-spaced pages (excluding
endnotes).  The deadline for submissions is January 31st 1997.
Submissions will be referred to two anonymous referees (in the
conventional academic fashion) and authors will be contacted by March
1st 1997.  Since this is an issue on cyberspace we hope to be able to
upload the articles to the forthcoming New Political Science web site.
This would provide authors with the opportunity to embed hyperlinks
within their articles and take full advantage of the web as a publishing
medium.

<P>For further information contact
<P>Chris Toulouse at <a href="MAILTO:urbsoc@gramercy.ios.com">urbsoc@gramercy.ios.com</a>

<P>    The purpose of this workshop is to explore the relation between the
rising popularity of plebiscitary democracy and the changing capacities
of political parties.  The choice to combine direct and representative
democracy will be considered from the perspectives of political theory
as well as of political competition.  The workshop aims to consider
contemporary political, social and intellectual pressures that make
expanded direct democracy an attractive option, and to examine the
implications of such an expansion for established patterns of
party-based democracy.

       the Comserve email interface to CIOS services.  Send the

<P>    The world of politics and mass communication has changed
substantially over the past decades.  Both separate and integrated
developments have led to the present-day situation of turmoil.  The
confusion is apparent in a number of ways and at distinct levels.

<P>    The disparity in communication resources between different parts of
the world or within nations is increasingly recognised as a cause of
concern.  The attempt by local power-elites to totally control the
modern communication channels -- press, broadcasting, education, and
bureaucracy -- does no longer ensure control of all the communication
networks in a given society.  Nor does control of the mass media ensure
support for the controlling forces, nor for any mobilisation around
their objectives, nor for the effective repression of opposition.

<P>    Therefore, no longer governments or rulers are able to operate
effectively, to control, censor, or to play the role of gatekeeper with
regard to all communications networks at all times.  Both alternate and
parallel networks, which may not always be active, often function
through political, socio-cultural, religious or class structures or can
be based upon secular, cultural, artistic, or folkloristic channels.
These networks feature a highly participatory character, high rates of
credibility, and a strong organic integration with other institutions
deeply rooted in a given society.

<P>    The traditionally claimed high standards of public media performance
and especially news reporting, have become eroded by commercialism and
transnationalisation.  Journalists have to give in to the demand of
viewer ratings and outside pressures.  The thin demarcation line between
the political and media world has become even more blurred as a result
of political marketing strategies and economic and political interest
groups.

<P>    Different and often contradictory logics are guiding public
policies.  At the level of the European Union, for instance, the
telecommunications policy with an emphasis on liberalisation and
deregulation differs from the policy recommendations in the broadcasting
field where some measures could be interpreted to be protectionist.  In
general the EU-policies advocate total freedom to provide services
across borders, and that, therefore, total liberalisation may lead to a
future cultural synchronisation and economic oligopolisation of Europe.
Therefore, it is questionable whether the present EU policies contribute
to more than just a single marketplace for producers, and whether the
average European citizen can also benefit from a united Europe?

<P>    These and many more topics will be discussed at an international
conference on "Media & Politics", which will take place from Thursday,
February 27, to Saturday, March 1, 1997, at the Catholic University of
Brussels, Belgium.

<P>    The theme of the conference will be reflected in a number of plenary
sessions with invited national and international speakers from the
academic, political and media world.

<STRONG><CENTER>                             sponsored by<BR>
  IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy
                         in cooperation with
    The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)</CENTER>
</STRONG><BR>
<P>The Symposium on Security and Privacy has, for 16 years, been the
premier forum for the presentation of developments in computer
security and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the
field.  We seek to build on this tradition of excellence by
re-emphasizing work on engineering and applications while maintaining
our interest in theoretical advances.

<P>We continue to seek to broaden the scope of the Symposium.  We want to
hear not only about new theoretical results, but also about the design
and implementation of secure systems in specific application areas and
about policies relating to system security.  We are particularly
interested in papers on policy and technical issues relating to privacy
in the context of the information infrastructure, papers that relate
software and system engineering technology to the design of secure
systems and papers on hardware and architectural support for secure
systems. Papers or Panels which discuss the application of theory to
practice which describe not only the successes but the failures and
the lessons learned are of special interest.

<P>Topics on which papers and panel sessions proposals are invited
include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>

<PRE>        Commercial and Industrial Security,
        Security and other Critical System Properties,
        Secure Systems,
        Distributed Systems,
        Network Security,
        Database Security,
        Data Integrity,
        Access Controls,
        Information Flow ,
        Security Verification,
        Viruses and Worms,
        Security Protocols,
        Authentication,
        Biometrics,
        Smartcards,
        Auditing,
        Intrusion Detection,
        Privacy Issues,
        Policy Modeling</PRE>

<P>A continuing feature of the symposium will be a session of 5-minute
talks. We want to hear from people who are advancing the field in the
areas of system design and implementation, but may lack the resources
needed to prepare a full paper. Abstracts of these talks will be
distributed at the Symposium.</P>

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:<BR>
<P>This year we are instituting mechanisms for "electronic" submission
of papers for the refereeing process. Final papers will still be
submitted in hard copy.

<P>We will continue to accept papers submitted via various forms of mail,
but not fax.  Papers should include an abstract, must not exceed 7500
words, and must report original work that has not been published
previously and is not under consideration for publication
elsewhere. The names and affiliations of authors should appear on a
separate cover page only, as "blind" refereeing is used. Authors must
certify prior to December 27, 1996 that all necessary clearances for
publication have been obtained. The committee strongly encourages
authors to include archival sources as references (books, journal
articles, etc.) and to include references to "WEB" or other "NET"
sources only if they can be backed up by some archival source. In this
way, we can ensure that people who read the paper 5 years from now
will have access to the information used as background and
justification of the arguments presented.

<P>Panel proposals should include a title, an abstract which describes
the topic(s) to be discussed, the names of all proposed participants
and assurances that the participants agree to serve on the panel, a
proposed length and format for the panel and any other information
that the panel proposer thinks would support their proposal. We will
publish the Panel Abstract in the Proceedings as well as any position
papers submitted by the panelists in support of the panel proposal.

<P>Those submitting papers via "hard copy" should send six copies of
their paper or panel proposal to:</P>

George W. Dinolt, Program Co-Chair<BR>
Lockheed Martin Western Development Laboratories,<BR>
Mail Stop X20,<BR>
3200 Zanker Road,<BR>
San Jose, CA 95134.<BR>

<P>Please mark the envelope "IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium."

<P>The title, abstract and authors names should be on a separate cover
page so that we can support the "blind refereeing process." We would
also like to have an electronic, ascii text version of the abstract
sent seperately to secprv97@wdl.lmco.com. The electronic version of
the abstract should include the title and the abstract as it appears
in the paper.

<P>Authors who wish to submit an electronic version of a paper or panel proposal
for evaluation should follow the instructions that will be posted
on our "Web" site at

<P><a href=http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee>
http://www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee</a>

<P>or by sending mail to secprv97@wdl.lmco.com with the word
"Instructions" in the Subject line. Instructions will be included in
the reply.  Papers and panel proposals must be received (however sent)
by 6:00 P.M. (PST) on Monday Dec. 2, 1996 (The deadline has been
extended from the original call). Authors will be notified by
mid-January about the status of their papers.

<P>Authors who submit an abstract for a 5-minute talk should include a
title, all authors names and their affiliations, where appropriate,
and text. The whole should fit easily on one 8.5" by 11" page.
Abstracts for 5-minute talks should be sent to George W. Dinolt at the
above address U.S. Postal address to be received no later than Friday,
April 19, 1997 at 6:00 P.M local time. We will review abstracts and
accept as many as we can. Please mark the envelope

<P>The development of information technologies and new types of digital
content in all aspects of society has far exceeded our understanding
about how these new technologies have reshaped social organization,
work life, interaction patterns and culture. In response to this
shortcoming, the Computer, Information Science, and Engineering
directorate (CISE) and the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences
directorate (SBE) as well as the Education and Human Resources
directorate (EHR) are encouraging multidisciplinary proposals for
research at the interface of behavioral and social science, education
research and information technology. Proposals may be submitted on
standard forms (see the Grant Proposal Guide, NSF 95-27) to existing
programs (see the Guide to Programs NSF 95-138) as this notice calls
attention to existing funding opportunities.

<P>The proposed research should aim to advance our understanding of how
information technologies shape and are shaped by the cognitive, social
and cultural dimensions of groups, organizations, institutions, and
societies. The driving force for this interaction is the widespread
proliferation of distributed computing with vastly increased
processing, communications, and storage capabilities.  Research should
seek to understand the impact of new forms of digital content and
communications accessible to wide segments of society as well as
national and global institutions such as nation states, multinational
corporations and financial institutions. The methodological approach
should be appropriate to the unit of analysis and research questions.
For example, a study of the impact on culture might focus on
understanding how people learn about and use information technology in
real-life situations, or on the interacting technological, social, and
organizational factors that facilitate or impede productive use and
learning. A study of the impact of information technology on nation
states might focus on the changing nature of sovereignty. Especially
welcome are proposals that aim to develop general explanations,
through grounded theory or other empirical approaches. Social science
contributions to the design of systems affecting large segments of the
population are also welcome.  Examples include cognitive, cultural,
economic, ethical, interpersonal, political, sociological and spatial
factors that should be incorporated into systems designed for ordinary
citizens.

<P>We are interested in a broad range of studies on the behavioral,
social and cultural dimensions of new information technologies. For
example, some possible research topics are listed below:


<P>-- Ethnographic studies of how information technologies legitimize
   people's identification with communities, and how human-computer
   dynamics in work- places structure the work process to affect
   productivity.
 
<P>-- Studies that examine economic institutions and organizations,
   including organizational structure; the links between technology,
   agent interaction, and productivity in firms and other organizations;
   and the impact of information technology on the co- evolution of
   economic institutions and cultural norms.
 
<P>-- Labor market issues related to information technology, including its
   impact on income distribution, labor force participation, investments
   in education and training, family structure and the allocation of
   resources within the family.
 
<P>-- Studies of the spatial and geographical implications and behavior
   associated with the spread and use of information technologies.
 
<P>-- Research to develop theories, methods, concepts, and principles that
   provide foundations for making large-scale, collaborative,
   content-rich applications effective in practice in their
   organizational and social contexts.
 
<P>-- Research that examines the operation, impacts, and usage patterns of
   organization-scale computing, content, and collaboration technologies
   with the aim of feeding back resulting knowledge into new technologies
   and new approaches toward integrating them in context.
 
<P>-- Research that examines the use of digital library resources in
   education, science, and technology.  How does the immediacy and
   richness of digital libraries and their associated tools change the
   nature of research and education?  How does the social conduct of
   science change and how can these changes best be accommodated?
 
<P>-- Studies of the research, design, development and implementation
   processes that bring new information technologies into existence, and
   the influence of such technologies on creativity, productivity, and
   social life in a variety of settings, including schools, work places,
   and homes.
 
<P>-- Research on how the cognitive capacities of humans interact with
   information technologies to facilitate or inhibit their use.
 
<P>-- Research to examine and evaluate ethical norms in the development
   and use of new information and communication technologies.
 
<P>-- Research on the roles that these technologies may play in social,
   cultural, political and economic conflict, for example strengthening
   the competitive position of some groups at the expense of others, or
   providing new arenas in which some human beings may exert power over
   others.
 
<P>-- Research to facilitate the development of laws and law-like rules
   regulating access to, use of, and outcomes of using information
   technology.
 
<P>-- Research on the impact of cultures and subcultures on the
   institutionalization and integration of information technology as an
   agent of change (for example, in schools and other workplaces.
 
<P>-- Research that examines the impact of information technology on
   quality and overall performance in organizations, e.g. through better
   integration with customers, process improvement, or better
   coordination of organizational subunits.


<P>Planning grants of $20,000 - $50,000 for 12- 18 months are available
to assist in the preparation of multidisciplinary proposals that might
require collaboration between social and behavioral scientists and
their counterparts in computer science and engineering. For example,
social scientists may want to work with researchers in large,
multidisciplinary NSF-funded projects focusing on information
technologies such as the digital libraries, collaboratories,
partnerships for advanced computing infrastructure (PACI), very high-
performance network services (vBNS), Engineering Research Centers, and
Science and Technology Centers. (see www.nsf.gov, www.cise.nsf.gov and
www.eng.nsf.gov)

<P>Other examples of possible research in the area of information
technology and culture can be found in the workshop report "Culture,
Society and Advanced Information Technology", available from the
Computing Research Association (info@cra.org, fax: (202) 667-1066) or
from the American Anthropological Association
(peggy@mhs.compuserve.com, fax: (703) 528-3546), and on the World Wide
Web at http://cra.org/Reports/Aspects/.

<P>The foundation hopes to make about 10 awards in FY 1997 whose average
duration is about 2-3 years and whose average total award size is
$50,000 - $500,000, subject to available funds and proposals of high
scientific merit.

<P>Prospective applicants should consult one of the program officers
listed below for relevant deadlines and target dates and application
procedures.</P>

 First Announcement and Call for Papers<BR>

<P>Harvard University is hosting this symposium to broaden and deepen
understanding of emerging economic and business models for
global publishing and information access and the attendant
transformation of international information markets, institutions, and
businesses. The goal is to provide managers in public, private, and
nonprofit sectors with a practical framework for developing
program strategies and assessing the efficiency and competitiveness of
new information markets and institutions. It will address
questions such as:</P>

<UL>--What will be the principal pricing models for information in an
advanced global Internet?<BR>

-- How will pricing models be affected by different technological
factors and market environments?<BR>

-- What will be the relationships between classic production costs,
transaction costs, and the economic value of intellectual
property?<BR>

-- How will different pricing practices at lower layers affect the
pricing of information?<BR>

-- What are likely long-term trends and scenarios for different pricing
models? What will be the effect of bundling or unbundling of
information services?<BR>

-- How will changing cost structures change the allocation of rights
between authors and publishers and other intermediaries?<BR>

-- How will markets for complementary products and services affect the
pricing and use of information?<BR>

-- What are the policy implications of different pricing models?<BR>

-- How do these reflect policy values associated with different kinds of
information?<BR>
</UL>
Background:<BR>

<P>The rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web is trans-
forming the way information is accessed and used in business,
education, and the home. New models for distributing, sharing, linking,
and enhancing information are appearing, often embodied in
software or infrastructure. No change is more dramatic than the shift to
user-initiated retrieval for text-based information
formerly distributed in the form of physical objects by
publisher-initiated manufacturing and delivery. A similar shift may be
underway for sound and video. However, the considerable differences in
bandwidth and storage requirements between text,
images, sound, and video may dictate different cost and pricing models
in the near and mid-term. As production and distribution
costs decline, transaction costs and the value of intellectual property
may assume greater prominence. On the other hand,
standards and software may work to substantially reduce transaction
costs over the long run. With barriers to entry reduced by
technology, information markets may become extremely competitive,
reducing margins and possibly lowering the economic value
of many forms of intellectual property.

<P>The Internet and the World Wide Web are characterized by explosion of
information along with an explosion of new tools for
navigating information. Competition for attention intensifies as
companies extend their marketing, sales, and support functions into
the Internet. Useful or entertaining information may have greater value
in attracting customer attention in an increasingly
competitive marketplace for information. Accordingly, it has been argued
that information will be valued less as intellectual
property and more in terms of the access it provides to other markets
and the value it adds to relationships. As a practical
matter, copyright may be overshadowed by the growing use of contracts as
a means of both securing value and defining
expectations in continuing relationships. Positions in simple
distribution chains are likely to erode as a result of disintermediation
and intense competition. In particular, reduced production costs and the
desire to avoid residual transaction costs may force
vendors away from complex pricing models. For example, usage-based
pricing may give way to subscription pricing. Such
dynamics may lead to new institutional arrangements for managing
life-cycle costs of information, especially in small markets
where users are also producers.

<P>Similarly, as production costs decrease, the costs of information may be
assimilated by the underlying infrastructure or assumed
by users. This trend may be seen in the pricing of online services and
in the massive volunteering of content on the World Wide
Web. The Web, including software and servers, enables editorial and
navigation functions traditionally performed by publishers and
libraries to be performed in increased measure by individual authors and
end users. Cost analysis in this environment may hinge on
identification and evaluation of critical bottlenecks -- with the
understanding that many technological limitations may be
short-lived. Congestion may lead to new methods of supplementing
point-to-point transmissions, such as caching, mirroring, and
satellite broadcast. These new mechanisms may raise intellectual
property and interconnection questions that may be addressed
both as business and policy issues. Congestion may also hasten the
implementation of type of service priority at either the network
or server levels. Negotiation over quality and scope of service may
become extremely complex, and vendors may be tempted to
price to as many dimensions of value as possible. However, simple
pricing models may have surprisingly strong appeal, as they
have had in the analog environment. Sequential distribution windows for
motion pictures illustrate the potential for simple price
differentiation in a technologically complex environment. Price
differentiation is now playing an increasingly important role in the
marketing of software and databases. In fact, there may be public policy
arguments for price differentiation, not only for reasons
of efficiency but to enable some of level of access for those who cannot
afford access under standard terms, just as public
libraries have offered access for those who could not afford to buy.
</P>

*****<BR>

<P>The Information Infrastructure Project emphasizes communication and
sharing of insight among scholars and practitioners with
different skills and backgrounds. Papers should be written in a clear,
non-technical manner (technical appendices may be
permitted) for a mixed, interdisciplinary audience that will include
publishers, librarians, economists, lawyers, and policy-
makers.

<P>Prospective authors should submit short abstracts for review and comment
as soon as possible. Extended abstracts or outlines
should be submitted by October 15, 1996, to ensure consideration for the
program. Acceptances of abstracts and outlines are
conditional pending receipt of a satisfactory draft by December 15,
1996. Papers and supplementary material will be published as
a volume in the Project's series with the MIT Press. Copyright
assignment is not required, and parallel publication of individual
papers in journals is encouraged.

<CENTER>              Defending Civilian National Security Interests and Infrastructures</CENTER><BR>

<P>The national security assets of not only the United States, but also major 
industrial and technical societies world-wide are shifting rapidly. The private 
sector infrastructure carries most military communications; builds global 
economies, provides life sustaining power and is responsible for the safety of 
millions of travelers.

<P>A mere few years ago, the world in bi-polar militaristic terms and we sought to 
protect ourselves through a policy of strategic deterrence: MAD. Today, 
distributed capabilities by nation-states, trans-national gangs, terrorists and 
other criminal elements create an entire array of potential adversaries which 
complicates any national defense initiative. The targets become civilian, but 
also affect government operations and military readiness.

<P>What we find occurring is a convergence of interests that traditionally were 
quite separate. The military uses much of the civilian infrastructures to 
conduct the affairs of war and peace; the civilian business sector is 
increasingly viewed as a national security asset worthy of protection. 

<P>This Call For Papers asks that interested parties from governments, academia, 
corporation and the private sector of all nations, submit papers, or concepts 
for papers to be given at InfoWarCon 6, and published on www.infowar.com. The 
papers may be on related topics, but ideally, to conform with the theme of the 
Conference, will take one of several approaches:
<UL>
<LI>	1. Developing methods for information assurance of private sector 
infrastructures and national security related systems. Availability, 
Confidentiality, Integrity, Identity, Repudiation.

<LI>	2. Knowledge and Technology Transfer between the various sectors. How do 
we get the interested parties to talk and cooperate?

<LI>	3. Effective technical or psychological means to educate or train 
populations for defensive national sensitivity. 

<LI>	4. Policy methods, processes, mechanisms and coordination on both a 
national and international scale.

<LI>	5. A military/government view on aspects of Information Warfare, be they 
defensive or offensive, and how they impact or influence the private sector.
Can the Military defend the private sector?

<LI>	6. A civilian/private sector view on aspects of Information Warfare, and
how they affect and impact the military/government of countries. Is corporate 
vigilantism the answer?
</UL>
<P>However, papers on any related subject of interest to a global "Information 
Warfare and Systems Assurance" audience are invited. Last year in Brussels, at 
InfoWarCon 4, representatives from over 30 nation-states participated. For this 
year, a number of top echelon Russian Information Warfare and Information 
Assurance experts will be there to participate in all conference activities.

<P>SOLDIER-SCHOLAR is a bi-annual journal of contemporary military
thought  published by the Military Art and Science faculty at the US Air
Force  Academy.  We are currently seeking paper submissions for our
Fall 1996  issue focusing on Warfare in the Information Age.  As
highlighted in the  President's 1996 National Security Strategy of
Engagement and Enlargement,  "the threat of intrusions to our military
and commercial information  systems poses a significant risk to
national security." We would like to  publish papers discussing both
offensive and defensive issues, and we hope  to examine not only
emerging technologies, but also the strategies  currently in
development which will use those technologies.

<P>Please consider the following when submitting papers:
<UL>
<LI>1. Articles should ideally be 2000-4000 words in length, though 
submissions of all lengths will certainly be considered.
<LI>2. Papers on topics other than the main theme may also be published;
you  are welcome to submit articles on other subjects.   
<LI>3. Please submit 3 copies of your paper which do not include the author's 
name or any other identification.  Additionally, a brief synopsis of your 
thesis and main points is requested on a separate sheet.   
<LI>4. Please also send a computer file copy, using a format which can be read  by
Microsoft Word 6.0.   
<LI>5. All articles are subject to editing and proofs will not be sent to the  authors prior to publication.  
<LI>6. Deadline for article submission: 15 October 1996 
</UL>

<BR>
From: <a href="MAILTO:mjrose@leland.Stanford.EDU">mjrose@leland.Stanford.EDU</a> (Marilynn Rose)<BR>
<P>Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management
Center on Work, Technology and Organizing</P>

School of Engineering<BR>
Stanford University<BR>
<BR>


<P>        Over the next two years, the Department of Industrial Engineering
and Engineering Management (IEEM) at Stanford University anticipates two
tenure-track positions in its newly established Center on Work, Technology
and Organizing (WTO). The level of appointment is open. We invite both
junior and senior scholars to apply. We expect to hire one new faculty
member for the fall of 1997 and the other for the fall of 1998.

<P>       The Center on Work, Technology and Organizing seeks to generate
knowledge, research and theory in the area of work, technology, and
organizing. WTO will also develop educational programs on work and
technology and serve as a nexus for an extended intellectual community of
researchers from academia, industry and government who are concerned with
issues of work and technology.  Representative research areas that would
fall within WTO's mandate include: the interplay between technologies and
work practices; the relation between work practices and organization
design; the consequences of a shifting technological infrastructure for
cultural understandings of work; designers', managers', and workers' images
of work; and research and development as a form of work.  Although open to
all research methods, WTO is strongly committed to field research, since we
start from the premise that our knowledge of work in contemporary
organizations is insufficient.

<P>        We are primarily interested in applicants who study the
intersection between work and technology in situ.  We are less concerned
with disciplinary background and, in fact, hope to build an
interdisciplinary team.  Experience in or familiarity with engineering,
design or the physical sciences is expected and the individual selected
will have a set of skills relevant to a school of engineering.  We
encourage applications from active researchers who fit these general
specifications, including organizational theorists, industrial engineers,
behavioral and social scientists, and computer scientists interested in
situated studies of human-computer interaction.  Applicants should possess
or soon expect to receive a Ph.D.  We expect the individuals we hire to
continue as active researchers and to be willing collaborators who are
committed to building WTO into a vibrant intellectual community.

<P>        In addition to playing a central role in WTO, applicants will also
have teaching and citizenship responsibilities in the Department of
Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management. IEEM offers a unique
environment for teaching and research in the context of an Engineering
School. IEEM's faculty brings engineers together with social scientists
around a curriculum that fuses production, operations management and
engineering risk analysis with organizational behavior and the management
of technology.

 <P>       Interested individuals should submit a vita and samples of their
work by December 15, 1996 to: Professor Stephen R. Barley, Chair of the
Search Committee, Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering
Management,  Terman 340, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-4024.

<P>        Stanford University is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action
Employer.  Female and minority candidates are strongly encouraged to apply.</P>

<P>1996 INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY SURVEY
<P>Findings Reveal Security Problems in Fortune 1,000 Corporations

<P>Baltimore, Maryland (November 21, 1996) ---- A new information security survey of Fortune 1,000 firms has produced striking evidence of serious problems in many commercial organizations.  Nearly half of the 205 firms that responded admitted that their computer networks had been successfully attacked and penetrated by "outsiders" in the past year -- with losses and associated costs considerably higher than previously estimated.

<P>     The results of the 1996 Information Systems Security Survey, which was sponsored by WarRoom Research, LLC, will be presented during a Morning Newsmaker press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, 9 am Thursday, November 21, 1996.  The survey drew an unprecedented high rate of response from the estimated 500 corporate professionals surveyed, noted WarRoom Research executive vice president Mark Gembicki.


<P>     "It was sent to the right people," Mr. Gembicki explained.  "It was distributed by executives and staff from six prominent organizations, among them several leading vendors of information security technologies which typically passed it on to senior managers who are clients and associates."  Representatives from the six organizations who distributed the survey are scheduled to appear at the press conference to comment on and help explain the results.

 <P>     The objectives of the survey were two-fold.  The first was to better quantify the potential security threats and vulnerabilities to these businesses, as well as to the National Information Infrastructure -- the nations vital computer systems such as banking, transportation, and telecommunications.  We also hoped this research would foster a greater awareness of the need for joint public/private-sector initiatives to better secure corporate and government networks, noted WarRoom Research president Steven Shaker.

<P>     The survey also had another intriguing credential.  The survey questionnaire was accompanied by a letter from Senator Sam Nunns Chief Counsel with the U.S. Senates Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, expressing their interest in the results and promising to respect the surveys guarantee of anonymity to all respondents.

<P>     Mr. Gembicki expressed his gratitude to the respondents and to the groups that distributed the survey:  IBM, Interpact, National Computer Security Association, Security Dynamics, Symantec, and the WheelGroup.  Comments from the distributing companies include:

<P>     Interpact/<a href="www.infowar.com">www.infowar.com</a> -- "The WarRoom Survey serves as yet another wake-up call to Corporate America and the Government: computer crime, cyber-terrorism, and espionage are all real facets of Information Warfare," said Winn Schwartau, president.  "It's time to take them seriously."

<P>     Symantec/<a href="www.symantec.com">www.symantec.com</a> -- "Symantec provides solutions addressing two of the top three security vulnerabilities identified by this study, including anti-virus and encryption software," said Bill Stover, senior director of federal sales.  "Symantec was pleased to participate in distributing the survey, and is committed to addressing security issues among individuals as well as corporate and government users."

<P>     WheelGroup/<a href="www.wheelgroup.com">www.wheelgroup.com</a> -- "A large percentage of respondents indicated they had policies on computer use which is an encouraging statistic on the surface," said Chris Goggans, senior network security engineer.  "However, 129 of the 205 companies actually caught insiders misusing their computer systems and this may be an indication that corporate security policies are not adequate and more technical solutions are needed."

<P>     Executives from 98 of the 205 firms which responded to the survey acknowledged that their staff had detected intruders who gained unauthorized access to computer systems in the past year -- but fully 27 percent of the respondents doubted their organization had the capability to detect illicit access attempts, or even penetration of their computers.

<P>     The corporations surveyed were willing to estimate the losses and associated costs for each successful intrusion by outsiders into their computer network.  Costs per incident were estimated at over $50,000 by 84 percent (136) of the respondents.  Moreover, 41 percent indicated losses of more than $500,000 per intrusion with 36 of these companies estimating losses at over a million dollars.

<P>     The next phase of this project will begin in early 1997 and include a much broader study of information systems security issues.  One area of focus will be an analysis of emerging threats and vulnerabilities, as well as interviews with executives on known competitor and adversary attacks.  Typical security indicators dont reveal how far someone will go to target a company and what methods they will use, said Mr. Shaker.  We are going to take a hard look at information systems security when it comes to illegal espionage and legal competitive intelligence.</P>

<P>Subject:  Information Systems Security Survey conducted by WarRoom Research, LLC

<P>The questionnaire was of great interest to Senator Sam Nunn, Ranking Minority Member of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.  This past summer, the Subcommittee expanded its series of investigations into national security issues by examing the threats and vulnerabilities of our National Information Infrastructure.  Hearings were held in May, June and July 1996 which showed how dependent our nation is on the reliability of computer networks, the integrity of the information flowing and stored on these networks, and on the accessibility of information available on these networks.  For this reason, the Subcommittee expressed interest in including WarRoom Research's survey results as part of its hearing record.  To do this, the Subcommittee promised to respect the survey's guarantee of anonymity to all respondents.  Although this survey was a collaborative effort with the Subcommittee and was developed to be independent of their work, WarRoom Research's survey results supported the Subcommittees findings.

<BR>

October 31, 1996

<P>You've got your passport. You've got your airline tickets. You've got your
notebook. You're a high-tech road warrior, ready to take off and take on the
world. But do you have the Executive Notebook Computer Travel Kit? Without it,
or a similar collection of the bits and pieces contained therein, you
might not be able to power up, or jack in, when you arrive at destinations that don't
celebrate Independence Day on the 4th of July. 

<P>A surprising number of business people are still surprised to find that many
countries in the world don't use RJ-11 sockets to plug in phones and modems. 
And even though a lot of today's notebook computers automatically adjust to a wide
range of voltages, many countries don't dish up the juice in familiar U.S.
sockets. For business travelers whose laptop batteries need charging at least
daily, and for those who can't work without frequent email pickup and
delivery, the worldwide array of socket and plug combinations is a serious impediment. 

<P>Some have already adopted a piecemeal approach to the problem, buying country
specific adapters as needed. But this can be expensive if you have to
travel to more than a couple of countries. For example, at Fry's Electronics in Silicon
Valley you can buy adapters at $10-$15 per country, economical if you are only
going to one country, but costly if you are on a 7 country swing through the 
EC, where "community standards" is an oxymoron, at least when it comes to
electricity and telephones.

<P>Fortunately, there is a pretty comprehensive solution right around the
corner at the Computer City chain of stores (see <a href="www.computercity.com">www.computercity.com</a> for the store
nearest you or call 817 390 2700).

<P>They now sell something called the Executive Notebook Computer Travel Kit,
a neat zippered bag of tricks, custom made in
China for this retail division of Tandy Corp. Unzip the bag and you get
several compartments where adapters are grouped by region. You will find power plug
adapters for just about anywhere in the world, with a handy chart of voltages
for those who have 110 only devices (sorry, no power conversion, that
requires a separate transformer). 

<P>The Executive Notebook Computer Travel Kit includes country specific phone
adapters for Belgium, France, Germany (which requires 2 deceptively similar
versions), Italy, and Australia. These are all made so that you can unplug the
phone, then plug in the adapter, your modem, and the phone. There is also a UK
adapter that works in New Zealand as well, plus a selection of RJ-11 adapters
(in-line, line doubling) that should handle just about anything in Asia and
South America, not to mention older hotels in North America. A couple of phone
patch cords are also included, plus a compact parallel printer cable, which
ingeniously converts to a null modem cable. 

<P>At $49.95 for all this, the Executive Notebook Computer Travel Kit strikes
this particular traveler as a bargain. Successfully collecting my email from the
other side of the world still gives me a real rush. And it sure beats 
collapsing into a hotel room at the end of a long day's travel, only to find I can't
connect my laptop to anything useful. From now on I am going to pack this
particular bag on every trip.

<P>Stephen Cobb, CISSP, was born in Britain, has lived in four countries and
travelled to fifteen. He has also visited 47 of the 50 states that constitute
the country of which he is now a citizen.

November 26 1996<BR>
<P>The world is moving toward new warfighting paradigms, and the electromagnetic spectrum holds the key to DoD's successful use of technological advantages of today and tomorrow. 

<P>Volume 11, Number 83


<P>Prepared remarks by Emmett Paige Jr., assistant secretary of defense for command,control, communications and intelligence, to the Armed Forces Communications Electronics Association Spectrum Management Symposium, Washington, July 10, 1996.


<P>The focus of my remarks today is on the radio frequency, or RF, portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. I will touch on some of the characteristics of the spectrum, review its importance to the DoD and outline how the DoD's experience and expertise in using the electromagnetic spectrum efficiently can point the way towards technical approaches that will ensure adequate spectrum
access for both the private sector and the public sector of our society.

<P>My objective today is to leave no doubt whatsoever about the importance of the spectrum to defense and national security.

<P>I am not here to sell you some wolf tickets, but to give you the facts from the [perspective] of the person in DoD who has the charter responsibility. 

<P>Let's begin with some of the unique characteristics of the electromagnetic spectrum. We human beings cannot perceive it --- we cannot see it, taste it, hear it, smell it or feel it. Yet our everyday lives are tremendously affected by our use of the spectrum.

<P>I'm talking about television, cellular telephones, weather satellites, cruise missiles, microwave ovens, the air traffic control system, police radars, tornado tracking Doppler radars, MRIs [magnetic resonance images], baby monitors, command and control systems, car radios, pagers and reconnaissance/strike systems.

<P>Through our toolmaking creativity, we have taken an intangible resource, the electromagnetic spectrum, and developed systems and devices that have immense tangible impact on our society and our national security. We may not be able see the RF spectrum, but we can see its utility. It is intangible, but it has immense value. Today, that value is measured not only in what we can do with
the spectrum, but also in monetary value of that utility, both in terms of revenues for the U.S. Treasury and the market place value of spectrum use licenses.

<P>This intangible but immensely useful resource, the electromagnetic spectrum, has another key characteristic -- it is finite. We have today all the spectrum we are ever going to have. But because of its immense utility, our use of the spectrum is growing every day, and by "our" I mean everybody: the private sector; local, state and federal government; domestic and international alike.

<P>This seeming paradox -- ever greater use of a finite resource -- is made possible by our technological advances. We are able to exploit the spectrum wisely and ever more efficiently. Through technological advances, such as the digital communications techniques initially developed by the military, we as a society are able to do more with the same amount of spectrum. It is this technology-enabled increase in efficient use of the spectrum that has enabled humankind to wring
ever increasing usage out of the finite electromagnetic spectrum. So let there be no doubt that the spectrum is an intangible and finite resource of ever increasing utility and ever increasing value to all of us. I am convinced that we still have a lot to learn and a long way to go in terms of getting more effective and more efficient use of the overall spectrum.

<P>We in the Department of Defense and the intelligence community fully understand the ever increasing utility and ever increasing value of the electromagnetic spectrum. The DoD's needs are increasing too. Our tasks for the nation have become more challenging since the end of the Cold War, for we are being called upon to do more things in more places than ever before. Right now,
the department has efforts under way across the breadth of the world, involving peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, disaster relief, counterterrorism, counternarcotics, counterproliferation, regional security and the protection of U.S. citizens. All of this is occurring while we are also maintaining our readiness to fight two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts and continuing our deterrence of
nuclear conflict. 

<P>These diverse and far-flung activities share at least two common features: First, they are being accomplished in defense of our nation and its citizens; second, they cannot be accomplished without use of the electromagnetic spectrum. That's a hard, cold fact that everyone must face up to. We are not "blowing smoke."

<P>As our use of technology has advanced, enabling us to have greater impact with fewer forces, our dependence on the electromagnetic spectrum has increased.

<P>Our military, just like much of our modern society, simply cannot function without adequate access to the electromagnetic spectrum. What does loss of spectrum access mean to our nation's military capability? 

<P>Essentially, the impact of diminished spectrum access will be a reduction in the effectiveness and overall capability of our military forces. It will impact our capacity to efficiently execute our mission. Losing spectrum is like losing any other resource, it costs. 

<P>Less spectrum access yields an increased expenditure of time, funds and other resources to develop, test and field alternative capabilities or work-arounds that in many cases will be less effective than the capabilities they replace. 

<P>Less spectrum access yields a degradation of military readiness while alternative capabilities are developed and due to more complicated training requirements. Each work-around is one more thing our young people must learn and remember, perhaps while under fire. Each time we are forced to "adjust" training in the United States away from operational norms to accommodate domestic spectrum constraints, our training realism and hence training effectiveness suffers.

<P>Loss of spectrum access forces us to expend other resources to compensate or make expenditures that do not advance our capabilities.

<P>The issue of spectrum stress is as great at home as it is with our deployed forces. With our permanent overseas presence significantly reduced, 85 percent of our forces train and exercise in the continental United States. If we cannot train as we fight, no matter how advanced our equipment may be, there can be little doctrinal development or organizational changes, and in the mind of the warrior, no confidence [in] the use of those advanced systems. As a result, our great
technological advantage is squandered.

<P>The reallocation of government spectrum executed over the past decade and the upcoming reallocation of spectrum associated with Title IV of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 are already forcing DoD to re-engineer or replace equipment that is still effective and long before the end of its planned life cycle. 

<P>From my perspective, the DoD and the nation are losing in two ways: the cost in lost military effectiveness and the financial cost of re-engineering, redesign or replacing existing systems. The ability of our target acquisition radars, remotely piloted vehicles, missile systems, shipboard air traffic control radars, long-range air surveillance radars and tactical radio relay to perform as
intended in both peacetime and conflict is being directly affected. Further, we have not yet felt the impact of the 235 MHz [megahertz] reallocation of Title IV as those frequencies are not yet being used by the private sector. The department is concerned that even more reallocation and system relocation will be demanded before the impact of the 235 MHz reallocation of Title VI has been
realized. We are concerned that decisions will be made without adequate consideration of impact on military capability and of the cost to relocate systems. I have the feeling that there are many folks on the [Capitol] Hill and in this country that do not care or at least do not believe us when we tell them that their military forces will be impacted.

<P>The department fears the spectrum upon which our ability to execute national security missions depends will be reduced to the vanishing point; reduced to the point that we cross the threshold being unable to provide adequate support to our young men and women in the field and the units to which they are assigned. A hasty decision to reallocate government spectrum will be costly for the
department -- costly financially, costly in readiness and costly in our ability to defend the nation.

<P>There are some, not realizing these costs, who have suggested that we in the military just move our systems to "some other" frequency bands or replace existing systems with new ones using other bands of frequencies, but they are not the same folks who authorize and appropriate funds to DoD.

<P>I submit that there are factors in addition to cost that must be considered. First, in some cases we use the bands we do because they are the frequencies that work for the purpose at hand. The physics of radio wave propagation is not something we can change. In other cases, our use of the spectrum is bound by international agreements since DoD operations are conducted worldwide.
Relocation of systems is not trivial because each piece of equipment interacts with many others. Relocation and adjustment can have a domino effect. Changes in any single part of the system can force changes in other parts of the integrated military system. Then there is the cost factor. Changing the operating frequency of a piece of equipment is a re-engineering effort; replacing
perfectly effective equipment just to effect a frequency change is costly. This is particularly difficult in an era of declining budgets. Lastly, the spectrum we move to often is less optimal for the functions concerned that the spectrum we leave. Hence, not only do we spend more, we get less. 

<P>There are some who accuse DoD of hoarding spectrum. This simply is not true. In the first place, DoD owns no spectrum. We are permitted access to specific bands of frequencies by joint agreement with NTIA [National Telecommunications Information Administration] and the FCC
[Federal Communications Commission]. Overseas, we have similar agreements with each host nation within whose borders we operate. In the United States our frequency assignments are approved by NTIA. DoD has access to spectrum, we do not own it. Today, in the most desirable bands of frequency below three GHz [gigahertz], 30 percent of the frequencies are reserved for the
exclusive use of the private sector. The private sector and the federal government share access to 56 percent of the frequencies. Thus, only 14 percent of the frequencies below three GHz are reserved for federal use. Over 86 percent of this valuable part of the RF spectrum is today available to the private sector, and that percentage will increase when the provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 come into effect.

<P>The need to review spectrum usage, to clearly articulate requirements and identify opportunities for sharing does not fall upon the DoD and other federal users alone, but also upon all users of the spectrum in the United States. Spectrum sharing is a way to satisfy the growing demands, both private and government, for this finite and increasingly important resource. We know this can be
done because the Department of Defense does it daily. Our definition of sharing is using technology and coordination to enable disparate users to exploit the same spectrum; multiple users of the same frequencies whose individual uses are technically compatible; multiple reuse of the same frequencies
through physical separation of users. We develop and implement technical spectrum sharing criteria among the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. There has never been an abundance spectrum. We have never been able to give each individual system or individual user the luxury of their own unshared frequency bands. We carefully examine the functions to be performed. We
separate the high-powered or highly critical spectrum uses from other uses to prevent interference. We collocate compatible uses. We engineer our systems to operate compatibly -- tolerant of other uses in the same or nearby bands. We also employ dynamic management to maximize frequency reuse to meet our extensive requirements. To meet emerging military and intelligence data transfer
requirements, which are expected to exceed multigigabits of information, demands effective spectrum utilization on our part. We know that sharing of spectrum works because we do it every day throughout the world. Outside of the DoD in contrast, sharing often means highly inefficient band segmentation in which individual users are provided their own piece of the spectrum, often
with additional, valuable spectrum squandered as unused "guard bands." Lastly, we know that spectrum sharing will work even better in the future with the advent of digital communications technology.

<P>Drawing from DoD's national and worldwide experiences, two essential elements for successful spectrum sharing are performance criteria and standards for the technical design of receivers as well as transmitters. We have and use performance standards and receiver standards within the DoD. Many other nations in the world have both receiver standards and transmitter standards.
Today, the U.S. employs only transmitter standards. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 did include language on the adoption of receiver standards. To date, the FCC has taken no action on this. ... The United States needs to implement and enforce such standards to ensure that
commercial, federal and military systems can operate harmoniously when used within the United States or in other countries. The adoption of such standards by the United States would also aid the international competitiveness of our industry's spectrum-dependent products.

<P>The Department of Defense is concerned that we are viewed as the only, or as the principal, source of reallocatable spectrum for meeting the growing needs of the private sector. Instead of a national review of all spectrum use, there has been a persistent erosion of government spectrum and the apparent adoption of an implicit policy that concentrates on government spectrum as the default source to satisfy new private sector needs.

<P>Our worldwide experience convinces us there is a better way to ensure adequate spectrum access for all users than the "zero sum game" of reallocation. But if that is the reallocation approach taken, it must be taken with great care. As Secretary [of Defense William J.] Perry stated in his Nov. 4, 1995, letter to Sens. [Trent] Lott [Miss.], [John] McCain [Ariz.] and [Kay B.] Hutchinson [Texas], before any further government spectrum is reallocated, target bands must be carefully reviewed. Consideration of the impacts on cost, military operations, intelligence operations and ultimately national security must be a priority.

<P>The Department of Defense knows the value of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the gulf war, the coalition's first attacks were aimed at Iraq's use of the spectrum, Iraq's radars and communications. We sought to render our adversary blind, deaf and dumb by denying him access to the electromagnetic spectrum. 

<P>Without the spectrum, the Iraqis could not mount a coordinated offense and could not sustain any defense. Without immediate access to spectrum, neither could we.

<P>The issue is more complex than summary statements regarding the relative ease or difficulty of reallocating DoD spectrum. [Army] Gen. [John M.] Shalikashvili [chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff] strongly asserts that coalition warfare is our preferred strategy. Much of our current spectrum access is linked to international access afforded our alliance and coalition partners worldwide. Loss
or reallocation of this access would have significant repercussions in our ability to operate effectively with other nations. As we shift to other less advantageous areas of the spectrum, our allies are left with awkward choices. Our commanders in the field and at sea must not be limited in either operational flexibility or ability to operate with allies.

<P>Well over a decade ago, a Soviet general reportedly said something like "to prevail in the next conflict, one must control the electromagnetic spectrum." That statement proved true in the Bacca Valley and on deserts in Iraq.

<P>The Department of Defense is committed to ensuring that "in the next conflict" it is we who will control the spectrum. We know its value.

<P>Gen. Shalikashvili is fond of noting that the nature of war is unchanged, but its character is in constant change. He is exactly right. We are moving toward new warfighting paradigms. These opportunities are available only to those willing to boldly exploit the technological advantages of the type that we currently hold. 

<P>Remember that the electromagnetic spectrum hold[s] the key to our successful use of our technological advantages of today and tomorrow.

November 23 1996<BR>
<P>[Source: Coming solar cycle may pose problems, AP item, 19 Nov 1996, 
PGN Stark Abstracting and Excerpting Service.]

<P>Cycle 23 of solar interference activities is building up, and is expected to
have considerable effects on our planet around the year 2000, according to a
panel of government researchers.  (Cycle 22 was at its peak in July 1989
[see RISKS-8.38, 39 on electric currents induced in power lines, blacking
out Quebec, and RISKS-8.72 for a more detailed retrospective article]; the
strongest cycle to date was in November 1957.)  In particular, many new
industries have emerged that were not subjected to previous solar effects --
and they have not anticipated the risks to their systems and their
businesses.  Navigation and communications are considered to be particularly
vulnerable.  For information on the report, you might try contacting Air
Force Col. Jud Stailey, assistant director of the Office of Federal
Coordinator for Meteorological Services, a 13-agency panel housed in the
offices of the National Weather Service, or Ernie Hildner, director of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Environment Center
in Boulder, Colo.

<P>Potential problems to anticipate include damage to computers and other
electrical systems in satellites; expansion of the Earth's atmosphere,
slowing down satellites and pieces of space debris, making them harder to
track; induced currents in pipelines and other large arrays of metal;
disruption of signals for the inexpensive single-frequency global
positioning system satellites; interference with the newly developed
satellite cell-phone system; changes in the Earth's magnetic field,
interfering with signals used to direct oil drilling bits deep underground.

<P>  [An obvious question for RISKS readers is which will have a more dramatic
  effect, Y2K or Cycle 23?  Perhaps we will have Murphy-slaw and each will
  reinforce the other on the same day!  PGN]</P>

	Emergency Economic Powers Act ("Act") (50 U.S.C. 1702), I, William
	J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, find that
	the unrestricted access of foreign parties to U.S. goods,
	technology, and technical data and the existence of certain
	boycott practices of foreign nations, in light of the expiration
	of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.
	App. 2401 et seq.), constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat
	to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
	United States and hereby declare a national emergency with respect
	to that threat.

<P>Apparently this state of emergency is still in effect.  This is what
gives the President the power to unilaterally make changes in the export
policy.  It would be nice if our congresspeople would take some
responsibility in this matter.</P>

<P>Top Information Warriors, International security experts, military
experts, flag officers and security professionals from government
agencies will join with corporate information assurance executives to
discuss and review state-of-the-art techniques in countermeasures
necessary to combat information warfare attacks against the information
infrastructures of the United States and allied nations. </P>

<P>Leaders from industry, government and the international scene will also
discuss policy options for defense as well as response to attacks. 
Groups such as FEMA, the American Red Cross, Power and
Telecommunications Associations as well as academics, major financial
institutions and law enforcement will contribute their experiences to
work to solve the problems we face nationally and internationally.</P>

<P>Information Warfare is likely to influence both military operations
other than war (OOTW), and the violent peace with which both law
enforcement and corporate security professionals must concern
themselves. Electronic Civil Defense for the 21st Century is the focus
of this conference.</P>

<P>Information Warfare represents a direct threat to governments,
financial and business information systems of corporations and private
businesses, and the personal privacy of ordinary citizens.  Information
Warfare is a relatively low cost method for less- developed
nation-states or underground organizations and trans-national gangs to
acquire technology, along with tactical and strategic economic
information, from more-developed nations, governments,
corporate/business entities, and individuals.</P>  


<P>Information Warfare is also a means for terrorists, criminals, or
politically-motivated splinter groups to attack their enemies.  Methods
for launching Information Warfare attacks can be done anonymously and
remotely, circumvent laws and detection, and employ an array of
clandestine electronic and human intelligence techniques.</P>

<P>Electronic Civil Defense is the guiding concept which unites all
aspects of a nations information infrastructure into a unified
mindset.  Its purpose is to prepare for, and where necessary,
counteract the effects of organized and unorganized attempts on the
part of individuals, terrorist elements, criminal enterprises, or rouge
nations to subvert friendly nations, commercial institutions, and armed
forces through malicious destruction of critical information systems
assets such as banking, medical, or defense-related systems. </P>

<P>The conference is sponsored by the National Computer Security
Association and two internationally known experts: Mr. Winn Schwartau
(author of INFORMATION WARFARE: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway);
and, Mr. Robert Steele (author of various works which focus on the
common theme of "Smart People, Dumb Nations: Bad Business").</P>

<P>Speakers include: Commander in-Chief of the Atlantic Command, General
John J. Sheehan; Steve Katz, Chief Information Security Officer,
Citibank; Sally Katzen, Administrator for Information and Regulatory
Affairs, OMB; Drs. Anders Eriksson and Peter Wallstroem, National
Defense Research Establishment, Dept. of Defense Analysis, Sweden;
General Jim McCarthy, USAF (Ret); Capt. Gregory Blackburn, Director of
Information Warfare, OSD/C3I; Air Vice Marshall Brendon OLoughlin,
Australian Defense Attach; Ron Eward, Martech, Inc.; Michael Logan,
Federal Planning Associate, The American Red Cross; William W. Donovan,
FEMA; Greg Brown, IBM Business Recovery Services; Danielle Cailloux,
Judge, Committee on Intelligence, Belgium; Col. Charles Dunlap, Judge
Advocate, USAF; and many more experts. </P>

ALIGN="LEFT"><h3>By LIEUTENANT GENERAL ERVIN J. ROKKE,
USAF</h3><BR> President, National Defense University <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Unpredictable change is what our nation's future
national security dilemma is all about. Appreciation for this
uncertainty is the beginning of wisdom in the post-Cold War era.
Not only is international politics in flux, but, furthermore,
technological breakthroughs relevant to national security are
occurring with greater frequency and with more substantial impact
than ever in history.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In this world full of
instability and rapid change, the U.S. government needs to muster
the full range of options at its command if it is to achieve its
goals at a price consistent with the resources its citizens are
prepared to devote to international affairs. Rather than simply
deploring the constrained resources made available for some of
the
traditional foreign policy and national security institutions, we
need to explore how to make use of the opportunities offered by
change.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This report represents an effort by
the National Defense University to examine what in this new world
environment are the strengths and weaknesses of the various
instruments available for influencing the behavior of foreign
governments. We hope that it will prove to be of interest not
only
to policymakers, but also to all readers with an interest in
security policy.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Strategic Assessment
applies the research expertise of the National Defense
University,
under the leadership of its interdisciplinary research arm, the
Institute for National Strategic Studies, with the generous
assistance of analysts from elsewhere in the U.S. government.
Offering such analyses, in both general and more specialized
areas
of interest to the national security community, is one part of
NDU's educational mission. That mission, as defined by the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, is to educate senior military and government
officials on issues related to national strategy, security
policy,
resources management, and warfare in the information age. It is
our
hope that this report is both authoritative and informative, and
that its influence will extend beyond the narrowly defined
national
security establishment. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> We wish to thank all
those who contributed to the success of this project,
particularly
the many analysts both inside and outside the military who wrote
or
reviewed chapters of the Assessment. We hope that this report
will
stimulate further thinking, discussion, and research on the
issues
treated in its pages among both policymakers and policy
analysts.<hr>
<h2>Foreward</h2><p>
<h3>By Hans Binnendijk, Editor-in-Chief</h3><p>
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In 1995, INSS inaugurated its annual
Strategic
Assessment with a survey of the world strategic environment from
the perspective of U.S. interests. This year, we continue the
series with a look at the instruments by which the U.S.
government
can influence the behavior of other governments. Our current
thinking is that the 1997 volume will examine flashpoints, i.e.,
the zones in which conflict and disorder may erupt in the next
decade, and the 1998 volume will return to the 1995 format, that
is, to update our 1995 survey of the key policy issues facing the
U.S. government.<p> <H3 ALIGN="LEFT"> Structure </H3> <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> We begin this volume by setting the scene, with
a
chapter about how the world is changing from the perspective of
U.S. security interests. Then we discuss the instruments of U.S.
power, starting with those that use persuasion rather than force
and proceeding to those that require progressively more use of
force--that is why our first chapter is about diplomacy and our
last chapter is about weapons of mass destruction. Using this
principle, we divide the instruments of U.S. power into three
groups: <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i> * Non-military instruments <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> * Political-military instruments <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> * Warfighting instruments</i> <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The final chapter is an executive summary that also draws some
general conclusions about how the instruments of U.S. power could
be made more effective. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Our focus is on
traditional foreign policy and defense issues. Some may argue
that
environmental security or economic security is, over the long
run,
a more vital issue than military concerns. While that may be the
case, we feel that what we National Defense University analysts
can
do best is to concentrate on the areas we know best. In so far as
we are able to, we try to touch on nontraditional areas of what
might be called national security in its broadest sense, but we
do
not pretend to do justice to these topics. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our
aim is to analyze the means available to the U.S. government in
the
current period to affect the behavior of other governments. We
want
to stress several points about that aim. Our focus is on the
instruments, not on the purposes to which they may be put. We
concentrate on what has changed since the end of the Cold War and
on what will continue to be the case for the next few years, not
on
the long sweep of history, not what may come to pass in several
decades, nor what will be the burning issues over the next few
months. Our net has been cast widely: we include in our set of
instruments a variety of institutions and capabilities that
perhaps
are not policy instruments strictly speaking. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The <i>Strategic Assessment</i> is aimed at policymakers,
analysts,
and informed members of the public who want a serious summary
statement of the tools available to the U.S. government for
accomplishing its aims vis-a-vis other governments. It does not
provide novel interpretations or detailed specialized research.
Specialists in one subject are unlikely to find much new material
on that issue here, although we hope they will find a succinct
statement of the applicability of that instrument of national
power, as well as some insight into the relationship among
various
instruments. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Although<i> Strategic Assessment
1996</i> strives to assess what factors are likely to limit or to
enhance the power of each instrument, its primary intent is not
to
advocate particular policies or approaches to policy. It is
neither
a statement nor a critique of U.S. government policy. The views
expressed in this document are those of the editors and do not
necessarily reflect the offical policy or position of the

Defense University, the Department of Defense, or the U.S.

This volume analyzes how the utility of various instruments of
U.S.
power has changed in recent years, primarily owing to the end of
the Cold War. For that reason, we need to set forth our view of
the changing international context within which the instruments
are applied. Our perspective on the emerging new world order was
set forth in the first chapter of Strategic Assessment 1995,
which we summarize here with some changes in nuance to reflect
developments during 1995 and with some additional material to
extend the analysis beyond the realm of geostrategy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The essential characteristics of the present strategic
environment are uncertainty and change. The world is going
through several types of dramatic changes. For heuristic
purposes, those changes can be grouped into three broad
categories--geostrategic, information, and, less clearly defined
than the others, character of government.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<A NAME="subhead1">
<a name="Geostrategic Developments">Geostrategic Developments 
</H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The world geostrategic scene cannot be described as simply as
during the Cold War, when the Western-Soviet confrontation was
the prism through which all events had to be viewed. At least
three perspectives are needed now to analyze the emerging
international system: seen from the top down, the major powers
have changed; seen cross-sectionally, states are arraying
themselves into three categories depending upon their success at
establishing democracy and free-market prosperity; and seen from
the bottom up, transnational problems have become a more
important part of the world scene.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Major Powers. </I>In the past, the defining characteristic of
a major shift from one world order to another was the transition
in relations among the major powers (indeed, among the European
powers). A shift in worlds was indicated by dramatic change in
the answers to three questions: who were the major players, what
they could do to one another, and what did they wish to do to one
another. Perhaps the classic example is the French Revolution
with its new player (democratic France), its new capability (the
citizen army), and its new intentions (spreading liberty,
equality, and fraternity). Similar transitions occurred with the
Congress of Vienna in 1815, the unification of Germany in 1870,
the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, and the developments following
World War II, as well as with the end of the Cold War.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the new world geostrategic environment is more complex than
great power politics, one of the new order's basic defining
characteristics remains the relationship among the major powers.
Those powers are the U.S., Western Europe, Russia, China, and
Japan, though India may join the group within a decade or so. At
the end of the Cold War, some thought that the new world would be
unipolar, that is, the U.S. would dominate the world scene. In
fact, the American people have not been interested in that job.
Instead of being unipolar, the world consists of asymmetric
poles, in which one (the U.S.) is much the strongest but the
others are nonetheless important independent actors.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Note: Percent figure is U.S. share of world total.In the first
blush of enthusiasm at the end of the Cold War, the
great powers were all cooperating. Now, relations among some are
cooler, and differences of perspective are more pronounced:
U.S.-China relations are characterized by suspicions and
disagreements on many issues, the hopes for a new strategic
relationship between the U.S. and Russia have faded away, the
tone in trade disputes between the U.S. and Japan has become
sharper, and the U.S. and Western Europe have disagreed about how
to handle the Bosnian crisis. But peace prevails, and that is a
powerful force for stability in the world. None of the great
powers is currently preparing for conflict with another. That
might change over time. If the powers were to consolidate around
themselves political and economic blocs that were exclusive
rather than open, tensions could emerge at the edges of the
blocs, such as between Russia and Western Europe or between China
and the U.S. A <B>clash among great powers</B>, directly or
through proxies, would be the greatest international threat the
U.S. could face, though it is a remote possibility in the near
term.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Factors shaping the behavior of the foreign great powers include
the following:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Russia is suffering from something similar to the Versailles
Syndrome that hit Germany after World War I. It feels isolated,
and it is bitter about the contrast between its post-Cold War
situation and its past superpower status. Moscow thinks it is the
victim, with others taking advantage of its temporary
difficulties. It resents being treated as a loser in the Cold War
when it feels that, rather than losing, it evolved in a way
advantageous to all. Its military is in decline if not disarray.
And, as important as any other factor, its economy has shrunk by
half over the last decade, while the rest of the world has grown
stronger. Yet Russia remains a nuclear power that can threaten
the survival of the U.S. as a nation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* China is feeling more powerful in world affairs because of its
spectacular economic growth over the last fifteen years. By some
estimates, China already has the world's third-largest output,
after the U.S. and Japan. In contrast to the vibrant economy, the
political system in China has been stagnant. The elite clings to
a discredited ideology that even they do not practice. As the
country hangs on the edge of a transition from one leadership
generation to another, decision making seems paralyzed. The
leaders seem to be afraid above all of anarchy, into which
category they put democratization. In international affairs,
China acts with ambiguity: sometimes like a normal player and
sometimes like the stereotype of the Middle Kingdom --not well
informed about what others are doing and how others behave, sure
that its ways should prevail despite the objections of others,
and assuming that it has a natural right to get what it wants. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Japan is experiencing political turbulence about whether the
old system of governance and economy is still the best. Five
years of economic stagnation, with essentially no growth in
1990-95, has shaken national confidence. Meanwhile, the trade
surplus with the rest of the world continues at levels that cause
tensions in relations with the U.S., and to some extent with the
European Union (EU) and tensions are increasing over the U.S.
bases, especially those in Okinawa.<p>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<b>U.S. Air Force F-16s flying with a German Mig-29 in
Sardinia.</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Western Europe remains uncertain how it will structure itself
in the future, especially in the area of security and the
military. Whether agreement is reached upon a coherent system for
making decisions will determine if Western Europe has the same
weight in international affairs as it does in the world's
economy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Three Categories of States. </I>Another geostrategic
perspective is the cross-sectional view, in which the world can
be seen as divided among three categories of states. At the
height of the Cold War, there were also three worlds: a generally
industrialized and free First World, a communist Second World,
and an underdeveloped, largely unaligned Third World. By the late
1980s, these divisions had eroded, as some communist lands
developed freer institutions and some underdeveloped nations
evolved into industrial democracies. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the new world order, the three categories of states are
characterized by how successful they are at achieving the almost
universally proclaimed goals of democracy and market-based
prosperity:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The <I>market democracies</I> of free and prosperous--or at
least rapidly developing--nations, were once found only in North
America, Japan, and much of Europe. Large parts of Latin America,
the newly industrialized nations of East Asia, and Central Europe
are now joining this group.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The <I>transitional states</I> of ex-communist lands, as well
as countries such as India and South Africa, are progressing from
a low economic baseline, which run the risk of becoming frozen
short of freedom and prosperity with authoritarian politics,
heavily politicized economies, and relatively low levels of
economic development.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The <I>troubled states</I>, primarily in Africa, the Middle
East, and parts of Asia, are falling behind the rest of the globe
economically, politically, and ecologically, often plagued with
rampant ethnic and religious extremism.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These categories are not firm; some very important countries,
like China, combine characteristics of two or even three groups. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some of the troubled or transitional states may be tempted to
divert attention from domestic problems by means of external
aggression aimed at establishing regional hegemony. It should be
no surprise were some such efforts by a rogue state, such as Iraq
or North Korea, to lead to a <B>major regional conflict</B>. The
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, particularly
nuclear weapons, could increase the propensity of aggressive
states to threaten their neighbors and increase the risks for the
U.S.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conflict within troubled states is likely to be a common
occurrence, and in some cases, the state will fail--the
government will cease to function effectively, and civil society
will degenerate into near chaos. In the 1990s, state failure
occurred to one degree or another in such places as Bosnia,
Rwanda, Somalia, Liberia, and Haiti. Most such internal conflicts
will not pose a sharp threat to U.S. interests, though they may
trouble U.S. humanitarian values. The great powers are often
willing to provide <B>humanitarian and peace operations</B> for
failed states. They are increasingly reluctant to intervene
militarily in civil wars, however, unless a particular crisis
takes place in their backyard, threatens to escalate to engulf
other states, create a humanitarian disaster, or otherwise affect
great power interests. The U.S. will have neither the means nor
the will to intervene in every such case around the world, but it
will intervene in areas of its historic and strategic interest as
well as in situations of horrendous suffering that offend U.S.
sensibilities. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Transnational Issues. </I>A third geostrategic perspective
looks from the bottom up at transnational problems, that is,
those which do not stem from the actions of governments. Some of
the major problems are:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The internationalization of crime, especially drug cartels that
operate on such a large scale as to threaten governments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Terrorists take advantage of more open societies to mount
increasingly brazen attacks, such as the 1993 bombing of New
York's World Trade Center. The March 1995 Tokyo subway attack by
the Aum Shinrikyo cult, which caused twelve deaths and five
thousand injuries, "demonstrates the threat a well financed,
sophisticated and international terrorist group poses [in what
could be the United States's] greatest national security concern
in the years ahead," to quote Senator Sam Nunn (D., Georgia).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Ethnic hatreds that erupt into genocide or ethnic cleansing, as
in Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia. A related phenomenon has been
the collapse of organized government under the pressure of
warlords and clan rivalries. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Sudden mass migrations becoming more common, partly in response
to state failure and ethnic violence. These waves of people, who
may or may not fit the traditional definition of refugee, can
overwhelm poor neighbors. As illustrated by the experience with
Haitians and Cubans, migrants can pose an unacceptable burden on
industrial nations like the U.S. that are concerned that the
refugees may become permanent residents. <p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>Coast Guard vessel picking up Haitian migrants.</b><IMG
SRC="ch0103.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">

* Environmental problems spilling over from one nation to another
as the planet's resources are used more intensively. Dangers to
the global commons multiply: all nations are affected by
depletion of the ozone layer and global warming.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some of these threats seem to call for military forces to back up
police forces that are outmaneuvered, overwhelmed, or outgunned.
<B>Constabulary operations,</B> such as picking up illegal
immigrants, intercepting narcotics shipments, and protecting
delivery of relief supplies in failed states, do not require the
specialized equipment and training needed for combat, but they
can tie up multibillion dollar aircraft carriers and
high-readiness troops unless a more cost effective rapid response
force is developed.
<a name="subhead2"><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Information Technology
</H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The pulse of the planet has quickened. Computers, faxes, fiber
optic cables, and satellites speed the flow of information across
frontiers, as illustrated by the explosive growth of the
Internet. Faster and larger information flows reinforce the
political trend towards increasingly open societies. Ideas,
people, and goods are moving across borders at an unprecedented
rate.

Technology progress is not a new phenomenon. Historically,
longbows, stirrups, gunpowder, steam engines, airplanes, and a
host of other technological advances dramatically changed the
nature of warfare. What makes the information explosion so
revolutionary is not that technology is advancing but the pace at
which it improves. While societies have often been confronted
with profound social changes owing to advancing technologies,
never before have societies been forced to adapt to a technology
which for decades has been improving by an order of magnitude
every three or four years. The speed at which computers
function--the rate at which information can be transmitted over
long distances--looks set to continue increasing at the rate of
tenfold every three to four years, which translates into up to
1,000-fold per decade.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No one can foretell all the ways in which information
technologies will enhance (or mitigate) traditional venues of
national power, but some themes are beginning to emerge.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One is that access to information is being recognized as a
<I>sine qua non</I> of economic growth. Mastery of information
technology is surpassing mastery of heavy industry as the primary
source of national power, whether exercised through commercial or
military channels. A useful concept in this regard is "waves" of
technology, popularized by Alan and Heidi Toffler. The new wave
of computers and communications will be the key to future
economic growth, but the older waves of agriculture and industry
will remain indispensable elements of national economic life.
Because the United States possesses the richest information flux,
other countries have become increasingly interested in tapping
into these flows. Linkages to sources of expertise (e.g., Silicon
Valley), sources of finance (e.g., Wall Street), or sources of
knowledge (e.g., universities, think tanks, and selected
government agencies) are considered desirable and one more reason
for nations to cultivate good relations with the United States. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another trend is that the ubiquity of global communications is
creating new avenues for the interests, culture, and values of
the United States to percolate overseas (and <I>vice versa</I>).
For the most part, this influence exists independent of national
policy; in some cases, however, the existence of these channels
makes it easier for the United States government to go over the
heads of other governments and communicate directly to their
citizens. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other end of the spectrum, the ability of the Defense
Department (DOD) to generate and distribute vast quantities of
intelligence permits the United States to influence the outcomes
of conflicts in which it chooses not to intervene directly. At
little direct risk, the United States can provide an "information
umbrella" to its friends by providing imagery and weather data,
software and other systems integration services, and, within the
next few years, simulation and other training tools. All these
methods, taken collectively, intensify the ability of the United
States to exercise what Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Affairs Joseph Nye calls "soft power."
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<b>USS Roosevelt and carrier group<BR></b>
<IMG SRC="ch0101.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE><p>
The extension of the rapid communication and computer
technological advances to the battlefield suggests that
information-based warfare will become more widespread within a
decade or two. Defense requirements will demand more investment
in information systems and less in industrial-era configurations
of tanks, planes, and ships. Information may come to rival
explosive force as a factor in warfare. The development of an
integrated approach--a system of systems--that combines sensors,
communications, and processors with weapons delivery will allow
further advances in the precision with which U.S. forces can
strike. Improvements in precision are not new--on average, a
target that took one bomb to destroy during Desert Storm required
170 bombs during the Vietnam War and 9,000 bombs during World War
II--but the cumulative effect is becoming revolutionary. With
more precise information about where to strike, weapons delivery
systems can shrink in size, facilitating the trend towards
striking from a long distance, possibly directly from the
continental U.S. to the battlefield.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The nature and conduct of information warfare is becoming a
subject of intense interest to defense analysts. Information
looks set to be a new dimension in which warfare can be
conducted, requiring defense against enemy actions that cause
vital computer nets to malfunction and providing new
opportunities for immobilizing an enemy.
<a name="subhead3"><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Changing Character of Government 
</H3><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After decades of increasing state involvement in area after area
of society in country after country, central governments have
been on the retreat since the late days of the Cold War. Publics
in many countries seem to have changed their views about national
priorities and the role of the government in achieving those
national goals.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The Devolution of Power.</I> The most obvious characteristic
of the retreat of the state has been the end of the totalitarian
systems in the Warsaw Pact, in which the state dominated all
aspects of life, stifling the institutions of civil society. But
in many other countries as well, a dramatic change has taken
place in what citizens expect from their governments. After
decades in which the power of central governments grew steadily,
those central governments are now reinventing themselves, and
power is diffusing from the center. Two changes stand out in
particular.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
First, central governments are ceding more power to regional and
local governments. For instance, not only did the Soviet Union
break up into its constituent republics, but Moscow has had to
permit regions more free reign. In post-Mao China, the provinces
acquired a large measure of economic independence that they used
to deny resources to the central government, which finds that its
budget is growing only modestly while the national economy races
ahead. In the EU, after years of defining detailed unionwide
directives, the new principle is "subsidiarity," under which
responsibility for each problem is to be assigned to as local a
level of government as possible--preferably local rather than
national, and then national rather than EU-wide. In the U.S., the
1994 House Republicans' Contract with America exemplifies the
strong interest in devolving to the states responsibility for
programs that the federal government previously controlled.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Secondly, central governments are shedding functions, partly to
reduce expenditures and thereby contain budget deficits. The most
important reduction in the role of the state has been a wave of
privatization that swept Western Europe, the ex-Soviet bloc, and
Latin America, and created ripples elsewhere. In 1994,
governments privatized about $80 billion in assets. The general
mood is that states are poor managers of factories, and that
selling off such enterprises is a way to raise growth rates. The
change in attitudes in Latin America has been particularly sharp,
from a general assumption that the state must organize economic
development to enthusiasm for the rule of the markets.

A related phenomenon has been a greater attention to the domestic
side of national power, especially the economic foundations of
power, relative to the projection of national power abroad. A
focus on domestic issues, especially economic problems,
characterizes Moscow, Beijing, Tokyo, and Brussels (that is, the
EU) as much as Washington. To some extent, that is a reflection
of the less threatening international environment. But there is
also dissatisfaction about growth rates, which in the U.S. and
the rest of the industrialized world have been much lower in the
two decades since the oil shock of 1973 than in the preceding
postwar decades. It seems likely that the highest priority in
U.S. politics in the next few years will be long-term economic
growth in a manner consistent with providing appropriate safety
nets for the unfortunate, and addressing social problems, such as
race relations. Concern about international and military affairs
will be seen in large part through this optic. In addition, the
U.S. body politic is of many minds about what issues are worth
risking blood and treasure for: which values are so fundamental
that they must be defended irrespective of the importance of the
geostrategic interests at stake, which areas of the world are the
most vital to the U.S., and which geostrategic interests are the
most important.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a result of the refocus on domestic issues, the U.S. public
and publics in many other countries have less of an
internationalist outlook and are less willing to spend money on
foreign affairs. Calls are being heard to restructure the
foreign-policy and national-security establishments to reflect
the decreasing interest in international issues compared to
domestic ones.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>A Perspective on Isolationism and Unilateralism.</I> The
debate over the U.S. approach towards national security could be
thought of as a compass, with two pairs of polar opposites. If
the north pole is engagement, then the south pole is isolation,
while the east is unilateralism and the west is multilateralism.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The strength of this analogy is that there are distinct and
powerful groups pointing in each of the four directions. For
instance, there are those (generally on the left) who believe
that no matter whether the U.S. intervenes regularly or seldom,
it should always do so through international institutions.
Meanwhile there are those (generally on the right) who believe
that the most important issue is that the U.S. always act in
defense of its own interests and under its own direction,
irrespective of how often the U.S. decides to intervene abroad.
That is, to the extent that the U.S. engages internationally,
they want it done unilaterally, but they are not sure how much
the U.S. should engage abroad.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another phenomenon illustrated by the compass analogy is
that a policy like isolationism can be approached from either
right or left. The Right tends to believe that the triumph of
democratic and free market ideals removes the rationale for
active intervention abroad (building upon the thesis of the "end
of history"). The Left is sympathetic to the argument that
military and foreign expenditures are a drain on resources that
could be better used at home (the theory of "imperial
overstretch" as a cause for national decline). As one pundit
described isolationists, those on the right do not want to
inflict the world on America while those on the left do not want
to inflict America on the world.<p>
<IMG SRC="ch01gr06.gif" ALIGN=left>

 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The compass analogy can be extended to include the groups at the
intermediate points, e.g., those on the southeast who want the
U.S. generally to remain aloof from foreign problems but to act
on its own (or with its close allies in a subordinate position)
when it does move.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the whole, the mood in American politics in the immediate
aftermath of the Cold War seems to have put the compass arrow
towards north, or engagement. In the early days of the Clinton
administration, the arrow swung so strongly towards
multilateralism that it was in danger of going right on through
towards isolation--that is, the popular reaction to the failures
of multilateral institutions caused many to think that the U.S.
should dramatically reduce its involvement in world affairs.
Since then, the arrow has swung again. In 1995, the new
Republican majority in Congress seemed to move the arrow to the
right, towards unilateralism (e.g., the votes to lift the arms
embargo on Bosnia irrespective of the U.N. sanctions). Given
these wild swings, it is by no means clear where the compass will
end up over the five to seven year time-frame of this report.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From the perspective of U.S. national security, an assessment of
major trends in the unfolding world order includes grounds for
both optimism and pessimism.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>On the optimistic side:
</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li>The major powers are still cooperating despite increasing
tensions among them.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li>Democracy and the market system are models to which nearly
all nations aspire, tempering the potential for ideologically
driven conflict.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li>The U.S. is a world leader in the information technologies
that are increasingly the source of national power, both economic
and military.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li>The U.S. economy has improved its performance relative to
that of all the major powers other than China. Unemployment is
less than half the rate in Western Europe; the growth rate since
1990 has exceeded that in Japan; and, of course, the U.S. economy
is doing incomparably better than the Russian economy. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li>The U.S. is the dominant military power in the world. Not
only does the U.S. have the largest inventory of advanced
equipment, and personnel as well trained as any in the world, but
in addition, no other country can match the U.S. in strategic
assets like transport logistics, intelligence and communications.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>On the pessimistic side:</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li>Multiethnic states are fragmenting violently, in some cases
falling into chaos, and massive humanitarian disasters offend
values Americans hold dear.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li>Traditional U.S. alliances are under stress, with differences
about how to respond to failing states and how to incorporate the
ex-communist states into new security structures.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li>Transnational threats, from international organized crime to
international terrorism, are increasingly being felt in U.S.
cities.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li>Nuclear proliferation may increasingly create instability in
volatile regions and may require the U.S. to act to neutralize
the threat.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li>The U.S. focus on domestic issues and the pressure to reduce
expenditures complicate the ability to respond to international
threats.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is still much that the U.S. can do to affect the character
of the new international system emerging from the end of the Cold
War system. But history suggests that shaping the character of
the new international system will become more and more difficult
as time goes by. International systems typically have a life
cycle in which the relations among the major powers start out
flexible and become more rigid. One of the more extreme examples
was the early years of the Cold War. Right after World War II,
the West and the Soviet Union had differences (for instance, over
the Marshall Plan or elections in Poland), but it was not
apparent to many that those differences would escalate into
all-out political confrontation. In 1945-48, several European
countries were attracted to both the U.S. and Soviet systems
(Czechoslovakia, Italy, and France all had large communist
parties but also large anti-communist groups), and it was by no
means clear that states would become aligned with one camp to the
exclusion of the other. But within six years, the lines were
drawn, to remain largely unchanged for another thirty-five years.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Note: The 1993 increase in international affairs funding was due
to an IMF quota increas.
In other international systems, the clarification came more
slowly. For instance, Napoleon and Bismarck were able to start
with opportunistic alliances that picked off their targets one at
a time. But eventually the other countries realized that their
salvation lay in alliance despite differences, and so the world
order became structured around alliances with and against France
and Germany, respectively. In other cases, the great powers
agreed to maintain a balance of power in which no one state
dominated the others, but over time they were unable to maintain
the commitment, so the world order moved toward a system of
alliances. (This is what happened to the post-Napoleonic "Concert
of Europe," which fell apart when the price of that commitment
became clear in the Crimean War; and also to the post-1919 League
of Nations, which proved powerless when challenged by a resurgent
Germany.)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If these historic analogies hold, then there is some urgency to
resolving the domestic debates about what the U.S. wants from the
new international system, because the international system may be
more malleable in the mid 1990s now than it will be in a few
years.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand, it would seem that one of the main differences
between this international system and that of the Cold War will
be greater ambiguity and more ad hocism. With regard to the
U.S.'s friends, the new order is likely to see the U.S.
increasingly acting with pick-up coalitions and outside of
long-standing alliances. Greater reliance on coalitions, as
distinct from alliances, poses problems such as coalition
cohesiveness, interoperability with forces of other nations, and
decision making at the top level (e.g., rules of engagement,
strategic goals, and decisions to initiate and to terminate
conflict). With regard to the enemy, the most likely conflicts in
the new international system will be those with poorly defined
enemies who may switch back and forth from being dubiously
neutral to actively opposed. In a high intensity conflict with a
clearly defined enemy, such as a major regional contingency in
the Persian Gulf, there may be significant ambiguity about
whether the enemy has or will use chemical, biological, or
nuclear weapons.

The challenge for the U.S. military is to balance the demands of
preparing for the several types of conflict possible in the new
system, while staying within the envelope of the resources that
will be made available in this era of limited government. As we
explained in <I>Strategic Assessment 1995</I>, in our view, the
tasks for which the military must prepare are, in order of
priority:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Hedging against the emergence of a peer competitor</I>
equipped with the new information technologies. This requires
investing in the future, through research and development and
procurement. The percentage of the defense budget dedicated to
this investment fell from 45 percent in FY 1986 to 30 percent in
FY 1996. Reversing this trend will not be cheap.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Preparing for major regional conflict</I> (MRC). The
<I>Bottom-Up Review</I> concluded that the U.S. must be ready for
two nearly simultaneous conflicts of this scale. Current force
structure allows for only a small margin of error in executing
the two MRC strategy. A high degree of readiness, force
enhancements, strong overseas presence (both to provide
confidence and to serve as forward staging areas), and increased
preparation for coalition warfare would serve to increase that
margin.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Countering proliferation.</I> Despite positive developments
(the North Korea agreement, inspections in Iraq, elimination of
nuclear arsenals in ex-Soviet states other than Russia,
elimination of South Africa's programs, termination of Argentina
and Brazil's efforts, and extension of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons), at least twenty
countries--many hostile to the U.S.--are still seeking to produce
nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons and the means to deliver
them.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Developing cost-effective responses to transnational
threats</I>, that is, undertaking constabulary operations that
back up local police forces, and addressing environmental
problems without diverting military assets from their primary
missions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Engaging selectively in peace operations</I> for failed
states. The selectivity should be both geographic and topical.
Geographically, the U.S. will engage more readily in areas of
vital national interest or of historic commitment. Topically, the
U.S. will concentrate on humanitarian relief and conflict
containment, rather than nation building or seeking to end
age-old ethnic tensions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These tasks for the U.S. military reflect the geostrategic
developments, the information revolution, and the changing
character of government in the post-Cold War era. In order to
make its will felt most effectively in this new environment, the
U.S. government is changing the way it uses its instruments of
power. The rest of this volume examines in turn the non-military,
political military, and war-fighting instruments.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Diplomacy arises out of the fundamental character of the
nation-state system, with its basic assumption that nation-states
are sovereign but divergent in their interests and unequal in
their power. Diplomacy is about the process of interstate
relations, while foreign policy concerns the objectives of those
relations. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Following World War II, Washington's diplomacy adapted all of its
foreign-policy instruments to the policy goals of the Cold War.
In the diplomatic sphere, the United States adopted the activism
of a superpower, leading a broad, military-political alliance.
The U.S. relied heavily on bilateral relations to build a nexus
of durable political and military coalitions as major diplomatic
tools. These included anti-Soviet coalitions (such as NATO,
CENTO, and SEATO) and institutions for the promotion of global
economic and political development (such as the Marshall Plan and
GATT). To implement this more ambitious foreign policy, the
traditional departments were expanded in staff and resources, and
a new family of government agencies was created with
responsibility for a new range of activities, including covert
intelligence collection and special operations, propaganda, and
economic and military assistance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the end of the East-West rivalry as an organizing principle,
governments and peoples are turning inward, focusing their
attention on specific local interests. At the same time, a
growing number of transnational issues bedevil countries large
and small. Furthermore, a number of actors have recently assumed
greater roles on the international scene: resurgent ethnic and
regional nationalism; international organizations, such as the
United Nations and the World Trade Organization; multinational
corporations; and private voluntary organizations (PVOs).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The multiplicity of these interests and actors who, in the
absence of a single organizing theme such as competition with the
USSR, clamor for priority attention presents new diplomatic
challenges implying the need for a more multifaceted and nimble
diplomacy. For instance, while U.S. bilateral relations with
Japan during the Cold War concentrated primarily on security
considerations, trade and investment questions are now of
increased importance, and the process of influencing Japanese
behavior requires paying attention to a more diverse number of
Japanese interest groups and power centers--the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry as well as the Defense Agency;
the Japanese car industry as well as the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. At the same time, the U.S. finds its ability to pursue
aggressive, bilateral diplomatic activity limited by expanding
multilateral obligations arising from its leadership role (e.g.,
in NATO and the U.N.) and by the American public's growing
insistence on a domestic focus.
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead2">Instruments</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Retrenchment and reduction appear to be the dominant trend with
respect to the American diplomatic organs. The best measure of
the funding for diplomacy is the data on government spending by
functional category. One of the categories is international
affairs (the 150 account ). The funding for the 150 account fell
46 percent in real terms from FY 1985 to FY 1995. Furthermore,
both the FY 1996 budget proposed by President Bill Clinton and
the congressional concurrent resolution on the FY 1996 budget
project steep reductions in the 150 account between FY 1995 and
FY 2000: their respective projections are for a 23 percent and a
43 percent decline in real terms. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Between FY 1985 and FY 1995, the reduction in the 150 account was
primarily in international security assistance, i.e., military
aid. The funding for the conduct of foreign affairs, other than
peacekeeping assessments, is perhaps the category most related to
diplomacy. That category rose by only 8 percent in real terms
from FY 1985 to FY 1995. The Clinton administration forecast that
it will decline by 19 percent between FY 1995 and FY 2000
(Congress did not break down the 150 account forecast into the
component elements).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most of the existing official foreign-policy community--the
National Security Council, the Department of Defense, the
specialized agencies, and the foreign-affairs components of
main-line departments--was created to augment the Department of
State in the conduct of American diplomacy during the Cold War.
Calls for budget-cutting in general are jostling for attention
with proposals for reorganization. For instance, Senator Jesse
Helms (R-North Carolina) proposed in 1995 the abolition of the
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S.
Information Agency (USIA), and the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency (ACDA) as independent organizations, with the transfer of
their functions to the State Department. <p>
<img src="ch0205.gif"><p>
<b>Until World War II, the building now known as the Old
Executive Office Building housed the Department of State, Navy,
and War.</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reorganized or not, the existing government organizations will
continue to be charged with implementing American diplomacy in
pursuit of U.S. interests utilizing a variety of instruments that
can be mixed and matched to specific ends. These range from
prodding North Korea into compliance with international norms on
nuclear questions to protecting access to government contracts
for American aircraft producers. The form in which they are used
also can vary, from quiet bilateral contacts by resident
embassies through "shuttle diplomacy" by senior officials to
highly publicized summits of chiefs of state. The United States
has also developed a program of regularly published official
reports on specific subjects, such as human rights, narcotics
traffic, and terrorism, that combine public diplomacy with public
pressure on other governments. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modern diplomacy is like an iceberg that lies largely underwater;
most of the business of influencing other governments takes the
form of myriad daily contacts outside the notice of the media and
the public eye. In general, the stronger the overall bilateral
relationship, the easier to settle specific issues, such as
police treatment of an American citizen or access to the local
market for a U.S. product. Conversely, the weaker the
relationship, the more difficult effectively to use diplomatic
tools to obtain changes in behavior, as seen in U.S.-Iran
relations.<p>

<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Established by law in 1947 as a body of cabinet-level officials,
the National Security Council (NSC) advises the President on
national-security policy. Its role was expanded during the
Eisenhower administration, when a relatively small NSC staff
organization was created to serve as a secretariat coordinating
foreign policy. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The National Security Advisor (NSA) and his staff have since
moved far beyond the Eisenhower-era concept of interdepartmental
coordination. The position of National Security Advisor now has
cabinet-level status, and is often seen as <I>primus inter
pares</I> on the NSC. In the Kennedy administration, the National
Security Advisor began to play a direct role in policy
formulation, a role expanded by Henry Kissinger, who essentially
assumed the power and role of chief diplomat as well as principal
foreign-policy advisor in the Nixon administration. Although the
trend of increasing power in the hands of the National Security
Advisor slowed somewhat during the Reagan years, a new twist was
introduced when the NSC temporarily assumed an active role in
covert operations. Under President George Bush, Brent Scowcroft
reintroduced the concept of the NSA as an "honest broker" who
coordinated U.S. foreign policy. This approach, when combined
with an engaged President and an effective Secretary of State
(James Baker) in an atmosphere of collegiality among senior
officials, produced a notably coherent, nimble, and
well-integrated U.S. foreign policy, even in the hectic days of
the Soviet Union's collapse.<p>
<b>Trends in U.S. Government Overses Presence 1984-94<p></b>
<img src="ch02b.gif">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Clinton administration also aimed for a collegial
relationship among its foreign-policy and diplomatic principals,
and the current National Security Advisor appears to be operating
more as an inside coordinator than external diplomatic operator.
Correspondingly, the principal roles of the NSA and his staff
appear to be prioritizing issues, seeking consistency, and
coordinating instruments within the U.S. foreign-policy
establishment, as well as adjudicating the underlying competition
for resources among agencies and departments. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The NSC is challenged to keep up with the growing foreign-policy
portfolio. Because the President's role in formulating U.S.
foreign policy and directing diplomacy will remain
central--despite an increasingly assertive Congress--the
importance of the NSC's integrating role can only increase. At
the same time, the roles of the National Security Advisor as a
spokesman and negotiator cannot be completely curtailed, though
they can be held in reserve for rare occasions when U.S. wishes
to demonstrate the depth of its interest. 

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead4">The Department of
State</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The State Department is the core diplomatic institution for the
U.S. government. It employs all of the diplomatic instruments,
from public spokesman to secret negotiator. Arranging
agreements--formal and informal, written and oral--is a basic
function of the department. More than fourteen thousand treaties
and other international agreements were concluded by the U.S.
government between 1946 and 1994.<p>
<img src="ch0206.gif"><p>
<b>President Clinton meets with family members at the memorial
service for three U.S. diplomats killed near Sarajevo in
1995.</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the senior foreign-policy advisor to the President and chief
of the core diplomatic organization, the Secretary of State can
claim primary responsibility for the overall integration of these
various special interests into a coherent foreign policy, subject
to the wishes and governing style of the President. State's role
as foreign-policy and diplomatic coordinator is performed at
various levels: in the NSC itself, in the formal interagency
process, and in the daily conduct of business between agencies in
Washington and in embassies, not to mention informal
arrangements, such as a weekly lunch among three or four
principal cabinet officials. Coordination is a major
responsibility of the department's component units, with the
geographic bureaus focusing on bilateral relations with other
governments (the warp), while the functional bureaus increasingly
deal with the substance of specific issues (the woof).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The State Department has primary responsibility for communication
with other governments. It manages this role through multiple
channels: foreign embassies resident in Washington; the U.S.
embassy network resident in other countries' capitals;
participation in international organizations; official
delegations; and (as discussed in the chapter on public
diplomacy) formal public statements by senior officials or
through the daily State Department press briefing. The bulk of
communication with other governments, on subjects as far apart as
the welfare of an American citizen in a Chinese prison to the
alleged export of Chinese missiles to Pakistan, is conducted
through these regular established channels. Increasingly,
however, the end of the Cold War has seen these regular,
established channels supplemented by more informal and ad hoc
arrangements, none of them entirely new. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For instance, there is a growing tendency to use special envoys
and representatives in crisis situations, ranging from Bosnia to
Somalia. They are intended to reflect high-level interest in a
subject, and often allow for a quick end-run around bureaucratic
boundaries. President Carter's mission to Haiti, Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott's trips to Russia, Ambassador Robert
Galluci's voyages to Korea, and numerous envoys to Bosnia are all
excellent examples of special envoys. They were attempts,
successful in President Carter's case, to convince a government
to take certain actions before the United States implemented more
forceful measures. Successes by special envoys, however, must be
weighed against the breathless character they sometimes give
American diplomacy. Further, the short-term successes of a
special envoy's mission sometimes confuse the difference between
first-aid and major surgery, and blurr the long-term
responsibilities of the regular bureaucracy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A number of other techniques have been prominently employed
recently and appear likely to continue to be of regular use.
Modern transportation makes formal state visits easier to
accomplish, and modern communications make them both more useful
and more dangerous. Thus, in dealing with local crises, the
world's governments have energetically employed secret talks, as
in the Middle East; proximity talks, as in Bosnia; contact
groups, also as in Bosnia; and shuttle diplomacy all over the
place, but notably in the Middle East and Bosnia. In many of
these diplomatic developments, the United States has acted as a
broker rather than as a principal party. <p>

The State Department traditionally has not been an agency that
designs and manages operational programs, but has worked in
cooperation with and provided policy guidance to other
departments and agencies that conduct programs overseas (such as
USAID, USIA, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the
Export-Import Bank, and the Departments of Defense and
Agriculture). During the Cold War,  the State Department's
responsibilities expanded enormously in response to the new
global leadership role, then later to increasing economic and
technological globalization and the emergence of so-called
transnational or global issues. Some of these new
responsibilities led to the creation of State Department
operational programs with special congressionally authorized
budgets to deal with international narcotics, terrorism, and
refugees. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The basic professional skills of the Foreign Service consist of
multidisciplinary and multicultural expertise, language skills,
and operational diplomatic skills, such as negotiating,
investigating, reporting, and analysis. To the traditional and
still valid category of skills must be added specialized
knowledge in rapidly developing areas, such as sustainable
development, narcotics, investment, and communications. These
skills, combined with a personnel system that provides
rank-in-person organization (similar to the armed forces) and
worldwide availability, constitute the value-added qualities of a
professional foreign service. The professional core of the
Foreign Service is its approximately 3,000 commissioned officers,
a number not significantly changed in almost forty years despite
increased demands. Its continued usefulness depends upon
aggressive recruitment and training, imaginative utilization, and
adequate administrative support. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The growth of responsibilities and subjects in international
relations, which began in a dramatic way after World War II, has
required that the Foreign Service core be supplemented by large
numbers of specialists employed partly by the State Department
but mostly by other agencies. One way to note changes in the
operating environment for American government employees deployed
outside the United States is to check the rapidly expanding list
graven in marble in the diplomatic entrance of the State
Department of such employees who died in exceptional
circumstances. It currently shows 171 names: 72 for the almost
two-hundred-year period from the Revolution to 1960, and 99 in
the period 1961-1994. The latter figure represents both State
Department employees and those of other agencies--from Marines to
DEA agents--who were serving at U.S. embassies or other posts. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite its prominence, the State Department is the
second-smallest department of the U.S. government, with an annual
budget of approximately $5.5 billion and a worldwide staff of
approximately 25,000, of whom approximately 10,000 are foreign
nationals performing mostly support functions. Within the context
of a decline in overall spending on international affairs, the
State Department's budget rose 24 percent in real terms between
FY 1985 and FY 1995, but that was in large part a result of
accounting procedures. A more relevant measure is the spending on
diplomacy is the budget category called the conduct of foreign
affairs, other than peacekeeping assessments. That measure rose
only 8 percent between FY 1985 and FY 1995, despite a dramatic
expansion in responsibilities as more countries became
independent (e.g., with the breakup of the USSR) and world
problems became more complex. Furthermore, as also noted above,
the budget for the conduct of foreign affairs is projected to
fall steeply between FY 1995 and FY 2000.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A variety of initiatives have been taken or are under discussion
to reorient the activities of the State Department. To increase
the priority given to functional, as distinct from regional,
issues, and to clarify the chain of command, the Clinton
administration reorganized the State Department into five areas,
each headed by an undersecretary of state: political affairs
(including all the geographic bureaus); economic, business, and
agricultural affairs; arms control and international security
affairs; global affairs; and management.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In late 1994 and early 1995, other and more dramatic proposals
for significant reorganization of the foreign-affairs and
diplomatic establishments were floated, from both administration
and outside sources. Many of these proposals call for devoting
fewer resources to diplomacy by cutting personnel, programs,
budgets, and overseas diplomatic posts. As a result of this
post-Cold War debate, reduction of the Department of State is
under consideration--first as part of the overall reduction in
the federal budget, and secondly as part of a reorganization
effort by State Department management. The reorganization appears
to focus on headquarters' needs rather than the field structure
and on administration rather than substance. It will be difficult
to implement the reduction while sustaining the capabilities to
handle an increasingly complex package of U.S. national
interests.<hr>
<blockquote><b>Tools of Diplomacy in Bosnia</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The multiple efforts by the international community to end the
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina during 1994-95 gave rise to the
expanded use of several diplomatic tools that were either
innovative or seldomly used in normal circumstances:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The contact group is the most prominent example. It was
designed to meet an old problem: how to separate out the
principal players and engage them to reach agreement before
getting the rest of the participants to join in the solution. The
creation of the contact group evolved from a background of
ill-fated attempts by the international community to hammer out a
peace plan acceptable both to all parties at war and to all
parties in the community responsible for implementing the plan.
First, there was the Vance-Owen proposal stemming from the
September 1992 International Conference on Yugoslavia (ICFY).
Vance-Owen gave way to the Owen-Stoltenberg (or Invincible)
package in 1993, but with no success.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A special envoy for Bosnia, an exceptional diplomatic
technique, was used by the U.S. in 1994. The envoy worked hard to
achieve a Bosnia-Croat federation. At the same time, as proposed
by the ICFY cochairmen, the principal powers reached a
comprehensive accord among themselves and then undertook to sell
it to the warring factions. Out of the envoy's and the contact
group's efforts came the "51%-49% Map" to divide Bosnia's
territory between the federation and the Bosnian Serbs, as well
as a further series of notional principles to end the war. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A special military advisor to the Secretary of State was
appointed in March 1994, as part of the U.S. approach to bring
together the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims. The advisor was
given the mandate to achieve a better working relationship
between the military commands of Bosnian Croats and Muslims,
which only weeks earlier had been slugging it out. The advisor
(first retired General John Galvin, and later retired General
John Sewall) faced an uphill battle not only in Bosnia but in
convincing the other members of the contact group that their
advice was strategic and not tactical. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Shuttle diplomacy, another time-tested by infrequently employed
technique, was begun after renewed fighting in the spring and
summer of 1995. After the U.S. NSA tested the waters with a
series of exploratory meetings in Europe, Assistant Secretary
Richard Holbrooke undertook a frenetic schedule of discussions
with principal players and protagonists. He succeeding in
bringing the right set of representatives to the conference table
and got them to reach an accord on a cease-fire and then a peace
agreement. While due in part to battlefield victories by the
Croat and Muslim side, along with battlefield fatigue,
Holbrooke's sucess was also due to skillful diplomacy, backed up
with some classic diplomatic persuaders: lifting trade sanctions,
providing economic aid, denying of diplomatic recognition, and
enforcing of an arms embargo.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Talks held in Dayton, Ohio, in November 1995 were the key to
achieving a peace settlement. Unlike similar mediated efforts,
such as the Camp David negotiations, these talks included many
parties, (e.g., representatives of the contact group countries)
brought together under the chairmanship of Holbrooke and the
chief European negotiator, Carl Bildt.</blockquote><hr>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As described by General George Marshall, the only man ever to
serve as both Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense,
military force without diplomacy is pointless, and diplomacy not
backed by military force is mere posturing. The traditional
synergistic relationship between diplomacy and war has deepened
to the point where these two instruments are deeply intertwined
in daily activities. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In pursuing its responsibilities, DOD employs a large range of
diplomatic instruments, but within a more restricted range of
subjects than the Department of State: for example, base rights,
training assistance, and equipment interoperability programs
among NATO partners; and human-rights obligations of armed
forces, but not among the population in general.<p>
<img src="ch0203.gif"><p>
<b>Present at the creation of the post-World War II U.S. foreign
policy: Secretary of State Dean Atcheson (right) and Secretary of
Defense (earlier Secretary of State) George Marshall.</b> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the military services long exercised a role in diplomacy
through the military attach&eacute;, the Cold War saw the
development in the Department of Defense of a so-called Little
State Department. The Undersecretary of Defense for Policy has
three senior assistants whose responsibilities specifically
include relations and interactions with foreign governments and
institutions, largely but not exclusively military (such as
nongovernmental organizations involved in humanitarian
assistance). These are the assistant secretaries for
international security affairs, international security policy,
and strategy and requirements.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the military side, the principal player in diplomacy are the
Joint Staff's Director for Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5) and
the regional unified military commands, headed by regional
commanders-in-chief (CINCs), who exercise active command of
military forces deployed outside the United States and who are
therefore in regular contact with foreign governments and forces
on matters ranging from coalition formation to the provision of
military technical assistance and the coordination of contingency
war-fighting plans. The role of the military in the employment of
the panoply of diplomatic instruments has been strengthened by
the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, a congressionally mandated
organizational and management reform that provides for greater
integration and coordination. In particular, the enhanced role of
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provides for greater
focus on these areas for DOD as a whole; however, this enhanced
role is a matter for current discussion, with some commentators
arguing that integration of the various elements of DOD has gone
too far. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the heyday of the Cold War, there was criticism that DOD's
role was too ambitious, preempting broader national goals in
favor of security interests strictly defined. The current
international environment calls for a more complicated and
diverse role for DOD, fully integrated with overall foreign
policy and under the State Department's diplomatic leadership--in
order to avoid having one diplomatic organ pursuing activities
that compromise or conflict with the work of another. For
instance, the State Department is traditionally oriented toward
individual countries, while the military is organized around
regional commands, which cross country lines. Consequently, the
military is more focused on security problems that cross country
lines, while the State Department brings a bilateral approach to
the interrelationship among problems.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead6">Single-Issue Foreign-Affairs
Agencies</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, the United States created a series of
essentially single-subject foreign-affairs agencies, such as
USIA, USAID, ACDA, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), and the
Peace Corps. These organizations deal directly with foreign
governments and international organizations through resident
representatives and delegations, and employ the full range of
diplomatic instruments, from public statements through
negotiations to involvement in multilateral organizations. Each
is the lead agency for policy formulation, and often
implementation, in its area of responsibility, although all are
subject to the policy guidance of the Secretary of State and the
operational control of the President's representative on the
spot--that is, the ambassador.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Each of these agencies provides important channels for
communications with other governments. Except possibly for the
Peace Corps, they have the advantage of specialized expertise and
contacts, as well as a single-minded concentration in their area
of responsibility. Some of these agencies can bring potential
concrete benefits to the diplomatic table: USTR can offer or deny
market access to the U.S., while USAID offers development
assistance. Others, such as USIA, have more ambiguous relations
with governments. Given the present organization of the U.S.
government, single-issue agencies are the obvious instruments for
seeking specific objectives in their areas of competence. For
example, the Treasury Department would be the natural choice to
handle negotiations on the codification of international norms
for foreign investment, and USTR to handle bilateral trade
negotiations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, single-issue agencies' institutional resistance to
balancing benefits in their area of competence against costs in
other areas can create tension, if not conflict, between specific
and broad national interests. Thus, their activities require
consistent and coherent central management to ensure that the
agencies pursue their objectives within the context of overall
U.S. policy and in coordination with other agencies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The independent status of these agencies and the relative
importance of their subjects are part of the overall debate on
the reorganization of the State Department and the whole
foreign-affairs establishment. The argument is that merging USIA,
USAID, and ACDA into the State Department will provide savings by
eliminating duplication of personnel and programs, and allow for
better coordination of U.S. foreign policy. Defenders of the
agencies counter that such a merger will result in the
subordination of specific objectives to the general concern for
good diplomatic relations. Thus, the question facing the
reorganizers is whether these instruments would be better
deployed in the post-Cold War era by a community of relatively
specialized agencies under some sort of overall direction
(coordination by guidance) or by a single diplomatic organization
responsible for the whole range of foreign-policy concerns
(coordination by organization). <hr><blockquote><b>Recognition
Policy as an Instrument of Diplomacy</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The end of the Cold War witnessed both the collapse of several
multiethnic states and the decline of ideology as a factor in
international affairs. These events forced the United States to
make a series of decisions concerning the diplomatic recognition
of new states and new governments. The act of recognizing a
country itself became a more prominent instrument of national
power.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The success of the new recognition policies varied widely. On the
one hand, recognition of the new countries formed from the former
Soviet Union reinforced their independence, and in the case of
the Baltic States contributed to their security. On the other
hand, international recognition of a non-viable state like Bosnia
contributed to the tensions that led to bloody conflict. Even the
issuance of a visa to Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui was read
in Beijing as a step towards eventual recognition of Taiwan, and
the Beijing government responded accordingly.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the case of Vietnam and North Korea, both former Cold War
adversaries, steps toward normalization and eventual recognition
became an effective instrument by which to pursue U.S. policies
on POWs/MIAs and nuclear non-proliferation respectively.
Recognition policy has proven to be a powerful instrument that
has received inadequate attention.</blockquote><hr>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead7">Diplomacy by Domestically
Oriented Government Agencies</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Traditionally, diplomacy was a matter only for diplomats and
foreign offices. But the increasing globalization of economics,
as well as of politics and social developments, has led to
expanding roles for other government departments once considered
to be purely domestic in orientation. As they enter into foreign
affairs, these departments are employing diplomatic instruments
in their areas of expertise: enunciating U.S. policy, negotiating
agreements, and maintaining regular relations with foreign
governments in an ongoing process of suasion.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For example, the Department of Agriculture operates the Foreign
Agricultural Service as an integral part of U.S. embassies, and
manages a number of subsidy, grant, and sales programs, as well
as programs to eradicate plant and animal disease. The Department
of Commerce manages the Foreign Commercial Service, which also
functions out of U.S. embassies. The Department of Labor, in
conjunction with State, trains and employs Foreign Service labor
officers and formulates U.S. policy toward labor unions outside
the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) is the lead agency for U.S. government participation in
multilateral health organizations, such as the World Health
Organization; HHS units such as the National Institutes of Health
and the Centers for Disease Control are major international
institutions. The Department of Treasury is the lead agency for
policy toward international financial issues in general, as well
as for U.S. government participation in multilateral financial
organizations and groups, such as the World Bank, regional
development banks, and the Group of Seven. The Justice Department
maintains liaison with foreign police authorities, and is
becoming a more active partner in the foreign-policy process and
in diplomatic activity, as a result of U.S. government concern
over narcotics, terrorism, and immigration.<p>
<img src="ch0204.gif"><p><b>Warren Christopher on the USIA
Worldnet.</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These departments and agencies participate in diplomacy in three
ways:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Formulating policy. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Providing specialized staff who may practice diplomacy as
members of U.S. missions and delegations. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Managing cooperative programs with other governments. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like single-issue agencies, these departments possess specialized
expertise and contacts in foreign countries, and can be used to
pursue U.S. interests outside of their nominal area of
responsibility. For instance, the Agriculture Department's
food-export program is vital to humanitarian-assistance
operations, and often plays a significant role in
economic-assistance programs. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead8">Embassies</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Governments communicate in ways ranging from direct contact
between home-based officials to public statements carried over
CNN, but the bulk of business takes place through resident
diplomatic missions. The United States maintains a diplomatic
network of 263 embassies, consulates, and missions. Even with
improvements in communication and transport technology, the
explosion of intergovernmental business has increased the demands
on embassies. The traditional tasks of representation, analysis,
and negotiation must now be pursued across a wider range of
issues: economic, social, environmental, and so on. Embassies now
often include human-rights and environmental experts as well as
political officers, military attach&eacute;s, and vice-consuls.
In a sense, embassies are the retail outlets for U.S. foreign
policy, employing a toolbox full of diplomatic instruments on a
daily basis in direct, regular contact with foreign governments
and, in the process, conducting the bulk of everyday diplomatic
business. They:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Ensure that U.S. positions are known and understood in other
countries by lobbying, explaining, and maintaining a regular
dialogue with the local leadership. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Learn the other country's interests, attitudes, policies,
and
plans at the source--especially as they relate to the country's
leadership. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Provide early warning of developing crises, as well as a
readily available crisis manager on the ground. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Oversee and manage foreign assistance, narcotics
interdiction,
and other programs. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Provide consular services to U.S. citizens and foreign
nationals, including the processing of visas.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Supportmultilateral diplomacy by providing the direct link
to
national governments. <p>
<img src="ch0202.gif"><p><b>Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser arafat sign

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak look on.<p></b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The embassies are not, as some have suggested, obsolete
institutions that have been superseded by summit meetings or
other direct, high-level contacts. Rather, they are the support
base and implementing tool for those two instruments. The
capacity to communicate instantaneously affects and changes the
role of resident embassies but does not eliminate their
usefulness. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Traditionally, State attempted to provide overall coordination
and management of all U.S. activities in a given country through
the authority of the ambassador. While this situation still
exists in theory, the growth in non-State personnel stationed in
U.S. missions overseas (they now constitute almost two-thirds of
overseas staff) and the range and complexity of programs have
strained if not overwhelmed the department's management role.
Various innovations have been made in an attempt to deal with
this management problem. The Country Team concept, chaired by the
ambassador and including all the agencies present in a country
(except military elements serving under the command of a CINC),
was introduced in the Eisenhower era. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the course of the Cold War, as the influence and role of
other departments expanded, and the resources of the State
Department and the ambassador did not, the ambassador's ability
to fulfill his role as manager of all U.S. programs in his
country became increasingly strained. While an understandably
satisfactory development from the perspective of the majority of
agencies and departments involved, many saw in this trend
conflicting agendas, duplicative functions and organizations, and
lack of proper focus and concentration on the more important
issues. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The size, cost, and mission of embassies and consulates is under
review in the context of the wider review of the State Department
and other foreign-affairs agencies. The expansion of the U.S.
overseas diplomatic establishment following the Cold War--over
twenty new posts--was not accompanied by commensurate increases
in budgets or staff (except for specialized staff in
administration and security, and in programs like
counter-narcotics). Budget pressures led to a 1995 decision to
cut in the next five years the number of overseas posts by
nineteen and the number of personnel by up to 25 percent at some
major embassies. These conflicting demands and pressures have
been partially met by hollowing out the substantive core of U.S.
missions--the professional political and economic staff. By
reducing opportunities for representation and intelligence, the
trend could have negative implications for the effectiveness of
U.S. diplomacy, if only for the obvious reason that even the best
diplomatic instruments require effective implementation by
skilled and experienced officials.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead9">Unofficial Diplomacy</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Official diplomacy is practiced by the executive branch of the
U.S. government, but various forms of congressional,
quasi-official, and informal diplomacy--sometimes called Track II
diplomacy--are practiced by Congress, ex-Presidents, and other
former government officials, as well as by government-financed
research institutions, lobbyists, and nongovernmental
organizations. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Congress has long promulgated the basic limits and parameters of
U.S. foreign policy, and congressional action itself can be a
powerful instrument of U.S. policy. One need only remember the
Marshall Plan. In the two decades after the end of World War II,
however, a tradition of bipartisanship in foreign affairs was
generally respected by legislators on Capitol Hill. Members of
Congress and their staffs travelled extensively around the world
on investigative missions, but tended to abstain--at least
publicly--from negotiating or representing positions different
from those articulated by the executive branch. <p><b> Rep. Bill
Richardson (D-New Mexico) meeting with Burmese Nobel prizewinner
Aung San Suukyi<p></b>
<img src="ch0201.gif">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The erosion of the bipartisan congressional tradition in foreign
affairs began during the Vietnam War and was subsequently
exacerbated by the decline in party discipline, the exponential
increase in professional staff in Congress, and the lack of
policy consensus in the post-Cold War world. Congressional
figures--both elected members and staff--now regularly engage in
public communication and even in negotiations with foreign
governments, international organizations, and other international
entities. A similar development is now seen among ex-Presidents
and other former senior executive-branch officials; President
Jimmy Carter has institutionalized his interest in influencing
foreign policy through the Carter Center. From this base, he has
played a significant role as a mediator or intermediary in a
number of political situations, e.g., the 1994 agreement with
North Korea about nuclear proliferation and the 1994 voluntary
departure from Haiti of the military rulers. Such figures appear
inclined to take up active, personal diplomatic roles--although
generally with at least the informal blessing of the White House.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Congressional delegations are a peculiarly American diplomatic
instrument, which arise from the division of powers in the U.S.
federal system. Members of Congress are senior government
officials but are not part of the executive branch, which gives
them a unique admixture of authority and freedom of action.
Congressional members and staff use their trips and contacts with
foreign representatives to promote their personal agendas and
legislative responsibilities, sometimes on their own and
sometimes in coordination with the administration. Congressman
Bill Richardson (D-New Mexico), for instance, has made numerous
successful foreign trips to pursue specific diplomatic issues,
such as obtaining the release of U.S. citizens imprisoned in Iraq
and the return of the body of a helicopter pilot lost in North
Korea, inquiring about servicemen missing in action in Vietnam,
and investigating the situation of Burma's leading democratic
politician. When congressional figures are willing to coordinate
their activities with the executive--which they often are --such
activity provides additional communications channels for the
executive branch. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Use of these eminent persons has its benefits and its problems
from the perspective of officialdom. They offer opportunities for
innovative interaction with other governments, and they provide a
means to sound out the other side without committing the U.S.
officially. That must be balanced against the dangers of blurring
U.S. foreign policy with a multitude of voices. After all,
Congress members and ex-officials are motivated by their own
agendas, which may to varying degrees differ from those of the
U.S. government.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More clearly unofficial diplomatic agents are advocacy groups,
PVOs, and research institutes who often practice what has been
called Track II Diplomacy. Advocacy groups for better relations
with particular countries--such as the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee--lend themselves to use as channels of
communication and negotiation for the United States as well as
for their clients. PVOs have become increasingly active and
effective in the expanding interstices between national
governments (see the chapter on International Organizations).
Research institutes include those that are branches of the U.S.
government (such as the Institute for National Strategic
Studies), government-funded institutions (such as the
Asia10Foundation, U.S. Institute for Peace, and the National
Endowment
for Democracy), and private policy institutions that receive
government contracts for specific projects, such as the
University of California's government-funded series of
conferences on alternatives for multilateral security in
Northeast Asia. In the pursuit of their professional interests,
these institutions closely follow international developments and
can therefore be sources of intelligence and analysis. Their
networks of international contacts, often at quite senior and
influential levels, offer another conduit for proposing and
exploring ideas and proposals unofficially. Current proposals to
cut or eliminate federal government financial support for many of
the quasi-government institutions will have an obvious effect on
their usefulness as diplomatic instruments.
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead10">Conclusions</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the more fluid situation of the mid and late 1990s, the
emphasis in diplomatic techniques is shifting from the  large,
formal, semi-permanent negotiating delegations between formal
coalitions that occupied the center ring of American diplomacy
during the Cold War, towards greater use of a wider ranger of
instruments. An increasingly complex world, with each state less
bound to a static coalition, and the more global character of the
international environment call for more ad hoc arrangements
involving special envoys, contact groups, and shuttle diplomacy.
Furthermore, the non-executive branch players, ranging from
Congress to PVOs, are playing an increasing role, influencing the
behavior of governments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The role and relationships between the various elements of the
U.S. foreign-affairs establishment do not necessarily reflect the
priorities of the new international situation. The role of the
State Department as the core repository of expertise on regional
and global issues, the integrating authority among an expanding
number of specialized departments, such as DEA and the
immigration service, and the overall manager of official
diplomacy would benefit from review, and probably strengthening.
In this perspective, a fundamental review of the U.S. government
foreign-policy establishment, in light of the conflicting
pressures of the current international situation and domestic
budget-cutting imperatives, appears overdue. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.S. diplomatic institutions are being asked to do more with
less, in more countries and on a greater range of issues.
Therefore, the programmed cuts in resources for these
institutions and activities will pose a challenge for the U.S.
ability effectively to pursue its national interest through the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The post-Cold War world is made more complex by rapid and
pervasive information flows and expanding experiments in
democratization. Foreign decision-making evolves less and less
from tiny ruling elites and is increasingly influenced by public
opinion when considering whether national interests coincide with
those of the United States. Even in limited democracies,
decisions by governments incorporate the input of academics,
interest groups, political parties, and world public opinion. New
technologies quickly convey masses of undifferentiated
information reflecting global images heretofore only imagined,
unimpeded by anything other than individual willingness to pay
attention to it. In this atmosphere, in which fast exchanges of
data drive decision making, the requirement for the United States
to speak clearly, coherently, quickly, and persuasively to key
foreign publics and leaders has never been greater.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States cannot assume that the opinions of these
foreign audiences are based on a clear understanding of U.S.
interests, actions, and intentions just because they have access
to satellite dishes and on-line newsletters. Nor can the United
States assure that its policies will be understood just by
issuing a statement and hoping for good news play. The media may
carry the President's speech or a report on a U.S. military
action, but they may not explain the underlying history, culture,
viewpoints, values, and intentions that enhance understanding and
acceptance. Media reports may be laden with commentary that is
inaccurate or distorted. Even upon hearing unbiased reports,
different foreign audiences may require different explanations of
U.S. policies and actions. For example, a proposition such as
"supporting democracy" can mean different things in London,
Singapore, Beijing, and Mexico City; the words used to describe
the concept to U.S. audiences may not have the same meaning or
connotations for other audiences. Lastly, beyond programmers'
loosely defined standards of newsworthiness, no formula governs
what will be covered by the media.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the interpretation of U.S. policies is left to such reports,
it may remain incomplete, distorted, misunderstood, and hardly
persuasive. And when foreign audiences misinterpret U.S. policy,
political costs escalate. Beijing may not find U.S. emphasis on
human rights more palatable for understanding U.S. traditional
values, but it might at least understand that criticism of China
is not arbitrarily hostile.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. government will be more effective at influencing events
abroad to the extent that foreign audiences understand U.S.
actions and policy. That requires not only information about
stated policy but also comprehension of such basics as the U.S.
constitutional framework, the character of U.S. society, and
contemporary U.S. politics. Creating that comprehension is the
job of public diplomacy. This chapter examines the instruments
for conducting public diplomacy and the implications of its
practice in a world where political and economic centers of power
are multiplying, where information is available as never before,
and where publics are developing viewpoints that guide their
nations' choices.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Public Statements 
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Public statements from anywhere within the U.S. federal
bureaucracy can affect global audiences. Some departments--such
as Treasury and Commerce--are obvious objects of the world's
attention, but even statements from such departments as Education
or Housing and Urban Development can have international
ramifications. A panoply of topics, such as population control,
pollution, or food supplies, blur the lines between what is a
domestic issue and what is international. However, most foreign
attention is naturally fixed on the White House, the Department
of State, and the Department of Defense. <p>
<b>The Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs
Kenneth H. Bacon conducted his first press briefing on October
27, 1994.</b><img src="ch0302.gif"><p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Every day, the major parts of the executive branch consult with
one another to ensure uniformity in understanding of policies and
how they will be represented to the public. Ideally, policymakers
will weigh public acceptance when the particular issue is
discussed. During Desert Shield and Desert Storm, an interagency
committee on public diplomacy fed advice into the decision
process with respect to shaping decisions that would have maximum
acceptance by coalition supporters and would be properly
understood by Baghdad and its supporters. But in noncrisis
situations, perceptions may not be considered until after policy
formulation. In the worst of all worlds, discussion of damage
control is the first time public reactions are considered.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By midday, spokesmen appear at podia in Washington to address a
range of issues encompassing anything that might attract media
attention. The world watches, but the process is not primarily
designed for international audiences. Rather, the executive
branch directs its explanations first at the U.S. public,
Congress, and domestic special-interest groups. It is always
possible that some statement or policy will arouse reactions
abroad, which may lead to a protest at a U.S. embassy or even a
phone call to the President or to a Secretary from a foreign
counterpart. But foreign opinion is usually felt indirectly and
has a weight different from domestic opinion. In certain
cases--as when a head of state visits or when a message is
intended to affect international negotiations--a statement may be
specifically designed for a foreign audience, but even those
statements are measured for their impact in the United States as
well. That is as it should be. The U.S. audience gets first
consideration, but it should not get the only consideration.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course, the media briefings at the White House, State, or
Defense are not the only window into the policy world.
Administration figures appear on talk shows; give exclusive
interviews, sometimes to the foreign press; and speak at events.
Their voices and the ideas they represent are, most importantly
for global understanding, amplified and explained officially
through U.S. public-diplomacy mechanisms. From roots in the
wartime agencies of World Wars I and II, the U.S. Information
Agency (USIA) and its overseas arm, the U.S. Information Service
(USIS), has been charged with carrying out America's public
diplomacy. Reflecting, as public affairs must, the policies of
the government it represents, USIA and USIS have been caught up
in the Cold War tensions, from presenting to the world the U.S.
case on the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 to
countering Soviet disinformation. But the unique role of
USIA/USIS has been in its commitment to developing deep
understanding abroad of U.S. society and culture as well as the
policies and attitudes that flow from these. <hr><blockquote>
<b>Countering Disinformation and Misinformation</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although the Soviet Union has passed into history, its campaign
of misinformation, disinformation, and other efforts to discredit
the West in general and the United States in particular survives.
AIDS as a deliberate American attempt to depopulate the
developing world, the Jonestown (Guyana) suicides as a CIA plot,
and assorted assassination conspiracies are just a few of the
stories that have proven more durable than the regime that
concocted them. Other groups hostile to the United States, such
as terrorist groups and rogue states, continue to use the same
techniques. The best weapons against such campaigns are early
identification and emphatic refutation--part of the work of
public diplomacy. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No misinformation campaign has been so persistent or damaging as
the so-called "baby parts" story--the story that the rich West
has children in underdeveloped countries killed to provide organs
for transplants. Entirely without foundation, this myth has been
perpetuated by major media first in hostile nations and then
around the world, and has been accepted by gullible publics
conditioned to think the worst about the United States. The myth
accelerated in 1987, after Honduran official referring to the
rumor was misquoted in a way that made it seem he was endorsing
it. Cuban media and Pravda both published accounts citing the
Honduran official as authority, leaving out his immediate
retractions and the other authoritative voices dismissing the
assertions. Subsequently, other anti-U.S. groups and media
knowing a sensational story when they saw it kept it alive. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The USIA report to the United Nations of December 1994 provides
the most thorough analysis of the baby parts story. It details
the unusual willingness, in some quarters, of even sophisticated
people to accept wild assertions as fact. The report further
illustrates how the body of documentation for this myth is built
on misrepresentations and cross-citations among unreliable
sources. This report to the United Nations is used repeatedly by
U.S. public-affairs officers abroad to counter further attempts
to perpetuate this misrepresentation. Unfortunately, the very
outrageousness of such stories plays on the public's interest in
the sensational and makes countering these myths a permanent item
on the public diplomat's list of duties.</blockquote><hr>
<img src="ch0303.gif" align="left"><b>USIS Mexico dealt with many
different perceptions of U.S. actions and motivation in the Gulf
crisis. This cartoon--"Extermination in the Gulf" by
Monsi--appeared in the Mexico City daily El Universal. The
balloon caption says, "The Iraqis will do what the Border Patrol
could not." The cover of the booklet reads, "76,000 U.S. soldiers
in the Persian Gulf are of Mexican origin."</b>

<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While departments and agencies are agreeing on what can be said
publicly at their U.S. briefings, 263 U.S. embassies, consulates,
and missions around the world are striving to explain U.S.
policies and actions in the nations where they are stationed in a
way that advances U.S. interests. Clearly, Washington cannot be
contradicted. But at some point, Washington's vetting of the
policy must end, and the U.S. spokesman abroad must make a
statement. He must decide how to present the U.S. line to foreign
audiences as positively as possible while still conforming to
Washington's guidance. How best to do this must come from USIS
professionals who speak the local language and understand the
local public as well as the details of U.S. policy, so as to
convey the U.S. position in clear, persuasive terms.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After a U.S. policy is announced to a foreign audience, the local
media report, pundits ponder, analysts interpret, government
bureaus and private companies inquire, and scholars are called on
to explain, "What did the Ambassador (or President or
Congressman) mean when he said...?" All of these commentaries and
inquires are examined as well as answered and subsequently
reported as representing foreign public opinion--which may affect
how the original policy is altered, or at least how it is
presented in the next cycle of information exchange. Such
authoritative and timely feedback provides Washington with a
critical perspective on the consequences of its policies. These
daily reports are supplemented by polling and surveys that
measure attitudes more broadly and over the longer term.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Every embassy has assets for maintaining communications with the
public, but USIS staff are required to get the most out of these
assets. A trade specialist, the military attach&eacute;, or a
Drug Enforcement Administration representative at the U.S.
embassy can give background briefings to key media, academics, or
others in anticipation of rising issues. The public appearances
of the ambassador and his deputy can be orchestrated to give
added weight to explanations in speeches, statements, and
interviews. Cultural exchanges can help close the communications
gap in a less direct way. A local official whose passion is music
can become more approachable through an introduction to the
conductor of a visiting American orchestra. Fulbright exchanges
can fill scholarly gaps, and useful relationships can develop
between people sitting on joint Fulbright boards. U.S.
professional, political, and academic groups can be put together
with counterparts who influence policy direction in the host
country. In addition, outside authorities, academics, visiting
administration representatives, artists, and experts can be
called on to exemplify U.S. society and explain the country's
policies. <img src="ch0304.gif" align="left"><b>Fulbright

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. government could, of course, simply trust foreign
audiences to soak up news from CNN and other worldwide news
services, and then make their own best guesses about U.S.
motivations and intentions based on available analyses. But the
U.S. government is more likely to get its viewpoint across if it
makes specific and tailored efforts to promote public
understanding of U.S. government positions. Resources are being
cut: USIA lost 600 positions in FY 1994-95 and is likely to lose
a similar number in FY 1996, as well as the closing of five
missions and eleven branch posts. The challenge will be to use
new means to accomplish this task more efficiently.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead4">Broadcasting and Electronic
Media</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Instant news coverage is not a substitute for a calculated
presentation of U.S. positions, although it lends urgency to this
task. The combination of an increasingly pervasive electronic
media and an audience that has grown in size and become more
important to decision makers presents a particular challenge to
electronic public diplomacy. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
CNN and rival news services strive to provide nearly instant
coverage of events around the world. There is no question that
CNN, particularly as an American enterprise, provides an
important dimension to communication exchanges. But CNN
broadcasts almost entirely in English. And it only tenuously
reaches places such as Chechnya, Rwanda, Iraq, Iran, North Korea,
and China.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Neither CNN nor any of its rivals is an official voice of the
U.S. government, and the sound bite approach leaves out context.
As news organizations, they pay attention to U.S. official
positions, so if these positions are articulated well and
presented at the right moment in unfolding events, there is an
even chance that the public will get the outlines of official
views by commercial means. But the chances decrease somewhat with
a news network of another country, which will feel more
compunction to give time to voices in its country of origin and
whose commentators may have viewpoints less well informed in
terms of American motives. And this is less apt to occur in a
story that is not a major or <BR>
continuing one. CNN may want a camera permanently at the Pentagon
briefing room during a military crisis or even at USTR during
major trade negotiations. But they will not have covered so
thoroughly the lower-profile processes leading to other
initiatives, and their output tends to be generalized for a
global audience. <Nighttime Coverage to Balkans from Medium Wave
VOA Facilities</b><img src="ch0305.gif" align="left">Source:
USIA<p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To complement commercial electronic media, the U.S. government
employs its own broadcasting. Western research has shown that
90-100 million listeners tune in the Voice of America (VOA), the
radio-broadcasting arm of USIA, each week. The Open Media
Research Institute commissioned a series of studies of elites in
the former USSR in the fall of 1994. Seventy percent of the
leaders in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, and Slovakia use the Voice of America as a news source.
As audiences in some countries turn away from shortwave, the
Voice of America is utilizing new channels for its material. In
January 1994, VOA became the pioneer international broadcaster to
use the Internet. In late 1995, between 80,000 and 90,000 files
are sent from VOA each week to computer users in sixty-eight
countries. VOA broadcasts are sent to listeners throughout the
world over thirteen wholly owned relay stations and fifteen
shared facilities. The system is complemented by 1,250 AM and FM
affiliated networks and stations, making VOA "local" in key
places like the former Yugoslavia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) have a long history as
surrogate voices in the countries of Eastern Europe, where
government radio prevented people from getting complete and
accurate information. Radio and TV Marti have fulfilled the same
role for Cuba. Whether such efforts are still required is
arguable, but they continue, and there is a proposal for a Radio
Free Asia. These are funded by the U.S. government but differ
from VOA insofar as they present news of the target countries
exclusively. By late 1995, RFE/RL was down from 1,700 employees
in Prague to 300, broadcasting mostly to the former Soviet Union.
Radio Marti broadcasts almost twenty-four hours a day, reaching
an audience that can only be estimated (because of the inability
to poll audiences) at about 16 percent. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For more than ten years, USIA has developed "Worldnet," a
twenty-four-hour direct television service from Washington
reaching three hundred embassies and USIS information centers
around the world via satellite to its own receiving equipment, as
well as to interested foreign parties. Worldnet's "Newsfile" is
seen by viewers in eighty countries and is produced in English,
Spanish, Arabic, French, Russian, and Serbian. In 1994, Worldnet
produced 550 of the new "Dialogue" show, which gives listeners
overseas a chance to hear the views and ask on-line questions of
American leaders. Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, and Trade Representative Mickey Kantor have
been guests.<hr><blockquote><b>Public Diplomacy in the Former
Communist World</b><p>
The Voice of America has affiliation agreements with both private
and state-owned broadcasters in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgystan, Armenia, and the Baltic Republics. Near Volgograd,
stations that jammed VOA in the past have switched to
broadcasting its signals. In a national poll conducted by the
Sociology Center of the National Academy of Sciences in Armenia,
VOA was rated the most trusted news source by 35.2 percent of
respondents. Russian radio/TV received 32.5 percent, Radio
Liberty 22.1 percent, and the BBC 18.3 percent. Forty-two U.S.
Fulbright scholars are studying in Eastern Europe this year, and
Fulbright commissions exist in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary,
Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. More than forty Vietnamese
Fulbright graduate students attend U.S. universities in the
mid-1990s, mostly studying economics. One-man USIS operations
have opened in Laos, Cambodia, and Mongolia in 1994-95. In
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, in 1989, USIA had
branches in fifteen cities in eight countries; in mid-1995, there
are posts in twenty-seven cities in twenty-six countries. The
parliamentary deputies and ministerial staffs in Riga routinely
use the American Library on-line services for real-time
information on U.S. congressional actions. USIS Budapest, working
with the International Media Fund and the University of Maryland,
has established the American Journalism Center as part of the
prestigious ELTE Lorans University. Cooperative programs have
been undertaken with Albanian TV on private business development,
with Romanian TV on service industries, with Russian and Latvian
TV on tourism, and with Hungarian TV on the U.S. banking and
financial systems.</blockquote><hr><b>Foreign Students in the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The same interactive technique is used for nonbroadcast-quality
(and cheaper) programs, such as a series of U.S. history classes
for Russian university students, with a professor in Washington
leading a class of students in Moscow. As Worldnet and technology
have developed together, it has become a valued and unique direct
satellite broadcast service to broadcasters and other audiences,
where local receiving technology and laws allow.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modern on-line technologies are an invaluable aid for conveying
U.S. positions to a foreign audience. For example, during the
NAFTA debate, President Carlos Salinas of Mexico contacted USIS
daily for statements by congressional leaders and the resulting
commentary. Potential foreign users are, on the whole, less
plugged-in than Americans, and those who are share the problem of
a bewildering number of information nodes available. <img
src="ch0307.gif" align="left"><b>USIS World Wide Web Home Page.<a
href="http://www.usia.gov">http://www.usia.gov</b></a>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are over 1,000 U.S. government sites on the World Wide Web,
among 30,000 as of the end of 1995. Cultivating a reputation as a
reliable source of information on any subject increases the
chances that U.S. government sources will be consulted when
questions arise on important issues. Even though certain items of
information might be used against U.S. interests in specific
instances, overall, U.S. diplomats find more advantage in being a
source than in allowing someone else to be.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Where the information highway intersects with educational and
cultural activities stands the traditional USIS library. Although
books and journals are not denigrated, rooms of books have become
too expensive to maintain and are being down-sized or eliminated
in favor of information or reference centers, except in
particularly information poor countries or where they are
important symbolically, as in the reading room in Soweto in South
Africa.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">Educational and Cultural
Exchanges and Events</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Educational and cultural exchanges, while only indirectly related
to immediate foreign-policy initiatives, can advance national
interests in several ways. Understanding by key persons of why
the U.S. government is doing this or saying that, is either
adamant or flexible on a certain issue, may be promoted by a U.S.
history course taken with a Fulbright scholar, a USIS-sponsored
speech on free trade, a delegation of U.S. visitors meeting with
their professional counterparts, or personal contacts with U.S.
opinion molders during a USIA exchange program. A recognition of
the role played by such experience in developing personal
predispositions drives the modest U.S. investment in educational
and cultural exchanges to reach a future generation of overseas
opinion molders, agenda setters, and decision makers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States has much to gain from validating its image as a
place where ideas flourish. Officially extending an invitation to
foreign scholars through prestigious USIA-managed programs, such
as the Fulbright Scholarship Program and Humphrey Fellowship
Program, confirms U.S. higher education as a seed bed of ideas.
That reputation has led to extraordinary demand by private
foreign students, an export that the Department of Commerce has
calculated as worth $6.8 billion dollars a year. USIS acts as
expediter for student exchanges through counseling services, and
even more specifically as agent for exchanges among legislators,
think tanks, youth groups, professionals, and similar groups
reaching out for contact and helping to promote formal American
Studies programs in foreign universities. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to the Institute for International Education, 76,302
American students studied abroad for academic credit in the year
1993-94 (the latest year for which figures are available), which
is only one-half of one percent of all American students in
higher education. Of this group, only 16 percent spent an
academic year or more overseas. In the early 1990s, 1,200
Americans were studying in Japan--more than 40,000 Japanese were
studying in the United States. In 1992-93, almost 20 percent of
the foreign students in the U.S. were from mainland China and
Taiwan. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.S. cultural, artistic, and sporting events staged overseas are
increasingly common, organized on a commercial basis. The
challenge for the U.S. government is to cooperate with business
to make these events a celebration of the broad range of U.S.
accomplishments, as well as to organize direct exchanges in areas
that offer little commercial rationale. Under special
circumstances, cultural exchanges can even become the principal
medium for diplomatic relations. This was given a special name
when developing relations with China were dubbed "Ping-Pong
Diplomacy" because exchanges of table-tennis teams paved the way
for further relationships. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most targeted of the exchanges are short-term visits to the
United States for rising leaders, such as those sent under the
U.S. government's International Visitors Program. These can
provide a better understanding of U.S. society and correct
inaccurate views held even by foreign elites. In most cases,
alumni of U.S. government-sponsored exchanges are predisposed to
give the United States a fair hearing and the benefit of the
doubt, sometimes with direct or indirect ramifications for
national security. For example, even in the midst of one of the
United States's nettling trade rows with Japan, then Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was moved to tears during a speech in
which he recalled his daughter's experience as an exchange
student in the United States. This hardly made him a less
vigorous proponent of Japan's national self-interest. But it did
indicate his belief that the ongoing U.S.-Japanese relationship
was too important to let it founder over a single transient
issue.<hr><blockquote><b>The International Visitors
Program</b><p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Margaret Thatcher wrote in her biography, The Path to Power:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I had made my first visit to the USA in 1967 on one of the
'Leadership' programs run by the American Government to bring
rising young leaders from politics and business over to the U.S.
For six weeks, I travelled the length and breadth of the United
States. The excitement which I felt has never really subsided. At
each stop-over I was met and accommodated by friendly, open,
generous people who took me into their homes and lives and showed
me their cities and townships with evident pride. The high point
was my visit to the NASA Space Center at Houston. I saw the
astronaut training program which would just two years later help
put a man on the moon. As a living example of the 'brain drain'
from which over-regulated, high-taxed Britain was suffering, I
met someone from my constituency of Finchley who had gone to NASA
to make full use of his talents. I saw nothing wrong with that,
and indeed was glad that a British scientist was making such an
important contribution. But there was no way Britain could hope
to compete even in more modest areas of technology if we did not
learn the lessons of an enterprise economy.</blockquote><hr>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All of this framework for public diplomacy serves a special
purpose when the President, Vice President, departmental
secretaries, and certain other high-level government spokesmen
travel. Nothing will focus an issue more quickly and sharply than
to have this level of government take it as part of the agenda
for a foreign trip. USIS public diplomats play critical roles in
making the most of these special occasions. Management of even
the most basic public appearances by such principals in a foreign
setting, taking into consideration local sensitivities and
practices, ensuring that traveling press can get their story out,
and providing local reference points for comments and statements
is considered critical to maximizing the public impact of such
visits. In addition to well-run press conferences and media
interviews, public diplomats can make possible special,
meaningful appearances, such as President Ronald Reagan's at the
tombs at Xian in China; Vice President Dan Quayle's shooting
hoops with Japanese school boys; and President Bill Clinton's
itinerary in Russia. These are the events that provide the
lingering visual images important to public appreciation of the
United States, and they require the expertise that is the
province of the public diplomat.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, the United States discovered that its
traditional democratic beliefs offered an effective counter to
the spread of the communist ideology. With the collapse of
communism, the U.S. continues to promotes democracy because
experience has shown that democratic states are less likely to
threaten U.S. interests and more likely to cooperate with the
U.S. on security and trade issues. In most instances, democratic
states resolve their conflicts in ways that allow continued
cooperation afterward. Also, a larger pool of states committed to
democratic ideals increases the potential to form coalitions for
political, economic, and security interests.<img src="ch0308.gif"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Promoting democracy broadens the range of national power
instruments that can be used to influence relations with the
transitioning state. For example, when Eastern European states
were ruled by communist governments, the instruments of national
power available to the United States to influence those countries
were limited to coercive (or at best non-cooperative) instruments
such as economic sanctions and demonstrations of military
readiness. Now that these states have more democratic systems of
governance, the U.S. is more able to employ instruments such as
military-to-military interaction, trade, foreign economic
assistance, and heightened public diplomacy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The National Endowment for Democracy is a non-profit, bipartisan,
grantmaking organization created during President Reagan's first
term as a way of helping democratically-minded groups in foreign
countries build more effective organizations and carry out
programs in democratic education, human rights, and respect for
the rule of law. Although it is a private agency, its funding is
part of the USIA Budget and is used to provide grants to other
private organizations. NED channels about 70% of its available
grant money through four member institutes: the National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the International
Republican Institute, the Free Trade Union Institute of the
AFL-CIO, and the Center for International Private Enterprise of
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Those groups in turn decide which
foreign groups will receive grants. The remaining 30 percent of
the NED's available grant money is distributed directly to
programs and groups. Although modestly funded (the budget request
for FY 1996 was $34 million), NED's ability to react quickly to
support emerging democratic movements is one of its major
strengths. Some of NED's most notable and recent success stories
include support for human rights and labor groups in China,
support for independent media in the former Yugoslavia, political
party training in South Africa, assistance to election monitors
in Mexico, support for human rights activists and the circulation
of newsletters in Cuba, and training of pollwatchers in Ukraine.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A variety of programs discussed under Public Diplomacy and in
other chapters of this volume support democracy abroad. The U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID) is the largest
spender on country-specific programs to support broadening of
political participation, improving accountability of government
officials and enhancing government legitimacy, as well as
conducting elections. USIA estimates that as much as twenty
percent of its $1.4 billion dollar budget is spent on
democratization initiatives in educational exchange, speaker
programs, university support, radio and TV operations and general
information exchanges.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department of Defense has used the International Military
Education and Training (IMET) program to teach foreign militaries
about the role of a military in a democratic society and the
Expanded IMET (E-IMET) program to educate foreign civilians in
some defense-related subjects thus enhancing civilian control of
the military. The role of the military in a democratic society is
the central focus of the Marshall Center, a separate DOD program
aimed at helping the militaries of central and eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union transition to democratic systems.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. government also works with, and in some cases supports
financially, the myriad of private voluntary organizations (PVOs)
supporting democratization. Former President Jimmy Carter and the
Carter Center in Atlanta have been instrumental in many
initiatives to promote peace and democracy, including
election-monitoring efforts and persuading Haitian military
dictators to surrender power to democratically elected leaders.
PVOs such as the International Foundation for Electoral Systems
(IFES)) have been leaders in providing election assistance to
countries in transition, and in monitoring elections to help
ensure fairness. IFES maintains a resource center in Washington,
D.C. which is a tremendous storehouse of information on technical
election issues, political problems, and election failures.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Important as it is, democratization is not panacea for all social
problems. In countries with strong ethical, racial, or religious
tensions, long-smoldering tensions, previously held in check by
superpower confrontation or authoritarian governments, can burst
into flame if democratization occurs without the proper
foundation and preparation. Conflicts in Burundi, Rwanda, and the
former Yugoslavia were stimulated in some degree by poorly
planned democratization without adequate protection for minority
interests. Elections sometimes heighten expectations among the
populace that western-style elections will result in
western-style economic prosperity. The resulting disappointment
when the elected government is not able to fulfill economic
expectations complicates the democratization process, and
sometimes results in calls for a return to the old way. While
elections are critical to a functioning democracy, haphazardly
rushing to hold elections without adequate foundations can
exacerbate existing problems and slow, rather than speed, the
transition to democracy.<img src="ch0309.gif"><b>Camera crews

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To provide international financial and technical assistance to
achieve one free and fair election, and then to expect a nascent
democracy to replicate the result on its own the next time is
unrealistic. Continued engagement by the U.S., both unilaterally
and multilaterally, makes more likely success at an enduring and
far-reaching democratization. At the same time, the U.S. may lack
the resources and the will to become involved in every situation.
U.S. involvement is most likely, and most likely to succeed,
where U.S. interests weigh greatly in the he balance and where
democratization may take root with enough assistance.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead8">Wartime Media
Relations</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Media-military relationships were at a high point during World
War II, when correspondents like Ernie Pyle thought of themselves
first and foremost as patriots. Vietnam, by contrast, represents
the dark days, when the media were characterized as actively
undercutting the war effort. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, many
in the military had a low opinion of the media. However, in the
early 1980s, a system was instituted to promote better
cooperation; under it a pool of reporters would be able to cover
military operations in the field. The first use during actual
combat was the 1984 Grenada invasion, when the press pool was
denied access to communication facilities and to frontline troops
for forty-eight hours. Cuba reported to its people the details of
the operation before the U.S. public heard them. That
precipitated serious, policy-level efforts to develop a modus
operandi for the military and the media. Under advice from a
panel of news and public-affairs people chaired by General Winant
Sidle, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger announced a policy of
access and positive accommodation in return for respect for the
demands of combat. The 1989 test of the system, the U.S. invasion
of Panama, was a flop. The conclusion afterwards by the military
and the media was that the system had to work, because the
military and the media needed each other. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the pool system was not the
principal form of coverage because thousands of journalists
flocked to cover the story. The media had unprecedented access,
but there still were problems. There are journalists who will
never be satisfied with their access to either the action or a
means of getting the story out. And there are military officers
whose negative attitudes toward the press will overpower
commitment to policy. But the relationship has developed into a
less adversarial one than during the post-Vietnam days. Indeed,
journalists have demonstrated a willingness to sit on stories
when the security need is evident, as seen at the start of Desert
Storm, when the planes <BR>
taking off from Saudi bases were evident hours before they
reached their targets. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A continuing challenge is the information revolution, because it
means instantaneous coverage by large groups of reporters who
flock to the most obscure parts of the globe in the event of a
crisis. Television lights on a landing zone and satellite phone
uplinks pose obvious problems for the military. So too does the
problem of security for journalists, who want to be free to move
at will but expect U.S. forces will rescue them if they get into
trouble. On the other hand, the information revolution can be a
powerful force multiplier for the military, with the media
carrying to hostile forces the message about U.S. might and
determination. 
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead9">Conclusions</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two fundamental changes have taken place that alter dramatically
the environment in which the United States conducts its public
diplomacy. First, the message of individual freedom, democracy,
and free market economy that the United States worked to spread
during the cold War has borne fruit. Most former communist
nations, military dictatorships, and other totalitarian societies
have been opened up, due in no small measure to the success of
our public diplomacy. Second, private news organizations, taking
advantage of rapid advances in telecommunications technologies,
are providing prompt, extensive coverage of global affairs and
distributing it to all corners of the globe.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The challenge for the U.S. government and its public diplomacy
has changed accordingly. It no longer need be concerned about the
battle of the ideologies. U.S. public diplomacy can now
concentrate on the twin tasks of promoting understanding of U.S.
society and encouraging support for the positions of the U.S.
government on more immediate issues.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, the role of the USIA and other U.S. government agencies
is shifting: they are less sources of information and more
organizers of information. That is, they are changing from
generating the news to organizing and providing an appropriate
context for news. CNN and other news organizations now move
rapidly and efficiently togather and disseminate news and that
news is available for the most part throughout the globe. There
is much less need for the United States to take unilateral action
to ensure that news and information penetrate a closed
totalitarian society. It is not necessary nor is it appropriate
for the U.S. to compete head to head with private news
organizations even if the U.S. government could do so
effectively.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The role for USIA is evolving into ensuring that the U.S.
position on a current issue or, when appropriate, the broader
U.S. policy toward a region is presented fairly and well
understood. As news organizations develop stories on issues in
which the U.S. has a stake, it is important that the U.S.
government be aware of the information that is reaching the
publics. As required, USIA can provide the appropriate context,
background, and information, to convey a clear understanding of
U.S. policy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The information revolution also demands competence and
involvement in more media. in the last two decades, television
has passed radio and the printed media as the primary source of
news that reaches the global public. Increasingly, the elites of
advanced nations are getting their information via electronic
media, including via the Internet. As this and other media become
more heavily utilized, it is important to provide the same
ability to organize and provide appropriate context to the news.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other aspects public diplomacy have changed as well. Resources
have declined for government sponsored tours, student and
cultural exchanges with foreign nations. On the other hand, there
has been a rapid growth and expanded opportunity for travel and
exchanges in the private sector. This provides an opportunity for
USIA to work with private groups in ensuring a constructive
opportunity for a greater understanding of the U.S. government
and society on the part of participants.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What has not changed is that the communication of U.S. policy
works best when a conscious effort is made at all levels of
planning to co-ordinate U.S. public diplomacy. The continued
investment of resources and close attention to public diplomacy
will pay important dividends in a consistent and credible voice
that communicates clearly the positions policies of the U.S.
government to the publics throughout the globe.<hr>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the conclusion of World War II, and in the years immediately
following, the United States played a key role in creating,
financially supporting, and otherwise enhancing the capabilities
of the United Nations, specialized U.N. agencies, and regional
organizations concerned with security matters. While the Cold War
prevented these organizations from functioning as originally
envisaged, they did at times serve U.S. interests by providing
vehicles to ameliorate the plight of refugees, dismantle colonial
empires, improve prospects for economic development among
emerging nation-states, and manage some international conflicts
that were not caught up in the U.S.-Soviet competition.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the end of the Cold War, there was a burst of enthusiasm about
the potential for international organizations. The major powers
seemed to share a common vision about world problems, and it
seemed that international organizations could provide the
institutional framework for arriving at a consensus on what to do
about each problem. The U.N. seemed to provide the best venue for
addressing the principal post-Cold War security problem, that is,
internal ethnic and religious conflicts, separatist movements,
and the so-called "failed state" syndrome. And it seemed that no
one state could, on its own, resolve the many post-Cold War
security issues that are transnational in nature--for example,
narcoterrorism, refugees and mass immigration, and the criminal
diversion of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or WMD material. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But these hopes were soon tempered by the realization that
international organizations, especially the United Nations, was
unable to carry out fully the new responsibilities with their old
structures and approaches. Furthermore, the United States, as
well as some other major powers, were reluctant to provide
international institutions with the resources and the clout
needed to implement the mandates being assigned them. And
differences among the major powers widened, making consensus more
difficult. In the United States, the U.N. began to appear less
attractive as a vehicle for addressing security concerns, while
alliances, coalitions, and unilateral measures appeared more
attractive.<p><b>U.N. System Staffed Headquarters, Early
1990s</b><p><img src="ch0401.gif">Source: Erskine, Childers and
Brian Urquhart, <i>Reviewing the United Nations System,</i> and
INSS estimate.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the wake of these developments, international organizations
and agencies find themselves overburdened and in need of
revitalization. Many of these institutions overlap in terms of
their field operations, since they cover similar problem areas.
At present, Washington concentrates much of its efforts on the
following:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* U.N. organs charged with conflict management (particularly the
Office of the Secretary-General, the Secretariat, and the
Security Council).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* U.N. specialized agencies that address transnational policy
questions of direct concern to the United States.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Regional groupings that have the capacity to support the United
Nations in its conflict-resolution role. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Private voluntary organizations (PVOs) that provide effective
emergency assistance to populations facing humanitarian crises,
such as natural disasters, civil conflicts, and other forms of
upheaval.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* International financial institutions that have the potential to
ameliorate the economic-development problems of less-developed
countries. (These are discussed in the chapter on economics.)

</H2>   
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
The United Nations
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, the United Nations had only a limited
capacity to contain or manage conflicts. Between 1945 and 1988,
only two out of every five U.N. attempts to mediate disputes
could be deemed successful. Of the international disputes during
1945-1988 in which there was some military engagement, the United
Nations helped resolve only 25 percent of those referred to it
for intervention. Nevertheless, the U.N. was an important forum
in which to resolve Third World disputes not directly involving
the U.S. and USSR, as well as to prepare the way for arms-control
treaties, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the end of the Cold War, the United Nations became the
principal international institution through which a series of
international problems were addressed. The result was several
less than successful operations that have earned the U.N. much
criticism in the United States. Unsatisfactory performances in
Bosnia, Somalia, and Rwanda have called into question the
organization's ability to serve as an effective vehicle for
conflict-resolution and multilateral burden-sharing. (U.N.
military deficiencies are discussed in the chapter on
humanitarian and peace operations; questions dealing with
organization and management are addressed in this chapter.) There
are three problems. First, the anticipated unity of view among
the Security Council's five permanent members (the United States,
Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom) was not sustained.
Secondly, the U.N. leadership, specialized U.N. agencies, and
major regional organizations have not proven adept in adjusting
to the transnational challenges confronting the international
community. Thirdly, several major members have not been willing
to provide the requisite resources.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Among the reasons for the shortcomings in U.N. operations has
been the United States's own uncertainty about its role in the
post-Cold War world and its unwillingness to pay the unexpectedly
high costs associated with U.N. operations. Congressional members
expressed these feelings in mid-1995, with various bills
reflecting a desire to shed many international burdens and to
define U.S. concerns abroad in terms of narrow--predominantly
economic--self-interest. For example, H.R. 2126 would require the
president to consult with appropriate congressional authorities
at least fifteen days before committing U.S. forces to any new
peacekeeping, peace enforcement, humanitarian, or international
disaster-relief mission. This requirement could be waived in
emergency situations, in which case the President would be
required to consult Congress within forty-eight hours after
deployment began.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another factor weakening the U.N. is a fear that it may grow too
strong and could tread on the national sovereignty of its
members. Within the United Nations, the majority of
members--including the United States--are ambivalent about the
U.N.'s post-Cold War interventions in civil conflicts. Not only
are such interventions in apparent violation of the principle of
national sovereignty, but the U.N.'s accomplishments have not
always merited the resources committed. Worries exist in some
quarters that enhancing U.N. capabilities in peacekeeping, human
rights, and humanitarian assistance would create a slippery slope
that could lead to an erosion of national sovereignty and the
passing of decision-making authority to the Secretary-General and
the secretariat.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b> U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs Budget</b><p>
($ millions)<p>
<img src="ch0402.gif" align="left">A third factor is the fear
that a strong U.N. would demand of its members greatly increased
contributions of money and manpower, resources that are
notoriously difficult for the U.N. to secure. Indeed, in August
1995, the Secretary-General announced that the organization was
"bankrupt." Cash resources could not meet either current
operating needs or existing obligations. As of the end of
September 1995, member states owed two billion dollars in
assessments not paid. The U.S.--the largest debtor--owed the U.N.
$400 million under the regular operating budget, and $800 million
under the peacekeeping budget. While acknowledging that the U.S.
share of the annual operating budget and special assessments for
unanticipated contingencies represents an excessive burden,
President Bill Clinton has been unable to secure agreement for a
reduction downward with offsetting increases by other member
states. Excluding contributions in kind (such as the costs of
U.S. forces borne by the U.S.), annual costs for U.N. peace
operations were approximately $3.5 billion in the mid-1990s, an
order of magnitude larger than the early 1980s. U.S. costs,
including contributions to the U.N. and supplemental costs for
U.S. forces working with these operations (but not costs the U.S.
forces would incur anyway, such as salaries), averaged $3.5
billion during 1993-1995. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In short, there is a lack of consensus within the U.S.
government--and elsewhere--about the U.N.'s future roles and
responsibilities. Some suggest the U.N. should be equipped to
undertake an effective and intrusive role. This would include
creating a standing force of brigade size for rapid intervention
in crisis situations, prestocking military equipment in various
geographic areas, developing common peace operations training
programs, and altering traditional peacekeeping rules of
engagement to permit forceful interventions in conflict
situations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Contributing to the external forces weakening the United Nations
has been serious internal management problems. In 1992, despite
stubborn resistance to reform in some U.N. circles, the
Secretary-General, supported by the General Assembly, reorganized
the U.N. political and emergency management apparatus into three
new departments. The Department of Political Affairs was formed
to lend some coherence to a wide variety of long-standing small
political units. The Department of Humanitarian Affairs was
created, partly with staff from a dissolved badly run agency, to
coordinate the functions of the U.N.'s large and largely
independent humanitarian agencies. It did not perform well in
1993-94. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) came
from greatly expanding what had been a small office in the
Secretary-General's staff. As of mid-1995, DPKO's 420 staff
members (including 118 military personnel), headed by an under
secretary-general, included the military advisor (a major
general), the 27-person situation center (which includes the
24-hour Duty Room and the U.N.'s only intelligence unit), the
operations office, and the planning and support office. Under the
DPKO, communications with forces in the field and crisis C3,
which were almost non-existent in 1990, have been dramatically
improved. <hr>

<img src="ch0404.gif">Source: U.N.<hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A significant reform issue yet to be fully addressed is the role
of the Secretary-General, who has gone from chief administrative
officer to being also chief peacekeeping officer, international
mediator, adviser to the Security Council, chief fundraiser and
public-relations officer. These added duties have raised concern
in some quarters about vesting too much authority in the
Secretary-General. Furthermore, some in the United States are
concerned that the Secretary-General at times takes action at
variance with U.S. interests. For example, in 1993, the
Secretary-General wished to have all Somali factions fully
disarmed prior to the handoff of field operations in Somalia to
the United Nations. Washington refused. On the other hand, the
phased U.S.-U.N. intervention in Haiti in 1994-95 was a model of
mutual accommodation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lastly, the United States is seeking to end excessive financial
dependence on a single member state, to wit, the U.S. An
equitable distribution of the burden among members in a position
to pay would enhance the organization's capacity to meet crises.
However, the organization's deteriorating financial position is
in part a reflection of the low priority that member states
accord the organization, and not just a dispute about
burden-sharing. In 1995, the U.S. Congress mandated that the
United States limit its payments for peacekeeping to 25 percent
of the total cost, compared to the 31.7 percent required by the
U.N. formula. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead3">The U.N. Specialized
Agencies</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, the specialized agencies performed the
useful role of codifying U.S. policy initiatives in several
areas, notably arms control, respect for human rights, and the
handling of refugee issues. Important agencies--such as the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)--were established, and
guidelines mandated by the General Assembly governing war crimes,
genocide, and the rights of the individual became accepted
standards. The role of the International Court of Justice was
enhanced. During this period, the U.N. also became an effective
forum in which to discuss and evaluate plans to end European
colonial dominion in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, some of the agencies, such as the U.N. Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization, suffered from incompetent
leadership, bloated budgets, and recourse to anti-Western
propaganda and publications. The U.S. has had limited success in
encouraging reorganization and structural reform, including
consolidation of specialized agency operations, that is,
elimination of some agencies and relocation of others.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As of the mid-1990s, several specialized agencies within the U.N.
system have become important vehicles for advancing U.S.
interests. Three stand out: the IAEA, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the International Court of
Justice (ICJ).
<hr><b>U.N. Peacekeeping Operations and Good Office Missions,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>International Atomic Energy Agency</I>. Washington views the
IAEA, established in 1957, as one of the most important
international organizations. Nonproliferation is a high priority
of the U.S. national security agenda, and Washington is dedicated
to enhancing IAEA capabilities to monitor and, when necessary,
confront problem states, such as Iraq, North Korea, Iran, and
Libya.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Within the terms of its mandate, IAEA has two basic
responsibilities. First, in the words of its statute, is to
ensure "so far as it is able" that nuclear programs under its'
purview are not used to further any military purpose. Under the
terms of the 1970 NPT, all member states not possessing nuclear
weapons are required to conclude a comprehensive safeguard
agreement with the IAEA. Secondly, Article II of the IAEA's
statues states that "the Agency shall seek to accelerate and
enlarge the contribution of atomic energy for peace, health, and
prosperity throughout the world." In an effort to extend the
benefits of peaceful nuclear technology, the IAEA maintains
substantial technical cooperation programs in such areas as
nuclear power, nuclear medicine, and nuclear safety. This role of
the IAEA <BR>
at times appears to be in conflict with its NPT responsibilities.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After the 1991 Gulf war, the IAEA discovered for the first time a
violation of a safeguard agreement. As a result of knowledge
gained from its long-term monitoring activities in Iraq, the
agency has significantly bolstered its safeguards system. This
new approach also played a major role in detecting violations of
the NPT safeguards agreement by North Korea in 1994-95. With the
support of the U.S. and a few other key members, the IAEA was
able to identify the nature of North Korean violations and to
report them to the U.N. Security Council, validating the
existence of significant undeclared nuclear activities in the
country. Through continued persistence, the IAEA successfully
negotiated access to key facilities and began to implement
effective control and accounting of the irradiated nuclear fuel.
The U.S. was thereby afforded an opportunity to launch bilateral
diplomatic efforts with North Korea to defuse the looming crisis.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. has promoted efforts to strengthen IAEA safeguards and
monitoring capabilities, particularly in safeguards inspections
and materials control and accounting. As a result, in March 1995,
the IAEA's Board of Governors adopted Program 9312 which provides
for, among other things, more intrusive inspections by the IAEA.
As a result of the indefinite extension of the NPT in April 1995,
reliance upon the the IAEA and its safeguards program as a
deterrent to nuclear proliferation will increase.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A limitation on the use of the IAEA as a instrument of U.S. power
is that, as an international organization, the IAEA represents
the interests of all its member states, while meeting its
obligation to implement international safeguards. Anytime the
U.S. turns to the IAEA for help on an issue, it runs the risk of
finding itself with an IAEA decision which it did not anticipate
and may be contrary to its policy goals. For example, in 1995,
Iraqi leaders lobbied the U.N. heavily for the lifting of
sanctions against them, claiming they had met all the conditions
placed upon them. The U.S. believed strongly that Iraq was still
withholding information regarding its weapons programs and has
been adamantly opposed to lifting the sanctions. The outcome
depended in part on the continued vigilance of the IAEA
inspectors of the Iraqi facilities. Had the Agency prematurely
given Iraq a "no discrepancies noted" report, it could have put
its finding at odds with the stated U.S. policy of preserving the
sanctions. The possibility of just such a dilemma has prompted
the U.S. government to cooperate very closely with the IAEA and
to share information and expertise as appropriate.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</I>. Prior to
1989, the U.S. government strongly supported UNHCR efforts to
ameliorate the plight of refugees, for example, those who fled
conflicts in Sudan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Angola.
With the passage of time, however, the U.S. became concerned
about inadequacies of UNHCR rapid-response capabilities, the
capabilities of its field-operations personnel, and the high
administrative costs of its operations. In addition, disputes
arose over the legal status of refugees versus displaced persons;
the U.S. has taken the position that the UNHCR definition of what
constitutes "refugee" status has been unduly restrictive.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite these concerns, the role of UNHCR has grown in the
post-Cold War world. A spate of intrastate conflicts has resulted
in massive numbers of displaced peoples and threats to the
stability in neighboring countries. In Bosnia, Rwanda, and
northern Iraq, the UNHCR has played a major role in helping the
victims of internal conflict. The issues surrounding massive
flows of immigrants, refugees, and displaced person are of
mounting concern within the United States and other Western
states.<p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
UNHCR data suggest an increasing demand for assistance to
refugees and displaced populations. In the early 1970s,
applicants for asylum in West European countries numbered about
1,000 per year; in 1991, there were 545,000 asylum seekers. By
1993, European governments, overwhelmed by the rising tide of
applicants for asylum, began to introduce restrictive
legislation. With respect to worldwide refugee populations, the
trend is even more disturbing. In 1951, when UNHCR was founded,
there were 1.5 million legally classified refugees worldwide; in
1995, there are some 20 million. In addition, an estimated 24
million people are displaced within their own countries, victims
of civil wars, failed governments, and natural disasters. One in
approximately 125 humans is uprooted as of the mid-1990s, with
fresh waves of refugees and displaced persons expected during the
remainder of this decade.<p>
<hr><blockquote><b>Restricting Iraqi Weaponry</b><p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the end of the Gulf War, the United States, in conjunction
with its coalition allies and members of the U.N. Security
Council, passed several resolutions giving international
organizations--the U.N. and the IAEA--responsibility for
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and
monitoring compliance with U.N. resolutions. U.N. Resolution 687,
passed in April 1991, authorized the Secretary-General to
establish a special commission to supervise the inspection and
destruction of Iraq's facilities for WMD, including chemical,
biological, missile, and nuclear capabilities, in cooperation
with the IAEA. Resolution 715, passed six months later,
reaffirmed and extended those powers. Terms of the resolutions
included:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Iraq's "unconditional acceptance of the destruction, removal,
or rendering harmless, under international supervision" of all
chemical and biological weapons, all stocks of agents, related
subsystems, and components, and all research, development,
support, and manufacturing facilities; and all ballistic missiles
with a range greater than 150 kilometers, with related major
parts and repair and production facilities. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The commission's conduct of immediate on-site inspection of
Iraq's WMD facilities based on Iraq's declarations and the
designation of any additional locations by the commission itself.
The Special Commission was also to supervise Iraq's "destruction,
removal or rendering harmless" of all items the commission
specified.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Prohibiting Iraq from using, developing, constructing, or
acquiring any of the above items and calling on the
Secretary-General and the Special Commission to develop a plan
for the future monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Baghdad's unconditional agreement not to acquire, research, or
develop nuclear weapons, subsystems, or components; declaration
of all locations, amounts, and types of materials; and placement
of all materials under the exclusive control of the IAEA for
custody and destruction. Baghdad also had to agree to on-site
inspection and monitoring of its future compliance with the
resolution. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other resolutions called for U.N. monitoring of Iraq's oil sales
if Baghdad accepted an oil-for-humanitarian-aid offer outlined in
subsequent U.N. resolutions. These examples mark one of the few
occasions the United States turned to an international
organization to implement a major arms-reduction program. Despite
the continuing Iraqi foot-dragging, evasion, and occasional open
defiance, remarkable progress was made during 1991-95 in
detecting and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
programs. The U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with this
task, led by Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, found numerous installations
and weapons systems that had not been known to the West or had
not been damaged during the war. For instance, UNSCOM destroyed
36 Iraqi mobile SCUD missile launchers, while U.S. air strikes
during Desert Storm destroyed no such launchers despite 2,000
sorties (and despite intelligence assessments during the war that
indicated that many launchers had been put out of commission).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Still, much remained to be done in late 1995 to establish with
confidence that Iraq was in full compliance with Resolutions 687
and 715, much less the other U.N. Security Council resolutions.
The U.S. has been careful to offer evidence and orchestrate
opposition when other Security Council members have tried to ease
sanctions on Iraq by suggesting, contrary to fact, that Baghdad
was in compliance.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The International Court of Justice</I>. While the ICJ was
created by the U.N. Charter in 1945 as the principal judicial
organ of the U.N., it is essentially a continuation of the
Permanent Court of International Justice established after World
War I. It is composed of fifteen judges, elected every nine
years, with one-third of the judges coming up for re-election
every three years. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both during the Cold War and afterwards, the ICJ has been fairly
effective in resolving maritime problems but not other issues. At
the core of the debate over the effectiveness of the ICJ as a
useful instrument lie two issues: jurisdiction and enforceability
of judgments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jurisdiction is the authority by which the ICJ can hear cases,
and it consists of two types: advisory jurisdiction and
contentious jurisdiction. Only U.N. organs and specialized
agencies may invoke the advisory jurisdiction, and advisory
opinions are nonbinding. Of more interest is contentious
jurisdiction. As its name implies, contentious jurisdiction is
used to settle disputes, but only between those states that have
accepted the ICJ's jurisdiction. Of the approximately 160 states
eligible to accept the ICJ's contentious jurisdiction, fewer than
one-third have done so.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When the ICJ agreed to exercise jurisdiction in a case filed by
Nicaragua against the United States in 1984 in response to U.S.
support of the Contras, the U.S. withdrew from jurisdiction of
the ICJ in 1986. Withdrawal of the United States from the ICJ
jurisdiction places the latter largely outside of the sphere of
instruments available to the U.S.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even in situations where a judgment is obtained from the ICJ,
enforceability of those judgments remains problematic. Although
the U.N. Charter requires any state that is a party to a case
before the ICJ to comply with the court's judgment, no action has
ever been taken by the Security Council to enforce compliance.
Indeed, the veto power of the permanent Security Council members
virtually eliminates any possibility of enforcing a judgment
against their core interests.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The future utility of the ICJ as an instrument of national power
is uncertain. States are still unwilling to accept binding
third-party dispute resolution, particularly where their national
security interests are at state. However, in an era of increasing
economic competition, the ICJ can still be useful in resolving
the inevitable disputes that arise, but only when the parties
themselves desire such third-party resolution.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the International Court of Justice does not have any
criminal jurisdiction, the U.N. Security Council, acting under
its emergency powers to resolve conflicts, recently established
two special War Tribunals to punish individual perpetrators of
atrocities in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda. These
tribunals do not abolish the jurisdiction of the local courts to
punish such crimes under their national laws, but they are given
primary jurisdiction over the offenses listed as international
crimes by the Security Council. With respect to Rwanda, the
Security Council establishes the precedent that certain offenses,
previously only recognized as international crimes when committed
during an international conflict, may also be treated as such
when committed during a purely internal conflict. These recent
atrocities also provided renewed impetus for completion by the
International Law Commission of a draft treaty for a permanent
international criminal court. Many international jurists believe
that such a court would be preferable to a succession of ad hoc
tribunals, because it would be applying uniformly laws which were
well defined in advance of the trials.<p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A whole array of multilateral organizations include members of
one region or type. Some of these define an area of interest that
excludes the U.S., such as the Arab League or the Organization of
African Unity. Some are concerned with a specific set of issues,
such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), the organization of twenty-five industrial democracies,
including the United States, Japan, and Western Europe. From a
security perspective, the three principal regional organizations
to which the U.S. belongs are those that group the states of the
North Atlantic, Asia Pacific, and the Western Hemisphere.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>North Atlantic. </I>During the Cold War, the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) was part of the efforts
to achieve political d&eacute;tente that evolved from the 1975
Helsinki Final Act. Its membership included the U.S. and Canada,
as well as essentially all European states (some smaller states
joined only in the 1990s). Some hoped the CSCE would produce a
European peace treaty; others saw it as a means to promote
Western values and engage in a substantive dialogue on security
and human rights. Indeed, the leaders of the Soviet Union had
committed themselves to the democratic ideals expressed in the
Helsinki Final Act, which proved important to the development of
the dissident movement in the USSR and Eastern Europe. CSCE
provided the framework for the negotiation and implementation of
arms-control agreements, such as the Stockholm Document of 1986,
the two Vienna documents on confidence- and security-building
measures (CSBMs), and the 1990 Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe (CFE) Treaty. At the same time, the CSCE was only a
process; it had no organizational structure, no institutions, and
no permanent base of operations. Instead, the CSCE functioned on
the basis of periodic follow-up meetings--which were designed to
take place every three to four years to review adherence to the
obligations included in the 1975 Helsinki Final Act--and, when
appropriate, to reach new agreements.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The CSCE process played an important role in the fall of
communism in Europe in 1989-1991 by providing a standard by which
to judge governmental performance in the human-rights and
political areas. With this revolution came the evolution of the
CSCE. The watershed event in this evolution was the November 1990
summit meeting, at which the thirty-six CSCE states signed the
"Charter of Paris for a New <BR>
Europe." The CSCE was seen as a unique body, which could build a
sense of community and cooperation based on democratic principles
among all the states of Europe while preserving ties with the
U.S. and Canada. Three new institutions were created: the
Prague-based Secretariat; the Warsaw-based Office for Free
Elections (subsequently expanded and renamed the Office for
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights [ODIHR]); and the
Vienna-based Conflict Prevention Center (CPC). The CSCE also
established a system of accelerated political consultation,
including biannual meetings of government heads and annual
ministerial meetings.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1993, realizing that Europe faced potential instability in
several locations, the CSCE attempted to move into the field of
operations for early warning, conflict prevention, and crisis
management (including fact-finding and rapporteur missions and
CSCE peacekeeping), for conflict within participating states as
well as between states. Reports submitted include ones on the
Kosovo region and Tadjikistan. An outgrowth of the fact-finding
mission to Kosovo was the establishment of what is known as a
mission of long duration. This small group of CSCE diplomats is
engaged in an unusual exercise of what could be called emergency
preventive diplomacy. A large portion of its efforts is to
convince minorities that they have certain legal rights that can
be exercised even in the face of what they perceive to be
outright discrimination.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reflecting the growth of a permanent staff, the CSCE was
redesignated in 1994 the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Though limited in power, the OSCE
remains important as the only pan-European body. U.S. membership
in OSCE is a concrete expression of European acceptance of the
U.S. security role in that continent. The size and cumbersome
nature of its decision-making process probably ensure that OSCE
will remain only a framework for political consultation and
consensus-building. However, in 1995, the OSCE sponsored a
high-level planning group to begin a peacekeeping mission to the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan; it also tried to mediate
in the Chechnya conflict and established a monitoring presence in
Bosnia. Efforts to go much beyond fact-finding and monitoring
missions into large-scale peacekeeping operations would be risky;
a major failure in this field might, unfortunately, hurt the
OSCE's potential for fulfilling its vital political role.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Asia Pacific. </I>Prior to 1990-91, the nature of the
regional-security environment in the Asia Pacific region was such
that it favored neither the birth nor the growth of international
organizations. For the preceding decade, the nations of Southeast
Asia had been focused primarily on the internal, domestic aspects
of national security. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), which was the major international organization in the
Asia Pacific region, reflected this. The regional military
presence of the United States, mandated by its rivalry with the
former Soviet Union, provided guarantees of external security.
The U.S. military presence remained a major factor in maintaining
regional stability.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After 1991, however, conditions changed. Years of impressive
economic growth in Southeast Asia helped to reduce destabilizing
internal pressures. Prosperity also prompted the discovery of new
interests and the means to pursue them more effectively. At the
same time, there was also a growing suspicion that the end of the
Cold War would mark the decline of the U.S. military presence. In
the Northeast Asia subregion, domestic factors again had less
force. But, because the powers of the subregion share concerns
about the future military presence of the United States, they too
are receptive to the idea of organizing to better achieve their
economic and security interests. Since 1980, however, no less
than eight new multilateral organizations or agreements have
emerged. Of the eight, two--the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) accord and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)--qualify as
international organizations in the true sense of the term.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The success of APEC shows that the region (with the possible
exception of China) has embraced multilateralism as an effective
means of managing issues related to economics and trade.
Concerned as it is with security matters, the ARF is progressing
more slowly. However, an extremely successful forum in August
1995 indicates that the concept of multilateralism is finding
increasing favor as an approach to security issues as well. In
the future, the force of economic and security imperatives will
increase. As a result, it is likely that the scope and scale of
international organizations within the region will also
increase.<p><img src="ch0408.gif"><b>a U.S. M-113A2 on lease to

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the impulse toward multilateralism results in a larger number
of stronger international organizations, the regional-security
environment would be transformed, thus raising two major
considerations for Washington's position and leadership. Many
economic and security decisions that have traditionally been made
on a bilateral basis will have to be made in a far more complex,
multilateral setting. Certainly the influence of the Asian pole
of the trans-Pacific relationship will grow as the regional
powers perfect the mechanisms of coordination and control. It is
also important to remember that the starting point for any new
emphasis on international organizations is, in part, a desire to
hedge against a perceived decline in U.S. power and will. Whether
this perception is encouraged or disarmed will depend upon the
approach that is adopted during the initial stages.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Western Hemisphere</I>. The principal U.S. objective in this
hemisphere has been to have a peaceful southern flank, one in
which political stability and economic growth could be managed on
equitable terms. Historically, the notion of a U.S. special
relationship with Latin America has been greeted with reserve by
governments in the south. The record of U.S. interventions in
local affairs, economic domination, and cultural arrogance is
difficult to overcome. Influenced by close proximity to
overwhelming U.S. power and Washington's Cold War propensity to
use it in the hemisphere, the history and traditions of the
inter-American system place emphasis on national sovereignty,
self-determination and regional solutions to security problems
instead of submitting to decisions of others, such as the great
power veto system of the Security Council. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Defending Latin American security interests has given rise to
several institutions and arrangements known as the Inter-American
Defense System. The system's authority, the Inter-American
Defense Board, has been headed by a U.S. general. The board has
languished, but it remains a mechanism through which the Rio Pact
members could cooperate militarily if they were so inclined.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Organization of American States (OAS) is the oldest regional
security organization. Tension between the United States and the
other members of the OAS has been a dominant theme of OAS
politics, arising from a perception that the United States has
attempted to use the organization as a Cold War instrument or a
cover for unilateral action, for example, in the 1965 Dominican
Republic intervention. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Regional solutions at the height of U.S. unilateralist foreign
policy in the Americas during the 1980s tended to bypass the OAS
as an ineffective political body. Latin American governments
often coalesced into ad hoc focus groups, such as the Central
American Esquipulas Group and the Rio Group, to resolve specific
transnational problems. When states found it beneficial to
introduce an "honest broker" to facilitate peace negotiations, as
in the Salvadoran and Guatemalan civil wars, they turned to the
United Nations. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whether in reaction to a growing awareness of mutual and heavy
economic interdependence, or to the growing consensus in the
region on constitutional democracy as the desirable political
model, or both, the Organization of American States has reemerged
as a positive and increasingly proactive hemispheric player. In
1991, a key milestone was reached with the adoption by the 21st
General Assembly of Resolution 1080, which created an automatic
procedure for convening the region's foreign ministers in the
event of an interruption of legitimately elected government "to
look into events collectively and adopt any decisions deemed
appropriate." For the first time in the organization's history, a
domestic political event was declared to be grounds for
collective action. The resolution provided the legal basis for
OAS action in response to a military coup in Haiti less than four
months later.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A larger role for the OAS in peace operations is dependent on
mutual understanding between the United States and its
hemispheric neighbors. The post-Cold War era offers an
opportunity to reach such an understanding, especially in light
of the spread of democratic government, regional economic
integration, and strong OAS support for democracy. In the 1990s,
there has been an increase in hemispheric interaction and
cooperation in such diverse areas as control of population
movements, counterinsurgency, narcoterrorism, disaster relief,
extradition of criminals, and cooperation among military
establishments.<hr><blockquote><b>OAS and U.N. Multilateralism in
the Haitian Case</b><p>
The OAS and U.N. cooperated imprecisely over Haiti, in a way that
underscores the differences in their respective interests and
competencies. Although the Security Council met on September 30,
1991, the day that President Jean-Bestrand Aristide was
overthrown, it did not formally convene because a majority of the
members felt the coup was entirely a domestic matter. The OAS
Permanent Council, however, was obligated to meet by its recently
adopted Resolution 1080, which called for automatically convening
in the event of an interruption of legitimately elected
government in any member state. The council met swiftly on
September 30, condemned the coup, and convened an immediate
Meeting of Consultation of Foreign Ministers, which met twice in
eight days and, in effect, shaped the international response to
the crisis. A subsequent meeting of the U.N. Security Council
followed the OAS lead in condemning the coup but adopted no
formal resolution because China would not concur. In Washington,
the OAS dispatched a special mission, led by the
Secretary-General, with a mandate to press for restoration of the
democratically elected government. When that mission failed, the
foreign ministers reconvened, froze all assets of the Haitian
state held in any OAS member country, and imposed a trade
embargo, which it tightened in May 1992.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Soon, it became apparent that the year-long nonbinding OAS
sanctions were being ignored by non-Western Hemisphere countries
and even some Latin American countries. Increasingly concerned
about the political consequences of a growing exodus of Haitian
refugees, the U.S. government in November 1992 sought the
involvement of the United Nations. The resultant joint OAS/U.N.
mediation effort, led by a former Argentine foreign minister,
introduced a large mission of civilian human-rights observers but
failed to mediate a political agreement. In June 1993, Haiti was
placed on the agenda of the U.N. Security Council by France and
three OAS states--Venezuela, Canada, and the United States. The
council, acting under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, imposed a
worldwide mandatory oil and weapons embargo on Haiti, as well as
a freeze on the state's assets abroad.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After another year with a failed agreement to lift the economic
penalties and return President Aristide, followed by reimposed
and intensified U.N. sanctions, including the deployment of
American naval vessels to enforce the U.N. near-total trade
embargo, the Security Council in July 1994 authorized states to
form a multinational force and use all necessary means to
facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military leadership.
This step led, two months later, to the peaceful arrival of U.S.
combat forces in Haiti and the subsequent presence of a U.N.
peacekeeping force known as UNMIH--the U.N. Mission in Haiti.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some observations can be drawn from the experience of the Haitian
case. First, the basis for OAS and U.N. action is different but
compatible. The OAS responded to Resolution 1080, which calls for
member states to defend democracy. That was not grounds for U.N.
action. The Security Council justified its decisions on the
argument that the Haitian situation was a threat to international
peace. However, that was the first time that an internal
political crisis having to do with democratic governance provoked
such drastic measures on the part of the U.N.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Secondly, there is no legal basis within the OAS to escalate from
diplomatic and economic sanctions to military action in order to
reverse a coup, nor for armed peacekeeping to assist in the
restoration of democracy. Latin American officials are also
reluctant on domestic political grounds, and have concerns about
who would control the use of force in an asymmetrical hemispheric
context. For the foreseeable future, the OAS needs to work
closely with the United Nations, which has the mandate and the
expertise to engage in peace operations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lastly, it is important to recognize that the OAS has been
successful in the defense of democracy. Its prompt condemnation
and the diplomatic (and possibly economic) isolation this
portended worked effectively in more recent Peruvian and
Guatemalan crises.</blockquote><hr>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">Private Voluntary

<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Humanitarian organizations doing work in the developing world are
known as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) or, especially in
the United States, as private voluntary organizations (PVOs).
Most major international and American PVOs came into being during
the period around World War II: the International Rescue
Committee (1933), the Catholic Relief Services (1942), Oxfam/UK
(1942), World Relief (1950), Church World Service (1946), and
World Vision (1950). However, recent years have seen considerable
growth in the number of PVOs that respond in any given
international crisis, e.g. 200 PVOs were active in Bosnia in late
1995.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1994, PVOs in the Western democracies spent nearly $9 billion
on relief and sustainable development programs in the developing
world, half of this being attributable to American PVOs alone.
The profile of PVOs has grown as they have attempted to influence
foreign policy decisions affecting complex emergencies. As the
number and extent of complex emergencies have increased, so too
have the PVO efforts. Through their advocacy efforts, the PVOs
influence the decision makers who direct American foreign policy
and by educating the public and engaging its active support
through financial contributions to relief efforts. Further, the
increasing activity of PVOs in international crises, combined
with the greater role of the U.S. military in peace and
humanitarian operations, means that PVO activities have become
vital components of operations in which the U.S. military is
involved. To understand the change in the interaction between
PVOs and the U.S. military, a useful contrast is between the
Vietnam war, where the interaction was small (and at times
unfriendly), and the Bosnia operation unfolding in late 1995,
where PVOs are central to the success of the mission.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
PVOs' operational work in complex emergencies focuses on the five
saving interventions that make up the relief discipline: food
distribution, shelter, water, sanitation and medical care. To
these disciplines may be added in-depth grassroots organizational
skills at the community level, which PVO's use as much in relief
efforts as in their longer-term sustainable development work.
PVOs know the history, politics, and culture of the society, the
religious beliefs, tribal or clan structure, and, most important,
they deal on a daily basis with the local and national elites and
authority structures that lead the social order.<p>

PVOs</b><p><img src="ch0409.gif">Source: Interaction<p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because of their sense of geographic place in the villages and
cities where they serve, PVO field staff frequently become
advocates of the people with whom they work, to such a degree
that they lose their objectivity or they see only very localized
conditions, which may not be representative of more general
societal trends. They sometimes fail to understand the larger
political, social, or economic forces at work in the country.
Sometimes, their ideological prejudices distort their
understanding of what is really happening in a society.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The PVOs are both unlike and similar. Their organizational
structures, their philosophical approaches to relief and
development and public policy, their sectorial specialization,
and their historical roots cover such a wide spectrum that they
cannot be easily characterized. Those PVOs that work exclusively
on public-policy issues but have no permanent operational
presence in the field are known as advocacy groups. These tend to
have modest budgets and staffs, and no programs or projects,
focusing instead on researching such issues as human-rights
abuses, refugee-protection issues, or hunger. Most of the larger
PVOs do both relief and development work; a few, such as the
International Rescue Committee and International Medical Corps,
work only in relief efforts. Some specialize by sector
(agriculture, health, or education), while others have regional
specialization (such as Africare, which works only in Africa). 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many PVOs do not accept or have never applied for grant funding
from U.S. foreign-assistance agencies. For some, that is a
function of religious principles or their long-standing
opposition to American foreign policy; for others, it is a wish
simply to be unhindered by the rigorous public-sector procedural
and program-design requirements of government grants. Still
others, including many smaller PVOs, do not have the expertise to
negotiate through the thicket of rules and regulations imposed by
these grants. Federal law requires that in order to be eligible
to receive grant funding, a PVO must raise at least 20 percent of
its aggregate funding from private sources. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite the differences among them, PVOs in general have a style
of work and an organizational ethos that is markedly different
from that of the U.S. military, e.g., less hierarchy among staff,
more emphasis on consensus than on command, and more concern
about involving locals in decisions. The differences between PVOs
and the U.S. military is a challenge to working together
smoothly. Yet both parties increasingly need to cooperate to
accomplish their separate missions--the PVOs need the military's
infrastructure support and the protection from hostiles, and the
military needs the PVOs ability to get local civilian
institutions functioning again.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most PVOs, both American and international, help in several ways
to implement the foreign policy of the United States, sometimes
unintentionally:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* By providing humanitarian assistance to people most vulnerable
to starvation and disease in a country governed by a rogue regime
in which economic sanctions have been imposed, PVOs avoid the
adverse human consequences of sanctions, which might render them
politically unacceptable to public and congressional opinion in
the U.S. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* By improving basic human services in a country following a
civil war through their rehabilitation and reconstruction
programs, PVOs help to create public support for whatever regime
is in power. If stability of the regime is a foreign policy
interest of the U.S., then PVOs serve that interest. Likewise,
PVO human-service programs ensure services are not interrupted in
a nation with an authoritarian past while it is democratizing, a
process that can at times be chaotic. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* By ensuring a safety net of human services, PVOs can mitigate
the consequences of economic reform and structural adjustment in
developing countries and thus increase their chance of success.
Most economic reform involves the elimination of budget deficits
through reduction of the public payroll, human-service programs,
and subsidized food prices measures that can create political
unrest and destabilize governments that impose the reforms. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* By acting as mediating institutions, faith-based PVOs working
through the churches, and secular PVOs working through other
grassroots organizations, can act in conflicts as neutral,
intermediary institutions between opposing sides and promote
pluralism in nondemocratic or newly democratic societies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
International organizations have the potential to serve as useful
instruments in pursuit of U.S. foreign policy objectives.  They
establish conduct to which all states can be held, thereby
providing a framework for intrusive, coercive enforcement on
rogues. They provide ready-made fora in which common purposes and
goals can be hammered out. They are important fora for
undertaking conflict-resolution initiatives, as well as for
sanctioning multilateral U.S. military operations that might be
contemplated, such as economic sanctions. When recourse to
military instruments is needed, they provide a foundation for
burden-sharing. Furthermore, they provide the venue for
organizing international cooperation in response to growing
transnational problems, such as terrorism, uncontrolled
migrations of large populations, weapons proliferation, and
narcotics. They serve as neutral or impartial bodies that
reinforce U.S. efforts in such critical areas as proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. In addition, there are practical
matters on which cooperation is needed, such as air-traffic
security, telecommunications, and postal standards.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand, international organizations have certain
intrinsic drawbacks:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* They often have their own bureaucratic agendas which may or may
not be consistent with U.S. interests.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* They have limited rapid-response capabilities as crises
materialize.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* With some notable exceptions, their bureaucracies are encrusted
with procedures that inhibit innovation or rapid adaptation to
changing circumstances.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Consensus-building on major policy initiatives contemplated by
the United States is slow to evolve and decisions taken tend to
represent ambiguity arising out of compromises.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States can play a major role in efforts to improve the
performance of many of these international and regional
organizations by establishing clear U.S. policy objectives and
concentrating its effort on those agencies and institutions
deemed essential to the attainment of those objectives. In
particular, the United States will be more effective if it finds
ways to accommodate itself to the eccentricities of regional
organizations that are prepared to engage in sustained
conflict-resolution initiatives. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Key elements within the U.S. government have yet to reach
agreement on the relevance and importance of international
organizations in the attainment of U.S. security-policy
objectives. While there is agreement that priority should be
accorded agencies that address issues such as proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, humanitarian needs, and, to a lesser
extent, peace operations, the U.S. government has not provided a
broad perspective on the roles and relationship of international
organizations to vital U.S. security interests.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In recent years, economic issues have risen in priority among
U.S. foreign policy interests, reflecting two major developments:
a relative decline in security concerns, resulting from the end
of the East-West struggle; and the American public's
dissatisfaction with U.S. economic performance. As concern over
economic issues has risen, interest has grown in the use of
economic instruments to promote U.S. economic and security
interests alike.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Economic Interests as an Issue. </i>During the Cold War, national
security concerns took precedence over economics. Differences
with Japan or Europe over market access were generally settled in
the spirit of the greater common endeavor of advancing collective
security. By contrast, the predominant attitude in the post-Cold
War era, irrespective of administration, holds that U.S. security
depends upon a strong economy in two senses: first, a strong
foreign policy requires a strong economic base; and secondly,
security in its broadest sense includes economic well-being
sufficient to provide prosperity for most and assurance of a
safety net for all. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many Americans are more worried about the economic aspects of
security than about the military aspects. Since the mid-1970s,
the U.S. economy has not delivered the growth in incomes that
Americans have come to expect. Many people believe the economy
suffers because the United States has not faced a level playing
field in international economic competition, and because
Washington has not supported U.S. business interests as strongly
as other governments have supported their firms.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Public dissatisfaction with the U.S. economy is fed by the fall
in the U.S. relative standing since the early post-World War II
years. The U.S. share of world economic output dropped from a
peak of perhaps 45 percent in 1945 to 25 percent in 1980,
creating a sense that the United States has lost its position as
the world's unquestioned economic leader and now is but one of
several economic power centers. Less well known, and thus less
influential in public opinion, is the fact that the U.S. share of
world output has remained stable at about 25 percent during the
last fifteen years. Indeed, in the years since the end of the
Cold War in 1989, the U.S. GNP has grown as fast as those of
Japan and the European Union. Besides maintaining its share of
world output, the United States has also increased its lead in
the information industries, including the crucial software
industry that gives it a commanding position in the technologies
central to future economic growth and modern warfare. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Economics as an Instrument. </i>At different times, the U.S. public
endorses inconsistent principles for guiding the instruments of
international economic policy. Support for the proposition that
all benefit from free trade is contradicted by support for the
view that economics is the principal field of competition among
nations and the United States must therefore take all necessary
steps to ensure it comes out on top. The view adopted tends to
depend on circumstances. In the late 1980s, when Japan's economy
looked to be on a path to surpass that of the United States, some
Americans viewed Japan as a threat; after four years (1992-95) of
recession there, the U.S. public has adopted a more relaxed
attitude toward Japan.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whatever principles Washington chooses to adopt, its ability to
wield economic instruments, on behalf of either economic or
security goals, has been subject to contradictory forces. The
effectiveness of economic instruments has become more
circumscribed than it was in the heyday of U.S. economic power
during the early Cold War era, owing to the decline in the
relative weight of the United States in the world economy. Also,
the sophistication of many nations' economies has grown, so that
they can produce a wide range of industrial goods, which
undercuts U.S. unilateral restrictions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand, the new world order enhances the effectiveness
of economic instruments in two ways. First, during the Cold War,
the Soviet Union stood ready to step in whenever the U.S. tried
to isolate another nation economically. For example, when
Washington applied economic pressure against Cuba, Moscow
provided the massive subsidies that kept Havana afloat. No
country now possesses the combination of hostile interests and
economic might to provide that kind of alternative. Secondly,
national economies have become more dependent on international
trade and world financial markets. Trade in goods and services
across national borders in 1970 amounted to about 15 percent of
world output; by 1995, this figure had grown to about 25 percent.
<h2 align="left"><a name="subhead2">Instruments</a></H2>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Trade Policy
</H3><p><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, Washington subordinated the use of trade as
a policy instrument to military and diplomatic concerns. One
example was the granting or withholding to the USSR and East
European countries of normal trade terms, misleadingly known as
most favored nation (MFN) status. More often than trade
privileges, however, the issue was trade sanctions, especially
for what were seen as unfair trade practices. Starting in the
1970s, Congress enacted tougher and tougher legislation mandating
antidumping duties and countervailing duties for subsidies.
Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which authorizes retaliation
for unfair trade practices, requires rapid action by the U.S. on
claims filed by U.S. firms and facilitates the imposition of
stiff penalties--to the dismay of many economists, who see little
basis for the law's view of what constitutes unfair trade.
Successive administrations did not place as high a priority on
unfair trade, as defined by U.S. law, as on foreign policy
issues. Time and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
proposals by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to impose
sanctions on Japan over its mounting trade surplus with the
United States were overridden by the State Department and the
Pentagon out of fear that such measures would imperil
Washington's security ties with Tokyo. Trade actions were more
frequently imposed when they could advance national security
interests. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition, the Washington foreign policy establishment
downplayed trade policy as an instrument of national power.
Despite aggressive trade promotion efforts in 1994-95, the U.S.
still trails its economic rivals in export promotion
expenditures. In 1994, the U.K. spent on export promotion about
$.25 per $1,000 of GDP; France spent $.17; Japan, $.12; and the
U.S., $.03. Also, a positionat the Commerce Department rarely
commanded the same prestige as a comparable one at the State
Department, and foreign service officers believed that promotion
came more quickly to those who focused on traditional foreign
policy concerns than to those who specialized <BR>
in economics.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Trade policy has gained prominence since the end of the Cold War,
owing in part to the growing importance of the international
sector for U.S. prosperity. In 1994, the growth in exports
provided a third of the growth in GDP, and exports supported 11
million jobs. The Commerce Department estimates that by 2000,
exports will support 16 million jobs. And those are good jobs:
one study showed that employment in the export sector in
1988-1995 paid 13 percent more than the average wage.<p>
<IMG SRC="ch05gr1.gif">
<P>Many members of the Bush administration recognized the importance
of this phenomenon and attempted to reshape U.S. policy
accordingly--beefing up the Commerce Department's Foreign and
Commercial Service to promote U.S. exports, and encouraging the
formation of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
to link the U.S. economy more closely with the dynamic economies
of Asia. But these attempts were often hamstrung by internal
disputes over the proper role of government in such efforts.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Clinton administration brought an unprecedented focus on
international trade policy as an instrument to promote U.S.
economic interests. The administration pushed through Congress
both the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the
Uruguay Round GATT accord, which established the World Trade
Organization (WTO). These two agreements were the centerpiece of
the administration's strategy for lowering the cost to U.S.
consumers of imports while increasing U.S. jobs by expanding
markets for U.S. goods. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the same time, the administration made sweeping changes in the
way government works with business to increase U.S. exports. The
Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, which is chaired by the
Secretary of Commerce and includes all the U.S. government
agencies involved in trade, formulated a National Export Strategy
to help American business compete and win overseas. The Commerce
Department created an Advocacy Center to track large foreign
infrastructure projects and assist U.S. exporters facing logjams;
for example, the center helped AT&amp;T win a $4 billion contract
to modernize Saudi Arabia's telecommunications system. The
Commerce Department has also targeted more than a dozen large,
emerging markets--China, Brazil, South Africa, and others--the
better to focus government export promotion activities. U.S.
government financial assistance to exports--including feasibility
studies, export credits, and aid related to exports--has amounted
to $19 billion per annum in the mid-1990s. Although in 1995
Congress, led by the Republican majority, considered abolishing
the Department of Commerce, it supported continuing the
government's trade promotion activities, though the exact
organizational structure for doing so remains unclear.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To mesh its economic efforts with traditional policy concerns,
the Clinton administration created the National Economic Council
(NEC), a White House-based coordinating group equivalent to the
National Security Council (NSC). With powerful leaders and many
staff members holding joint NEC/NSC positions, the new council
has helped broker economic and foreign policy interests. However,
balancing trade priorities with other foreign policy concerns has
proven difficult. One issue has been whether MFN status--that is,
access to the U.S. market on normal terms--should be made
conditional on progress in human rights, most especially for
China. An example more closely related to security issues is to
what extent U.S.-Japan trade differences can and should be
isolated from the bilateral security relationship. In early 1995,
as the USTR implemented a get-tough policy with Japan, the
Defense Department released its annual report on U.S. security
interests in Asia. While the report did little more than restate
the U.S. commitment to Asia's defense, Tokyo interpreted the
timing of its release and its formulation of the grounds for U.S.
troop strength in Asia as signals that U.S. trade concerns
remained separate from, if not necessarily subordinate to,
military and diplomatic interests.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The use of regional trade agreements as a policy instrument has a
side effect on security interests, because such agreements may
implicitly link integration with the U.S. economy to security
commitments by Washington. For example, Washington has always
demonstrated a profound interest in the political and economic
stability of Mexico. By further integrating the U.S. and Mexican
economies, NAFTA deepened Washington's sense of responsibility
for developments in Mexico, making the Clinton administration's
move to bail out the crumbling peso practically inevitable.
Similarly, in discussions with Asian nations regarding APEC,
Washington has explicitly linked access to the rapidly growing
Asian markets with a continued commitment to Asian security.
Implicit in this is the suggestion that free trade in the Pacific
rim will anchor U.S. interests in Asia and maintain the U.S.
security umbrella over the region.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Trade policy will likely serve increasingly as an instrument of
U.S. power. However, while at times trade policy can advance
foreign-and security-policy interests, trade issues can also
complicate those interests. The challenge ahead is to forge a
workable balance between these various interests.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One aspect of trade policy has been controls on high-technology
exports with potential for military use. Such controls are
discussed in the chapter on Arms Control. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="ch05box1.gif"><p>
<a name="subhead3"><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Financial and Macroeconomic Policy
</H3></a><p><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Among the economic instruments for affecting foreign governments,
by far the bluntest are financial and macroeconomic tools:
intervention in exchange rate markets, controls over loans and
investment (into or out of the U.S.), interest rate changes, and
tax and government expenditure policy. During the Cold War, these
instruments were used in part to deny resources to the communist
world (e.g., strict limits on loans to the USSR) and in part to
push allies (e.g., financial leverage over Great Britain and
France to cut short their 1956 invasion of Egypt during the Suez
Canal nationalization crisis). However, the main Cold War use of
financial and macroeconomic instruments was to preserve the unity
and promote the joint prosperity of the Western alliance, for
instance by running large budget deficits during the 1974-75
oil-price recession to provide an engine for Western economic
growth.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Changing Circumstances. In the increasingly interdependent world
of the 1990s, any attempt to use financial and macroeconomic
instruments to influence a foreign government is fraught with
risk. Indeed, many economists are sceptical about the ability of
macroeconomic and financial policies to achieve economic goals,
much less foreign policy aims. Four reasons may be mentioned.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<IMG SRC="ch05gr2.gif" align="left">
Purely national economies no longer exist, if they ever did.
Policymakers are constrained by globalization, which has changed
financial markets, at least, into truly international markets.
Thus, raising short-term interest rates, imposing capital
controls, and coordinating monetary policy with other countries
prove less effective than they once did because of greater
capital mobility and the ability of traders to circumvent
national economic regulations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* International capital flows have become vastly larger than
government resources available to defend currencies. This has
greatly weakened the ability to use what was once among the most
powerful of international financial instruments, namely, the
exchange rate. Whereas during the sterling crises of the 1960s
the British government could mobilize reserves equal to several
weeks (or, in some cases, several months) worth of trading on
international currency markets, the volumes those markets now
handle daily exceed the reserves of all countries combined. In
1994, the world's foreign exchange markets handled an estimated
one trillion dollars each business day. In the face of such
volume, coordinated actions by the G7 countries can be only
symbolic, a signal of the intent to change monetary policy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Since the late 1970s, the trend has been toward the idea that
governments should create a predictable environment within which
economic decisions can be made, without getting involved in
fine-tuning the economy, which had been popular during the heyday
of Keynesian economics in the 1960s and early 1970s. Governments
are less willing to use tax and expenditure policies, which were
once seen as central instruments to affect both domestic and
world economies. Declining confidence in the government's ability
to manage productive assets has only reinforced this trend. In
many countries, privatization has replaced nationalization as the
trend of the day. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The size of the U.S. budget and trade deficits places tight
constraints on international economic policy. The Federal Reserve
has to retain interest rates high enough to finance these
deficits, which limits its ability to stimulate the economy with
lower rates as some domestic critics would want. In its interest
rate policy, the Federal Reserve also has to be concerned about
the exchange rate of the dollar for foreign currencies (the lower
the interest rates in the U.S., the more attractive to take money
abroad, which reduces the value of the U.S. dollar). Besides its
effects on capital flows, the exchange rate also affects trade:
the lower the value of the dollar is relative to other
currencies, the cheaper are U.S. exports and the more expensive
to U.S. consumers are imports. When the value of the dollar
drops, that can exacerbate tensions with Japan (which worries
that its products will no longer be competitive) and with Europe
(which worries that capital flows will disrupt the EU's
Exchange-Rate Mechanism).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<IMG SRC="ch0501.gif"><p>
World leaders at the 1995 G7 Summit, Halifax, Canada<p>Consequences of Change. That macroeconomic policy
coordination among the G7 nations is difficult, and speculators
can circumvent exchange-rate agreements, does not mean that
cooperation among the advanced industrial countries will be
abandoned. Macroeconomic coordination, even if only as meetings
to air concerns, offers a means to promote openness and reduce
the potential that countries will retreat into economic blocs.
Such economic blocs might be less inclined to pursue common
interests and more inclined to practice beggar-thy-neighbor
policies, such as competitive devaluations, that undermine global
economic prosperity and drive interstate tension. The formation
of closed economic blocs centered around great powers could pose
a substantial threat not only to global prosperity but ultimately
to world peace.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is significant that macroeconomics, not national security, led
the heads of the Western powers to start meeting annually. While
the G7 meetings were initially limited to finance, they evolved
into a general consultation on foreign policy issues, such as how
to respond to developments in the former Eastern bloc and to
challenges from rogue states. In effect, the G7 summits became a
way to draw non-NATO Japan--and perhaps one day Russia--into a
common security dialogue.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead4">Foreign Aid</a></H3>
<p><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, foreign aid was often used to counter
potential Soviet influence by supporting governments friendly to
the United States, enticing nonaligned governments towards a
pro-Western stance, and ameliorating social conditions that could
feed radical anti-Western movements. Some funds went to countries
in which the U.S. maintained bases (principally the Philippines,
Portugal, Greece, and Turkey), and other funds assisted countries
facing communist insurgencies (such as El Salvador). In the
1990s, as the Soviet system has lost its appeal to developing
countries and the Soviet threat disappeared, foreign aid has
become an instrument to influence governments on a host of issues
from labor rights to environmental pollution.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Since the end of the Cold War, there has been strong public
pressure to cut spending on foreign aid, even though the aid
budget has been shrinking in real terms for twenty years. In
inflation-adjusted dollars, aid peaked in the early 1960s, at
about twice the 1995 level. As a share of GNP, aid in 1995 was
less than one-fourth its level of thirty years earlier.
<p>
<img src="ch05gr4.gif" align="left">One of the principal limitations on the effectiveness of foreign aid as
a policy instrument is that the goals set for it are overly
ambitious, which dissipates what could be more powerful influence
if it were more narrowly focused. The legislation that guides the
disbursement of foreign aid, the Foreign Assistance Act, is
burdened with thirty-three objectives and seventy-five priority
areas, which impedes USAID from rewarding governments that shift
policy in directions desired by the U.S. Furthermore, Congress
earmarks much of the aid, that is, directs how much is to be
spent in each country. While earmarking lets the elected
representatives rather than career officials decide how to spend
the taxpayers' money, it leaves little flexibility for USAID to
direct aid to good development and foreign-policy partners and

Foreign Policy Aid and Economic Development Aid. Foreign aid has
many components, which can be grouped for analytical purposes
into two categories. First is the foreign policy aid, consisting
primarily of military aid and cash payments to foreign
governments (more or less equal to the budget category called
Economic Support Funds, ESF). Second is development aid, which
consists of food aid (PL 480), disaster relief, projects like
roads and schools built by USAID, U.S. contributions to
international aid institutions, and a variety of smaller
programs, such as the Peace Corps. While USAID is the principal
foreign aid agency, it is responsible for administering only
about one-third of the U.S. foreign assistance funds, and the
allocation of its funds is decided in an inter-agency process in
which general foreign policy interests weigh heavily. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<IMG SRC="ch05gr3.gif" ALIGN="left">Since the end of the Cold War, Israel and Egypt have
gotten most of the foreign policy aid. Between them, they receive
$5 billion a year (including $3.1 billion in military aid), a
level set by the 1978 Camp David peace accord between the two
countries. (Inflation has cut the value of this assistance by a
third since then.) The governments of Egypt and Israel see the
aid as part of a U.S. commitment to their respective security, an
absolute precondition for the peace between Cairo and Jerusalem.
The aid has also helped cement close cooperation on a wide range
of issues, including facilities and logistical assistance for the
U.S. military.<p>
<img src="ch05gr4.gif" align="left">In 1995, for all countries other than Israel and Egypt,
less than $100 million was allocated for military aid grants,
while $365 million was allocated for ESF. Foreign policy aid has
been particularly hard hit by the decline in aid since the
mid-1980s. At FY 1996 prices, foreign policy aid averaged $4.5
billion in 1986-88, $3.5 billion the three years after that
(1989-1991), and then fell steeply to an average of less than $.5
billion in 1993-95.
<P>
In contrast to the decline in foreign policy aid, economic
development has not been as hard hit. Economic development
aid--which includes contributions to multilateral organizations,
food aid, and direct U.S. aid programs--was relatively stable
from 1986 thru 1994, at constant 1996 prices. The annual average
for those nine years was $7.3 billion (at 1996 prices), and most
years saw a slight growth compared to the year earlier. However
in 1996, economic development aid was substantially below the
average for the previous decade..
<P>
<img src="ch05gr5.gif" align="left">In other words, the reduction in the total aid budget in the late
1980s and early 1990s came entirely out of the foreign policy
aid, while economic development aid stayed relatively constant.
In 1986, the foreign policy aid was twice the size of the
economic development aid. To be sure, much of the foreign policy
aid went to Israel and Egypt; setting that aside, the foreign
policy aid was still three-fourths the size of the economic
development aid. In 1995, the foreign policy aid was less than
the economic development aid; indeed, without aid to Israel and
Egypt, the foreign policy aid was 5 percent the size of the
economic development aid.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Economic development aid, the traditional focus of interest among
aid personnel, is said to serve U.S. interests through job
creation programs that reduce the pool of alienated youth who
could be attracted to radical anti-Western ideologies; family
planning and environmental protection programs that ameliorate
pressures on the world's resources; and economic development that
diminishes the risk of ethnic strife and the collapse of states
(which can create humanitarian disasters so massive that the
United States intervenes). Two such interventions--Somalia and
Rwanda--cost more than Washington spent on development assistance
to all of sub-Saharan Africa between 1992 and 1995.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<IMG SRC="ch05gr6.gif" ALIGN="left">Development assistance has become a less potent
instrument of U.S. influence as the proportion of aid dispensed
by Washington has declined relative to that of other donors. In
1970-71, the United States provided 40 percent of the world's
official development assistance as defined by international
agencies (which exclude military aid from their data). In 1993,
the U.S. supplied 16 percent. Not only had Japan become by 1993
the world's largest donor in absolute terms, but Japanese aid to
Latin America--an area of traditional U.S. interest--exceeded
U.S. aid in that region.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Overall, foreign aid's importance as a source of
development financing is shrinking in a world with more open
economies and better information about opportunities in
developing nations. Countries with sound policies attract private
foreign capital that dwarfs available foreign aid. In 1994,
private capital flows to developing nations totaled $173
billion--about three times the level of official aid.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<IMG SRC="ch05gr7.gif" ALIGN="left"><i>Organizational Issues.</i> Debate arose in 1995 about
the best organizational structure through which to deliver
foreign aid. USAID has been actively cutting its costs. In 1995,
USAID closed twenty-one overseas missions and reduced its staff
by 1,200 personnel (about 30 percent), partly in response to the
criticism that, per dollar of aid distributed, it maintained ten
times as many employees abroad as did its British counterpart.
Proposals have been made to consolidate USAID with the State
Department, which might cut costs but could also reduce the
visibility of aid and subordinate development to other foreign
policy objectives. Other proposals suggest increasing the
responsibility of private voluntary organizations, which already
distribute about 30 percent of project funds. However, such plans
would not resolve the problem of extensive congressional mandates
that establish so many priorities that the impact of aid is
diffused, weakening its effectiveness.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In light of the tight resource situation, U.S. policymakers are
using innovative means to mobilize funds. Long-established
institutions are being tapped for new purposes; witness the use
of $20 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund to finance
the U.S. part of the package to avert a Mexican financial crisis
in 1995 (other industrial countries provided $10 billion; the
IMF, $8 billion; and commercial banks, $3 billion). Another
method of leveraging U.S. money that may be used more in the
future is to form international consortia to finance foreign
policy initiatives. In 1994-95, the U.S. negotiated an agreement
in principle with North Korea for the construction of a nuclear
power plant in that country in return for Pyongyang's taking a
variety of non-proliferation steps. The cost of that nuclear
power plant may be $4 billion to $5 billion, depending upon what
associated facilities are also provided and on what restrictions
the North Koreans put on the construction process. Little of that
money will come from the U.S., which persuaded South Korea and
Japan to bear 90 percent of the cost. An international
organization, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO), was set up to carry out the project. While
the U.S. role in resolving this issue and in KEDO might seem
disproportionate based on the money the U.S. is contributing,
Washington's voice on the matter reflects the U.S.'s nuclear
umbrella over Japan and South Korea and its 37,000 troops in
South Korea. 
<p>
In addition to administering foreign aid directly, Washington
provides about $2 billion a year for international aid agencies.
Most of this money represents the U.S. share in international
financial institutions (IFIs), such as the World Bank, the Inter-
American Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. The
United States is the largest shareholder, or among the largest,
in every IFI. 
<P>
<img src="ch05box1.gif"><p>While Washington alone cannot determine policy in any IFI, it has
a strong voice in all of them, which it uses to advocate economic
policies that advance U.S. policy interests. For instance, when
the collapse of the Mexican peso in late 1994 led to worries
about social unrest in that country and about a contagion effect
(frightened foreign investors withdrawing funds from otherwise
healthy economies) on many smaller developing and ex-communist
countries, the IMF stepped in with $18 billion, allowing the U.S.
to share the burden of rescuing the Mexican government. In the
former Soviet Union, the World Bank and the IMF distributed about
$10 billion in loans in 1991-95, dwarfing U.S. aid efforts.
Worldwide, the IFIs lend about $60 billion a year, with the World
Bank group lending about $40 billion a year, the regional
development banks about $10 billion, and the IMF another $10
billion (although IMF lending fluctuates sharply, rising when
recession threatens and falling when business booms). That makes
these institutions the largest sources of official funds to the
developing world. However, most of these funds are provided at
market interest rates, while most bilateral aid, including nearly
all USAID projects, are grants.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In many countries that borrow from them, the IMF and World Bank
have encountered strong criticism for infringing on national
sovereignty, for imposing harsh burdens on the poor, and for
insisting on doctrinaire conservative free-market policies. The
two institutions have acquired a negative reputation among
nationalists, especially in Africa and the former Soviet Union.
The IMF and World Bank response is that they are asked in when
times have turned tough, so it is hardly surprising that they
must prescribe bitter medicine, and that only such medicine will
cure the patient. The U.S. government is of two minds about the
strong measures that the IMF in particular prefers. On the one
hand, necessary as it may be for the medium term, shock
adjustment may cause social instability that undermines a
friendly government. On the other hand, to the extent that the
government concerned needs to be pressured into taking reform
steps it resists, then it is in Washington's interests to have
the bad news brought by the IMF rather than by U.S.
representatives.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One indicator of the usefulness of the IFIs in the post-Cold War
period is the pressure to set up additional such institutions.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),
established in 1990, has helped consolidate the transition from
communism by financing privatization and private sector firms.
The Middle East Bank, formation of which was announced in
November 1995, will facilitate roads and other infrastructure
(e.g., telephone systems) that might strengthen the Arab-Israeli
peace process, for example, by improving conditions of the West
Bank and Gaza.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the IFIs have been important instruments for advancing U.S.
economic development goals, such as the promotion of free
markets, they have not been as useful for Washington in bringing
pressure to bear on regimes unfriendly to the West. Other IFI
shareholders have vigorously resisted U.S. efforts to have the
IFIs consider non-economic foreign policy concerns when
disbursing loans, exhibited in Washington's attempts to block
loans to countries that abuse human rights or support terrorism.
The United States has, however, often persuaded the IFIs not to
lend to rogue states because of their poor economic records. For
example, Syria is over $300 million in arrears to the World Bank,
and the World Bank is not considering new loans to Iran.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In conclusion, the effectiveness of aid as a tool of U.S.
national power has been undermined by a lack of focus, by goals
that are too numerous for the resources provided. The political
climate in the U.S. suggests that funding for aid will be cut and
restrictions on its use will be increased. More use will be made
of alternative techniques to mobilize funds for foreign policy
initiatives, such as relying on international financial
institutions or specially formed international consortia, as in
the case of the power plant for North Korea.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">Sanctions</a></H3>
<p><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The term "economic sanctions" can refer broadly to the
curtailment of any customary trade or financial relation, or
narrowly to measures against states that have violated
obligations under international agreements. This chapter
discusses broad bans on trade or finance. The chapter on arms
control considers denial of military and dual-use technology,
while the chapter on limited military intervention discusses the
enforcement of sanctions with military measures, such as a naval
blockade.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modern interest in sanctions focuses on them as an
alternative to war. While the U.N. Charter envisaged sanctions as
a major instrument of the Security Council, the Cold War
prevented agreement among the council's five permanent members in
the face of most threats to peace. A trade ban was imposed on
Rhodesia in 1965 (after the white residents declared independence
from Britain), and more limited bans (particularly on arms) were
used in a few other cases. In addition to these international
sanctions, the United States imposed its own trade bans on
several communist countries, including North Korea, China, Cuba,
and Vietnam. In 1986, the U.S. Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act
banned new investments and trade with South Africa in a number of
goods; in 1988, the U.S. forbade financial transactions with the
Panamanian regime of Manuel Noriega.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the post-Cold War era, internationally mandated sanctions have
become a more common instrument, in part because the permanent
Security Council members can agree more readily on their use. In
1990-95, the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq, Libya, the
successors to the former Yugoslavia, and Haiti, all but the
latter two of which were still in place in late 1995. The
sanctions on the former Yugoslavia were suspended by Security
Council Resolution 1022 in November 1995. They would be
reimposed, without action by the U.N. Security Council, if either
the Commander of IFOR (the NATO-led force) or the civilian High
Representative (chosen by the OSCE) informed the Council that
Serb authorities are significantly failing to meet their
obligations under the peace accord. Beyond the U.N.-mandated
sanctions, the United States in late 1995 had comprehensive
sanctions on Cuba and Iran, as well as partial trade bans on the
areas of Angola held by UNITA rebels and, despite the early 1995
easing in relations, on North Korea.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch05box2.gif"><p>Sanctions' record of success depends upon what they are expected
to accomplish. They have been least successful at promoting the
fall of regimes or the overthrow of dictators, in part because
the elites who could engineer a coup are well insulated from the
hardship that sanctions create. Sanctions have also had little
success in changing governments' fundamental policies--with some
obvious exceptions, such as the end of South African apartheid.
More likely, sanctions can persuade governments to change
policies to which they are not firmly committed, or which are
peripheral to their basic interests. For example, the mid-1980s
sanctions of certain Japanese firms for selling militarily useful
technology to the USSR encouraged the Japanese government to
tighten its controls over dual-use exports. Sanctions can also
tip the balance when a government is only considering changing
its policies, as occurred in 1995 when the hope of securing an
easing of sanctions certainly contributed to the reduction in the
Serbian government's support for the Bosnian Serbs and its strong
pressure on them to agree to the peace accord negotiated in
Dayton, Ohio in late 1995.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition, sanctions have often weakened a target government's
ability to carry out aggressive plans, by depriving it of
resources.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to a widely cited 1990 Institute for International
Economics study by Gary Hufbauer, Jeffrey Schott, and Kimberly
Elliott--Economic Sanctions Reconsidered--sanctions achieve
greater success in modifying the target country's behavior when
their goals are relatively modest, the target is much weaker than
the countries imposing sanctions, the target and the nations
imposing sanctions conduct significant trade, sanctions are
imposed quickly without time for adjustment, and the sanctioning
countries avoid high costs to themselves. To this list can be
added: that the effectiveness of sanctions increases when the
nations imposing them can sustain them for as long as necessary
and are willing to use military force to enforce them.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<IMG SRC="ch05box3.gif"><p>While
they may influence governments, sanctions inflict collateral
damage on vulnerable civilians. This problem is exacerbated when
the target government cares little about the well-being of its
people, or will even use their suffering to pry concessions from
countries imposing the sanctions. Another shortcoming of
sanctions is the cost to the U.S. economy. Unilateral U.S. trade
bans may shift business to other countries, though the target
country will still probably sustain some losses. The issue is
whether the economic loss for the United States is a reasonable
price to pay for the damage inflicted on the target. For example,
the 1995 ban on dealing with Iran forced the U.S. firm Conoco to
cancel an oil investment. Iran renegotiated the deal with the
French firm Total on less attractive terms, meaning less revenue
for Tehran, which may therefore have to postpone arms purchases
during lack of cash.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As noted, in the immediate post-Cold War period, cooperation
among the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council
facilitated passage of sanctions resolutions. In 1994 and 1995,
however, disagreements grew among the permanent five over several
of the sanctions it had imposed. For example, the U.S. Congress
voted to unilaterally lift the restrictions on arms to Bosnia,
the Russian Duma voted to lift trade restrictions on Serbia, and
the French and Russian governments expressed unease over the
conditions they thought Washington tied to lifting export
restrictions on Iraq. In light of the growing differences over
existing sanctions, it may become more difficult for the Security
Council to approve new ones.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite their mixed record, sanctions will remain a popular
policy instrument. Their benefit-to-cost ratio usually compares
favorably to those of other policies, and they are often seen as
more appropriate than the alternatives: military action or
diplomatic protest. Sanctions can also signal U.S. displeasure,
cautioning that Washington may take additional steps.
Furthermore, they warn other nations of the price they will pay
for future misbehavior.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, sanctions can also provide an excuse for inaction. They
may placate public demands for action when Washington wants to
evade responsibility, and thus they may fail to convey a firm
message to the target country, which may see the imposition of
sanctions as an indication that stronger measures are unlikely.
If that is the case, sanctions can weaken U.S. influence.
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead6">Conclusion</a></H2>
<p><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Economic policy will continue to grow in importance as the world
becomes more economically integrated. The greater the growth in
international trade and financial flows, the greater the role the
U.S. economy will play in international economic developments.
Unlike the Cold War world of ideological conflict, in which
traditional security concerns dominated policymakers' thinking,
governments now emphasize the pursuit of material prosperity.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nevertheless, the increasing prominence of economic issues does
not necessarily translate into a greater ability to use economic
instruments of U.S. power. Economic instruments are often blunt
in two senses. First, like a blunt instrument, they work only if
swung hard, in which case they can inflict so much damage that
they can be destructive. For instance, sanctions are most
effective when they are universal, applied by all countries and
affecting all trade--but in that case, the sanctions inflict
considerable suffering on the innocent civilian population.
Another example is the use of economic pressure on an ally with
which the U.S. maintains a close security relationship, such as
Japan. The difficult task is how to achieve the U.S. economic
goals without damaging the security relationship.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Economic instruments are blunt also in the sense that they are
not sharp, that is, they are not especially effective. Foreign
aid has a mixed record at achieving general foreign policy goals;
for instance, the assistance to Russia has done little if
anything to improve U.S.-Russian political and security
relationships. And foreign aid is becoming a less powerful
instrument as budget pressures reduce the funds available. As for
economic sanctions, despite specific successes, such as South
Africa, and Serbia, the general rule remains that governments are
unlikely to change their policies in response to sanctions; the
best sanctions can usually do is reduce the target government's
income, which may hinder its ability to carry out plans that
would damage U.S. interests.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most powerful economic instruments that the U.S. government
wields are those that shape the behavior of the private sector.
Rather than spending taxpayer resources, Washington can often
affect the economies of other nations more efficiently by
offering guidance to the private sector about overseas political
risks, and by establishing the framework and incentives to
promote private trade and investment overseas. The recognition
that the private sector is crucial to international economic
relations may in part underlie the declining importance of
budget-based instruments such as foreign aid and the growing
emphasis on trade policy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The activities of the intelligence community range from providing
the President with timely and accurate information (especially
during crises) to monitoring its customary array of targets; and
from forecasting new problem areas to undertaking covert actions
when traditional instruments of policy are deemed unsuitable or
have proven ineffective. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prior to World War II, the United States lacked a significant
intelligence capacity, as that term is understood today; such a
capacity--both military and civilian--developed during the war.
Then, with the advent of the Cold War came the creation of a new,
permanent intelligence infrastructure. The National Security Act
of 1947 established the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), headed
by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), who was given the
responsibility of coordinating all the agencies of the national
intelligence community. In the mid-1990s, these agencies include
the National Security Agency (NSA), the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA), the individual military service intelligence
agencies, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and
Research, the counterintelligence unit of the FBI, and the
offices--including the National Intelligence Council--that
support the DCI, who has direct administrative control over the
Community Management Staff and the CIA. In all, some thirteen
federal agencies, most embedded in cabinet departments, are part
of the intelligence community. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although the current budget and personnel size of the
intelligence community are classified, both budgetary and
personnel figures are headed downward. Each agency is smaller in
the mid-1990s than it was in the late 1980s, and Congress has
mandated further cuts from what the press speculates was a $28
billion 1995 budget, so that levels by the year 2000 will be only
about 75 percent of 1985-89 levels. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the resources devoted to intelligence are shrinking, the
objects of interest to the intelligence community and the demands
for intelligence by decision makers are becoming more far-ranging
and diverse. With the end of the Cold War, the overriding threat
of the Soviet Union has been replaced by an increasing array of
smaller threats, each requiring attention from the intelligence
community. These threats were set forth as follows in the Clinton
administration's 1995 statement, A National Security Strategy of
Engagement and Enlargement:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because national security has taken on a much broader
definition...intelligence must address a much wider range of
threats and dangers. [It] will continue to monitor military and
technical threats, to guide long-term force development and
weapons acquisition, and to directly support military operations.
Intelligence will also be critical for directing new efforts
against regional conflicts, proliferation of WMD,
counterintelligence, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking. In
order to adequately forecast dangers to democracy and U.S.
economic well-being, the intelligence community must track
political, economic, social, and military developments in those
parts of the world where U.S. interests are most heavily engaged
and where overt collection of information from open sources is
inadequate. Finally, to enhance the study and support of
worldwide environmental, humanitarian, and disaster relief
activities, technical intelligence assets (principally imagery)
must be directed to a greater degree towards the collection of
data on these subjects. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thus, the post-Cold War world poses unprecedented challenges for
the U.S. intelligence community: it must function effectively,
against a broad range of threats, in an environment of
unparalleled openness and oversight, but with dwindling
resources.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As of late-1995, three major studies of the U.S. intelligence
community were underway--the first by the Aspin Commission,
headed by former Defense Secretary Harold Brown. This commission
was charged with reviewing the efficacy and appropriateness of
community activities, including, among other issues, the
community's roles and missions in providing support to the
defense and foreign policy establishments; whether the
community's roles and missions should extend beyond these
traditional areas of support; whether the existing organizational
and management framework of the community provides the optimal
structure for executing the missions; whether existing principles
and strategies concerning collection capabilities should be
retained; whether intelligence analysis as structured and
executed adds sufficient value to information already available
to the government to justify its continuation; whether there is
significant waste or duplication; and whether counterintelligence
policies and practices are adequate to ensure necessary security.
The report of this commission is due in March 1996.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second review is being conducted by the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence, the oversight committee that
deals with the broad range of intelligence issues for the House.
This report is scheduled for completion in January 1996, two
months in advance of the Aspin report. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The third study, organized by The Twentieth Century Fund, is
being done by a bipartisan panel of distinguished former State
and Defense Department officials, senior intelligence officers,
and members of Congress who have joined the private sector. The
focus of the commission is an examination of the relevance of the
National Security Act of 1947 in light of post-Cold War
circumstances; the nature of the threat facing the U.S.
intelligence community after the Cold War; the strategic role of
intelligence in a time of growing openness; and the question of
whether the proposed organizational reforms go far enough to
ensure that the nation's intelligence capabilities are going to
be effective in the world of the next century. The report of this
commission is to be ready by June 1996.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Strictly speaking, the analytical side of intelligence is not an
instrument of policy but serves as a support for policy. Unlike
diplomacy or military force, intelligence analysis does not
directly influence the behavior of foreign states or entities.
Instead, its practitioners work intimately with the practitioners
of persuasion and coercion who are striving to achieve such
influence. Strategic intelligence services provide national
security decision makers with the following:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Early warning of war and other developments that could
threaten core U.S. interests, especially when such developments
occur in countries restricting the access of U.S. diplomats and
journalists.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> On-going information about foreign countries' compliance
with arms control and other international treaties. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<li> Support for negotiators. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given the multiple roles of intelligence, its instruments fall
into four categories. One--collection--prepares the intelligence
community to support policy makers and military commanders.
One--analysis and reporting--is the act of providing such
support. One--counterintelligence--supports U.S. personnel and
agencies by protecting them from the harmful efforts of foreign
intelligence agencies and other hostile groups. One--covert
action--subsumes any instrument of influence when it is wielded
in such a way as to keep secret the role of the U.S. or at least
to provide U.S. leaders with plausible deniability.

</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The term "collection" embraces the multiple means of gathering
intelligence information. Human intelligence (HUMINT), the oldest
type of collection, derives from operatives in the field. The
Directorate of Operations within the CIA is principally
responsible for clandestine HUMINT collection; DIA, the State
Department, and the military services also contribute extensively
to HUMINT. Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is the collection and
processing of foreign communications, noncommunications
electromagnetic radiations, and foreign instrumentation signals.
SIGINT is the domain of NSA. Photography, infrared sensors,
lasers, electro-optics, and synthetic aperture radar produce
imagery intelligence (IMINT). CIA and the Department of Defense
(DOD) share imagery tasking and exploitation, although the actual
launch and maintenance of satellites has been handled by the
National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Lastly, measurement and
signature intelligence (MASINT) comprises intelligence obtained
by analyzing the distinctive features of a source, emitter, or
sender utilizing acoustic, seismic, particle, multispectral, or
other data associated with it. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the Cold War developed, U.S. intelligence became increasingly
proficient in the development and deployment of collection
systems using advanced technology--SIGINT, IMINT, and MASINT.
HUMINT achieved some spectacular successes, but these were offset
by the USSR's penetration of a number of Western intelligence
agencies and the subsequent compromise of valuable assets. For
example, it has recently come to light that most of the Cubans
whom the CIA recruited during the Cold War were actually double
agents working for Cuban intelligence. Similarly, Aldrich Ames's
disclosure of the names of assets providing intelligence to CIA
led to the death of a number of individuals at the hands of the
Soviets. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Collection and New Technologies.</i> A profound question for
the
future of U.S. intelligence is the degree to which
technology-based collection systems will retain their
effectiveness. Several developments cast a long shadow of doubt:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Target countries and entities increasingly implement
countermeasures as they become more knowledgeable about the
capabilities (and limitations) of U.S. intelligence systems. For
example, to preclude the collection of intelligence from space,
many countries calculate when satellites are over their
territories, and at those times curtail or enshroud activities
that they wish to hide.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Advances in telecommunications and information systems, and the
growing prevalence of sophisticated commercial encryption
technologies, complicate the collection of data from
communications and computer networks. The essence of the basic
algorithms for encrypting messages beyond what all but the most
powerful computers can break can be obtained from the Internet.
Using such publicly posted algorithms as "Pretty Good Privacy,"
even strangers can exchange traffic secure in the knowledge that
their transmissions cannot be interpreted without extraordinary
effort.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The sheer cost of upgrading and maintaining space-based
collection systems constitutes an obstacle in light of
diminishing intelligence budgets. The press speculates that the
U.S. is spending billions of dollars to upgrade its intelligence
satellites.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Collection and New Targets. A still more telling question for the
intelligence community is the degree to which it can adapt to new
targets. From the outset of the Cold War until after the break-up
of the Soviet Union, intelligence resources and manpower were
focused heavily on the Soviet Union and its spheres of influence.
Over the course of forty-five years, the intelligence community
built an extensive data base on the activities of the Soviet
Union's military, economic, civilian and military leadership, and
relations with foreign governments. Analysts watched the other
Warsaw Pact countries as well, noting, for example, how they
performed during military exercises. In the developing regions of
Africa, Asia, South America, and the Middle East, Soviet client
states received some attention, and the intelligence community
also analyzed Soviet influence in nonaligned countries where
conditions appeared ripe for an increased Soviet presence and the
replacement of regimes committed to neutrality by leaderships
actively hostile to the United States. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other major Cold War intelligence targets included the People's
Republic of China, North Korea, and Cuba--both because of their
ties to the Soviet Union and because of the threat they posed to
U.S. interests in their regions. Areas of instability such as the
Middle East, Africa, and Latin America received periodic surges
of attention in response to regional conflicts. Lastly, the
intelligence community devoted resources to economic and
political developments in countries where the United States had
considerable interests, including many outside the Soviet bloc
for which open sources were inadequate. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question has arisen whether the sources and methods of
collection cultivated during the Cold War can be translated to
the collection challenges of the post-Cold War era. For example,
the intelligence community developed unequalled expertise in
counting and tracking nuclear weapons, but monitoring the
dismantlement of such weapons and the disposal of fissionable
materials presents some different problems. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shifts in the realm of political analysis also lie ahead. During
the Cold War, intelligence agencies developed a keen sense of how
communist systems functioned. In contrast, the challenge for
political analysts in the post-Cold War world is to discover what
factors may strengthen democratic political forces in
post-communist societies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the area of economic intelligence, the methods used to develop
human sources and elicit information about the economic
weaknesses of socialist systems and Cold War adversaries have
little relevance to post-Cold War challenges. The acquisition of
information about commercial practices and transactions, and the
expertise to interpret financial and business data, require
different sources and skills. The personnel most knowledgeable
about these subjects are also sought by the private sector,
against whose salaries government cannot compete. Furthermore, a
host of ethical and methodological questions has arisen over the
possibility of the intelligence community's sharing its
information with U.S. business--aiding them, for example, in
their pursuit of a level playing field in international commerce.
Former DCI R. James Woolsey said clearly as he was stepping down
from his position in early 1995  "We are not in the business of
spying for private firms." Thus far, the policy remains
unchanged. But the intelligence community sometimes does pass
U.S. firms information about illicit activities taken against
them by foreign companies and governments. Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown stated that in 1994 "the intelligence community detected
foreign firms using bribery to undercut U.S. firms' efforts to
win international contracts worth $45 billion" and that in almost
every case, the U.S. government informed the U.S. firm about the
bribery attempt.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Intelligence Community Structure</b>
<img src="ch06gr01.gif"><p>
Other new targets--such as international terrorism, crime, and
drug trafficking--present their own problems. For instance,
counterterrorism operations seek to prevent terrorist acts. Yet
taking preemptive action usually entails revealing that the U.S.
government was in a position to know of a terrorist
organization's plans, which in turn jeopardizes intelligence
sources and methods. Intelligence professionals must work closely
with law enforcement officials to ensure that these sources and
methods are not compromised in the process of providing foreign
intelligence to the law enforcement community. The same holds
true for counternarcotics operations. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Environmental monitoring is another new target. Vice President Al
Gore led an effort to make available hundreds of thousands of
reconnaissance satellite images. Some 800,000 declassified images
processed by the National Reconnaissance Office between 1960 and
1972, released in February 1995, are available on the Internet.
Similarly, both France and Russia are offering satellite imagery
for sale to commercial and other customers, a practice likely to
spread. Environmental targets are becoming part of the tasking of
imagery satellites. But intelligence personnel who interpret such
images may find that expertise in identifying the signatures of
Soviet military forces does not necessarily translate into a
facility for addressing environmental issues. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some new targets seem to fit a traditional mold yet actually
differ drastically. For example, the intelligence community
traditionally supported U.S. intervention operations by providing
early warning of volatile situations. But this role is greatly
complicated to the extent that the issues driving U.S. foreign
policy are unclear. As Les Aspin, the late chairman of the
Commission on Roles and Capabilities of the U.S. intelligence
community, noted, "Using the military to protect our values
overseas...drives the intelligence community crazy because there
is no way to anticipate where values issues might crop up next." 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another example is the use of satellite photos to detect a new
kind of suspicious military activity, namely, war crimes, as in
Bosnia. Such use creates great pressure to reveal photo data,
which the U.S. has traditionally been extremely reluctant to do.
Indeed, after revealing evidence of mass graves dug by Bosnian
Serb forces, the U.S. was not willing to provide all of its
intelligence on the subject to the international tribunal judging
war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img src="ch0605.gif"><p><b>Overhead photo of
possible Serb war crimes site, displayed to the U.N. Security
Council</b><p>
While adaptation to these circumstances has been reasonably
successful, it has not been without problems. Most means of
collection--in particular, satellite imaging--were designed to
cover the Soviet Union. Within the constraints of physics,
satellites have been adapted through new technologies to cover
targets for which they were not originally designed. According to
John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists, the new 8X
satellite can take high resolution photos of 1,000 square miles
at a time, compared to 100 square miles for the KH-12 satellite
it is replacing; if so, the wider coverage should reduce this
problem. However, certain targets remain outside their range and
must be accessed by alternative collection means, sometimes with
the assistance of foreign partners who are unproven allies. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Open-Source Information. The opening up of the former Soviet
Union, combined with the information revolution, has provided a
wealth of unclassified data that was hitherto unavailable. The
explosion in open-source information creates yet another set of
conceptual challenges for intelligence analysis.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some experts estimate that more than 80 percent of the data used
by the intelligence community comes from open sources, and CIA
and NSA are probably the only U.S. government agencies that have
the technical capability to handle the vast quantities of
information available. Such volume puts enormous strains on the
systems designed to filter the intake and on the analysts who
must process what is left. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another effect of greatly increased open-source information is
the decreasing dependence on the intelligence community in some
segments of the national security community. CNN is available in
most operations centers and other government offices, as is
increasingly the Internet, to satisfy multiple information needs.
Some intelligence consumers prefer to probe their own sources and
private contacts--either academics or foreign counterparts or
colleagues whom they trust. One reason is that such information
does not necessarily come with the cumbersome restrictions on use
that accompany the output of the intelligence community. As a
result, the intelligence community will in the future have to
compete for customers as it never did when  much information
about the Soviet Union could be acquired only through sensitive
sources, and such competition will require that the community add
intelligence value to information it obtains from open sources. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These facts have led some to question the need for maintaining an
elaborate and expensive intelligence establishment at all. But
aside from the issue of information not available from public
sources, major distinctions still exist between information and
intelligence. Journalists--the primary purveyors of
information--generally describe what they have observed or have
been told, often without the time, experience, and expertise to
analyze or evaluate the implications of this information.
Intelligence, however, constitutes information from a variety of
sources that has been analyzed by specialists and tailored to the
specific needs of the user. Thus, it will remain true that some
key questions of policymakers and military commanders will be
answerable only by the intelligence community. And those who take
advantage of the community's capabilities will find that no media
organization, think tank, or academic research can match the
intelligence community for timeliness, responsiveness, and access
to otherwise unavailable information--particularly when analysts
understand their customers requirements.

</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For reasons of economy and security, national intelligence
agencies were dispersed during the Cold War. While most remain in
and around the Washington area, their geographic separation has
made it difficult to develop a closely knit group of experts who
could convene easily to deal with intelligence issues.
Fortunately, new technology makes virtual meetings using
audio-visual technology a reality. This also permits analysts
deployed in the field to interact more productively with their
Washington counterparts. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The intelligence community's principal analytical organizations
are the Directorate for Intelligence within the CIA, most of DIA,
and the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the State
Department. These agencies have produced some impressive results,
such as the analysis that sustained the Western effort to control
exports of sensitive technologies to communist countries during
the Cold War. But some post-Cold War concerns--for example,
crises requiring the deployment of U.S. forces for brief
periods--are short-lived, unlike the enduring concern over the
Soviet Union. Even though budgets are declining, the intelligence
community is still expected to produce timely and accurate
intelligence on these situations, some of them involving
countries about which little previous data has been developed. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Outside Expertise.</i> While information data bases can be
built up
over time and updated if resources allow, it is not
cost-effective or even possible to maintain a cadre of
specialists with the expertise to cover all possible
contingencies. Therefore, the community has occasionally had to
find ways to acquire the expertise it needs through
nontraditional means. A case in point is the use of Kuwaiti
students studying in the U.S. during the build-up to Desert
Storm, when the number of capable Arabic linguists in the U.S.
military and the intelligence community proved insufficient to
meet the demand. Similarly, it is occasionally necessary to call
upon the academic community for expertise that the intelligence
community lacks. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States' growing involvement in U.N. operations, and
Washington's commitment to provide intelligence to support allied
operations other than war, has led not only to greater sharing of
intelligence with foreign governments but also to increased
reliance on foreign expertise. The result so far is mixed. The
United States still contributes the preponderance of intelligence
to such operations; some coalition partners have been unwilling
to provide their input on other than a bilateral basis with the
United States. The storage and protection of intelligence
documents have been problematic, as exemplified in the Somali
operation by the discovery of classified material in an unguarded
U.N. area. Intelligence support for U.S. military forces deployed
in U.N. operations poses special problems. Deployments often
occur in regions where neither the United Nations nor the United
States has a complete picture of conditions on the ground. Such
situations increasingly require cooperation with the private
sector--private voluntary organizations (PVOs), for example--to
gather information about infrastructure, language, customs,
culture, and other subjects useful for humanitarian and peace
operations. Some PVOs have been traditionally reluctant, if not
averse, to cooperating with military forces or intelligence
organizations and only recently have warmed somewhat to these
interactions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Changes in Customer Support.</i> Within the intelligence
community,
major changes have occurred in customer support since the end of
the Cold War. However, these changes did not result from the
altered strategic environment as much as from the increased
integration of intelligence professionals into policy and
military staffs and from dramatic changes in technology. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By virtue of the changes in information technology, users of
intelligence information, from policymakers to military
commanders and their staffs, can retrieve some material directly
from community data bases. Rather than waiting for the results of
standing or special intelligence <BR>
requirements, customers can acquire tailored intelligence almost
as easily as they can access information from the Internet and
other unclassified data bases. In addition to established hard
copy intelligence publications, the Defense Intelligence Network
provides televised reports of intelligence-based news events to
senior levels in the Pentagon and the field. Intelink, the
intelligence professionals' Internet, provides access to an
expanding array of intelligence products and data bases and
represents a powerful new tool in their analytical kit.<p>

<hr>
But just as insufficient intelligence can pose a problem, too
much unfiltered information can also impede sound policy and
decision making. While technology also addresses this problem, it
remains the responsibility of the intelligence community,
particularly in a crisis, to deliver only the information needed
to make timely, sound decisions. For example, during the buildup
to the Gulf War, one of the earliest and most challenging
problems facing the intelligence community was limiting the
intelligence sent to Riyadh. Without pre-selection, customers
would have been overwhelmed by data and unable to pick useful
material out of the mass of information. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But no amount of technological advance will matter if customers
are unaware of the availability of intelligence, or choose not to
use it. While this is a timeless problem, it has acquired added
importance in the information age. In Desert Storm, one U.S.
division commander executing the "Hail Mary" to flank Iraqi
forces from the west was fully informed of Iraqi military
activities throughout the operation, while another, executing a
parallel mission, operated without such intelligence. The former
had experts who knew how to obtain and use the relevant
intelligence, something which the latter apparently lacked. Such
situations will prove increasingly detrimental to the performance
of coordinated operations in the future. To optimize
intelligence, therefore, policymakers and military commanders
must have experienced, well-trained intelligence officers and
should understand the basics of the intelligence community and
how it can serve their needs. Ideally, customers should also hold
periodic meetings with the intelligence officers who support
them. In such instances, the quality of intelligence support
increases immeasurably. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Support to Military Commanders.</i> While each military
service has
its own intelligence organization, U.S. planners have long
recognized the value of independently produced national
intelligence. Such intelligence can serve as a check on the work
of operational commanders' own intelligence units and add both
breadth and detail to the strategic picture. Moreover, though
military intelligence personnel may train for a wider range of
contingencies, the services concentrate on tactical intelligence
unique to their needs. They cannot devote sufficient resources to
develop expertise for all possible operations. And when the
expertise of their own intelligence agencies falls short,
military commanders will look to the broader intelligence
community to provide the required expertise.
<blockquote><P ALIGN="LEFT">
Those who use technical intelligence almost always do so with
preconceptions that they bring to the analytical process. There
is rarely disagreement over what a picture shows, for example,
but what it means is often the subject of intense debate. <p>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the past, however, some intelligence support to military
commanders has been inconsistent in quality, presented in a form
or at a time that made it difficult to use, pitched at so general
a level that it frustrated commanders making concrete decisions,
or provided from too many technical sources to offer a coherent
picture. "Good intelligence," DCI John Deutch noted in an address
to the 1995 graduating class at the National Defense University,
is "particularly important at a time when we have a smaller
military that is being asked to take on a wider number of
different challenges in remote and unfamiliar areas of the
world." But to make a difference, Deutch continued, the national
agencies "must be clearly focused on the needs of the
warfighter." Thus, intelligence collection and analysis
organizations must continue to provide information for military
commanders that is more timely, accurate, attuned to the specific
needs of operational commanders, and presented in a form tailored
to battlefield situations. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to the DCI, intelligence promotes battlefield awareness
by providing "joint force commanders real-time, or near
real-time, all-weather, comprehensive, continuous surveillance
and information." A newly established Associate Director of
Central Intelligence for Military Support is to ensure that,
despite their multiple priorities and consumers, intelligence
agencies continue to meet the special needs of the military and
the circumstances of the battlefield. This requires closer
attention to how the intelligence community disseminates its data
during wartime conditions and how it receives feedback from its
military customers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Press reports speculate about organizational changes to improve
the coordination among analysts of satellite imagery, including
use of the same data for intelligence analysis and map making. In
1995, eleven separate agencies did their own imagery analysis,
according to press reports unconfirmed by official sources. In
October 1995, a reorganization of the imagery activities into one
consolidated agency was announced.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Commanders, in turn, must strive to articulate better how
national intelligence can serve their tactical needs. For
instance, the traditional written intelligence report has been
supplemented and complemented by a growing array of multimedia
products that often help in the planning and execution of combat
operations. Technologically, this intelligence can be transmitted
simultaneously to the commander and the individual soldier in the
field, which, from the commander's perspective, creates problems
for maintaining command and control. That is a new dimension in
information the services have yet to understand fully.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As former CIA Deputy Director for Intelligence Douglas MacEachin
described in a 1994 working paper to the Washington-based
Consortium for the Study of Intelligence, the community must
ensure that the needs of the customer are the driving factors in
the production of intelligence and that analytic tradecraft
emphasizes both the facts and the findings derived from them.
Opinions must be linked to "what is known, how it is known, and
with what level of reliability"--in short, the rigorous
application of principles of analytic tradecraft.<p>

Counterintelligence aids national security by protecting U.S.
forces and government agencies and their personnel against
espionage, sabotage, assassinations, and terrorism conducted on
behalf of foreign powers and organizations. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1995, despite the end of the Cold War, the United States
remains the primary intelligence target for many countries,
including some traditional allies who have increased their
attempts to acquire economic and corporate secrets. What has
changed in the post-Cold War world is the ease with which foreign
intelligence services can operate in the United States. The
relaxation of security concerns, plus advances in penetration
techniques, has made it increasingly difficult for the United
States to implement successful counterintelligence measures. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Porous international borders and market-driven decisions create
pressure for the national security community to relax limitations
on the export of hitherto restricted technologies. A growing
number of countries thus have access to advanced technology that
previously was difficult to acquire outside of the United States
and its allies. As a result, U.S. systems that protect sensitive
information are increasingly vulnerable to exploitation. The
steady expansion of computer networks, the growth in corporate
and political intelligence stored in networked computers, and the
continuing internationalization of the public phone system,
private communications networks, and the Internet have created
new challenges in protecting information. Software tools to break
into and read sensitive information are freely available all over
the world. In addition, the challenge of protecting sources and
methods, the pressure to downgrade and declassify information,
declining security standards, and leaks and espionage have
produced vulnerabilities that are increasingly difficult to
counteract.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand, though Aldrich Ames was a Cold War spy, his
arrest in 1994 did dramatize for the country the serious problems
that can result from lax security and ineffective
counterintelligence. This scandal prompted the Clinton
administration, at the insistence of Congress, to alter
counterintelligence structures and to require the FBI and CIA,
with assistance from other intelligence agencies, to work
together more closely to define current and future threats and
implement countermeasures. As part of this renewed emphasis on
counterintelligence, the National Counterintelligence Center,
created in 1993 by Presidential Decision Directive 24, maintains
an extensive data base on foreign intelligence activity and
provides intelligence support to the counterintelligence
operations of the FBI and CIA.

Covert Action</a><p><A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Covert action uses intelligence assets and capabilities to
influence foreign governments, events, organizations, or persons
in support of foreign policy objectives while concealing the
actions' sponsor, or at least allowing plausible deniability.
Covert actions are the responsibility of the intelligence
community, which may draw for support on other government
agencies, such as the military's special operations forces. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Covert action became a staple of the four-decade struggle between
the communist East and the democratic West. The KGB's covert
action typically tried to subvert noncommunist governments and
political movements--in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia,
as well as the United States. A CIA covert-action capability
developed primarily to counter these initiatives, giving U.S.
policymakers an effective option in situations where diplomacy or
foreign aid were insufficient, but the use of military force or
overt political or economic intervention was inappropriate. Such
action was a key element in the immediate postwar struggle for
political power in southern and western Europe. Over subsequent
years, CIA covert operations ranged from small, discrete efforts,
such as sneaking banned publications into communist states and
bankrolling selected noncommunist politicians, to supporting
large-scale conflicts in such theaters as Afghanistan and Angola.
In rare instances, most notably in the Iran-Contra affair, the
White House assumed control of covert action, effectively taking
it out of the hands of the CIA. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As an instrument of policy, covert action has always generated
controversy. Its supporters stress the importance of expanding
the range of instruments available to policymakers and the
utility of an option that does not bear the fingerprints of the
U.S. government. Detractors focus on the difficulty--which
approaches impossibility as operations grow large--of keeping
covert action secret, and the damage to U.S. credibility and
interests that can accompany the exposure of these actions.
Critics also point out the inherent tension between the world of
covert action and the world of democratic government. Secret
operations are susceptible to abuse unless carefully overseen.
This danger has been highlighted recently by public allegations
concerning a CIA connection with a Guatemalan intelligence
officer involved in serious human-rights abuses.<p><hr>

their hands on nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. As
these terrible tools of destruction spread, so too spreads the
potential for terrorism and for criminals to acquire them. And
drug trafficking, organized crime, and environmental decay
threaten the stability of new and emerging democracies, and
threaten our well-being here at home. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Earlier this year, I set out in a presidential decision directive
what we most want [the intelligence community] to focus
on....First, the intelligence needs of our military during an
operation. If we have to stand down Iraqi aggression in the Gulf
or stand for democracy in Haiti, our military commanders must
have prompt, thorough intelligence to fully inform their
decisions and maximize the security of our troops. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Second, political, economic, and military intelligence about
countries hostile to the United States. We must also compile all
source information on major political and economic powers with
weapons of mass destruction who are potentially hostile to us. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Third, intelligence about specific transnational threats to our
security, such as weapons proliferation, terrorism, drug
trafficking, organized crime, illicit trade practices, and
environmental issues of great gravity. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Let me say that I know the Ames scandal has colored a lot of the
current debate over the future of the CIA....It's important that
we don't minimize the damage that Ames did or the changes that
need to be made to prevent future scandals. But Aldrich Ames was
a terrible exception to a proud tradition of service--a tradition
that is reflected in the fifty-nine stars that shine on the CIA's
memorial wall in honor of those who gave their lives to serve our
country. </blockquote><hr><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The end of the Cold War renewed the debate over whether a
significant need for such a capability remains. But the emerging
missions for the intelligence community--particularly the
interconnected threats of proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, international terrorism, and international organized
crime--suggest strongly that the need for covert action persists.
The next critical challenge will be to develop a covert
capability whose operations can be monitored by overseers in the
executive and legislative branches, while still proving effective
against the sophisticated networks run by international criminal
syndicates, illicit arms merchants, and rogue governments.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An intelligence community is always suspect in an open society,
but during the Cold War the U.S. intelligence community
established itself as a major element of national security. With
the end of the Cold War, that positive perception has begun to
fade, and not only because of a traditional aversion to secrecy.
There have also been the Ames scandal; questions about the
quality, accuracy, timeliness, and relevance of intelligence;
concerns over the control of covert activities; a belief that the
intelligence community needs to be restrained and streamlined;
and a conviction that tax dollars should go to undertakings that
more directly serve the U.S. public. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The numerous proposals that have been made to re-examine the
structure and functions of the intelligence community in light of
the dissolution of the Soviet threat have ranged far and wide,
but a common theme is that the community needs to be streamlined,
downsized, refocused on new targets, and generally made more
efficient. Some argue that the expensive systems required to
support intelligence, to say nothing of the organizations that
produce it, are costly excesses in the post-Cold War world and
that public funds should not be spent to acquire information
available in the public domain. The current reviews in the
executive and legislative branches as well as the private sector
may well reach the same conclusion, although it is not clear the
various recommendations coming out of these studies will be acted
on in an election year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If recent crises are predictive of the future, a substantial
increase in HUMINT collection will be needed to answer the
intelligence questions posed by the crises of today and the
future. Among the most important intelligence needs in
Bosnia-like conflicts are insights into the intentions of the
leaders and their warring factions, for which the human collector
is critical. Emplacement of sources and their cultivation take
many months if not years, and the U.S. intelligence resources may
not be sufficient to meet the demand.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Technology and automation can offset some of the loss of
personnel, but trained, analytical expertise remains beyond the
capacity of the computer. Community analysts have learned over
many years not to be bound by rigid intelligence requirements but
to anticipate where resources must be reapplied to meet emerging
intelligence needs. Even before the end of the planned
downsizing, it is clear that more selectivity will be required,
despite the risk that priority will be given to the wrong targets
and techniques.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The next decade will be an unsettling time. The U.S. intelligence
community will not receive funding sufficient to achieve the
levels of expertise it enjoyed during the Cold War, and the
principal challenge will thus be to identify the level of effort
that will produce the most useful intelligence at the lowest
cost. As its funding shrinks, the size of the community will also
shrink, and the community will likely be reorganized, resulting
in some amalgamation of functions at the national level and
perhaps the elimination of others. The argument that today's
threats require more, not less, intelligence has not been
persuasive thus far.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The productive and technological base of a nation is the
foundation of its national power. As Hemocrates noted 2400 years
ago, the ability to wage war--as well as to influence events in
the world without using military power--depends to a large degree
upon a nation's wealth. A strong productive base provides the
means and leverage for action and can significantly enhance a
nation's prestige and ability to influence the outcome of
international events.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The view that the productive and technological base is the
foundation of national power was expressed in 1989 by Harvard
scholar Paul Kennedy in<I> The Rise and Fall of the Great
Powers</I>:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
[The] historical record suggests that there is a very clear
connection in the long run between an individual Great Power's
economic rise and fall and its growth and decline as an important
military power...Technological and organizational
breakthroughs...bring greater advantage to one society than
another.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For over forty years, U.S. strategic policy was directed at
maintaining a technological edge over the USSR. The Cold War was,
to a significant extent, a contest between the superpowers'
productive and technological bases. The United States and the
Soviet Union devoted large portions of their respective national
wealth and productive capacity to wage the Cold War. As the
conflict progressed, the productive bases from which these
nations' power arose diverged significantly.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although the rate of increase of U.S. gross domestic product
(GDP) slowed considerably after the mid-1960s, all except three
of the thirty years between 1965 and 1995 saw real growth in the
economy. While it is difficult to secure reliable GDP data for
the former Soviet Union, it seems clear in retrospect that the
Soviet productive base suffered some long and serious setbacks in
the last decades of its existence. The declining Soviet
productive base could not support both the demands of the
military establishment and the demands of the Soviet people.
Perhaps more than any other single factor, this poor economic
performance led to the demise of the Soviet Union as a superpower
and its subsequent dissolution as a state. Had the GDP of the
Soviet Union expanded at a rate of 3 percent annually instead of
declining, the superpowers might still be waging the Cold War. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This chapter examines the major forces affecting the U.S.
productive and technological base in the mid-1990s, and addresses
the question of what role the U.S. government can play in
reinforcing important sectors of the productive base and in
translating industrial might into an effective instrument of
national power. The forces examined are:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The relationship between manufacturing and services.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The impact upon national power of increased globalization.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The rise of information technology as a strategic industry.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The effects of downsizing on the defense industrial base.<p>

</H2><h3 align="left">
Manufacturing and Services 
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most basic distinction in the productive base (construction,
agriculture, and mining aside) is between manufacturing and
services, though the dividing line has become blurred as
manufacturers increasingly rely upon services from outside firms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The shift from a manufacturing to a more service-based economy
may be seen in changes in employment. In 1970, 27 percent of the
U.S. nonagricultural work force was employed in manufacturing. By
1993, the figure was only 16 percent. During the same period,
service-sector employment increased from 67 to 79 percent.
Manufacturing employment fell from 19.4 million to 17.8 million
workers; and employment in services increased from 47.3 million
to 87.2 million workers. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch07unknown.gif align="left">Although this shift is not
a new phenomenon--as long ago as
1900, more Americans worked in services than in
manufacturing--the magnitude of the shift has given rise to a
number of concerns. Most pertinent here, this shift raised doubts
as to whether a nation can wage war without a strong
manufacturing base. But these doubts may be premature, for the
strength of a nation's manufacturing base cannot be determined
solely on the basis of employment trends, and waging war has
become less dependent on large numbers of classical military
instruments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, employment data is downright misleading: despite a
decline in manufacturing employment, total U.S. manufacturing
<I>production</I> almost doubled between 1970 and 1993--an
increase of over 3 percent annually. The durable-goods sector--of
which producers of military hardware are a part--more than
doubled its production during the same period. Since 1982,
durable-goods production increased more rapidly than total
industrial output. Declining employment combined with increased
output suggests that improvements in productivity have been
proceeding apace.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Productivity, although an increasingly elusive quantity to
measure, is the single most telling indicator of the performance
of a nation's productive base. And sustained increases in
productivity over time are a crucial foundation of national
power. Indeed it is the <I>relative</I> productivity of a
nation's productive base that counts, that is, not simply how
productive the U.S. economy is in absolute terms but how well it
is doing compared to its competitors. In addition to relative
productivity performance, the sheer size of the U.S. productive
base provides foundational support for national power. To take an
extreme example, a super-productive small economy, such as
Luxembourg, could not match the military power of a huge but
generally inefficient power, such as Russia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Between 1965 and 1995, Germany and Japan made significant strides
to close the productivity gap with the United States but have not
yet caught up. A 1992 McKinsey study comparing U.S. manufacturing
and service productivity with that of the United States's
international peers found that the U.S. still maintained an edge
in overall productivity compared to Britain, Germany, France, and
Japan--despite Japan's much-touted dominance in certain
high-profile industries, such as metal products, automobiles, and
electronic equipment. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The manufacturing sector continues to be the workhorse of
productivity improvement for the United States. Regardless of its
apparently poor productivity performance, the service sector too
has great potential as an instrument of national power. It
includes among other industries transportation and
communications, both of which are significant force multipliers
in the event of conflict. For example, many of the world's
manufacturers have been substituting transportation and
communications assets for large inventories, resulting in
so-called just-in-time inventory--a process that the military can
adopt, and to some degree already has. <p>
<img src="ch07unknown.gif" align="left">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the past, the essential link between the productive base and
national power was the ability to increase production runs of
weapons. World War II and the Korean War provide prime examples
of when the time necessary to close the gap between productive
output and military requirements was paid for in blood and
territory. However, many analysts suggest that future wars will
be of short duration and will therefore be fought with on-hand
weapons and munitions, obviating the need for a massive
industrial mobilization. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thus, the more relevant questions may be whether the industrial
base can, on an ongoing basis, supply the new technologies and
weapons that will ensure an overwhelming advantage for U.S. and
allied forces, and whether the military can rapidly incorporate
these new technologies into its inventory. The answers are not
clear.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When the Department of Defense (DOD) was the major buyer of high
technology in the marketplace, it was assured first access to
leading-edge technologies. DOD no longer enjoys this position in
most high-tech markets: its expenditures for the latest
computers, electronics, and telecommunications technology have
been surpassed by a rapidly expanding civilian marketplace. This
raises the issue of whether the defense-acquisition system can
respond to changing needs and changing technologies fast enough
so that front-line warriors have at their disposal the latest and
best technology that industry can provide. The present
acquisition system may be unable to shorten its delivery lead
time (seven to fifteen years, as of 1995) and thus unable to take
advantage of high-tech production commercial-development cycles
of two to five years. The Clinton administration's Federal
Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 made some significant
steps toward simplifying the acquisition system, but, to a large
degree, the focus of FASA was on the many small procurements the
government makes rather than on the acquisition of major weapon
systems, where there are few actions, but each involves much
money. The agenda of Vice President Gore's National Performance
Review (NPR) also included the objective of streamlining
procurement. FASA and NPR have thus far failed to produce
significant acceleration of major systems procurement. Those
undertaking acquisition reform have to overcome serious
political, cultural, and organizational obstacles.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As an example, DOD's continual reliance upon outdated military
specifications (milspecs) is seen by some as evidence of the
acquisition system's inability to aggressively provide the best
and latest technologies to U.S. warriors. While this allegation
has the ring of truth, it is important to remember that in a
manufacturing environment, specifications are one of the
foundations of production. Additionally, there are many areas of
military equipment production where there are no commercial
specifications available. The issue is not simply avoidance of
milspecs, but rather the identification and use of the latest and
best specifications to describe the requirement. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are many examples where the DOD acquisition system was
adjusted to accommodate new threats and new realities: the
Polaris missile program, the nuclear-power program, and the many
secret ("black world") efforts. If the productive base is to be
used effectively as an instrument of national power in this era
of rapid development and obsolescence of technologies, the
acquisition system will be sorely challenged to be an enabler,
giving the military access to the dynamic developments in
computing and telecommunications, rather than a hindrance. In a
future conflict or arms race, the nation with the shortest
acquisition lead time and product-cycle time will have a distinct
advantage. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead3">Globalization and U.S.
National Power <p><A
HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The environment in which the U.S. productive and technological
base operates has changed dramatically since the end of World War
II. That changing environment has affected the ability of the
United States to use its productive and technological base as an
instrument of national power.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The environment may be characterized as one of increasing global
economic interdependence, that is, globalization. Both the work
force and the manufacturing base are increasingly global. Capital
flows over national borders essentially unimpeded. Globalization
has been greatly facilitated by the peace among the major
industrial nations since 1945, the revolutions in
telecommunications and transportation, technological changes in
the manufacturing processes, and the rapid increase in world
trade. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Globalization has advantages and costs. On the one hand, it
promises ever improving levels of efficiency and
quality--provided that trade barriers are not erected by those
nations that perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage. On the
other hand, it is perhaps the single most important threat to
national sovereignty in the mid to late 1990s. There is an
inherent conflict between the idea of economic openness and the
desire for national control. The continued reluctance of the
nations of the European Union to embrace a single currency and a
single central banking system, despite much rhetoric favoring
such institutions, is a clear example of this conflict.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch07unknown.gif" align="left"><I>Indicators of
Globalization.</I> In 1959, U.S. exports
accounted for 4.2 percent of GDP. By 1993, this figure had grown
to 10.4 percent. Of this, about one-quarter is services and
one-tenth is agricultural products. Services is the fastest
growing portion of U.S. exports. At the same time, advanced
technology products account for more than 23 percent of total
U.S. exports. Between 1990 and 1993, the U.S. trade in advanced
technology products increased by more than 16 percent.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps the most significant change in the nature of U.S. trade
is the substantially increased role of multinational corporations
and intrafirm trade. In 1990, multinational firms accounted for
more than 75 percent of the total U.S. trade in goods. It is
estimated that about one-third of U.S. exports goes to
multinational firms' own subsidiaries abroad. Another one-third
is exported from foreign-owned companies in the United States to
their parent firms' own countries. To further compound the
confusion over national production and trade, the import content
of U.S. exports rose from 10 percent to 14 percent between 1987
and 1992.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the United States and the world have seen rapid growth in
trade, increases in international financial transactions and
investment have been even more significant. In 1993, about $1
trillion per day was traded around the world in a globalized
exchange market that never closes. The rapid increases in capital
movements and market influences on exchange rates have done much
to circumscribe the power of national central banks. The
September 1992 failure, in the face of market opposition, of the
Bank of England's efforts to maintain the prescribed value of the
pound sterling within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism
illustrates the point.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Foreign direct investment in the United States grew from $83
billion in 1980 to more than $445 billion in 1993. Japan has 22
percent of the total, compared to 59 percent for the European
Union (including 21 percent for Britain and 15 percent for the
Netherlands). Thirty-eight percent of foreign direct investment
is in manufacturing, 9 percent in petroleum, 10 percent in
finance, and 16 percent in retail and wholesale trade. U.S.
affiliates of foreign companies accounted for almost 6 percent of
U.S. GDP in 1992, compared to 4 percent in 1987. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch07unknown.gif" align="left">By contrast, from 1980 to
1993, U.S. direct investment
abroad grew from $215 billion to $548 billion, of which 18
percent is invested in Britain and 13 percent in Canada. Europe
remains the most popular location for newly acquired affiliates,
which indicates that access to well-ordered and established
integrated markets seems to outweigh access to low-wage labor
markets in direct U.S. investment decisions. Thirty-eight percent
of U.S. direct investment abroad is in manufacturing, while
petroleum accounts for 11 percent, and finance 26 percent.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Worldwide Information Technology Sales,
1993<p></b>
<img src="ch07gr03.gif" align="left">Manufacturing, petroleum,
and finance interrelations raise
the possibility of one government's using leverage in other
countries to influence the outcome of global issues. On the
surface, it may appear from the relative balance of U.S. and
foreign direct investments that other governments may have as
much potential leverage as the United States. However, this is
not the case. For while total direct foreign investments in the
U.S represent 6.6 percent of U.S. GDP, the United States has
considerably larger relative investments in other countries. For
example, 1991 U.S. direct investment in Britain represented about
7.7 percent of their GDP, while British investment in the U.S.
was only 1.8 percent of U.S. GDP. The same can be said of almost
all other countries except Japan, whose direct investment in the
U.S. is 1.6 percent of U.S. GDP, while U.S. investment in Japan
is only 0.7 percent of the Japanese GDP. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Globalization and U.S. National Influence. </I>Use of any
economic leverage power to influence international outcomes needs
to be country specific and industry specific. The U.S has
potentially more influence in some countries than in others and
is clearly more vulnerable to return influence by certain
countries.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The same specificity may be required if trade is to used as a
lever of national power. The U.S. relationship with Japan and
China are perhaps extreme examples. China's exports to the United
States grew from $2.8 billion in 1987 to $22.8 billion in 1993,
giving the U.S. perhaps some influence not previously held with
China. By contrast, the large and pervasive trade deficit with
Japan places U.S. national power in some question. Some suggest
that the U.S. enjoys the perverse power of the debtor over the
creditor who threatens nonpayment. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nonetheless, because of its historic position favoring free
trade, the size of its market, and its industrial power, the
United States is in a unique position to use the global
marketplace as an instrument of national power. In some contexts,
the promise of access to U.S. markets or the threat of exclusion
may have an impact on the outcome of events. However, it is
important to recognize that this form of U.S. influence has
declined relatively as other nations--particularly Japan and the
European Union--have acquired significant wealth and productive
power. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any exercise of U.S. power in the industrial realm must recognize
the increasing influence of multinational firms in the global
market. The international firms operating within the global
marketplace are major new stakeholders in the quest for global
stability and therefore are potential allies to which the United
States may turn in a variety of situations. The goals of
multinational firms often coincide with those of the U.S.
government. Both are interested in global stability, the peaceful
transition of political power, the creation and maintenance of
free markets, free access to raw materials, access to the global
manufacturing base, the removal of trade barriers, and the
establishment of internationally applied product standards and
rules of ownership. <p><b>Growth of U.S. Information
Industry<p></b>
<img src="ch07gr01.gif"><p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is not only a global marketplace but--of greater national
security interest--a global manufacturing base. It is
increasingly difficult to identify a manufactured product as
"Made in America." The U.S. military has become more dependent
upon items with significant foreign content, especially as more
and more defense hardware is purchased from commercial sources
rather than traditional defense-industry sources. Still, reliance
on foreign sources may be less militarily significant now than it
would have been in the past. As discussed below, future wars are
likely to be fought with the equipment on hand rather than with
weaponry produced during a long, extensive mobilization of the
domestic industrial base.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"> <a name="subhead4">Information Technology as a
Strategic Industry<p><A
HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Certain industries are generally considered to be more important
than others to a nation's economy, power, and prestige. There is
a debate in the United States over how to identify such
industries and what--if anything--the U.S. government should do
to support them and to ensure they are fully exploited to the
national advantage.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A strategic industry may be defined as one that causes
significant economic growth in excess of its own value. History
provides many examples of strategic industries: railroads and
agriculture in the United States; textiles, railroads, and coal
in Britain; and the chemical industry in Germany. Each of these
cases suggests a connection between new technology and strong
economic growth not just in the strategic industry itself but in
related industries as well.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For example, the U.S. railroad industry, with heavy
government support, spurred growth in the steel industry with its
demands for massive amounts of steel for rails, bridges, and
equipment; it also substantially stimulated the machine tools
industry, the telegraph industry, and the coal industry.
Moreover, the growth of the railroads provided a cheap means to
move bulk agricultural products to market, thus substantially
reducing the cost of these products and providing consumers with
a better diet. Similarly, railroads provided cheap transportation
for coal and pig iron, thus indirectly stimulating heavy
industries.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Strategic industries also exist today. Whether government takes a
role in fostering them is essentially a political decision.
Historically, the U.S. government has supported strategic
industries in a variety of ways: through outright ownership, as
with the Tennessee Valley Authority and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration; protection from some of the rigors of
free markets, as with agriculture; subsidies for research and
development support, as with semiconductors; and provision of a
market for new technologies before they are commercially viable,
as with DOD support of computers. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Percentage of Households with PCs and
Modems, 1994</b><p>
<img src="ch07gr02.gif" align="left">The information industry
today holds the most convincing claim to
the status of a strategic industry. As an element of national
power, the U.S. information industry generates considerable
wealth in its own right. It also provides foundational support to
the whole of the U.S. information economy, estimated by some at
36 percent of U.S. GNP in the mid-1990s. The information economy
is defined as the confluence of computer hardware, software,
telecommunications, and the value-added information-provider
sector. Historically, there were clear boundaries between
hardware, software, telecommunications, and service providers.
Such is no longer the case. Now, they are inextricably linked to
form a very powerful source of economic and productive energy
that can be leveraged at the national and international level.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of what role Washington should play in supporting
strategic industries in the information age usually divides
respondents into two camps: those who want the government to
allow the free markets to work, and those who favor government
support for strategic investments in the most promising future
technologies. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The historical record suggests that the government can play a
constructive role. But success in supporting railroads,
agriculture, mining, and air transport, for example, is
counterbalanced by Washington's tendency to become a captive to
those industries as they mature and become politically powerful.
The challenge is to identify and support dynamic, emerging
industries that are a potential source of national power and
wealth and avoid long-term capture.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.S. firms have long been at the forefront of the information
industry. Microsoft's MS-DOS or Windows operating systems run
over 80 percent of the world's personal computers. The software
industry grew by 11 percent in 1994, making it the
fastest-growing service business in the United States. With the
deregulation and privatization of telecommunications markets
around the world, U.S. telecommunications firms are becoming
strategic partners with newly privatized telephone providers in
foreign markets. More important, joint ownership or access to
foreign telephone markets provides an entree for a plethora of
information-service providers. Distinctly American
information-service providers (Prodigy, America Online,
Compuserve, Dun and Bradstreet, and others) offer a variety of
services that instantaneously link customers with far-flung
sources of information. The United States maintains a huge $3
billion trade surplus in information-related services, including
those of information providers such as Mead Data Central, the
company that runs Lexis and Nexis.
<hr><blockquote>
Measuring the Information Economy 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most economists agree that the production and dissemination of
information are playing an increasing role in the United States
and other advanced economies. However, there is no widely
accepted methodology for calculating the size of the information
economy. A handful of economists have attempted to measure the
size of the information sector of the U.S. economy by means of
various complex methodologies. In 1962, Fritz Machlup (<I>The
Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States)
</I>calculated that in 1958, 32 percent of the U.S. work force
was engaged in knowledge-producing activities. In 1977, Marc U.
Porat and Michael Rubin (in a nine-volume report for the U.S.
Department of Commerce entitled <I>The Information Economy</I>)
concluded that in 1967, the sector in which information was the
main output accounted for 25.1 percent of U.S. GNP, and
information activities within noninformation industries accounted
for 21.1 percent. Lastly, in 1986, Michael Rubin and Mary Huber
(in <I>The Knowledge Industry in the United States,
1960-1980</I>) concluded that in 1980, 36.5 percent of the U.S.
GNP could be attributed to knowledge production. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even if one narrowly defines the economy's information sector,
the industrial and service sectors are increasingly dependent
upon the use of information in their productive activities. For
instance, the capital spending on information machines in the
U.S. economy has exceeded spending on traditional industrial
equipment.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the late 1980s, some analysts predicted that Japan and Pacific
Rim countries would dominate high-tech markets. This has not
happened, nor is it likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
U.S. companies are still the foremost innovators,
standard-setters, and market leaders of the information
revolution. Five of the top six computer makers are headquartered
in the United States. Intel leads the semiconductor business,
Microsoft tops the PC software market, and Motorola is the
international leader in cellular technology. Further, the United
States leads the world in connectivity, household computing
power, household connectivity with external information
providers, electronic commerce, and other facets of the
information industry. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.S. policy can influence the behavior of nation-states or
regional geopolitical jurisdictions by establishing policies that
influence who may participate in and have access to the
opportunities available in the United States. Additionally,
influence can be brought to bear by employing the principle of
reciprocity. If country X does Y, then U.S. policy will permit
that country to accelerate its development of a technically
advanced information infrastructure. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As an element of national power, the U.S. capability to leverage
its edge in the information industries depends upon the ability
of U.S. providers to establish de facto technical standards by
dominating worldwide markets, and to innovate future generations
of information products and services. For example, in 1995
Microsoft's MS-DOS and Windows software functioned as a standard
for PC operating systems throughout much of the world.
Application software developers therefore had to develop programs
that operated within Microsoft's environment if they hoped to
penetrate world markets. Japanese firms did much the same in the
less strategic VCR industry.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Underpinning the development of future generations of
information-technology applications and products is the ability
to innovate. Technological develop-ment is, in turn, dependent on
access to the requisite intellectual capital. Technological
innovation will migrate, physically or electronically, to areas,
regions, or countries where the intellectual capital resides.
Maintaining a leadership position within the global-information
industry therefore requires a world-class educational and
cultural infrastructure to produce the human capital to develop
new generations of information-technology products and services.
It also requires the creation and maintenance of the structural
capital--that is, the networks, information systems, and
information repositories--that is the foundation for innovation. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"> <a name="subhead5">The Defense Industrial
Base<p><A
HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The current wisdom holds that future conflicts will be fought
with off-the-shelf systems and technologies, and the major
challenge for the U.S. defense industrial base will be to replace
forces lost in conflicts rather than to handle massive, sustained
production runs. Given the inventory and age of defense hardware
in 1995, coupled with the unlikelihood of a serious conflict, the
capabilities of the defense industrial base will probably not be
tested seriously until obsolescence begins to threaten defense
capabilities early in the next century. The crux of the argument
over support of the defense industrial base beyond current needs
is the issue of whether what remains of the base in the future
will be able to respond in a timely manner to the requirement to
replace obsolescent equipment or, indeed, to support a long, hot
war if predictions of relatively short conflicts prove wrong. It
is unclear what would be the cost in time and money to
reconstitute the once highly prized skills that are being allowed
to languish.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The defense base reaches more deeply into the U.S. industrial
base than is often understood. For example, it supported much of
the high-tech research performed in the United States since the
Second World War. As recently as 1990, it directly or indirectly
employed about a quarter of all engineers, consumed about 15
percent of durable-goods output, and supported half of all
computer research.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch0701.gif"><p>
<b>US soldier demonstrating laptop use in the Field</b><p>
The decline in U.S. defense procurement spending began in 1985
and continued in the first half of the 1990s. The reduced
military spending hit hard at the defense industrial base.
Defense procurement went from a FY 1985 peak of $136 billion to
$42 billion in FY 1996 (in FY 1996 dollars), that is, from the
equivalent of 2.4 percent of GDP to 0.6 percent. And these
numbers understate the problem for defense firms, since
procurement of goods with a large civilian market, like food and
personal computers, fell proportionately less than the purchases
of major weapons systems, which is the key issue for the
traditional defense industrial base. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The response by defense firms to the decline has focused on
mergers and consolidations in order to ensure a competitive
position. The essential question is whether U.S. defense firms,
despite the very significant decline in defense procurement,
remain capable of satisfying the materiel requirements to support
the use of national power.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Contrary to popular belief, the defense industry is not simply a
few large contractors that work exclusively to supply weapons for
the Department of Defense. True, there are some cases in which
only a single or a few suppliers of a particular system exist;
but such suppliers typically engage some 800 to 1,000
subcontractors, who contribute about 60 percent of the value of
delivered systems. Additionally, the vast majority of companies
that do business with the DOD also undertake significant
commercial work. John Alic and Harvey Brooks reported in
<I>Beyond Spinoff</I> that the 67 largest prime contractors
obtained only about 9 percent of their revenues from defense
work, even during the height of the Reagan buildup.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thus, the prime firms in the defense industry have a more varied
customer base than is generally supposed. Subcontractors do not
usually rely solely upon defense work either. Rather, most
defense contractors are prepared to adapt to market forces as
military orders dwindle, and most will probably continue to be
capable of providing needed goods. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, certain industrial segments and technologies are so
unique to defense that no commercial market for them exists or is
likely to exist. Thus, despite the overall health of the
manufacturing base, there are some very critical defense
industrial activities where no commercial applications would
sustain a company or production line between defense orders. In
this category are laser guidance, stealth technology, and
submarine construction, among others. These specialized items can
be produced only with direct government support. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thus, Washington has to face the policy dilemma of which
companies to support, and why. Ideally, the government would make
these decisions based on a clearly articulated, high-priority
military requirement, coupled with an extensive cost/benefit
analysis. But the connection between grand strategy, military
requirements, and actual production is tenuous in the best of
times. During a significant reduction in forces and the
subsequent contraction of support facilities and the defense
industrial base, the question of what to save ultimately will be
decided on Capitol Hill as part of the political debate. The
decision process surrounding the Seawolf submarine is a case in
point--regardless of the decision's merits.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The defense base faces at least two major challenges: continued
restructuring to ensure survival in an era of modest defense
spending, and competition in the global marketplace with foreign
suppliers that are vying for a declining export market. The most
overt response to these challenges has been an increased effort
among defense firms to collaborate in the development and
production of new systems so as to reduce risks, increase access
to technologies, and share up-front costs. Such collaborations
include the teaming of U.S. prime contractors for the duration of
a project, as well as international collaborations, sometimes
with government-owned foreign companies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This collaborative trend within the United States may ensure the
survival of a viable U.S. defense industrial base. But when
partnerships between U.S. and foreign firms are involved, new
concerns emerge. International collaboration implies either
sharing or partitioning information so that neither party can
make the unit individually. Partitioning arrangements may
significantly affect U.S. ability to exercise unilateral action
in pursuit of its national security goals. For example, General
Electric (GE) and SNECMA of France jointly manufacture the CFM-56
aircraft engine, which is used in military (the KC-135R
air-refueler) and many civilian aircraft. Neither company
manufacturers the complete engine. Rather, GE makes the "hot
section" and SNECMA makes the "cold section." Each company
assembles complete engines using the other's sections and then
delivers them to customers. Although France's <BR>
status as an ally makes disruptions in the exchange of sections
unlikely, this example illustrates the vulnerabilities that can
be incurred by cross-border defense ventures: U.S. capability to
expand its air-power projection could be severely hampered if
France chose not to allow cold section shipments to the United
States. GE could, of course, manufacture CFM-56 cold sections
given sufficient time and resources. <hr><blockquote><b>The
Seawolf
Submarine </b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the height of the Cold War, the Navy's plan had been to buy
three Seawolf submarines a year for six years, costing some $33.6
billion. President Bush in May 1992 called for cancellation of
the Seawolf submarine production program except for the one boat
under construction at the General Dynamics electric boat (EB)
division in Groton, Connecticut. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opponents of the cancellation decision included the
congressional delegations from Connecticut and Rhode Island, who
were concerned with the cancellation's economic impact. Besides
the loss of thousands of jobs, they argued that loss of Seawolf
production would place in grave jeopardy one of the nation's two
nuclear-capable shipyards. EB strongly maintained that it could
not continue to make submarines without at least one new order a
year. Additionally, responding to a future military threat would
be more costly if EB were to lose its highly trained, specially
skilled work force. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
President Bush's supporters argued that Seawolf was no longer
needed and was too costly, particularly in light of the demands
for tax cuts, reduced federal spending, and the need to balance
the budget. The Seawolf had long been a target of criticism from
Senator John McCain (R--Arizona), a staunch supporter of defense,
who maintained that the submarine was too expensive and the money
could be better spent on other Navy needs. The House and Senate
eventually agreed on funding a second Seawolf, which was
acceptable to President Bush. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In September 1993, President Clinton--who had announced in March
1992 during the Connecticut primary his support for either two or
three Seawolfs--confirmed a third submarine would be built at a
cost of $2.3 billion at EB. Newport News, the other
nuclear-capable yard (in Newport News, Virginia), was slated to
receive an order for a new aircraft carrier. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After the November 1994 election, the Seawolf was again under
attack, with Senators McCain and John Warner (R--Virginia)
identifying as wasteful some $8 billion in spending, including
Seawolf production. The Congressional Budget Office in May 1995
lent support to the critics of Seawolf when it questioned the
military need for a third Seawolf and stated that construction of
the third submarine would do little to help the vital
subcontractors in the submarine industrial base. Virginia
Senators Charles Robb (D) and Warner joined forces and strongly
objected to the Navy's plan to continue to bypass competition by
giving the order for the third Seawolf to EB. The Navy, however,
maintained that by preserving the nuclear shipbuilding base in
the mid-1990s--with orders to both EB and Newport
News--competition to build nuclear-powered ships would exist for
the next decade. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In June 1995, the House voted to cancel the third Seawolf and use
the savings to improve the second Seawolf and start the new line
of advanced--more affordable--submarines. However, Congress
accepted in November 1995 the proposal crafted by Senator Warner,
under which the third and final Seawolf would be built by EB,
which would also get the order for the lead boat of the new
submarine class in 1998, but Newport News would get the order for
the second new-class boat in 1999. From then on, there would be
competition for the planned twenty-eight follow-on orders. This
plan preserves the skill base at EB until the next-generation
order is received, and provides for future competition between EB
and Newport News. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Seawolf debate was a mixture of many different elements, but
most emphasis was on preserving jobs. Apparently, less
consideration was given to Russia's continued submarine-building
program. A troubling aspect of the Russian defense structure
since the end of the Cold War is the emphasis on submarines.
Production of the improved Akula class has continued at much the
same pace as in the late 1980s. Additionally, construction of a
new ballistic submarine class began in December 1993. In the new
boats, the Russians--thanks to their own technical skill and to
borrowed Western technology--have largely closed the gap with the
U.S. in quietness, one of the major measures of submarine
quality. By 2000, the Russian nuclear submarine force may be 80
boats, most of which will be about as quiet as the 70 boats the
U.S. will have then.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><p>
<b>Sea Wolf Submarine</b><p><img src="ch0702.gif"><p>
Washington could also exploit such arrangements by blocking
shipments to a collaborating company if doing so would serve some
compelling national interest. Collaboration is more and more
common as increasing numbers of U.S. and foreign companies
develop arrangements for development and production. The usual
arrangement is similar to the GE/SNECMA model: each makes part of
the product, while sharing as little technical data as possible.
These commercial arrangements are usually undertaken to share
costs and risks, to obtain technology, and to facilitate market
penetration. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As defense firms continue to downsize and embrace international
collaborative efforts to ensure survival, the U.S. defense
industrial base loses some of its unilateral ability to respond
to sovereign interests. Washington has the power to reverse these
trends through direct intervention in the defense industry, but
economic and political realities run counter to creation of a
policy broadly supporting the declining base. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Besides a diminished threat and rapidly declining defense
dollars, there has been a fundamental shift in the way DOD
approaches acquisition. Defense is increasingly relying on
commercial products for major portions of its high-technology
equipment. The old system of heavy DOD R&amp;D funding followed
by procurement is gone. In its place is a reduced DOD presence in
the R&amp;D market. The need is to capitalize upon rapidly
changing market-driven products so that DOD can take advantage of
the latest technologies and commercial economies of scale. The
old, unique defense supplier base is unaffordable. It lacks the
means to exploit rapidly new technologies and fails to take
advantage of commercial-sector production economies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The government's challenge is to adapt its acquisition
system to make the defense market more commercial friendly in
order to gain maximum advantage of commercial technologies and
prices while maintaining required defense-unique capabilities.
Specific military mission analysis can assist in identification
of necessary defense-unique products. Formulating policies to
protect and foster unique capabilities is no trivial task, being
fraught with political difficulties and serious trade-offs: for
example, national versus collaborative development and
production, domestic versus foreign sourcing, current capability
versus future capability, and competition versus sole sourcing.
The alternative is to let the political process or the
marketplace decide. That alternative may, in fact, be more
efficient than generally credited.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. productive and technological base is quite strong and
doing well in comparison with its foreign peers, providing a
solid foundation for the exercise of national power. Yet, the
base is constantly changing. The major forces affecting the base
include:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A sharp rise in the service sector coupled with a steady growth
in manufacturing production.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A greater reliance upon trade as a source of national income.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Increased globalization of information, manufacturing, and
finance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Expansion of the role of international firms in world affairs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The rise of information technology dominated by the United
States.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Reduced defense expenditures for R&D and procurement,
resulting in a downsized defense industrial base.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A significant change in defense acquisition focus toward
increased use of commercial items and technology. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The issue of the proper role and goals of the government to
foster and protect the productive and technological base as an
instrument of national power is unresolved. The challenge for the
United States is how to harness the economic growth capacity of
new technologies and industries so as to remain the world's
premier power. The debate continues over the appropriate goals
and role of the government in preserving manufacturing skills
unique to defense requirements. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite the debate, the productive and technological base remains
a firm foundation of national power against which a number of
instruments may be leveraged to influence the outcome of world
events. These instruments include:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The control of access to the U.S. domestic market and U.S.
technology, including information technology.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Use of the foreign affiliates of U.S. firms to influence local
events, at least by demonstration of "enlightened" policies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Maintenance of the appearance, if not the reality, of great
industrial might (including the defense industry) to forestall
potential adversaries.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Efforts to demonstrate, if no other way than by example, the
promise of greater economic and political well-being through
participation in the global marketplace, which requires political
stability, maintenance of free markets and sources, removal of
trade barriers, establishment of international standards, and
rules of ownership enforceable under law. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S productive and technological base is inextricably woven
into the fabric of the global marketplace. It cannot retreat
without incurring serious costs. As in the past, economic
interrelationships offer the promise of increased stability and
peace in the world. The productive and technological base can be
used as an instrument to support and enhance U.S. interests
globally, but not without consideration of the enablers and
limitations resulting from the global nature of the base itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before the end of World War II, arms control had not experienced
significant success. Modern arms control had its roots in the
nuclear age, when the technology of war advanced to the point
where humanity possessed the means to destroy itself. At the
start of the Cold War, the focus was on eliminating dangerous
weapons, e.g., the Acheson-Lillienthal Report calling for
eliminating nuclear weapons. This attitude persisted, resulting
in the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT) and the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). But
during the middle of the Cold War, the theory of arms control
rested in large part on the notion that adversaries could
cooperate in creating force postures that would place less
pressure on political leaders to use their forces or lose them.
Hence the emphasis was on preventing a first-strike posture with
nuclear weapons, and on measures to reduce the risk of
inadvertent conventional conflict as well as to complicate the
task of military planners who might see some advantage in a
surprise military attack. At the end of the Cold War, the
emphasis shifted back to eliminating weapons, even whole classes
of weapons, which was the centerpiece of the two Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks (START) treaties and the Treaty on Conventional
Armed Forces in Europe, signed in 1989-92.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A fundamental question for arms control is what the disappearance
of the special circumstances that prevailed during the Cold War
will mean for the theory and practice of arms control. One open
issue is to what extent control of their respective weapons will
remain an important part of the U.S.-Russian relationship.
Another important question will be how to develop arms-control
mechanisms for volatile regions, or for the globe as a whole,
when the underlying political situation is more complex and
multisided than in the relatively straightforward East-West Cold
War confrontation.

Nuclear Arms Control 
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By the middle of the Cold War, U.S. thinking about arms control
had moved from an emphasis on reducing numbers of weapons to a
focus on stabilizing the U.S.-Soviet strategic relationship. In
1969, bilateral negotiations began between the superpowers on
limiting the delivery systems of strategic nuclear weapons. The
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) were conducted on the
premise that a "first-strike" posture should be eschewed in favor
of a "second-strike" posture. The resulting SALT I Interim
Agreement, the first negotiated limitation on strategic nuclear
delivery vehicles, entered into force in October 1972,
essentially freezing strategic offensive ballistic missile
systems at their then current levels for five years.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States continued to seek a stable force posture
through the negotiation of the SALT II Treaty, which was signed
in 1979 but never ratified. This treaty implemented the 1974
Vladivostok Accord, in which the United States and the Soviet
Union agreed on the principle of equal aggregate limitations on
strategic offensive-delivery vehicles, that is, intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBMs), and heavy bombers. Both the SALT I Interim Agreement
(beyond its five-year term) and the SALT II Treaty were observed
through an informal arrangement until 1986, when President Reagan
discontinued this observance in response to Soviet violations.<p>
<img src="ch0803.gif" align="left"><b>U.S. Secretary of Defense
and Russian Defense Minister Grachev watch the destruction of a

approach to arms control
back in the direction of disarmament, proposing to cancel the
deployment of U.S. intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe
in exchange for the elimination of similar Soviet weapons, and
opening the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks (START). The
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, signed in 1987,
eliminated an entire class of nuclear-weapons delivery
vehicles--ground-launched missiles with ranges of 500-5,500
kilometers. This treaty also contained a precedent-setting
verification regime, allowing for short-notice, on-site
inspections that had previously been unacceptable to the Soviets.
The INF Treaty was the first agreement that provided for the
actual elimination of existing nuclear-weapons delivery systems.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In September 1991, President Bush offered to destroy all U.S.
nuclear artillery shells, stand down ICBMs scheduled for
elimination under START I, end the twenty-four-hour runway alert
status for nuclear bombers, and remove nuclear weapons from U.S.
surface ships, land-based naval aircraft, and attack submarines.
As a result of this initiative, 90 percent of U.S. tactical
nuclear weapons have been eliminated. Soviet President Gorbachev
responded within a week with a similar initiative, promising to
destroy Soviet nuclear artillery shells, take USSR bombers off
alert, confine mobile missiles to their garrisons, and cancel
several new weapons programs. Both countries also committed
themselves to significant cuts in their strategic nuclear
arsenals, pursuant to the conclusion of the START Treaty--which
mandated reductions in the total number of deployed warheads to
6,000 each--on July 31, 1991.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the wake of the Soviet Union's dissolution, Presidents Bush
and Yeltsin signed the Joint Understanding on Reductions in
Strategic Offensive Arms, which obligated both sides to cut their
strategic nuclear forces below START I levels. The ensuing START
II Treaty will, when ratified and implemented, reduce each side's
nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500. START II also places
eliminates heavy ICBMs and Multiple Independently-targetable
Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs) on land-based missiles, promoting
stability by focusing on weapons that lend themselves to
first-strike use. Once START II is in force, the United States
and Russia have pledged to consider further reductions in
strategic forces.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even if relations between Washington and Moscow remain cordial,
arms control will remain an important instrument for promoting
U.S. national interests as long as states retain nuclear weapons.
Maintaining current treaties serves the interests of strategic
stability: a unilateral change in any of these agreements would
almost certainly destabilize the U.S.-Russian strategic
relationship. In the future, the strategic nuclear arms control
instrument may cease to be a U.S.-Russian monopoly and instead
become multilateral with the inclusion of China, Britain, and
France.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The dissolution of the former Soviet Union had a dual impact on
the arms control instrument of U.S. policy. On the one hand, it
opened the door to the possibility that former Soviet nuclear
weapons or weapons-usable material could fall into the hands of
rogue states or terrorists. On the other hand, it created arms
control possibilities that were impossible during the Cold War
beyond the field of "traditional" strategic nuclear arms control.
The opportunity exists to greatly enhance the national security
of both the United States and Russia through cooperative
measures, but there are no guarantees that this opportunity will
last.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, the Soviets went to great lengths to protect
their nuclear weapons and materials from loss, theft, or misuse.
The demise of the former Soviet Union left nuclear forces and
weapons-production facilities spread across new international
borders, while the central government that had imposed stringent
administrative control over these forces and facilities ceased to
exist. Military morale and cohesion have declined, as have the
living standards of former Soviet nuclear weapons scientists.
Homeless military officers and nuclear physicists whose children
are hungry struggle to maintain strict accountability for nuclear
weapons and materials, but they are faced with diminished
resources to perform this function and the lure of the
significant economic benefits they could receive from selling
weapons, material, and expertise to criminal elements. The
possibility that nuclear weapons or weapons-usable material could
fall into terrorist hands has increased. As a result, the United
States may face a greater nuclear danger today, albeit of an
entirely different type, than it did during the Cold War.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These new dangers have created the opportunity for a new type of
arms control emphasizing cooperative efforts. The threat is
different; the governments of the newly independent states of the
former Soviet Union share with the U.S. an interest in protecting
the security of the nuclear weapons and materials in their
territories. The U.S. can work with them in ways it could not
work with the former Soviet Union. For example, Washington and
Moscow are cooperating to enhance the security of nuclear weapons
and fissile material, as discussed in the next chapter. Both
sides are reducing their nuclear arsenals as quickly as possible.
Transparency measures are being implemented to increase the
confidence of both sides that the agreed reductions are taking
place. Furthermore, steps will be taken to prevent unauthorized
seizure of nuclear warheads or fissile materials by
non-government entities. Measures under negotiation include
declarations of quantities and types of warheads and fissile
material, spot checks to confirm the accuracy of these
declarations, and mutual inspections of dismantled warheads in
storage facilities. Other measures to promote nuclear security
focus on building a storage facility for dismantled warheads,
improving the security of material in transit, tightening export
controls, and improving the physical protection of--and
accounting measures for--warheads and fissile material.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the mid-1990s, the United States has implemented innovative
cooperative measures to protect nuclear materials that would have
been impossible during the Cold War, using both economic
incentives and security arguments. For example, in Operation
Sapphire, the U.S. government airlifted 600 kilograms of highly
enriched uranium (HEU), enough for dozens of bombs, from
Kazakhstan to the United States for safe disposition. Similarly,
Washington forged a deal with Russia to purchase 500 metric tons
of HEU from dismantled weapons, blend it down into low-enriched
uranium for use in reactor fuel, and ship it to the United
States. The U.S., Russia, and Ukraine also negotiated a
tripartite agreement for the commercial use of the nuclear
material in Ukrainian weapons, which was central to securing from
nationalist Ukrainian politicians the agreement that Kiev would
give up its nuclear weapons. However, these latter two
arrangements remain beset by problems, including economic worries
(the U.S. uranium mining industry is concerned about the
competition from cheaper Russian and Ukrainian materials, and
there are worries that the deals may jeopardize the price
Washington will get for selling the reprocessing company it
owns). It is far from clear whether the U.S.-Russian partnership
is solid enough to sustain the kind of cooperative effort that
these measures require.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S.-NATO proposals on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions
(MBFR) in 1973 sought to create equality between NATO and Warsaw
Pact manpower in a narrow zone in central Europe. The Treaty on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) of 1990 was designed to
regulate, in a verifiable way, the levels of key types of
military equipment--including tanks, armored personnel carriers,
attack helicopters, artillery, and fixed-wing combat
aircraft--held by NATO and the Warsaw Pact in the
Atlantic-to-Urals zone of application. Thus, the CFE Treaty
limits the deployment of the kinds of equipment necessary for
combined arms attacks. By providing for verification that these
limits are being observed through intrusive, on-site inspections,
CFE increases the confidence of its parties that no one is
massing forces for an attack. The CFE and its implementing body,
the Joint Consultative Group, provide an effective framework for
stabilizing the conventional arms situation among its parties in
Europe. Through the October 1994 deadline for achieving 60
percent of the total reduction called for in the treaty, more
than 18,000 items of treaty-limited equipment had been destroyed,
including 6,000 by Russia. The full reduction was required by
November 1995, with an additional four months allocated to verify
the residual levels, and then a review conference is to follow,
probably in Vienna in May 1996.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Europe has changed dramatically since CFE was signed in 1990.
Most notably, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, the Eastern
parties to the CFE regime, have dissolved. This complicates the
treaty's application. For example, the CFE set ceilings for
deployments in four subzones, which were to be reached by late
1995. Russia--and, to a lesser extent, Ukraine--want adjustments
in some CFE provisions that limit deployments in the flank zones
around the Black and Baltic Seas, claiming that the breakup of
the former Soviet Union and instability in the Caucasus generate
requirements unanticipated during the negotiations that shaped
the treaty. As it had warned since September 1993, Russia did not
meet the November 1995 original treaty requirements. Most of the
various solutions proposed by Russia in 1993-95 would require a
significant change to the CFE Treaty. Shortly before the November
1995 deadline, the CFE signatories agreed to a framework to ease
the CFE flank caps, despite dissatisfaction by Norway and Turkey
over allowing more Russian weaponry in the zones near their
borders. While by no means a final deal, the framework agreement
represented major progress towards resolving the dispute about
CFE flanks. Failure to resolve the CFE Treaty compliance issue
could complicate approval of START II by the Russian Duma and the
U.S. Congress.

<b>Missile Defense: Consensus and Controversy </B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which entered into force
in 1972, sought to prohibit deployment of large-scale strategic
defenses. The ABM Treaty followed the premise that defensive
systems are inherently destabilizing: if a country deploys
effective defenses against ballistic missiles, it could launch a
first strike with impunity because whatever retaliatory enemy
forces survived the attack would be no match for the attacker's
defensive systems. By limiting defensive systems, the ABM Treaty
thus reduced the imperative for rapid growth in offensive systems
necessary to overwhelm missile defenses.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the 1980s, President Reagan's desire to provide for a
space-based national missile defense through the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) led to attempts by his administration to
reinterpret the ABM Treaty to allow for defenses based on "other
physical principles" than those anticipated when the treaty was
negotiated. The debate was rendered moot by the collapse of the
former Soviet Union.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The military and political utility of theater-range ballistic
missiles was demonstrated during the Gulf War, when Iraq launched
SCUD missiles against targets in Israel and Saudi Arabia. Since
that time, a strong consensus has been forged in the United
States concerning the need for active theater missile defenses
(TMD) to counter missiles with ranges up to 3,500 km. This
consensus has been bolstered by the continued proliferation of
ballistic-missile technology in Asia and the Middle East. U.S.
policymakers have taken steps to improve the Patriot and system
missiles for point defense, to develop Theater High Altitude Area
Defense for wider-area defense, and to expand the AEGIS system
for tactical missile defense from the sea.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While improving TMD capability is a priority shared by the
Clinton administration, Congress, and the armed forces, the
development of a national missile defense (NMD) is a far more
divisive issue. The debate over NMD centers on differing
perceptions of the threat to U.S. territory posed by nuclear,
biological, and chemical weapons, and differing views concerning
the utility of the 1972 ABM Treaty in the post-Cold War world.
Illustrative of the controversy are the divergent approaches
taken by the Bush and Clinton administrations on the NMD issue.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Bush administration believed proliferation of NBC and missile
capabilities to be a near-term threat to U.S. territory. In
response, President Bush looked to strengthen active U.S.
defenses against limited ballistic-missile attacks. The Strategic
Defense Initiative of the Reagan administration was reoriented to
deal with limited ballistic-missile threats. The new program,
named Global Protection Against Limited Strikes, sought to create
and deploy a limited, layered national missile defense without
undermining the deterrent effect of the Cold War nuclear balance.
The existing terms of the 1972 ABM Treaty, however, stood as an
obstacle to the creation of a national missile defense.
Describing the treaty as "an outdated relic of the Cold War," the
Bush administration looked to amend the treaty's terms to
correspond with what it believed to be the new security
requirements of the post-Cold War world. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In contrast, the Clinton administration's policies reflect a
belief that the short-term possibility of a missile attack on the
United States is highly unlikely. While TMD continued to garner
attention, the Bush administration's priority of establishing a
national missile defense was downgraded. Instead, President
Clinton chose to preserve the existing terms of the ABM Treaty,
calling it "the bedrock of strategic stability." The Clinton
administration considered maintenance of the strategic nuclear
deterrence provided by the ABM Treaty during the Cold War to be a
crucial and sufficient hedge against post-Cold War uncertainties.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Following the 1994 mid-term elections, the political tide again
turned on the issue of national missile defense. The "Contract
with America" of the victorious congressional Republicans
promised to speed development of anti-ballistic missile defenses
on both the theater and national levels. With Republican
majorities in the House and the Senate, 1995 witnessed
congressional approval of funding for a national missile defense
project. Congress also rejected language recommended by the White
House stipulating that this NMD program would not abrogate the
ABM Treaty as it is currently written. The Clinton administration
has threatened to veto any legislation that breaks with the terms
of the ABM Treaty. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The effectiveness of any military technology must be evaluated
not only against the standard of its economic and opportunity
costs but also in terms of likely countermeasures potential
adversaries will develop. Effective defense of U.S. cities and
troops abroad against WMD would be a massive benefit. National
missile defense may be available only at significant cost. The
establishment of an effective national missile defense could lead
potential adversaries to circumvent such a system by delivering
their weapons through unconventional means. </blockquote><hr>

Conventional arms control on the model of CFE holds potential for
increasing stability in regions of tension throughout the world.
A particularly important application of the CFE's lessons is the
Dayton accords ending the fighting in Bosnia, which set forth
target dates for agreement on verifiable reduction in the same
types of military equipment covered by CFE. The CFE holds lessons
for the Korean Peninsula, where an effective conventional arms
control regime would have to be an important part of any lasting
package to replace the 1953 armistice agreement. Conventional
arms control could also be used to make conflict less likely in
the Middle East, South Asia, and Latin America.

Building Measures</H3><p><A

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Confidence- and security-building measures (CSBMs) are another
instrument by which negotiations with potential adversaries can
serve the U.S. interest to reduce the risk of conflict. They are
used to clarify intentions rather than limit weapons. When
neither side of a dispute wants war, it is possible to mutually
enhance confidence that neither side will start a war by making
the actions of both militaries more transparent. CSBMs aim to
create less-threatening force postures in this manner. While such
measures do not eliminate the risk of attack, they reduce the
risk that precipitous incidents or inadvertent escalation will
lead to war. CSBMs clarify the intentions of certain military
operations (such as field exercises), enhance communications
between potential belligerents, and establish guidelines
concerning military operations susceptible to misunderstanding.
Restraints on military operations may also play a role in
confidence- and security-building regimes. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like other arms control instruments, CSBM regimes depend on
political will. All parties must agree that the agreement serves
their interests. Thus, CSBMs can only be effective when none of
the parties intends to launch an attack. If and when this
necessary condition fails and military planners on one side
prepare to launch an attack, they must choose between openly
renouncing the regime or simply violating it. The unwillingness
of CSBM regime members to fulfill their obligations acts as a
trip-wire, alerting other members that the regime is failing and
must be adjusted or abandoned.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Europe has been home to the most fully developed CSBM program
since 1975, owing to the efforts of the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)--now known as the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Along with all
European countries, the U.S. participated in the CSBM regime of
Vienna Document 1999 and in the Vienna-based Forum on Security
Cooperation. Over the last thirty years, however, CSBMs were
first tested in the Middle East, in connection with the
Israeli-Egyptian agreement on the Sinai. CSBMs of a sort are in
place between Pakistan and India, and have been the subject of
thus far fruitless discussions between North and South Korea.
CSBMs can only be effective when all parties want them to work.
When crises become acute, CSBMs have already failed.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">Nonproliferation</H3><p><A
HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nonproliferation is the means by which countries are discouraged
from acquiring certain types of weapons through negotiated
agreements and the establishment of international norms in order
to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and
their delivery vehicles, as well as related dangerous
technologies. Judging that it is in the vital interest of the
United States to keep nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons
out of the hands of additional countries as well as terrorists,
the United States has aggressively pursued nonproliferation
measures for several decades.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While now widely accepted, the international norm against nuclear
proliferation did not spontaneously appear. Estimates in the
mid-1960s were that there might be as many as thirty countries
with nuclear weapons by the late 1970s. To forestall this
possibility, the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT) was negotiated. The NPT struck a bargain between
the nuclear weapon "haves" and "have nots." The non-nuclear
weapons states pledged to forgo such weapons (Article II) and to
accept internationally monitored safeguards on their nuclear
programs (Article III). In return, the nuclear weapons states
pledged to offer the non-nuclear weapons states assistance in the
development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy (Article IV)
and to "pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures
relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early
date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and
complete disarmament under strict and effective international
control" (Article VI).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Five countries had openly developed nuclear weapons before the
NPT was negotiated, but after the NPT came into force in 1970,
this trend stopped abruptly. India tested a nuclear device
(euphemistically called a "peaceful nuclear explosion") in 1974,
Israel developed a nuclear arsenal of at least several dozen
weapons, and it is likely that Pakistan has the capability to
constitute nuclear arsenals on short order. However, even these
three nuclear threshold states, who have never signed the NPT,
have not openly deployed nuclear arsenals. South Africa
clandestinely built a small nuclear arsenal, but dismantled it
and joined the NPT. Other states have taken actions that indicate
an interest in a nuclear weapons option, but none has gone as far
as the four mentioned above. The NPT attached a political cost to
nuclear proliferation, even for countries not party to the
treaty. It also established incentives not to proliferate, like
peaceful nuclear cooperation for treaty parties and enhanced
confidence that neighboring states are not developing nuclear
weapons. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The international nonproliferation environment changed with the
end of the Cold War. The end of the superpower arms race
increased the relative importance of smaller nuclear threats just
as the nonproliferation discipline the superpowers had imposed on
their client states was evaporating. This change was highlighted
after the Gulf War, when Iraq's program for developing WMD was
discovered to be of much greater scope than previously believed,
despite monitoring of the Iraqi program. In response, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)--the body responsible
for monitoring safeguards on civil nuclear programs to prevent
diversion to weapons programs--upgraded its safeguards program
and became more aggressive in its pursuit of information,
reaffirming its right to conduct special inspections wherever it
chose.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the great post-Cold War successes of U.S. nonproliferation
policy was the persuasion of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to
return the nuclear weapons on their soil to Russia and to join
the NPT as non-nuclear weapons states. If these states had not
renounced the former Soviet nuclear weapons on their territories,
significant strategic nuclear arsenals would have remained in
their possession, which might someday have threatened the United
States. Further, if these states had chosen to retain nuclear
weapons, START I could not have been brought into force, and
further strategic arms reductions between the United States and
Russia would not be possible.<p>

When the NPT was negotiated several countries were unwilling to
accept a permanent treaty, demanding instead a review conference
after twenty-five years. In May 1995, the nearly 180 parties to
the NPT met in New York and decided to extend the NPT
indefinitely. The treaty called only for a majority of the
parties to decide, but the United States and its allies had
engaged in a global diplomatic campaign to gain widespread
support for the treaty, which resulted in a consensus decision to
extend the NPT without conditions. A limited extension had been
suggested by many developing states as a way to lever further
arms control progress from the nuclear weapons states.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Next Steps on Nuclear Nonproliferation.</i> In addition to
indefinitely extending the NPT, the 1995 conference endorsed the
IAEA's "9312" plan for strengthened safeguards and increased
cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It also set forth
a series of goals on continued reductions in nuclear arsenals in
the direction of ultimate abolition, pursuit of an agreement on
the termination of production of fissile material for weapons
purposes, pursuit of the creation of more nuclear weapon free
zones, and achievement of a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT)
by the end of 1996.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States no longer produces fissile material for nuclear
weapons purposes and has placed a significant quantity of nuclear
material under IAEA safeguards. President Clinton has urged that
a fissile material cutoff treaty be negotiated by which other
countries would commit to do the same under an international
verification regime. Such a treaty would cap the amount of
material available for nuclear explosives. More important it
could bring the nuclear programs of non-NPT states--specifically,
India, Israel, and Pakistan--under international safeguards for
the first time. These states, which refuse to sign the NPT in
part because of the perception that it is discriminatory
(allowing some states to possess nuclear weapons while forbidding
others), may be more willing to sign a cutoff treaty that applies
to all states.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States is party to one nuclear weapon free zone
(NWFZ), the one in Latin America established by the Treaty of
Tlatelolco. The five nuclear-weapons states are party to its
protocols, in which they pledge to observe the nuclear-free
status of the zone by not deploying nuclear weapons within it and
promising never to use nuclear weapons against a state (a
negative security assurance) that is a party to the zone and is
in compliance with its treaty obligations. The 1986 Treaty of
Raratonga established a nuclear-free zone for the South Pacific
and included a pledge not to test nuclear weapons in the zone.
Thus far, only Russia and China, among the five nuclear weapons
states, are parties to this treaty. French nuclear tests at
Mururoa Atoll within the zone have sparked severe international
protests.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Completion of a CTBT in 1996 is considered by many a litmus test
of the compliance of the nuclear weapons states with their NPT
extension commitments. In August 1995, President Clinton decided
that, rather than seeking to conduct very small nuclear tests
which might have been allowed under a CTBT, the United States
would seek a zero-yield CTBT. The President made this decision
based in part on a report by the JASONs, a group of senior
scientists and nuclear weapon designers, which determined that a
high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of the
U.S. arsenal could be maintained in the absence of nuclear
testing through a sophisticated, science-based stockpile
stewardship program. This decision was made with the caveat that
the U.S. could withdraw from a CTBT if this level of confidence
could not be maintained, a development that President Clinton
views as very unlikely. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States is seeking a CTBT for several reasons. First,
it would make nuclear proliferation more difficult by imposing a
verifiable international ban on nuclear testing. Secondly, it
would support the global nuclear nonproliferation regime by
demonstrating the good faith of the nuclear weapons states.
Thirdly, the United States has already conducted over a thousand
nuclear tests, and it is questionable if further testing would be
worth the political costs.<hr>

<i>Biological and Chemical Weapons.</i> The U.S. is one of 175
signatories of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which
entered into effect in 1974. The treaty sought to eliminate a
type of weapon thought, at the time of the treaty's signing in
1972, to be militarily useless because of its unpredictability,
and therefore suitable only for terrorists. However, with
advances in research, this assessment may be changing. Thus, an
ongoing international effort strives to enhance the BWC's
verification provisions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nearly 160 states have signed the 1993 Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC). It will come into force once it is ratified by
sixty-five states. The United States has not yet ratified the
CWC, and many other nations are waiting to see what Washington
will do before proceeding with ratification. Through the
ratification of this treaty, the United States will gain a
prohibition on the so-called poor man's atomic weapon. However,
there is concern about the cost, excessive intrusiveness of
inspections in the United States, and the ultimate effectiveness
of inspections.<p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The collapse of the Soviet Union and rising concerns over the
future economic prosperity of the U.S. have resulted in
substantial changes in the administration of the controls on
dual-use items. The regulatory authority under the Export
Administration Act (EAA) was not extended by Congress before it
expired in 1995, and these controls are administered under the
provisions of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act
(IEEPA).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although the terms under which Congress will ultimately renew the
EAA are still uncertain, no one seriously questions the need for
continuing to impose export controls on dual-use items or the
justification for changing the manner in which these were
administered during the Cold War. In short, in 1995, these
controls were in a state of transition, with many changes already
in effect, others in process, and some hinging on future
congressional decisions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In response to the emergence of regional stability concerns as
presenting the most likely threats to world security, emphasis
has shifted from controls primarily designed to restrict
conventional military buildup of communist nations to those
primarily designed to curtail the proliferation of WMD in Third
World nations. Export controls alone cannot prevail against a
state determined to build or obtain WMD. Such controls can,
however, make proliferation more costly, time-consuming, or
visible. By raising the political and economic costs of
proliferation, export controls can complement diplomatic efforts
to discourage proliferation. By slowing or exposing would-be
proliferators, export controls can buy time for
counterproliferation efforts.<hr>

Safeguarding Nuclear Technology</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Distinguishing between a peaceful energy program and one that can
produce nuclear weapons is often a difficult task. The
responsibility for ensuring that NPT parties' nuclear activities
are subjected to safeguards and are directed toward peaceful
purposes lies with the IAEA. IAEA safeguards are a comprehensive
system of accounting and reporting procedures, on-site
inspections, nuclear material measurements, and containment and
surveillance techniques. As a result of the discovery of the wide
scope of Iraq's nuclear weapons development program, the IAEA
strengthened its safeguards system. The new safeguards
enhancements, known as the "9312" program, require increased
access for IAEA inspectors and reaffirmation of the IAEA's right
to conduct "special inspections" of undeclared sites, more
information provided to the IAEA on nuclear activities,
environmental monitoring to detect nuclear materials and
facilities, increased cooperation by states, and greater use of
advanced technology, including unattended surveillance and
measurement instruments and remote transmission of data.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reactor Technology. The most common type of nuclear reactor is
the light-water reactor (LWR). LWRs use ordinary water as a
moderator (a component of nuclear reactors that slows neutrons,
increasing their chances of fissioning) and as a coolant (a
substance circulated through a reactor to remove or transfer
heat), and use LEU as fuel. Light-water reactors must also be
shut down to be refueled, which makes it easier to ascertain that
no materials have been diverted for military purposes.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another type of reactor that is in widespread use is the
heavy-water reactor (HWR). It uses water that contains more than
the natural proportion of heavy hydrogen atoms (also known as
deuterium) to ordinary hydrogen atoms as both a moderator and
coolant. Heavy water absorbs fewer neutrons than normal water,
making a chain reaction easier and allowing the use of natural
uranium as fuel. The most popular type of HWR is the CANDU
(Canadian deuterium-uranium reactor). These reactors do not need
to be shut down in order to be refueled, which makes it more
difficult to determine if materials have been diverted.
Fortunately, the IAEA has developed safeguards that allow such
diversions to be detected, and since the CANDU uses natural
rather than enriched uranium, the danger of materials being used
for weapons purposes is somewhat lessened.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A third reactor type, high-temperature gas-cooled reactors
(HTGRs, or gas-cooled reactors--GCRs), uses graphite as a
moderator and helium rather than water as a coolant. HTGRs use
HEU for fuel, which makes them more efficient than reactors that
use LEU or natural uranium, but also makes them an obvious source
of nonproliferation concern.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another type of reactor, the breeder reactor, uses plutonium as
fuel and actually produces more plutonium in its operation than
it consumes. The large amounts of plutonium that would result
from a commercial breeder reactor program have serious
consequences for any attempts to stem proliferation. In 1995,
only Japan had plans to use breeder reactors on a large scale.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The greatest dangers of proliferation come from enrichment and
reprocessing facilities. As noted above, uranium enriched to
various levels is often used as fuel in reactors. Some states
have built their own means of enriching uranium rather than rely
on outside sources of fuel. This raises the worry that in
addition to producing only LEU for use in reactors, these states
could also produce HEU or plutonium for weapons purposes. There
are four different enrichment techniques in use or being
researched: gaseous diffusion, gas centrifuge, aerodynamic, and
laser. Gaseous diffusion was developed in the 1940s as part of
the Manhattan Project. It requires huge plants and enormous
amounts of electric power to operate, making it unlikely that it
would be used to covertly develop material for use in a weapon.
Gas centrifuge technology, on the other hand, requires only a
fraction of the power and can be built in a much smaller
facility. This makes it efficient for use in the nuclear power
industry, but also lends itself to clandestine development of
weapons. Aerodynamic methods (the two primary being the "Becker
Nozzle" and "Helikon") require less space than the gas centrifuge
process, allowing them to be easily hidden, but demand even more
power than gaseous diffusion plants, making them an unattractive
means for secretly developing weapons. A new technique using
lasers to separate isotopes is being experimented with that would
consume very little energy and could be carried out in a single
step, requiring only a small facility in which to operate. The
laser enrichment process could easily be adapted for covertly
producing weapons-grade material, but the complex and difficult
technology needed to build it represents a significant barrier.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reprocessing plants are designed to recycle the residual U-235
and plutonium from spent fuel, usually through chemical means.
Several countries operate reprocessing plants because it provides
an alternative to storing nuclear waste. Reprocessing is cause
for great concern in regards to proliferation because it produces
uranium and plutonium that are highly purified and in convenient
chemical forms. Although the purified uranium would not be
weapons grade, any plutonium emerging from a reprocessing plant
would be suitable for direct use in nuclear weapons.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the growing concerns over maintaining economic security as a
large component of national security, the Trade Promotion
Coordinating Committee's National Export Strategy led to the
elimination of restrictions on exports of many commodities,
particularly in the sectors of chemicals, software, computers,
and telecommunications equipment. The strategy focused on the
adverse economic impact on U.S. firms and industries of denying
export authorizations. It called for expediting procedures to
ensure prompt insurance of the licenses, simplifying Export
Administration Regulations to make these more user friendly, and
reducing the fragmentation of administration responsibilities
among several U.S. government agencies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, Congress allowed the executive branch broad
authority to administer export controls on dual-use items. The
trend is clearly moving toward limiting this discretion. Whereas
in the past, export control decisions have always been exempt
from judicial review, under the pending bills to renew the EAA,
including the administration bill, the exporter would be afforded
the right of redress in the courts.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The spread of high technology across the world makes unilateral
controls less effective than before, and these are particularly
damaging to U.S. exporters. Accordingly, unilateral controls are
being eliminated, except in limited circumstances (such as with
Iran), while the U.S. takes the lead in increasing the
effectiveness of multilateral controls.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Principal export control regimes and groups are:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* NPT Exporters Committee, or Zangger Committee, as it is often
referred to, was created to coordinate implementation of the
NPT's Article III.2. This article requires each NPT party to
ensure that IAEA safeguards are applied to their exports to
non-nuclear weapons states of source or special fissionable
nuclear material and "especially designed or prepared" equipment
and material. One of the main activities of the Zangger Committee
since its creation has been to produce and clarify the control
list, often called the "trigger list." Membership of the NPT
Exporters Committee consists of twenty-nine states, whose
representatives meet twice a year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) was created to coordinate nuclear
export controls in a multilateral forum not directly tied to the
NPT. NSG guidelines require that a recipient non-nuclear weapons
state accept safeguards on all its nuclear activities, not just
the exported item, as a condition for the supply of nuclear
material, equipment, and technology. The guidelines also
emphasize the importance of exercising restraint in the export of
sensitive commodities and technology, such as enrichment and
reprocessing, and call for consultation in cases where such
exports might increase the risk of conflict or instability. The
NSG meets several times a year and has thirty-one members.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* "Australia Group" is an informal forum of states, chaired by
Australia, whose goal is to discourage and impede CW and BW
proliferation by harmonizing national export controls on CW
precursor chemicals, BW pathogens, and CBW dual-use production
equipment; sharing information on CBW proliferation developments;
and seeking other ways to curb the use of CBW. The group has
established common export controls for CBW and has issued an
informal "warning list" of dual-use CBW precursors, bulk
chemicals, and CBW-related equipment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The purpose of the
MTCR is to arrest missile proliferation worldwide through export
controls on missiles and their related technologies. It is
neither a treaty nor an international agreement; rather, the MTCR
is a voluntary arrangement among twenty-seven countries that
share a common interest in stemming missile proliferation and
controlling exports of missile-related items in accordance with
common guidelines and a technology annex. The MTCR originally
controlled missiles and unmanned air vehicles capable of carrying
a 500 kg payload to a range of 300 km; it has since been extended
to cover missiles capable of delivering any weapon of mass
destruction (nuclear, biological, or chemical) of any weight to
any range.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM)
was a multilateral export control regime established in 1949 to
maintain common controls on items that could enhance the military
capabilities of the then Communist Bloc nations. Presidents
Clinton and Yeltsin agreed at the Vancouver summit to eliminate
export control relics of the Cold War and to establish in their
place a partnership between the East and West in this area. COCOM
formally ended on March 1994, but members agreed to keep national
controls on former COCOM-controlled items until the new regime is
established. On the basis of a September 1995 meeting in the
Hague, the "New Forum" post-COCOM regime is scheduled to come
into existence in January 1996, with Russia and several East
European states among the twenty-eight founding members. It is
based on the principle of exchanging information about the
transfer of arms and sensitive dual-use goods and technologies. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to stopping the transfer of technology with military
applications to potential adversaries or aggressive states, U.S.
export control policy also aims to monitor technology flows that
are acceptable in themselves but that need to be tracked to
prevent diversion and to ensure that U.S. forces recognize the
military capabilities they might face in any given region.
Occasional attempts have been made to control the conventional
arms trade, the most recent being the 1991 agreement among the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to notify
each other of arms sales to the Middle East. This agreement
collapsed in the wake of China's withdrawal after the United
States announced that it would sell F-16s to Taiwan in 1992.
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead6">Conclusions</H2><p><A

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While successful arms control agreements can limit the spread and
reduce the number of weapons and otherwise enhance security and
stability, standing alone they seldom prevent a state that is
determined to acquire such weapons from doing so. They can,
however, raise the political or economic costs to such a degree
that many states will forgo the use or acquisition of these
weapons. In this regard, the NPT is a shining example of the
effectiveness of U.S. arms control efforts. It has codified and
strengthened the international norm against nuclear proliferation
such that no state has been willing to openly violate the treaty,
and very few states have attempted to skirt it even covertly.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whereas arms control agreements at the height of the Cold War
were designed to cap or limit buildups and modernizations, the
post-Cold War role of arms control agreements is to manage
weapons reductions that are already underway, because countries
are cutting spending in what they perceive as a less threatening
environment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite the end of the Cold War, Russia remains indispensable to
successful arms control on such issues as dismantling the nuclear
weapons legacy of the Cold War and working out new arrangements
for European security to supplement the CFE Treaty. A major issue
is adjusting Cold War-era agreements to retain their arms control
accomplishments while permitting responses to the changed
post-Cold War threats, e.g., permitting defenses against rouges
with missiles within the framework of the ABM Treaty and
promoting stability in the Caucasus while preserving CFE limits
on conventional forces.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In zones of regional conflict, the pressing arms control problem
is to prevent the spread of advanced weapons technology. Global
regimes to contain or roll back weapons of mass destruction are
more or less in place, with the exception of a comprehensive test
ban treaty and confirmation of signed treaties. Progress has been
made to safeguard nuclear technology and material, as well as to
limit the spread of missile technology. Efforts are underway to
supplement these agreements with cooperative security-building
measures. But the success of these regimes may depend on progress
towards resolving regional conflicts, such as those in Northeast
Asia, the Middle East, and South Asia.<hr>

<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Defense engagement is a term that is
being
used by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to describe
the long-standing political-military issue of the nature, scope
and
scale of noncombat military and defense support of U.S. foreign
policy in peacetime, a role that has evolved from many changes in
political and professional thinking.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The
Cold
War national strategy of containment demanded the presence of a
modern, trained U.S. military capability worldwide, maintenance
of
its readiness for combat, and help to friendly and allied
countries
around the globe to develop stronger national defenses. The
United
States initially provided a bargain-basement shortcut to military
modernization with its World War II and Korean War stocks of
inexpensive but reliable arms and a wide range of associated
military equipment. Under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program,
which became Security Assistance in the early 1960s, the U.S.
provided on a grant basis or sold a wide range of defense
articles
and services, including professional education and technical
training. By the early 1980s, however, Security Assistance had
become a prisoner of its own bureaucracy, leading one Unified
Commander to observe that its programs "satisfy the requirements
of
trying to deal with Congress, but do not necessarily help us as
we
work with our regional allies in carrying out our [national
security] responsibilities." <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> During the Cold
War, the United States also conducted low-cost and low-profile
political-military activities in other regions of the world, such
as the provision of humanitarian and advisory assistance, and
maintained service-to-service contacts. Yet, these initiatives
remained marginal in DOD's resource-allocation process and the
military's doctrinal thinking. For years, the armed services
minimized these nonstandard programs and criticized them for
diverting resources and undermining force readiness. <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> As of the mid-1990s, however, the situation has
begun to change. The defense community's past resistance to using
noncombat means to project U.S. influence is slowly giving way.
The
difference has been a post-Cold War national-security strategy
emphasizing active leadership and involvement worldwide, also
known
as engagement and enlargement (of the community of democracies).
This strategy challenges the Defense Department not only to
ensure
that the armed forces maintain the capability to protect U.S.
interests with force but also to employ the department's civilian
and military organizational, professional, and institutional
assets
to support the National Security Strategy's goals of security,
economic prosperity, and democratic growth--goals that do not
translate easily into classical defense and military concepts. <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Faced with these new realities, the 1995
<I>National Military Strategy,</I> prepared by the Joint Chiefs
of
Staff, identifies "peacetime engagement" as one of three sets of
tasks for achieving the military objectives of promoting
stability
and thwarting aggression. This term, the publication says,
describes a broad range of noncombat activities undertaken by
U.S.
armed forces, which demonstrate commitment, improve collective
military capabilities, promote democratic ideals, relieve
suffering, and in many other ways enhance regional stability. <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> A little-noticed trend toward greater innovation
in selectively using military forces and defense resources in
peacetime outside of the traditional framework of military
assistance had already emerged in the Americas during the 1980s,
as
U.S. Southern Command developed more immediately responsive and
effective forms of defense involvement in order to support the
Reagan administration's Central American policy. These included
using active duty, reserve, and National Guard units to conduct
engineering exercises and military humanitarian deployments for
training in the Caribbean Basin. By 1987, Southern Command had a
catalogue of twenty-seven defense activities, including
security-assistance programs, to offer U.S. country teams in the
Americas. Other unified commands have since adopted, and adapted,
many of the same activities and programs. <hr><blockquote>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Foreign Military Interaction <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Early in 1995, the Joint Staff defined foreign military
interaction
as "initiatives whereby U.S. defense personnel--by direction of
US
Defense authorities and in coordination with the US country
team--interact with foreign defense personnel on a systemic and
cooperative basis to achieve national security objectives." Most
of
the instruments examined in this chapter fall under the heading
of
Foreign Military Interaction (FMI), and several were on a 1995
Joint Staff list identifying sixteen separate FMI programs.
However, the Joint Staff's list is not all-inclusive; for
example,
it excludes the Excess Defense Articles and Direct Commercial
Sales
programs. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Successful FMI programs depend upon
close cooperation between Defense and State personnel at the
regional and national levels. Ideally, the geographic CINCs,
working within policy guidelines set in Washington and
collaborating with U.S. ambassadors and country teams within
their
areas of responsibility, tailor programs and activities to meet
changing local and regional requirements, thus anticipating
trends
rather than reacting to events as they occur.  <P ALIGN="CENTER">

</H2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This chapter examines two groups of
initiatives under the conceptual umbrella of defense engagement.
The first comprises Foreign Military Interaction (FMI), which
includes military assistance, military education, and joint
planning, exercises and operations. The second group combines DOD
programs that constitute "defense diplomacy." <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Military Assistance  </H3> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The United States
offers grant and commercial-sales programs to enable friendly
nations to acquire U.S. military equipment, services, and
training for legitimate self-defense and burden-sharing purposes.
Adequate military capabilities among allies decrease the
likelihood that U.S. forces will be called on to intervene in a
crisis and improve the odds that U.S. forces will find a
favorable (interoperable) situation should intervention prove
necessary.  <p>
<b>Arms Deliveries to Devoloping Nations by Recipient, 1987-
94</B><p>Deliveries to leding recipients (in millions of current
US Dollars)*<p><img src="ch09a.gif" align="left"> DOD manages a
number of congressionally authorized military-equipment programs.
Known during the Cold War as Security Assistance, these programs
are now called Foreign Operations Assistance. This term also
refers to a range of nondefense programs discussed in other
chapters, such as the Economic Support Fund (ESF), migration and
refugee assistance, and international narcotics control. This
section discusses two elements on the Joint Staff's FMI
list--Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and Foreign Military Sales
(FMS)--as well as Excess Defense Articles (EDA) and Direct
Commercial Sales (DCS). To avoid confusion with the nondefense
aspects of the Foreign Operations Assistance, the term "military
assistance" is used here. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Since the
mid-1980s, trends have developed in four areas that affect
military assistance programs: <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> *
<I>Congressional interest.</I> A trend toward greater
congressional oversight of national security policy begun in the
1970s continues in the mid-1990s. Increasingly, Senate and House
authorization committees oriented toward foreign policy, as well
as appropriation subcommittees, use legislation to delimit and
guide implementation of military assistance programs. They
direct, for example, the inclusion (or exclusion) of specific
countries and earmark the level of funding for specific states.
These four legislative bodies often require the executive branch
to provide notification before specific military assistance
initiatives can be implemented, such as before lethal equipment
and air frames are provided or sold to particular countries, and
when there is an intent to give or sell excess defense articles
to any foreign government.  <p><b>Arms Deliveries to Developing
Nations by Supplier, 1987-94<p>
</b>(billions of current dollars)<p><img src="ch09b.gif"
align="left">><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> * <I>Foreign interest.</I> The
success of the United States in the Persian Gulf war has
significantly increased foreign interest in U.S. military
doctrine, equipment, and training. Many governments share the
expanded, post-Cold War U.S. security policy agenda--covering
such issues as democracy, drugs, and peacekeeping--leading to
many requests for military equipment, technical training, and
professional education. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> * <I>Funding.</I>
Since the mid-1980s, congressional funding of the two principal
military assistance programs, FMF and International Military
Education and Training (IMET), has steadily declined. Foreign
governments today, freed from the ideological constraints of the
Cold War, have become more price conscious and often shop for the
best arrangements to purchase equipment and training. This has
resulted in a shift toward FMS and DCS; toward alternative U.S.
sources, like the Excess Defense Articles program; and toward the
use of other suppliers, such as Russia, France, and the United
Kingdom. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <img src="ch0905.gif" align="left">*
<I>Arms transfers.</I> Over the seven-year period from 1987 to
1994, the value of international arms deliveries to developing
nations steadily declined. In 1994, the trend reached its low
point of $14.4 billion (of which $6.7 billion were U.S. sales),
slightly more than a quarter of the 1987 total. This pattern
reflects the conclusion of the Iran-Iraq War, the end of the Cold
War, and the winding down of other regional conflicts. While many
major U.S. arms clients in the Middle East ordered substantial
amounts of equipment after Desert Storm, deliveries are
proceeding slowly, partly because of the need to absorb equipment
but mostly because of budget difficulties. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Foreign Military Financing (FMF).</I> FMF has long been the
primary means by which the U.S. government finances the purchase
of U.S. defense articles and services by select friends and
allies. However, Washington has changed its procedures from a
loan system at near market interest rates, the norm in the
mid-1980s, to a grant arrangement. The latter method is intended
to help governments receiving FMF to devote scarce financial
resources to economic development. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The
initial force and effectiveness of this program worldwide have
been lost gradually since the mid-1980s as a result of two
trends. First, congressional appropriations have steadily
decreased from $5.2 billion in FY 1986 to $3.2 billion in FY
1995. Secondly, annual legislation has fenced increasingly larger
percentages of this funding. In 1995, more than 98 percent of FMF
was for Israel and Egypt, the main recipients ($3.1 billion), and
for several small, specialized programs, such as aid to build
democracy in Haiti ($3 million). This left only $25.7 million
available in 1995 for discretionary allocation among eligible
countries. Foreign Military Financing aided twenty-eight
countries in 1984; eleven years later, it assisted nine nations
and a demining program. The termination of most country programs
has had a debilitating influence on the quality and scope of U.S.
defense relations with many Latin American, East Asian, and
Middle Eastern countries. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>Foreign Military
Sales (FMS).</I> The FMS program enables friendly nations to
buy<B> </B>U.S. military equipment, services, and training.
Purchases are made with some U.S. financial assistance for
eligible countries. As measured by agreements signed rather than
by deliveries, FMS averaged $11.5 billion annually between FY
1984 and FY 1992. After a one-year jump in FY 1993 to $32.4
billion due to sales to the Middle East, FMS returned to a lower
level of $13.2 billion in FY 1994 and an estimated $8 billion in
FY 1995. FMS also covers the sale of professional military
education, which is consistently high, accounting for well over
50 percent of the international students in DOD schools. By
providing foreign forces with U.S. hardware, using U.S. military
personnel to familiarize foreign officers with its operation and
maintenance, and by educating future military leaders in the
United States, FMS fosters and reinforces the idea of
interoperability with the U.S. armed forces. DOD also benefits
from the tendencies of foreign sales to keep important production
lines running and lower the unit costs of key weapons systems. <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The FMS program is affected by a congressional
restriction on the transfer of FMS-purchased material to third
parties, which hinders the disposal of obsolescent material and
the purchase of new equipment to replace it. In addition, the
Arms Export Control Act requires that the costs of implementing
the FMS program be paid by FMS customer countries. An
administrative surcharge of 3 percent is applied to most sales. A
5 percent rate is applied to nonstandard items and services. In
addition, a logistics-support charge of 3.1 percent is also
applied on certain deliveries of spare parts, equipment
modifications, secondary support equipment, and supplies. <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>Direct Commercial Sales (DCS).</I> Some
states prefer to rely on direct commercial purchases of U.S.
military hardware, training, and technical assistance from
defense contractors. These companies must first obtain export
licenses, which require State Department approval. Estimated
commercial sales in FY 1995 were $5.9 billion. During the period
1989-1995, DCS purchases averaged about 31 percent of purchases
through the FMS program. The trend in the mid-1990s is toward
growth in DCS relative to FMS. Depending on the type of equipment
or services purchased as well as possible legal or policy
limitations, this approach offered cheaper arrangements and fewer
bureaucratic obstacles.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>Excess Defense
Articles (EDA).</I> Defense articles no longer needed by the U.S.
armed forces--ranging from rations and uniforms to used vehicles,
cargo aircraft, and ships--may be sold to eligible countries and
international organizations under the FMS program, or transferred
without cost under provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961. An elaborate framework of rules governs the EDA. A joint
Defense-State EDA Coordinating Committee, for example, matches
requirements with assets and U.S. policy priorities, trying to
ensure some equity in distribution of items among countries.
Several Central and Eastern European countries are eligible to
receive only nonlethal EDA. A limit exists on the annual value of
EDA that a foreign government may acquire by sales or grant--in
fiscal year 1995, this limit was $250 million (although
exceptions are made for high-cost items, such as ships). And
Congress must be notified of all EDA sales or grants. In fiscal
year 1994, total EDA amounted to $1.1 billion, a decrease
compared with the average of $1.5 billion in FY 1991-93. The
decline reflects the existence of budgetary constraints in many
countries interested in EDA, as well as a certain amount of
frustration with the bureaucracy surrounding this program.
Morocco, Turkey, Greece, and Israel were the largest recipients
of grant EDA in 1994. Given the ineligibility of most countries
for FMF funding, both State and DOD are seeking ways to make
better use of EDA as an instrument of policy, particularly the
program's ability to support developing countries with limited
defense budgets. As the downsizing and modernization of the U.S.
armed forces continues to slow down, fewer articles will be
available in the immediate future, increasing the competition for
EDA. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In sum, military assistance programs
reflect increasing congressional involvement in the direction and
details of U.S. foreign policy through its control of the
foreign-operations budget. When the executive and legislative
branches agree on objectives and the concept for using FMF and
EDA as instruments of policy, proactive assistance tends to take
place, although affecting fewer countries and at lower levels of
funding than during the Cold War era. Many foreign governments,
becoming aware of Congress's influential role, have begun to make
their case strongly on Capitol Hill as well as to U.S.
ambassadors. There is flexibility in this DOD category of policy
instruments, but it is found in programs that are outside the
formal Foreign Operations budget process: in Foreign Military
Sales and, particularly, in Direct Commercial Sales--programs
over which State and Defense can exercise more independent
control.  <H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead3">Military
Education</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>International Military Education and
Training (IMET).</I> The premise underlying IMET is that
educating younger foreign military officers in the United States
invests in the future promotion of U.S. interests. Graduates may
rise to positions of prominence within the military, government,
or business community of their countries, and Washington desires
access to these future leaders. Furthermore, the United States
wants to help emerging leaders utilize their defense resources
more effectively and encourage self-reliance in national defense.
<p>
<b>International Military Education and Training by Region<p></B>
(in millions of current year dollars)<p><img src="ch0907.gif"><P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> More than 100,000 students from 114 countries
have attended IMET courses in 1976-1995, averaging 5,500 annually
in 1976-1989 and 3,800 annually in 1990-95. The attraction is
twofold: grantees gain insight into U.S. combat techniques as
well as learn how the armed forces fulfill their role in a
functioning democracy. Schooling is highly sought after by
foreign governments: interest far exceeds funding levels and
available classroom seats.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In 1991, Congress
legislated a variant of IMET for education on resource
management, civilian control, military law, and regard for human
rights. This initiative, entitled Expanded IMET (E-IMET), allows
civilians with defense-related interests from foreign government
agencies, legislatures, and nongovernmental organizations to
participate in IMET programs. The legislation has also fostered a
popular and highly effective series of courses taught overseas by
mobile education teams. E-IMET shows great promise in its ability
to bring senior civilian and military officials together in their
own country, often for the first time, for shared,
confidence-building educational experiences. The introduction of
E-IMET, however, has decreased the amount of money available for
traditional professional military education.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Regional Study Centers.</I> This relatively inexpensive FMI
program, begun in 1993, allows regional unified commanders to
offer academic courses on defense planning and management in
democratic societies for mid- to senior-level foreign military
personnel and, when possible, civilians. The first regional study
facility chartered by the Secretary of Defense was the U.S.
European Command's George C. Marshall Center in Garmisch,
Germany. It focuses on instructing personnel from Central and
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In 1995 an
Asia-Pacific Center was being established in Hawaii to support
the U.S. Pacific Command. The aim of this facility is to foster a
broader understanding of U.S. military, diplomatic, and economic
interrelationships in the Pacific. <hr><b>IMET Country Programs
1985-96</b><p><img src="ch09c.gif"><hr><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In
sum, these two initiatives are solid investments in the
future--the future stability of many friendly countries worldwide
and future U.S. access to and interaction with senior government
officials in these countries.<p> <H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a
name="subhead4">Joint Planning, Exercises and Operations</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
 </H3> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> A group of loosely related, relatively
new Defense Department programs for joint planning, exercises,
and operations existed on a small scale during the Cold War,
although they became more common in Central America in the 1980s.
These programs have become common practice with many more
countries since the end of the Cold War.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Combined Planning and Exercises.</I> Sponsored by either the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, unified commanders, or the
military services, combined planning and exercises focus on
improving U.S. military readiness while fostering
interoperability between U.S. forces and potential military
partners. These high-profile events build interpersonal contacts
and force collaboration among participants, outcomes that are
integral to successful coalition operations. The roots of the
spectacular allied achievements during the Gulf War can be found
in a series of increasingly more sophisticated regional exercises
during the 1980s, which built a foundation of operational and
logistical planning and cooperation. The trend in the mid-1990s
toward reduced forward-basing of U.S. military forces worldwide
increases the importance of the relationships that grow out of
combined planning and multilateral exercises. These opportunities
also become important confidence-building measures among
neighboring states. <p><b>United States and Royal Thai Marines

This category includes exercise-related construction, a dimension
that provides a tangible example of U.S. commitment to a country
and can facilitate subsequent U.S. deployments in response to
regional crises. U.S. Southern Command used exercise-related
construction strategically in the 1980s to develop Honduran
airfield and port capabilities to deter Nicaraguan aggression
against its neighbors, while creating the transportation
infrastructure needed to support a U.S. military response. Joint
and combined planning and exercise activities tend to be
expensive and often, because of their strategic importance, drain
funding intended for other defense programs.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Traditional CINC Programs (TCPs).</I> The five regional
Unified Commanders conduct a variety of FMI activities to promote
regional stability and support other national security goals.
While programs vary based on each command's requirements, TCPs
share common characteristics. Planning is responsive, flexible,
and transparent, and accomplished in coordination with U.S.
diplomatic missions. Examples of major TCPs include U.S. military
liaison teams working in former Soviet-bloc countries; the
activities comprising "cooperative engagement" in the
Asia-Pacific region; staff exchanges with Middle Eastern
countries; training deployments for reserve and National Guard
units in the Caribbean Basin; and the peacetime Psychological
Operations program worldwide. (See chapter on unconventional
military instruments.) Unified commanders have two major concerns
about TCPs: internal DOD funding has tended to fluctuate from
year to year, making a consistent program difficult to achieve;
and, in this regard, a mechanism is needed to weigh different
CINC requirements against the funds apportioned within DOD.  <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR)
Program.</I> Also known as the Nunn-Lugar program after its
congressional sponsors, CTR focuses on the states of the former
Soviet Union that retain nuclear weapons: Russia, Ukraine, and
Kazakhstan. The program's broad goals include facilitating safe
disposition of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass
destruction; preventing proliferation of such weapons;
maintaining regional stability; and avoiding the return of a Cold
War-type rivalry with Russia. CTR-funded activities include
Russian-U.S. peacekeeping exercises and the establishment of
high-level communication links between the Defense Department and
ministries of defense in Russia and Ukraine. <p><img
src="ch0903.gif"><p><b>Combined forces from th United States and

Vehicles during Exercise Cobra Gold '95</b><p><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
FMI activities involving former Soviet states do not come under
the auspices of a geographic CINC, being instead managed by the
Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff.
Therefore, CTR does not fall under the TCPs funded by the
military departments; nor do CTR activities include formal
military education under IMET. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>Partnership
for Peace (PFP).</I> This post-Cold War initiative aims to build
working ties between NATO and the militaries of its former Warsaw
Pact adversaries, with an eye to developing possible future
members of NATO and maintaining cordial relations with the
militaries of nations that opt to remain outside of NATO.
Exercises under this program will focus on improving the
capability of PFP militaries to work together in peacekeeping,
search and rescue, and humanitarian-assistance operations,
particularly in NATO-led combined joint task forces. <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Twenty-six states have joined the Partnership
since the January 1994 NATO summit when the initiative was
announced. But as of late 1995, participation in PFP activities,
not to mention interoperability with NATO, is hampered by chronic
resource problems, equipment obsolescence, operational
incompatibilities, and leadership deficiencies. Once these
problems are overcome, interaction between NATO and its PFP
partners should lead to better military cooperation and greater
burden-sharing, which should improve U.S. strategic flexibility.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Funding by the United States is critical to
the success of this fledgling program. Eastern PFP partner states
are unlikely to have the fiscal wherewithal to fund their own
activities, and enthusiasm among other NATO countries for
assisting with the program is doubtful. To help jump-start
partner integration into PFP and initial participation in
small-scale military exercises, President Clinton announced while
visiting Warsaw in July 1994 a bilateral initiative to provide
$100 million in assistance to PFP member countries in 1996--$25
million of which would be earmarked for Poland. The Departments
of State and Defense will most likely share this funding using a
60/40 split. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>Counterdrug Programs.</I> In
1989, Congress directed DOD to take charge of detecting and
monitoring maritime and air transit of illegal drugs bound for
the United States. Four years later, the President's strategy
shifted the emphasis from fighting drug transit to supporting
countries where the drugs originate so these countries can better
conduct their own counterdrug operations. DOD provides resources
in five areas: support to source nations; detection and
monitoring of transit zones; support for domestic drug
law-enforcement agencies; initiatives to dismantle cartels; and
demand-reduction programs. In addition, the State Department uses
FMF to sustain its own fleet of military aircraft in two major
source countries and fund a small military education program. (A
more detailed discussion of these programs can be found in the
chapter on unconventional military instruments.) <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In sum, the true measure of U.S. defense
involvement abroad is not only the forces deployed worldwide but
also the wide array of programs used to associate and work with
other countries to achieve different shared goals. This strategy
will be successful in each region of the world to the degree that
each unified command's persistent, low-profile, and long-range
programs reduce the need to deploy forces in emergency
situations. <H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">Defense
Diplomacy</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In contrast to FMI programs that
geographic CINC's use within their overseas areas of
responsibility, the category of defense diplomacy includes
professional contacts involving the Secretary and his principal
civilian and military assistants, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, members of the Joint Staff and the three
military departments, or their representatives. Also an integral
part are policy-related, outreach activities by DOD's academic
and research institutions, such as the National Defense
University and the Defense Resource Management Institute, and by
various DOD agencies, such as the Defense Mapping Agency and the
U.S. Army's School of the Americas. Most frequently, initiatives
in this category take place in the United States. Defense
diplomacy and FMI differ in other ways as well. The former is not
an official term. As used in this chapter, it groups different
defense and service activities whose relevance and importance as
instruments of policy either have not been recognized or have
been taken for granted. Consequently, these initiatives tend to
occur without a plan to create synergy or to guide their
development and exploitation over time. Lastly, they lack the
established funding sources and bases in legislation that
undergird FMI.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Defense diplomacy is not new,
but it has long been downplayed as routine. Defense officials
often do not think of their interactions with counterparts from
other countries or the initiatives taken by their agencies that
engage foreign personnel as instruments of foreign policy. In the
past, such activities have been presumed part of the job, and not
always one that was welcomed.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &#009;In the
post-Cold War era, however, there is an important niche in DOD's
participation in peacetime engagement for defense diplomacy. For
one thing, certain strategic relationships and issues do not fit
easily into the unified-command-based model of overseas presence.
For example, Mexico, Canada, and the states of the former Soviet
Union do not fall under a geographic CINC. The Office of the
Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff are better positioned in
Washington to manage most of the delicate defense-policy
interactions in these countries. Likewise, some security
issues--alliance policies, weapons of mass destruction, arms
transfers, and confidence-building, for example--are so
politically sensitive that they are handled directly by the
Pentagon. 
<hr><blockquote><b>NDU's Role in U.S-China Defense Diplomacy</b> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Official relations between U.S. and Chinese
national defense universities were established in 1987. The 1987
agreement actually put the seal on informal ties that had been
developing steadily since the early 1980s.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both sides were eager to advance relations. At the height of the
Cold War, the United States wanted to consolidate
military-to-military relations with China, which were considered
significant in the continuing struggle with the Soviet Union.
Moreover, relations with the Chinese National Defense University
(NDU) fit neatly within the overall framework of
military-to-military ties, which, at that time, embraced
high-level visits, working-level exchanges, and so-called
military/technical cooperation, or the transfer of certain types
of military and dual-use technologies to China.  <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> For their part, the Chinese, although not
unwilling to send a signal to Moscow about their position in the
Cold War, were more interested in gaining information relevant to
their military modernization program. Beijing emphasized such
priorities as assessing U.S. military technologies, professional
military education and training, and concepts of operations and
doctrine. Despite differing priorities, the relationship
developed because both sides decided that such ties served their
respective interests.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Relations came to a
halt, however, in the wake of the Chinese military's violent
suppression of the demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in June
1989. Relations remained in limbo until January 1994, when the
president of the U.S. NDU visited his counterpart and agreed, in
principle, to reconstruct institutional ties. That effort
progressed reasonably well, despite a pause in mid-1995. In late
1995, the president of the U.S. NDU visited China's NDU, and
further advances in the institutions' relations are planned for
1996. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Despite the ups and downs of the
relationship, the United States derived considerable benefit from
links between the two national defense universities. Bonds
established between the leaders of the institutions have been
maintained, despite retirements and transfers on both sides.
Also, interactions at lower levels of the faculties and staffs
produced a self-sustaining cadre of military and civilian
professors and researchers who gained insight into the strategic
priorities and methods of their counterparts. For example, the
U.S. gained access to information on China's assessment of the
regional security environment, the military budgeting process,
Chinese thinking about doctrine and operational art, and Chinese
perceptions of the requirements of professional military
education. Lastly, relations between the two institutions form a
network that supports continued communication, despite problems
in overall bilateral relations. The link between the two military
establishments embodied in the ties between the NDUs may forge a
new strategic basis for U.S.-Chinese ties in the future.  <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Two major lessons can be drawn from the
experience of the inter-NDU relationship. First, defense
engagement is a dependent variable; the scope and scale of
defense relations are influenced by the tenor of overall
relations. In the case of China, defense relations were the first
to lapse and the last to be restored. Although defense engagement
enhances bilateral ties and may help to slow a decline, its role
in shoring up strained relations is less than clear. Secondly, in
the absence of shared strategic objectives, defense engagement is
difficult to establish and sustain. For example, as of the
mid-1990s, China is suspicious of U.S. strategic intentions. In
these circumstances, defense-related initiatives designed to
build confidence and a basis for improved relations encounter
some difficulty. Great care and sensitivity are required in
defining the engagement agenda to include areas of common
interest and mutual benefit.</blockquote><hr>
<img src="ch0901.gif" align="left"><p>
<p align="left"><b>U.S. medical readiness exercie in Ecuador</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Also, the norm in military relationships
worldwide is the association of counterparts--ministry to
ministry, service to service, joint staff to joint staff. While
some foreign governments appreciate the CINC's potential as a
patron within the U.S. system of military assistance and are
willing to work closely with him, others prefer to deal directly
with their counterparts in Washington. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, DOD has developed an unprecedented capacity to
educate and train its civilian officials, as well as to build
functional staff expertise in several specialized areas, such as
resource management, public affairs, and emergency management.
During most of the Cold War, there was little interest in
exporting any defense know-how outside of the United States.
Today's security environment and policy to promote democracy make
sharing such abilities more feasible and desirable.  <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The department's defense-diplomacy activities
tend to fall into five categories with somewhat fuzzy boundaries,
some of which are long-standing practices and some of which are
new to the 1990s:  
<img src="ch0902.gif" align="left"><p><b>U.S. Army

project in Honduras, creating a farm to market road where only a
trail existed.</b><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> * <I>High-level
contacts:</I> official visits overseas, counterpart visits to the
United States, defense ministerial meetings, bilateral-security
working groups, contact with the Washington diplomatic corps, and
personal associations with senior foreign leaders that mature
over time. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> * <I>Staff talks:</I> bilateral
Joint Staff talks, multinational service conferences, and both
joint and service expert exchange opportunities (relating to
subjects such as military law, simulations, and force
development). <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> * <I>Sharing professional
expertise:</I> OSD briefing (teaching) teams from such staff
offices as Program Analysis and Evaluation, the Emergency
Planning Directorate, and the Defense Intelligence Agency; the
U.S.-U.K. Kermit Roosevelt exchange military lecture series;
NDU's collaboration with the Inter-American Defense College; and
various DOD outreach programs.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> *
<I>Developing an understanding of defense issues and requirements
among civilian defense officials:</I> foreign attendance of
courses in service and defense education systems for DOD's
civilian professionals; meetings between visiting government and
legislative officials and DOD's civilian functional area experts;
and short workshops in Washington designed to address this need. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> * <I>Academic/research support of policy:</I>
formal affiliation with sister institutions for military
education; counterpart exchange visits by directors of military
colleges and universities; roundtable discussions and workshops
to share ideas with visiting civilian and military dignitaries,
academics, and journalists on topics of their interest; and the
distribution of magazines, reports, and other professional
literature published by service and defense academic and research
institutions--ideally material published in foreign languages. <P
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Thus far, there is no formal network of programs
for defense diplomacy similar to FMI, no funding sources other
than existing representational and regionally focused service
"cooperation" funds, and no management structure within OSD, the
Joint Staff, or the service staffs. There is no one in offices
devoted to international political-military affairs who attempts
deliberately to meet the security or governance needs of a
country or subregion by crafting programs that draw upon
activities in one or more of these categories. The outlook for
this multifaceted instrument as a means of U.S. influence is
continued ad hoc use and failure to realize defense diplomacy's
potential. As a minimum, OSD should develop regionally oriented
matrices characterizing the key security and defense policy
issues and identifying different defense-diplomacy initiatives to
be used (or created) to address them. Ideally, each region's
matrix would mesh with, reinforce, and, in turn, be reinforced by
the CINC's strategy for using FMI assets.<hr>
<blockquote><b>Repelling Aggression in El Salvador</b><p> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The activities of the Department of Defense
in support of U.S. policy in El Salvador during its twelve-year
civil war (1980-1992) fall somewhere between "defense engagement
in peacetime" and "limited military intervention." DOD went
beyond a normal combination of foreign military interaction
programs--FMF, IMET, and TCPs--and defense diplomacy by deploying
highly specialized mobile training teams under security
assistance, sharing a wide range of intelligence products, and
supporting the country's large military management requirements,
particularly in a military emergency. Washington went to great
lengths to keep the U.S. military presence in El Salvador small,
limiting the number of trainer/advisors to fifty-five, and to
ensure that its overall approach to military support did not
replicate earlier Cold War experiences. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> By
the end of the Salvadoran civil war, the Pentagon and individual
U.S. services had provided a myriad of programs, services, and
suggestions to their Salvadoran counterparts in an effort to help
the government of El Salvador defeat the FMLN insurgency. The
only resource purposefully withheld was the direct involvement of
American warfighters. A large military assistance program, mobile
training teams, out-of-country training of units, periodic visits
by the CJCS and other high-level U.S. military leaders,
assistance with intelligence collection, intelligence sharing,
civic action assistance, IMET training in the U.S.--all were
tried. Some were successful in advancing U.S. interests, others
had no effect one way or the other. A few had negative results. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>What worked.</I> The smartest move the
U.S. made in helping El Salvador repel aggression was to resist
the temptation of direct U.S. military involvement in the
fighting. The preponderance of U.S. assistance was spent on
teaching the Salvadorans to teach themselves, i.e., on training
the trainers. Also, what advanced U.S. interests best was
assistance uncluttered--and carefully crafted for the Salvadoran
situation and culture. The resident presence of U.S. military
personnel, officers and enlisted, was also extremely beneficial
when those assigned represented the best of the U.S. professional
force, i.e., role models. The exposure of the Salvadoran
military, and of civilians who harbored a distrust of their armed
forces, to what a professional military acting under civilian
leadership is all about was the most effective method of
conveying those concepts.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>What seldom
worked.</I> The U.S. put enormous effort into intelligence
sharing. With a multitude of platforms and other data gathering
mechanisms, the U.S. tried to pass information that could be of
use to the Salvadoran allies. This seldom had effect. First, it
was most often too little, too late. Secondly, Salvadoran
expectations as to what the all-knowing U.S. intelligence
community could produce far outstripped reality. As a result, the
Salvadoran military never understood or accepted the importance
of intelligence. In a similar vein, the U.S. effort to
demonstrate the importance of PSYOP, particularly in
counterinsurgency warfare, was wasted. The assignment of PSYOP
trainers with no in-depth knowledge of Salvadoran culture or the
mindset of its military had either no discernable impact or was,
as in one case, an unmitigated disaster.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>What always failed.</I> The delivery of messages by high
ranking U.S. military or Defense civilian visitors, especially
the delivery of messages having nothing to do with military
matters, never had the desired result. The distinguished status
of the visitor never made up for a necessarily limited personal
knowledge of the environment into which the message was being
delivered. Thus, messages were inevitably mangled and
misunderstood. Worse yet, the U.S. often then proceeded on the
false assumption that the message had gotten across. Activities
that the U.S. employed to encourage attitudinal and institutional
reforms within the Salvadoran military almost always came to
naught. The U.S. rarely, if ever, had sufficient knowledge of how
the Salvadoran military truly functioned, or what its
institutional mindset was on any given subject. The U.S. practice
of conditioning all or part of military assistance funds each
year to coerce changes within the armed forces was largely
counterproductive.</blockquote><hr>  
<img src="ch0908.gif"><p><b>Army tank conducting live fire

name="subhead6">Conclusion</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H2> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The conclusions of two 1995
studies underscore the importance of defense engagement today and
for the future. First, the Commission on Roles and Missions of
the Armed Forces argued that engagement in peacetime is a sound
and relatively inexpensive investment in the promotion of
regional stability and the nurturing of democratic norms. It
encouraged measures further to integrate and coordinate defensive
engagements within DOD and other government agencies. Secondly, a
study of the effectiveness of one education program, IMET,
conducted by the Institute for National Strategic Studies,
concluded that this form of defense engagement has had a positive
effect on many foreign civilian and military leaders who have
participated in U.S. programs, frequently causing them to to be
more favorably inclined toward the United States and its
policies. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While the United States has made
considerable progress in adapting how military resources are used
in peacetime today, beyond solely maintaining readiness for
combat, three general patterns are emerging that may shape the
future of defense engagement in peacetime. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> *
<I>Reliance on DOD's resources.</I> Funding for foreign policy
initiatives is shrinking, even as defense civilians and units of
the armed forces demonstrate that technical-military expertise
and professionalism can be an effective diplomatic tool,
particularly in peace operations, and while FMI programs and
defense diplomacy increasingly support U.S. security policies
worldwide. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> * <I>Decreasing personnel. </I>In
addition to a growing shortage of officers and non-commissioned
officers with foreign-area expertise, the particular active duty
units that participate in most FMI programs--engineers, military
police, communications, and medical--are shrinking in number at a
more rapid rate than the services as a whole. The immediate
impact is to increase competition among the geographic Commands
for the use of remaining units. <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> *
<I>Appearance of defense contractors.</I> New actors in peacetime
defense engagement are defense contractors who negotiate
agreements directly with foreign governments. They typically
advertise corporate military expertise in such areas as
streamlining security assistance, force management,
modernization, training, and military transition assistance
programs for emerging democracies. The appearance of these
companies is too recent for an informed judgement to be made
about impact on defense engagement. But the arrival of such
independent parties suggests the direction in which this
instrument of U.S. power might travel in the future. <p> <hr>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Security relationships and overseas presence have come under
increasing scrutiny since the end of the Cold War. Despite this
scrutiny, or perhaps because of it, both the Bush and Clinton
administrations have made a strong case for preserving
commitments to core allies, engaging potential coalition
partners, and continuing a credible military presence in Europe,
the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The end of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry has left the United States
with a global network of multilateral and bilateral relationships
without a rationale clearly understood by the public. Regardless
of the absence of a menacing global threat, which provided a
stable cohesive for past U.S. security relationships, the United
States has an enduring and fundamental interest in preserving
close ties with powerful states. Such ties can deter regional
aggressors, reassure allies and their neighbors, and ensure rapid
and effective military response in the event of conflict.
However, the recent security environment has led some to question
America's alliances as: too rigid to respond swiftly to today's
less conventional security challenges, unnecessarily benefitting
the U.S.'s major economic competitors, and easily supplanted by
less binding relationships that entail fewer political and
physical costs. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although there is no simple typology for organizing the complex
variety of security relationships and forces deployed overseas,
this chapter organizes these diverse and at times overlapping
instruments of national power into four types of security
relationships--the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
other formal alliances, de facto alliances, and coalitions--and
three types of overseas presence--forward-deployed forces,
military exercises, and pre-positioned military materiel.

NATO
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
America's Cold War strategy of containment was predicated on an
extensive array of alliance commitments and forward-stationed
military troops. Of all those commitments, none was so
instrumental in bringing the Cold War to a peaceful and
successful end as was the transatlantic alliance, led by the
United States and embodied in NATO, with the United States,
Canada, and eventually fourteen western European nations
including Britain, France, Germany, and Italy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
NATO's genesis was the wreckage left in Europe after the Second
World War: an imperial, totalitarian regime in Moscow threatening
an exhausted European continent. Only the United States could
balance the West European democracies against Soviet hegemony. In
response, the U.S. led its European allies in erecting an
economic, political, and military bulwark to defend the west
against the East. As the military instrument, NATO became the
most important and visible pillar of Western solidarity. The key
dates were the 1949 founding of NATO; the 1955 decision of the
Federal Republic of Germany to join NATO rather than choose a
course of neutrality, an action that led to the creation of the
Warsaw Pact nine days later; and the 1967 adoption of a new
military strategy of flexible response. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<blockquote><b><P ALIGN="LEFT">
NATO Enlargement</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The NATO enlargement process faces two dangers. The first is that
enlargement will proceed too fast, which could upset a delicate
political process underway in Russia. The other is that the
process slows too much, in which case it could stall.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Impact on Russia. There is not much consensus at present in
Russia on anything, but there is consensus among the national
security elite against enlargement. Many Russians believe that
NATO enlargement would draw a new line in Europe which would
create cultural and economic barriers that would be impossible to
overcome. Russian observers say that if NATO enlarges, Russia may
abandon START II and the CFE Treaty.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Impact on Central and Eastern Europe. Not all of the Central and
Eastern European states may be ready to join NATO at the same
time. The 1995 NATO study on enlargement concluded that decisions
should be made on a case by case basis. While the NATO study
makes clear that there are no fixed criteria, it does provide
some guidelines, including that ethnic and border disputes need
to be settled. Progress on democratic reform and civil-military
relations will also be an important factor.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As NATO proceeds, it risks separating Central Europe from Eastern
Europe and creating a strategic vacuum in the East. States in
this region are concerned they will have no firm security
framework and that they may have to deal with a Russia which is
more aggressive in response to enlargement.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Impact on Western Europe. Western Europe is somewhat divided on
the enlargement issue, with Northern Europe generally more
interested than Southern Europe. A West European consensus could
form around the proposition that NATO enlargement should be tied
to EU enlargement. But that may take too long for some in the
U.S. and Germany.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Impact on NATO. The 1995 NATO study focuses on enlarging in a way
that strengthens rather than weakens NATO. A minimum degree of
military interoperability will be needed on the part of candidate
countries so that NATO can operate smoothly. The extent of the
modernization required has already generated a debate about the
danger of extending hollow commitments which could cost NATO tens
of billions of dollars to fix. The study also concludes that NATO
has no a priori need for forward deployment of either troops or
nuclear weapons into any candidate country, but it would reserve
the right to do so.</blockquote><hr>
NATO's vitality as an instrument of U.S. power derived from the
unwavering American commitment to Europe, U.S. leadership, common
interests and values, and the gradual, decades-long development
of mechanisms for cooperation and consultation. The incremental
institutionalization of NATO--with the North Atlantic Council,
the many political committees, the Military Committee, the
civilian and military international staffs, and numerous agencies
and integrated commands--led to a truly integrated combined
military capability that has endured many intra-alliance crises,
deterred Soviet aggression, and continues to prove its
capabilities in the post-Cold War era. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the mid-1990s, NATO remains the anchor of American engagement
in Europe and the linchpin of transatlantic security. However,
the most successful political-military alliance in modern history
faces a number of crucial choices with regard to its future.
Among these are the difficult issues associated with NATO's
membership and mission. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
NATO's post-Cold War membership debate is sometimes simplified as
a conflict between broadening or deepening the alliance. The
former would try to preserve the gains of the Cold War's end by
moving quickly to incorporate the fledgling democracies of
Eastern and Central Europe that achieve certain basic criteria.
The latter would concentrate on maintaining cooperation among the
sixteen members of NATO and delay its enlargement, in particular
because expansion would antagonize Russia. NATO has balanced the
two goals. First, NATO's London summit declaration of July 1990
proclaimed Russia to be no longer an adversary, and it announced
a new program for diplomatic liaison open to all the members of
the Warsaw Pact. Next, at the Rome summit in November 1991,
NATO's commitment to an inclusive Europe was further manifest in
its creation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC),
which established a new institutional framework for consultation
and cooperation on political and security issues between NATO and
the non-NATO states of the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe (CSCE, later OSCE). Then, at the January 1994 NATO
summit, President Clinton launched the Partnership for Peace
program aimed at drawing interested countries closer to the
alliance through individual political and (especially) military
partnership programs. <p>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As of late 1995, officials from NATO member countries continue to
struggle with the issue of defining the criteria for expanding
full membership in the alliance. Even if some Central European
countries should meet such criteria for NATO membership, their
entry into the alliance--still subject to unanimous consent of
the members under the Washington Treaty--could be held up by
widespread concerns about Russia's reaction. The notion of a
strategic understanding with Russia over NATO expansion seems as
desirable as it is difficult to achieve. The challenge is to
define the NATO-Russian relationship in a way that strengthens
NATO reassures the Central and Eastern European states, and
satisfies Russia that its security is in no way diminished.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The debate over NATO's mission has concerned whether and how to
transform an alliance traditionally focused on the defense of
members' territory into an alliance that is also capable--and
willing--to respond to the crises that threaten the allies'
collective interests near their territory, or even farther away.
Some observers have summarized NATO's post-Cold War prospects by
the phrase "out of area or out of business." 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1991 NATO allies agreed for the first time on the importance
of addressing security threats beyond the NATO area, and
established crisis management operations as important NATO
missions. In 1993, the allies added peacekeeping to their crisis
response missions by agreeing to respond to both CSCE and U.N.
calls for peacekeeping on a case-by-case basis. In 1994, NATO
agreed to form Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF) as a means of
modifying the Cold War vintage Integrated Military Structure to
achieve the flexibility and mobility needed for crisis response.
In 1995, in its first actual military operation, NATO military
forces unleashed massive, sustained air strikes in support of
major new diplomatic effort to bring peace to war-torn
Bosnia-Hercegovina. At this writing (November 1995), such
military intervention appeared to have been largely successful at
protecting safe haven zones and advancing the peace process. The
mere decision to deploy NATO forces outside of its members'
territory marked a milestone on the path of transforming NATO
into an effective transatlantic alliance for the post-Cold War
era. <p>
<blockquote><b>The Purpose of Security Relationships</b>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
First and most fundamentally, alliances augment military power.
Rather than unilaterally building up military power, nations may
opt to join a security relationship with other nations. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Secondly, alliances are usually threat-based; that is, they are
formed with specific antagonists in mind. Thus, alliances--and
other less formal security relationships--are aimed primarily
against a potential threat, and only derivatively for something.
The offensive alliance, in which aggressive nations band in the
avaricious expectation of being able to share the spoils of an
offensive victory, is far from the norm. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Throughout history, states have entered into alliances for a
variety of other reasons, such as ideology (holy alliances) or
political penetration (satellites or client states subverted, for
example, through significant political, financial, or technical
assistance). Moreover, Otto von Bismarck's diplomacy of
constantly shifting among alliances in the latter half of the
nineteenth century was predicated more on considerations of
maintaining order in the international state system than on
balancing threatening power. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thirdly, the common bond holding alliances together is each
ally's perception that its national interest is served by the
alliance. Alliances are rooted in common interests. But unlike
individuals, nations cannot have friends. Because alliances are
founded on common interests, it follows that when interests
change, alliances are affected. This goes a long way toward
explaining some of the difficulties in alliance management since
the demise of a common global opponent, the Soviet Union.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some scholars offer less hard-nosed views of the purposes of
alliances. Idealists believe that alliances can be a step toward
permanent collective-security regimes, such as the United
Nations, or regional-security communities rooted in common values
and respect for international law. Neoliberals emphasize how
interlocking networks of relations can provide countries with a
stake in accepted international norms, customs, and practices.
Hence, neoliberals suggest that alliances are relevant not simply
for addressing threatening power (collective defense) but also
for more positive objectives, such as buttressing international
order (collective security).</blockquote>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The CJTF initiative holds the most significant promise to date
for genuine re-orientation of the alliance's military
capabilities for new missions. By investing in the concepts,
standardized procedures, and exercise regimes for CJTF as it did
for collective defense, NATO will become the reservoir of
multinational expertise and essential infrastructure to conduct
the rapid deployment of task forces to respond to a wide array of
crises. Not only will this give NATO the means to mount
operations as an alliance, but the latent cooperation among its
participating nations will provide a nucleus to deploy coalitions
of the willing outside of NATO's political-military apparatus as
well. In this regard, the Western European Union (WEU) will be a
special benefactor of CJTF. Simply the presence of a CJTF
capability will go far to reassure NATO's friends and to deter
aggression well beyond NATO's borders.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet it is no surprise that the political struggle to agree on a
concept for CJTF capabilities and employment has been especially
difficult. More so than any other post-Cold War initiative, CJTF
goes to the heart of the allies' debate over the future of the
alliance. While most want CJTF to be at the center of European
collective security and crisis management, some see it at the
periphery as a backstop to capabilities the WEU hopes to some day
obtain. While none see the WEU today as capable of managing, for
example, the crisis in Bosnia, those who see NATO's future as a
backdrop to Europe's own capability in security and defense want
to avoid the creation of a permanent crisis-management tool such
as CJTF in NATO. A still more fundamental question remains:
Whether NATO will continue to be a collective defense alliance
directed at outside threats or whether it will take on a
different task as the provider of security to all of Europe,
including Russia.<p>
<img src="ch1006.gif"><b>U.S. Air Force F-16Cs flank a Republic
of Korea F-5 overflying South Korea's Independence Hall</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In large part, the answer to that question will be revealed as
NATO deploys its implementation Force (IFOR) to Bosnia in
response to the Dayton peace plan. In Bosnia, theoretical debates
over future institutional relationships are yielding to the
ealities of political will and military capability. As a result,
IFOR's operational links to the EU, OSCE, WEU and UN, as well as
to many non-NATO nations, will establish the precent for what
works in crisis response. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Approval of IFOR's deployment brought France closer to NATO's
military structures. In addition, the late 1995 French decision
to re-join NATO's military policy making bodies, the Defense
Planning Committee and the Military Committee, may prove a most
significant turning point in mapping NATO's place in Europe's
future security structure. France will be engaged in NATO's
military policy planning process for the first time in nearly
thirty years.s
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty, the United
States and Canada maintain an additional defense agreement--the
North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD's primary
interest in the 1960s was to defend North America against air
attack (meaning bombers from the Soviet Union). By the 1970s,
NORAD's objectives had broadened to deterrence against ballistic
missile attack through warning and assessment. Then, in 1986, the
two nations agreed to upgrade their systems to counter an
evolving cruise missile threat. In the mid-1990s, NORAD units
routinely assist law enforcement agencies in their efforts to
stem the tide of illicit drugs into Canada and the United States.
The evolution of NORAD's objectives will undoubtedly continue as
new technologies redefine the threats against Canada and the
United States. In the final analysis, the NORAD Agreement
represents the amicable and enduring relationship between Canada
and the United States. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead3">Other Formal Alliances</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Besides NATO, the other principal formal alliances are in East
Asia and the Western Hemisphere. Unlike multinational NATO,
America's alliances in East Asia are chiefly bilateral. Even so,
the Cold War's end has placed similar strains on America's
Asian-Pacific alliances, raising questions not only about the
mission of these alliances but also about how these bilateral
relationships should or could be interwoven into the fabric of a
larger Pacific community.<p>
<b>U.S. Military Personel in Foreign Areas, FY1988-95<p></b>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, the U.S. government built a fire wall
between trade and security issues that prevented trade disputes
from interfering with critical security relationships. That fire
wall has disappeared, and U.S. administrations continue to search
for an effective means of integrating competing security and
economic interests. The problem of balancing U.S. economic and
security interests has been most acute with Japan, whose $65
billion trade surplus with the United States has led a number of
critics to call for holding the security alliance hostage to
Tokyo's redressal of the trade imbalance. The limitations of
coercive linkage seem obvious, given the inherent need for allies
to retain a high degree of trust and public support.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>The U.S.-Japan Alliance.</i> Throughout the Cold War, the
U.S.-Japan security alliance was the cornerstone of American
strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. From its origins--following
the American occupation of a vanquished nation--the post-World
War II relationship with Japan has emphasized a complementary
rather than an identical power-sharing arrangement. In the 1950s,
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida forged a consensus that
Japan would focus on its economic recovery and growth, and the
United States would concentrate on maintaining military security.
Thus, in exchange for allowing U.S. forces to be stationed on
Japanese territory, the United States guaranteed the safety of
Japan.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The so-called Yoshida Doctrine served the mutual interests of the
United States and Japan: Japan prospered economically while the
United States used Japan as an unsinkable aircraft carrier to
contain Soviet aggression. For a brief time in the early 1970s,
this arrangement came under fire, as the U.S. withdrawal from
Vietnam set in motion a short-lived effort in Japan for greater
defense autonomy for its Self-Defense Forces (SDF). But the
alliance emerged stronger for the testing, with, for instance,
Japan's 1981 commitment to defend the sea lanes out to 1,000
nautical miles from the home islands. Japan's military role
expanded in a manner that was defensive and complementary to the
U.S. armed forces. In particular, the SDF enhanced its
capabilities for conducting anti-submarine warfare and
air-defense missions, while the United States continued to focus
on offensive power-projection capabilities.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the mid-1990s, the United States and Japan have achieved
unprecedented levels of bilateral cooperation. Japan pays more
for U.S. forces, transfers more technology to the United States,
engages in more combined training, and assumes more roles and
missions within the alliance than at any other point in its
four-decade history. However, in many ways, this close
relationship is only a superficial continuation of policy
trajectories established during the Cold War. Without significant
efforts to redefine and win public support for the alliance's
main purpose, as well as efforts to reformulate roles and
missions within a more equal strategic partnership, this alliance
between the world's two largest economies could falter in the
years ahead.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although not always apparent due to the succession of relatively
weak coalition governments, Japan is emerging as a major player
in international security affairs. There should be no mistaking
the commitment of Japan's elites in government, business, and
politics to the alliance with the United States as the
centerpiece for Japan's future security. However, in the
mid-1990s, there were growing signs in Japan's policy planning of
renewed attention to global and regional multilateral
institutions, as well as stronger independent capabilities as
means of hedging against possible U.S. withdrawal or leadership
fatigue. Some in Japan appeared to be questioning old taboos
regarding force projection, arms exports, and even nuclear
weapons. In the 1980s, the best and the brightest Japanese
bureaucrats worked on the alliance with the U.S.; in the
mid-1990s, they work on Asian affairs, peacekeeping, or planning
a "well-balanced" (rather than complementary) military force
structure. Momentum and energy in Japanese policy planning are
flowing away from the alliance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sensing this drift in the alliance, and faced with a possible
conflict on the Korean peninsula to which U.S. forces in Japan
would have to respond, senior U.S. officials in late 1994
launched an intensive one-year effort to begin shoring up the
U.S.-Japan alliance. The Department of Defense initiative
culminated in a new joint security declaration, which was set to
be announced by the two governments at a summit meeting in spring
of 1996. It is to reaffirm the alliance and cite specific
enhancements agreed to or underway.  More importantly, in
November 1995 the government of Japan issued a new National
Defense Program Outline which declared the security relationship
indispensible to Japan's national interest. Officials in both
capitals appeared poised to enhance security cooperation
appropriate to the post-Soviet-era.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite this management effort, the U.S.-Japan alliance faces
continuing challenges in the years leading up to the twenty-first
century. As long as Japan maintains a massive trade surplus with
the United States and a major threat fails to materialize,
Americans increasingly will demand that the security relationship
be leveraged to force Japan to make economic concessions. The
final outcome of such a policy is unknown, but clearly it could
run the risk of undermining the alliance. The demise of the
alliance, in turn, could destabilize the increasingly important
Asia-Pacific region, which lacks a mature regional security
framework and remains marked by divided countries, territorial
disputes, and historic suspicions. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>The U.S.-South Korean Alliance.</i> Unlike NATO and the
U.S.-Japan alliance, the alliance between the United States and
the Republic of Korea (ROK) has been predicated on maintaining
deterrence in the face of the division of the Korean peninsula,
not on the Soviet threat of the Cold War era. Given that
considerable uncertainties surrounding North-South relations are
likely to remain for the rest of the 1990s, the alliance is apt
to retain its original purpose. However, if tensions abate on the
peninsula following an October 1994 Agreed Framework between the
U.S. and North Korea over its nuclear facilities, then the
U.S.-ROK alliance will require a thorough review of its
rationale, its division of labor, and its place in the regional
context. The shared and complementary interests of the two
countries seem likely to continue well into the next century.
After all, Korea, united or not, desires a powerful if distant
ally to balance against its larger neighbors. Likewise, the
United States holds a strong interest in helping its
eleventh-largest trading partner fulfill its objective of
becoming a larger bulwark for regional stability.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Other Asia-Pacific Alliances.</i> The United States also
continues to have treaty alliances with several other nations in
the Asia-Pacific region, including the Philippines and Thailand,
of which the most important is that with Australia. Washington
and Canberra have enjoyed a long tradition of close
political-military consultation and cooperation that predates
even the 1951 ANZUS Treaty. Australia hosts and operates with the
United States several joint facilities that make key
contributions to U.S. security, and the two countries have
extensive programs for joint exercises as well as intelligence
and scientific cooperation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>The Americas.</i> Another artifact of America's Cold War
alliance network is the 1947 Inter-American Treaty of Reciptocal
Assistance, signed in Rio de Janerio. As the collective-security
treaty for the Western Hemisphere, the Rio Treaty calls for
consultation in the event of a threat rather than invoking an
automatic response like Article 5 of the North Atlantic Charter.
The absence of such an unambiguous "musketeer principle"--all for
one and one for all--has tended to emphasize diplomacy rather
than concerted military cooperation among the countries of the
Americas, only 22 of which have ratified it. In fact, when the
Rio Treaty was invoked by Argentina in its 1982 war with Britain
over the Falkland-Malvinas Islands, it proved ineffective in
rallying diplomatic and military support. There were no common
interests to unite neighboring countries suspicious of each
other. Although the Rio Treaty was designed to keep foreign
powers at bay and to provide the United States with political and
moral legitimacy to wage the Cold War on behalf of noncommunist
nations, it was seldom used to significant effect.<hr>
<blockquote><b> Coalition Orgnaization and Execution</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A number of issues will affect how well the coalitions in which
the U.S. is likely to participate will cohere and function:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Pre-coalition groundwork. Advance preparation, such as
increased joint training, education, exercises, and exchanges,
can introduce U.S. military personnel and civilian counterparts
to prospective coalition partners, as discussed in the chapter on
Defense Engagement.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Access to foreign facilities. Because future coalitions are
likely to be more flexible and short-lived, the United States
cannot count on the same degree of access to foreign military
facilities that it enjoyed during the Cold War era. This suggests
that U.S. military forces will have to become more autonomous,
even if achieving this capability is costly.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The core military group. In any coalition, some countries
inevitably become part of a core group while others remain
peripheral to decision making and the execution of operations. In
Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the United States and Saudi
Arabia were politically and financially at the core, whereas the
United States, Britain, and perhaps France were militarily at the
core. Combat operations will proceed more smoothly if core
nations exclude those that cannot conduct combined operations
with similar equipment and doctrine. On the periphery, there are
two basic categories of partners: those that can make a useful
contribution in the military operation, and those that cannot,
but add political cover.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Coalition maintenance. A robust liaison with militarily and
politically essential partners may be necessary to hold together
a coalition. In the Gulf War, for instance, the United States
saturated the Saudis' and other key partners' defense apparatuses
with competent U.S. civilians and officers to ensure a unity of
effort. If combined combat operations are contemplated, then it
is in the interest of U.S. component commanders to check and
double check, rehearse and re-rehearse actions to be undertaken
to avoid costly mistakes, including fratricide. Given that
coalitions are often symbolic and require much political
give-and-take, U.S. leaders may devote much effort to the
collegiality and diplomacy required to placate the national
sentiments of coalition partners.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is precisely this looser mutual commitment among countries of
the Western Hemisphere that has begun to change in the 1990s, as
a result of unprecedented cooperation in economic matters and the
almost universal acceptance of democracy as the political ideal.
U.S. defense diplomacy as well as military interaction with
counterparts have made important contributions in the areas of
Latin American political-military cooperation and respect for
human rights. While the Rio Treaty itself has had no impact,
trust and confidence among neighbors is growing on several
levels. This can be seen in the 1994 Summit in Miami; the
first-ever 1995 Defense Ministerial in Williamsburg, Virginia;
the extensive involvement of regional police and military forces
in bring peace and stability to Haiti; and the hemisphere's
collective success in ending sustained combat in 1995 between
Peru and Educador as well as setting the stage for negotiations
to resolve this long-standing border dispute. These events, and
particularly the supportive, low-profile role played by U.S.
civilian and military defense officials, underscore the potential
for greater confidence and security building within the American
neighborhood and the prospect for more effective collaborative
engagement abroad.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While any nation could potentially become a coalition partner
with the United States in a time of crisis, some countries have
security relationships that are alliances in all but name. That
is, although they may lack a formal treaty of alliance, the
variety of military, political, and other interactions with these
countries make them de facto allies. Particularly important are
the relationships with three Middle Eastern states because of the
vital U.S. interests at stake and the level of threat they face.

<hr><blockquote><b>Recent Coalitions</b>

Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has found
coalition partners from all over the globe. Some of the more
significant recent coalitions were:

* Desert Shield/Storm: In 1990, the U.S. deployed 500,000 troops
to the Persian Gulf as part of a U.S.-led coalition force to
defend Saudi Arabia. In January 1991, the U.S.-led coalition
commenced a six-week military campaign that liberated Kuwait and
crushed the Iraqi armed forces. Coalition forces, particularly
from key NATO allies, such as Britain and France, played an
important military role in the victory.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Southern Watch: Since 1992, U.S. and coalition aircraft have
enforced a no-fly zone over southern Iraq.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Provide Comfort: Under way since the end of the Gulf War, this
operation maintains a secure environment that permits
humanitarian assistance to flow to the endangered Kurdish
population of northern Iraq. Multinational operations include
approximately 1,500 U.S. military personnel and some 50 aircraft
sorties per day, on average, from NATO bases in Turkey.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Vigilant Warrior: In October 1994, after two Iraqi Republican
Guard divisions massed on the Kuwaiti border, the U.S. deployed a
Marine Expeditionary Unit, elements of a heavy Army division, a
carrier task force, and additional land-based aircraft to
reinforce security partners Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Uphold Democracy: In September 1994, the United States entered
Haiti peacefully to oversee the return of the country's popularly
elected government (ending President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's
three-year exile) and the departure of the nation's military
leaders. The use of U.S. military power in an effort to restore a
democratically elected government was the first such operation in
the Western Hemisphere ever authorized by the United Nations.
Various regional nations pledged support to help provide civil
control after the U.S. military operation reined in the armed
forces, police, and paramilitary groups. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Deny Flight: Beginning in April 1993, about 1,700 U.S. military
personnel stationed in Europe participated with NATO allies to
enforce a ban on military flights over Bosnia, monitoring the
U.N. protection areas and providing close air support to U.N.
peacekeepers in Bosnia when called upon.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Able Sentry: Since the spring of 1993, about 500 U.S. troops
have participated in the U.N. observer force, now called the U.N.
Preventive Deployment in the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia, providing a stabilizing presence and preventing the
conflict in other regions of the former Yugoslavia from spilling
over into Macedonia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Sharp Guard: Starting in April 1993, three U.S. naval vessels
and approximately 7,800 U.S. personnel participated regularly
with NATO allies in maritime enforcement of sanctions against
Serbia in the Adriatic Sea, with intermittent support from other
assets of the U.S. Sixth Fleet. As with Deny Flight, Sharp Guard
was teriminated in December 1995 with the establishment of IFOR.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Support Hope: From June through September 1994, some 2,000 U.S.
military personnel from Europe deployed to Africa to organize and
carry out emergency humanitarian relief operations for refugees
fleeing a brutal civil war in Rwanda. While the U.S. operation
was unilateral, it directly supported multinational governmental
and nongovernmental efforts at providing humanitarian support.
Moreover, as the U.S. pulled out in the autumn of 1994, its major
Asian ally, Japan, dispatched peacekeeping forces to support
refugee camps in Zaire.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Provide Relief: From August 1992 until March 1993, the U.S.
conducted a military airlift from Mombasa, Kenya, to deliver
goods to Somali refugees. The U.S. also led the Unified Interim
Task Force from December 1992 to May 1993, which was a
large-scale coalition effort to stem mass
starvation.</blockquote><hr>
<i>Israel.</i> U.S. interests are tightly interwoven with those
of Israel for historic, political, and moral reasons. Ever since
President Harry Truman promptly recognized the new state, the
United States has been pledged to its survival. During the Cold
War, Israel was an essential partner in the Cold War struggle to
limit Soviet influence in the region. In the post-Cold War era,
the U.S. supports Israel's security through a combination of
means, not the least of which is major security assistance so
that Israel can maintain its qualitative edge over any likely
combination of aggressors. Moreover, the United States supports
Israel in its pursuit of a peaceful and stable regional framework
with its neighbors for the long-term. 
<hr><blockquote>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><b>Responsibility Sharing</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States has increasingly expected its allies to assume
greater responsibility for regional security. From the mid-1980s
to 1993, U.S. annual defense outlays declined in real terms by
over 15 percent ($60 billion). Post-Cold War changes in the
international environment have enabled other U.S. reductions,
with active duty end strengths dropping 20 percent since the end
of the Cold War, and major force components down 15 to 25 percent
from 1990 levels. Since 1990, the U.S. has reduced troop levels
permanently stationed overseas by over 225,000 (44
percent)--mostly out of Europe--and its estimated real annual
stationing costs (including military pay) have been
reduced--through negotiated agreements as well as lower forces
levels--by nearly $10 billion (33 percent).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.S. allies in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East provide a
wide array of host-nation support to the United States. DOD
estimates that the U.S. receives more than $10 billion annually
in cost-sharing and cost-avoidance from European and East Asian
allies, which equates to roughly 40 to 50 percent of the extra
costs of deploying those forces overseas. Japan's contribution is
the highest of any ally, and a new host-nation agreement and
special-measures agreement worked out in late 1995 committed
Japan to approximately $5 billion in direct and indirect support
for each of the next five years. The Republic of Korea, which
provides land and facilities for U.S. use, logistics support and
manpower augmentees, contributes about $3 billion a year in
direct support, indirect support, and foregone revenue. Estimates
of Germany's direct support, indirect support, and foregone
revenues are in the range of $2 billion a year.

<i>Saudi Arabia.</i> Saudi Arabia, as the largest Gulf state
supportive of Western interests, sits atop a critical region of
the world for its oil and yet is adjacent to two major security
concerns in Iraq and Iran. The security of Saudi Arabia is not
guaranteed by a formal treaty of alliance; however, successive
American Presidents over several decades have reiterated the U.S.
interest in its safety. The Gulf War and the Vigilant Warrior
deployment of 1994 demonstrated the firmness of this and similar
commitments. It was Saudi Arabia's willingness to allow a gradual
buildup of vital military infrastructure during the 1970s and
1980s that enabled the United States to deploy overwhelming
military force against Iraq. Since 1991 a continuing U.S.
operation to keep watch on Saddam Hussein has been based in Saudi
Arabia, which has borne much of the deployment's cost. Some
Saudis are concerned about these costs and about he continuing
presence of U.S. soldiers in what is a conservative Muslim
society. Of course, as the U.S.-led coalition to defend Kuwait
suggested, aggression against any of the six members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the
United Arab Emirates, and Oman) would be likely to compel an
American response.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Egypt.</i> For nearly two decades during the Cold War, Egypt,
the Arab world's most populous country, led an anti-Western,
pan-Arab movement that supported Soviet objectives in the Middle
East. From the 1970s onward, however, Egypt became a stalwart
Western supporter, first in the Cold War and then in the
establishment of an Arab-Israeli peace process. Egypt's
willingness to make peace at Camp David was the first major
breakthrough in the peace process. Cairo continues to take a
leading part in promoting interests shared with the United States
throughout the Middle East, whether in rallying Arab League
backing for Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion, providing two
divisions to Desert Storm, or offering key support to the Middle
East peace process.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">Coalitions</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Alliances, whether de jure or de facto, represent the traditional
security commitment of the Cold War era. Since the breakup of the
East-West contest, however, rigid ideological alignments have
given way to far less structured and more ad hoc arrangements. In
response to crises, coalitions of the willing have formed. Of
these various coalitions, it is useful to distinguish between
those led by the United States, albeit perhaps authorized by the
United Nations or regional collective-security bodies, and those
directed by the United Nations in which the U.S. participates.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the foreseeable future, Washington will continue to insist
that it lead and direct any operation that may involve U.S.
military forces in combat or prospective combat situations.
Conversely, if the situation can be characterized as posing
little risk of combat--as is the case in traditional peacekeeping
operations, such as in Cyprus--then the United States is likely
to encourage other nations to carry the burden of leading and
directing the coalition operation. In short, in combat situations
in which the National Command Authorities have decided to
intervene, the United States will seek U.N. authority but abjure
U.N. direction. Besides domestic political opposition to U.S.
troops under U.N. command, a basic reason for this distinction is
that any effective military operation requires a unity of command
and effort. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Coalitions and formal alliances both offer the same potential
benefits, although the chief benefit of a coalition is typically
different from that of an alliance. Whereas both types of
security relationship offer political legitimacy and an
aggregation of military power, the emphasis in a coalition is on
the former, whereas the emphasis in an alliance--which, after
all, is a latent war community--is on the latter. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another advantage of both types of association is the aggregation
of finances and resources to support military operations. Also,
both coalitions and alliances can serve a restraining function by
limiting the actions of allies and coalition partners--for
example, by eliminating the chance that a given nation will join
an opponent's coalition.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whatever the benefit of any given coalition, its relative merits
need to be weighed against the potential costs of creating it.
The fundamental risk in setting up or joining a coalition is that
national objectives may become submerged, diverted, or derailed.
An identity of common interests and objectives is rare enough
among two or three countries. Disparities are magnified
geometrically, however, when even larger groups of nations are
involved. Agreement in international organizations or among large
groups of coalition partners usually represents something like
the lowest common denominator of interests. This can make a
coalition's objectives murky. From an operational perspective, it
can sharply restrict the scope, pace, and flexibility of
operations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In short, the political and diplomatic imperative to seek
consensus within a coalition often stands at odds with the
military imperative to achieve results through the threat or use
of unrestrained force. Thus, in some instances, the impulse to
form a restrictive or binding coalition should be suppressed in
order to maintain maximum flexibility. Future coalitions, like
their predecessors, will cohere principally in proportion to the
level of perceived threat. Given that starkly different scenarios
for the future are plausible, U.S. alliance and coalition
policies will have to remain, above all else, flexible. <p>
<img src="ch1002.gif"><b>Clemenceau-class aircraft carrier Foch

This chapter has implicitly assumed that the United States will
largely remain a status quo power, and that its primary
objectives in participating in military coalitions will be to
enhance stability in general and to defend specific national
interests in particular. Like most states, the United States
tends to view its own behavior as benevolent and defensive. Yet,
U.S. decision makers should not assume that others share this
view. Even governments that Washington does not regard as hostile
worry about the uses to which U.S. power might be put, and even
traditional U.S. allies may not always approve of U.S. policies
or actions. These facts suggest that when thinking about future
alliances and coalitions, Washington also needs to think about
preventing future arrangements from forming against the United
States. <p>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead6">Forward-Deployed
Forces</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most critical military aspect of U.S. engagement strategy is
forward deployment. Post-Cold War reductions are nearly complete,
and as of mid-1995, the United States sustained an overseas
presence of about 255,000 personnel (or 15 percent of the total
active force). That figure represented a 50 percent reduction,
down from 510,000 personnel stationed overseas just six years
earlier.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Often, even a token presence can serve like a cooling rod in a
nuclear power plant. This is particularly true in Asia, where a
power balance among China, Japan, and the members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations has yet to be struck. The
roughly 100,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in East Asia
stabilize the balance, reassure U.S. security partners, and
prevent unnecessary regional military buildups. Most Asians
recognize this more readily than Americans, which is why they
wish U.S. forces to stay and why Japan is willing to contribute a
high level of host-nation support. Although the U.S. Government
remains committed to current force deployments in Japan and South
Korea for the foreseeable future, future events and evolving
political debates may encourage Washington to focus more on
capabilities than quantities. For instance, the alleged rape of a
Japanese schoolgirl by American servicemen crystallized debate
over plans to reconsolidate U.S. facilities on Okinawa, which
houses some 28,000 or 62 precent of the U.S. troop presence in
Japan. If the bilateral commission established in late-1995 to
review America's 40 facilities on Okinawa is perceived as
stonewalling the local Okinawans, then it is highly likely that
U.S. presence in Japan will remain a volatile political issue.
Hence, especially if there is a diminution of the threat from
North Korea, subsequent U.S. security planners may find it
prudent to focus less on the number 100,000 and more on essential
missions and types of leading-edge forces, especially naval and
air, which adequately convey the seriousness of America's
commitment to the region.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reassurance also remains important in Europe, where most want
Germany to retain its non-nuclear status and defensive posture.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Forward-deployed forces are fundamental to America's ability to
react to crises around the world that affect vital interests or
humanitarian concerns. In Desert Storm, about 95 percent of the
airlift arrived via Europe. A review of twenty-seven operations
mounted between March 1991 and October 1994 reveals that more
than half were staged from Europe. Without forward-staging areas,
America's ability to react would be severely constrained.<p>

Each service struggles with a portion of forward deployment:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Many in the Army would prefer to bring home the two heavy
divisions in Europe while only retaining a "reception center"
infrastructure. There may be a case for replacing armor with more
mobile light units. Similarly, should the threat from the North
disappear on the Korean peninsula, the 2nd Infantry Division in
South Korea might also be reduced or removed, although there
appears to be mounting interest in retaining at least a residual
U.S. ground presence, and perhaps an enhanced naval and air
presence, for regional reassurance and crisis response well into
the next century. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The Navy finds it increasingly difficult to retain a
significant presence in the Caribbean, Mediterranean, Atlantic,
Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf with a fleet two-thirds
the size of a decade ago. As Marine Expeditionary Units
increasingly provide a mobile presence for crisis management,
there do not seem to be enough forces to go around. <p>
<b>USAREUR Forces being loaded for pre-positioning afloat,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* More than the other services, the Air Force emphasizes the
coercive impact of all military assets, not just those deployed
overseas. Thus, while the Air Force agrees that forces stationed
overseas are the most tangible form of U.S. presence, its
global-presence concept contends that space assets, ICBMs and
bombers in the U.S., aircraft carriers, and airborne units all
exert influence on or coerce U.S. adversaries to varying
degrees.<p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Closer to home, the United States maintains an important military
presence on foreign territory within the Western Hemisphere, in
Panama and Cuba. Although the U.S. will honor the 1977 Panama
Canal treaties, which call for the complete withdrawal of all
U.S. military forces from the country before the beginning of the
year 2000, both sides agreed in late 1995 on the need to retain a
forward U.S. presence into the next century. Thus, even after
relocating America's Southern Command to Miami, Florida, the U.S.
armed forces stationed in Panama at the beginning of the next
century could be in the range of 5,000 troops. In addition, the
United States retained forces based in Guantanamo, Cuba.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The post-Cold War decline in America's overseas military presence
has increased U.S. reliance on long-range transportation to
project power. Throughout the course of any given year, the
United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) shows the flag
on every continent and in most countries of the world. Moreover,
USTRANSCOM is essential to all U.S. military operations, as well
as many global humanitarian and peace operations. For instance,
in 1995, USTRANSCOM moved 5,000 British troops and their
equipment to the Bosnian theater. While unremarkable in and of
itself, the airlift was yet another demonstration of how the
capability to project power overseas has become an integral part
of America's long-term commitment to allies and security partners
around the world. <p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of
1986 placed greater emphasis on joint training and exercises.
Accordingly, the emerging role of U.S. Atlantic Command as the
Joint Force Integrator and the start-up of the Joint Warfighting
Center contribute to this emphasis through a higher degree of
integration of joint training, exercises, and doctrine than
existed during the Cold War. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Exercise Program
remains the Chairman's principal vehicle for achieving
interservice and multinational operational training. Exercises
also demonstrate U.S. resolve and the capability to project
military presence anywhere in the world, and they provide an
opportunity to stress strategic transportation and C4I systems
and to assess their readiness. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
CINC-sponsored exercises, a large subset of the CJCS Exercise
Program, are continuing their transition in the post-Cold War
environment to reflect emerging security relationships, evolving
theater strategies, and increased joint task-force training. The
emphasis of CINC-sponsored exercises has shifted from a few
large-scale exercises focused on global contingencies and
conflicts to an increased number of smaller-scale exercises
focused on regional contingencies. As a result, CINC-sponsored
exercises have increased in number from ninety in FY 1990 to two
hundred in FY 1995, but they have decreased in size and scope. As
the permanent overseas presence of U.S. forces has been reduced,
joint exercises have increasingly been used to maintain regional
access and presence and to demonstrate U.S. resolve. Other
exercise trends include increased use of modeling and simulations
in exercises; the enhancement of military relations and
interoperability with allies and security partners;
containerization of ammunition and unit equipment; the exercising
of pre-positioned equipment; and special-forces participation in
CINC-sponsored exercises. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As operational deployments continue to increase and resources to
decrease, U.S. forces are finding it more difficult to support
exercise requirements. For this reason, the Joint Staff launched
a review in 1995 of the entire CJCS Exercise Program, with an eye
toward combining scheduled CJCS exercises or integrating CINCs'
requirements with existing component exercises to reduce the
overall number of exercises while increasing their quality. The
military is also looking at the opportunities to use simulations,
computer-assisted exercises, or command-post exercises to replace
or complement current field-training exercises.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Affordable and rapid crisis-response capabilities cannot rely
exclusively on airlift--which is expensive and limited by
available aircraft--or on sealift, which is relatively slow. A
comprehensive Mobility Requirements Study in 1992 estimated what
combination of lift and pre-positioned arms and supplies would
best yield a "strategically prudent force that is fiscally
responsible." As a result of this study, as well as a March 1995
Mobility Requirements Study Bottom-Up Review Update, an
increasing emphasis has been placed on pre-positioning to help
improve U.S. mobility and crisis-response capabilities.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pre-positioning Afloat. Ships filled with military materiel are
based in foreign ports where formal agreements specify U.S.
basing rights. These "floating depots" may leave without
host-country permission and proceed through international waters
wherever and whenever directed, before full-blown crises develop,
if desired. Ships sometimes may reduce vulnerabilities by
maneuvering out of harm's way, and the cargoes they carry may be
tailored to satisfy requirements in more than one theater.
However, optimum locations are not always available. Thailand,
for example, rebuffed U.S. requests to tie up in its waters
midway between Diego Garcia and Guam, where U.S. squadrons are
stationed. In addition, even under the best circumstances, costs
for afloat pre-positioning are higher than for stocks
pre-positioned ashore.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1980, in response to concerns about the Persian Gulf, the Navy
acquired seven commercial ships configured to carry cargo for
11,200 Marines. Various shortcomings associated with this initial
force were corrected when thirteen Maritime Pre-positioning Ships
(MPS) were leased until the year 2010. A five-ship squadron,
together with a Fleet Hospital Ship, is homeported in Diego
Garcia in the Indian Ocean, earmarked for duty in the Persian
Gulf. One four-ship squadron is based at Guam/Saipan; another
roams the Mediterranean. Each squadron is prepared to outfit
tailored Marine formations up to and including a 17,300-man
Marine Air-Ground Task Force, which it can sustain for thirty
days with ammunition, water, rations, and supplies. Plans call
for three more MPS to enter the inventory, one per squadron.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Army Pre-positioned Afloat program postdates the Cold War.
Since November 1993, a heavy combat brigade, including 123 M1A1
tanks and fifteen days of essential supplies aboard five
roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) ships has been stationed at Diego
Garcia, together with a Heavy Lift Prepo Ship for port operations
and three Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) vessels loaded mainly with
munitions. The Army also has five LASH vessels in Guam. The plan
is to modernize and expand by two ships by FY 1998, including
replacing seven aging ships with eight new Large Medium-Speed
RO/ROs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pre-positioning Ashore. Since the 1950s, pre-positioning programs
ashore have been intended primarily for use by Army armored and
mechanized brigades. The Berlin crisis of 1961 prompted
Pre-positioned Overseas Material Configured to Unit Sets
(POMCUS), which provided for three divisions plus support in
Germany at the Cold War peak. Sets for four brigades remain,
although critics consider them anachronistic. Most agree that the
Army brigade sets in Korea, Kuwait, and Italy are more relevant
to the post-Cold War environment. In addition to the brigades
sets, significant amounts of Air Force and Army materiel are
stored in Southwest Asia, some of it left over from Desert Storm.
In particular, the October 1994 Operation Vigilant Warrior
validated the need for pre-positioned ground combat equipment in
the Persian Gulf. Subject to congressional approval of
construction funding, a second armored brigade set with a
division base will be pre-positioned in Southwest Asia by FY
1998, and another armored brigade set will be pre-positioned in
South Korea in FY 1996. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In summary, pre-positioning has become an increasingly important
part of U.S. defense plans for ensuring rapid mobility in the
event of a crisis. Recent initiatives will significantly enhance
the U.S. deterrent posture, deployment response time, and
warfighting capability in volatile regions. At the same time,
however, contentious issues--such as command and control
arrangements, local security, and maintenance requirements for
pre-positioned stocks--will continue to require constant
negotiation and oversight by senior defense officials.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
America's complex network of security relationships and various
types of overseas presence has been profoundly affected by the
end of the Cold War, and there remains a widespread consensus
that these instruments of national power remain important for
preserving U.S. influence in the world.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Security Relationships. In the last few years of the twentieth
century, America's formal alliances are likely to face continuing
challenges to their existence. Policymakers will continue to be
pressed to articulate clear rationales for alliances, both to
persuade public opinion of their relevance in the post-Cold War
era and to provide fundamental stability to alliances in spite of
periodic economic competition or other disputes. Shoring up
NATO's mission and credibility without recreating a Russian
threat to the east will remain a paramount challenge for U.S.
decision makers; likewise, adapting and making more equal
America's alliances in East Asia, especially with Japan and South
Korea, will be critical tasks in the next few years. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
America's other security partners, its de facto allies, will
represent an even greater range of challenges. On the one hand,
the United States is likely to face a growing array of
relationships that require specialized expertise to maintain; on
the other hand, the United States will be unlikely to extend to
these countries the kinds of formal commitments Washington was
eager to make during the 1950s, when it created its global
network of Cold War alliances. In short, the U.S. will have to
juggle these security relationships, using troop rotations,
exercises, and information exchanges to shore up key partnerships
and retain a vast set of friendly relations that would enable an
effective coalition to be built in the event of a conflict or
crisis. In the longer term, the question of proliferating weapons
of mass destruction, especially relatively inexpensive systems,
such as cruise missiles and biological warheads, is apt to pose
increasing challenges to all U.S. security partners and allies,
underscoring the importance of counterproliferation measures,
including active defenses, as means of retaining the requisite
political will to endure.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the foreseeable future, the United States is unlikely to fight
a major conflict except as part of a coalition. If that coalition
is led by the United Nations, then the U.S. is apt to steer clear
of direct and massive combat support and instead confine its role
to rear-area support. The international response to a major
conflict would probably not be led by the U.N. but by some
executive agent, whether the United States, another major power,
or a military alliance like NATO. If the coalition is led by the
United States, then it needs to focus on the nucleus of other
capable allies, de jure or de facto, who will form the nucleus of
its warfighting potential; other security partners will need to
be brought into the coalition on the basis of their strategic
value, whether on the battlefield or in symbolic political value.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Overseas Presence. Just as alliances and other security
relationships will face many challenges in the next few years,
so, too, is overseas presence likely to face increasing scrutiny,
especially if significant military threats fail to materialize. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Forward deployments are sure to face increasing questions from
members of Congress, many of whom will be confronted with further
base closings in their home states or other competing
motivations, such as reducing the federal deficit. Even so, the
consensus behind maintaining an active presence in Europe, East
Asia, and the Middle East seems unlikely to break in the
foreseeable future. While sudden changes cannot be ruled out--for
example, the collapse of North Korea--the likely challenge will
not be to forward presence per se but more to the appropriate
size of the military overall.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Recent trends in exercises are likely to continue to accentuate
the importance of smaller, more varied efforts, designed not for
massive land or blue-water threats but oriented to multinational
cooperation for other military operations, including peace
operations and humanitarian assistance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lastly, as force structure declines and support for large
overseas bases continues to diminish, the importance of
pre-positioned forces ashore and afloat is likely to expand.
Nonetheless, the difficulty in winning support to base such
stocks can be a delicate political matter, as the United States
found out when such support was rejected in Thailand in early
1995. Consequently, policymakers might expect to spend increasing
amounts of time winning local support for such pre-positioned
military equipment and materiel, which will be critical to timely
and effective efforts to respond to crises.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Peace operations is a subset of the broader category of
operations other than war (OOTW). It refers to a form of military
intervention short of full-scale war, in support of diplomatic
actions, and conducted by, or with the endorsement of, a
collective security organization in order to maintain or restore
stability to a region or a state. In addition to "defusing and
resolving international conflicts," as proclaimed by Presidential
Decision Directive 25, Reforming Multilateral Peace Operations
(PDD 25), peace operations also address civil strife and
humanitarian crises within individual states.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This study discusses four distinct instruments or capabilities:
1) peacemaking and conflict prevention; 2) peacekeeping; <BR>
3) expanded peacekeeping and peace enforcement; and 4)
humanitarian operations. The taxonomy of peace operations is
organized according to a combination of four pivotal factors: the
breadth of the mandate or rules of engagement; the presence or
absence of an accord among the disputants; the degree to which
the operating environment for the peace force is characterized by
basic consent or by armed opposition; and the size and complexity
of the mission. This chapter does not discuss major conflicts
such as Korea (1950) or the Persian Gulf (1991), even though they
were endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. This chapter also
excludes unilateral U.S. operations, such as Lebanon in 1958 and
Grenada in 1983, where there was no international endorsement.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Since the late 1980s, many peace operations have combined
traditional military and diplomatic activities with humanitarian
support for civilian populations conducted by military units,
usually to save lives and alleviate suffering on a large scale.
Such support can entail conducting, assisting, or safeguarding
the delivery of food and medical supplies; protecting civilian
populations; and so forth. Humanitarian support operations have
also been conducted by the armed forces alone, independent of
other actors. These have taken place in various sizes, under
various mandates, in both permissive and hostile environments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On occasion (e.g., Somalia and Bosnia), the protection of
humanitarian activities by peacekeeping forces has evolved into
peace enforcement on a large scale. For these reasons,
humanitarian support is discussed as a separate category. Nation
assistance or peace-building activities--disarmament of factions,
conduct of elections, rebuilding of local administration, and
other measures to strengthen a weakened or collapsed state--have
also been frequently incorporated. However, they will not be
discussed as a separate instrument since they have not been
conducted independently of other operations. Moreover, most are
performed by civilian specialists, although the U.S. military has
on occasion contributed civil or military expertise and other
specialized skills.<hr><img src="ch110a.gif"><hr><p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Between 1945 and 1988, there were thirteen U.N. peace operations,
limited mostly to the Middle East and aimed at discouraging the
renewal of conflict after a cease-fire between hostile states.
The Middle East actions took place with the blessing of both the
United States and the Soviet Union, both of whom wished to avoid
escalation that might precipitate unwanted great power
confrontation. Most other proposals for U.N. action ran into
Soviet veto power, thus severely limiting the number of peace
operations. Few U.S. military personnel and no U.S. units
participated.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Between 1988 and 1995, there were some twenty-six new and
separate peace operations authorized and commanded by the U.N.
Starting in 1987-88, a positive attitude emerged in Moscow toward
both U.N. peacekeeping and cooperation with Washington in
resolving regional conflicts. The ensuing cooperation produced a
much more assertive approach by the U.S. and key U.N. members
toward peace operations. In addition, the United States
organized, outside the formal U.N. framework, two major coalition
peace operations (Restore Hope in Somalia and Uphold Democracy in
Haiti) as well as a more limited multinational mission (Provide
Comfort in Iraq). France and Russia also organized and led peace
operations outside the U.N. framework but with its concurrence:
France in Rwanda in 1994, and Russia in Georgia and Tajikistan in
1994-95 (using the CIS). In addition, involvement of regional and
subregional organizations in peacekeeping increased markedly
during this period (e.g. OAS in Haiti, NATO in Bosnia, OAU in
Burundi, ECOWAS in Liberia).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a result, the U.S. military has become heavily involved in
peace operations around the globe, both through direct
participation and as a source of transportation, logistical
support, and equipment. As of end-September 1995, 3,239 U.S.
military personnel were part of U.N. operations, according to
U.N. definitions. Twenty-thousand U.S. military personnel were
being dispatched to Bosnia as part of a NATO peace operation. The
participation of U.S. military units in post-Cold War peace
operations qualitatively boosted multilateral effectiveness. U.S.
C3I capabilities and experience in managing coalitions have
proven to be major assets in planning and coordinating
multilateral operations, and valuable specialties--such as civil
affairs, psychological operations, special forces, engineering,
and advanced logistics (including tactical and strategic
airlift)--have been contributed by the U.S. Few other military
establishments can provide such assets to the U.N. When there has
been danger of conflict, U.S. combat units participating in U.N.
peace operations have remained under the operational command and
control of U.S. senior officers, as in Somalia and Haiti. On
occasion, for temporary duty, U.S. military personnel are under
operational or tactical control of other military commanders,
including NATO.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In keeping with the growth of operations, the number of U.N.
peacekeeping personnel increased from 8,000 in 1988 to some
62,500 in 1995, and assessments for U.N. peace operations rose
from approximately $200 million in 1988 to $3 billion in 1995.
(Moreover, these figures do not cover the costly, U.S.-led
operations in Iraq, Somalia, and Haiti.) 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Starting in 1994, however, the U.N. and U.S. both adopted a more
cautious attitude. Haiti, Angola, and Tajikistan were the only
new U.N. peacekeeping missions undertaken in 1994-95, along with
the reinforcement of the U.N. Protection Force in the former
Yugolsavia (UNPROFOR) and the creation of the NATO-led
implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia. No new expanded
peacekeeping operations were authorized, and six earlier
operations were completed or terminated, including expanded ones
in Cambodia and Somalia and medium-size missions in El Salvador
and Mozambique; UNPROFOR was scheduled to end in late 1995.
Simultaneously, a strong movement arose in Congress favoring a
drastic reduction in U.S. contributions and support for future
U.N. peace operations, as well as tight limits on the use of U.S.
forces. The backlash generated by the failed mission in Somalia,
the agonizing dilemmas of the operation in Bosnia, and the need
for deep cuts in the overall U.S. budget generated serious
concerns over the utility of U.N. peacekeeping and made it an
inviting political target. The Clinton administration has favored
tighter restrictions upon the UN but opposed drastic cuts and
overly restrictive constraints, and argued for the continued
utility of selective, more effective, and usually less costly
peace operations. At the same time, it assisted in substantial
improvements in the peacekeeping capabilities of the U.N.
Secretariat, particularly in the areas of logistics, planning,
and C3I.<hr><b>Number of Major Peace Operations</b><img
src="ch110B.gif"> 
<hr><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Repeated use of this rapidly evolving instrument of
national policy has confronted military thinkers with a host of
nettlesome doctrinal, training, financial, and operational
issues, while policymakers have been forced to grapple with an
array of novel political and diplomatic challenges. According to
Congressional Research Service data, the cost to the U.S. for
peacekeeping jumped in FY 1995 to approximately $1.5 billion in
incremental operating costs and $1.2 billion in contributions to
the U.N. peacekeeping budget, as well as $680 million in
humanitarian aid more or less associated with the crises that led
to the peacekeeping operations. The need for effective
interagency as well as international coordination has become more
important as civilian functions and agencies--including scores of
private voluntary organizations--have been integrated with
military forces in peace operations. Managing the interaction and
interdependence of political, military, humanitarian, and
economic activities is an essential element for success.

Conflict Prevention and Peacemaking 
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Intended to forestall the outbreak of hostilities or to
facilitate resolution of an armed dispute, conflict prevention
and peacemaking missions are conducted with strict impartiality,
almost always with approval of the disputants. They are comprised
of primarily diplomats and other civilians, including
humanitarian workers, human rights monitors, etc. Limited numbers
of military personnel, usually unarmed, often assist in liaison
with the belligerents, implementing confidence-building measures
orarranging a cease-fire. A recent innovation in this category of
peace operations, known as preventive deployment, stations
lightly armed troops as a trip-wire to deter the spread of
conflict. The only example of this, to date, is Macedonia, where
some 1,000 U.N. military observers (half from the U.S.) have
contributed to deterring a spill-over of hostilities from Bosnia
or Croatia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, prevailing U.N. practice and Soviet
opposition restricted the number of U.N. peacemaking missions.
With the exception of the Congo in the early 1960s, the U.N.
avoided addressing domestic unrest. Since the end of the Cold
War, the Security Council has been increasingly <BR>
inclined to approve peace operations. Since 1995, the U.N.
Secretary General has been able to authorize conflict prevention
missions on his own initiative. Most of the new operations have
been explicitly concerned with internal conflicts.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a result, the United Nations has undertaken scores of conflict
prevention or peacemaking missions, (mostly initiatives by the
Secretary General) and demands for military personnel to assist
these diplomatic activities have also increased. Since 1989, such
operations have been conducted in Afghanistan, Angola, Western
Sahara, Rwanda, Somalia, and the Aouzou strip in Chad. These
missions generally involved domestic rather than interstate
conflict (except for Afghanistan and the Aouzou strip). The
mandates essentially involved monitoring cease-fires, movements
of forces, and weapons deployments. Several carried additional
objectives: registering voters and supervising a referendum on
the disputed territory in Western Sahara; protecting the delivery
of relief supplies in Somalia; and assisting with a cease-fire,
demobilization, and election in Angola. Operations in Georgia and
Tajikistan by the CIS and in Liberia by ECOWAS had U.N. observers
assigned to them.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mission results have been mixed, determined primarily by the
willingness of warring parties to pursue peace and honor the
agreements reached. Clear and realistic mission objectives, a
good comprehension of the local political situation, adequate
resources, and strong outside political support from key states
also contributed to success. In the Bosnian, Somalian and Rwandan
cases, local disputants were not sufficiently receptive to
international mediation, and the peace forces lacked the power,
cohesion, and will to bring an end to those conflicts. The same
was true in Liberia for five years. On the other hand, Libyan
troops did withdraw from Aouzou, as did Soviet troops from
Afghanistan, facilitated by U.N. observers. The first Angola
mission failed due to inadequate understanding of the local
situation, an undermanned U.N. mission, an unrealistic timetable,
and continued differences between the two disputants. A
subsequent mission successfully corrected these deficiencies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States has provided political, logistical, and
financial support to almost all these conflict
prevention/peacemaking operations and on occasion has also
contributed a small number of military observers. Despite mixed
results, Washington has regarded such operations as a useful,
low-cost means of collectively pursuing secondary interests.
Governments and non-governmental organizations are directing a
great deal of attention to developing a rapid-response capability
for quickly mobilizing trained, multinational teams of
diplomatic, humanitarian, and military personnel in response to
international crises. This capability could increase the
effectiveness of efforts at prevention or containment, thus
avoiding much larger and more costly security and humanitarian
problems if crises continue unchecked.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead3">Peacekeeping</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Peacekeeping operations occur after disputants have achieved a
tentative resolution to their conflict, whether international or
intrastate. In such missions, impartial military observers verify
implementation of a cease-fire or monitor the separation of
forces. The number and success of these operations have increased
substantially since the end of the Cold War, as has the
operations' complexity. Recent peacekeeping operations have
frequently involved some aspects of peace-building, as well as
support for humanitarian operations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prior to 1989, U.N. peacekeeping missions were limited to
observing and patrolling demilitarized zones and force-limitation
zones, and monitoring cease-fire agreements. Such operations had
mixed results. The 1956 mission in the Sinai helped prevent war
for a decade but was compelled to withdraw at Egypt's insistence
in 1967, powerless to prevent another Arab-Israeli war. A
subsequent Sinai mission in 1973 facilitated the successful
transition to the Camp David peace treaty in 1979. The Golan
mission has helped Israel and Syria avoid even a single incident
since it was constituted at U.S. instigation in 1974. On the
other hand, the operation in South Lebanon, begun in 1972, proved
impotent to prevent conflict. Its continued presence follows the
Security Council's judgment that the situation would be even more
volatile if it were withdrawn. This is also true for the Cyprus
operation, which began in 1964, was upset by a major war in 1974,
and continues at a lower level of force and expectation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1962, a U.N. General Assembly action created a Unique
Temporary Executive Authority for West New Guinea to avoid an
impending war. It successfully provided security and an interim
administration for the territory, turning it over to Indonesia
after seven months and organizing "an expression of popular
opinion" on the future. This prefigured the more complex and
challenging sort of peacekeeping operation that has arisen in the
post-Cold War period.<p align="left"><b>Troop Conributions to

<p>Note: Based on U.N. records.  The U.S. uses a different
definition of which of its troops are part of U.N. peacekeeping
operations.<p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Outside of the formal U.N. framework, the Israel-Egypt peace
treaty established the Multinational Force and Observer (MFO)
mission for the Sinai in 1981. With some 2,000 personnel from
eleven countries (about half from the United States) and an
annual budget of $50 million, it is still in existence. Its
usefulness is illustrated by the absence of subsequent incidents
in the Sinai. In 1982-85, the U.S., Italy, and France undertook a
multinational operation to calm the situation in Lebanon. It was
successful in 1982, but crossing the line between impartiality
and partisanship in 1983 led to extensive U.S. casualties. U.S.
and other forces subsequently withdrew.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In late 1989, a peacekeeping operation was deployed in Nicaragua
to monitor a cease-fire, verify the concentration of Contra
guerrillas in security zones and the concurrent concentration of
the Nicaraguan army, and oversee Contra disarmament and
demobilization. The number of sea, air, and ground observers
gradually decreased from 1,200 in early 1990 to 300-400 during
1991. By June 1990, most of the 22,000 Contra personnel had been
demobilized, and the Nicaraguan army had disengaged. Elections
were held, and the operation was officially terminated in January
1992.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A separate U.N. peacekeeping operation for El Salvador was
established in 1991, involving some 1,000 personnel. Its tasks
were to monitor respect for human rights, the separation of
combatants, demobilization of Soviet- and Cuban-backed guerrilla
forces, restructuring of the Salvadoran military and police
forces, and the conduct of elections, as stipulated in the
Chapultepec accords. Also successful in achieving its aims, the
operation was terminated in 1995.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several Iraq-related U.N. operations were established in 1991
stemming from the Gulf War, including a peacekeeping mission with
some 1,000 lightly armed military personnel that continues to
monitor the Iraq-Kuwait border and demilitarized zone against
hostile Iraqi actions. A smaller operation demarcated the border
to the satisfaction of Kuwait and disbanded.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Mozambique, a larger and more complex peacekeeping force of
between 5,000 and 7,000 personnel (ONUMOZ) was established in
December 1992. Its mandate was to monitor the cease-fire between
government and guerrilla forces, verify the subsequent separation
and demobilization of forces, oversee elections, and facilitate
the return of refugees. Its annual budget was some $250 million.
The original implementation period was lengthened to provide more
time to accomplish its tasks and to persuade the warring parties
to respect both their previous agreements and future election
results (including certain prior understandings on power
sharing). The peacekeeping operation was successfully completed
in December 1994. By August 1995, more than 1.7 million refugees
had returned with the assistance of the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) and PVOs.<hr><blockquote><b>Major World

In Angola, a renewed U.N. operation (UNAVEM III) deployed in
1995. The plan was to reach a level of 5,000-6,000 forces,
building up gradually while testing the willingness of both
government and opposition guerrilla groups to disarm, accept the
1993 elections, and prepare for a second round of elections. Thus
far, progress has been fitful, but a power-sharing agreement
based on the 1993 elections has been reached, and renewal of
hostilities has been avoided.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On March 31, 1995, UNMIH replaced a U.N.-sanctioned expanded
peacekeeping operation in Haiti (the Multi-National Force, or
MNF) that had been led by the U.S. Its mandate stemmed from
Chapter VI of the U.N. Charter, and the military component was
limited to 6,000 personnel (2,400 from the U.S.). Overtly hostile
elements had been neutralized before deployment. The operation's
objectives were to provide security for elections and other
peace-building activities, including creation of a new police
force, training the judiciary, monitoring human rights, and
promoting economic revitalization. The U.S. headed the military
component, thereby retaining effective command and control. So
far, UNMIH has been successful in fulfilling its mandate to
provide security and restore civil institutions to Haiti,
although the conduct of the first round of parliamentary and
municipal elections in June 1995 was badly flawed. The
involvement of U.S. military forces has been broader, more
prolonged, and costlier than anticipated, in part because
civilian agencies in the U.S. and U.N. have been slow to muster
the required resources, and in part due to administrative
deficiencies of the Aristide government. An upsurge of violence
in late 1995 and questions about the capacity of the fledgling
Haitian police force to maintain order when UNMIH departs
illustrates the challenges confronting such missions.<hr><b>Cost

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Peacekeeping has become increasingly complex and more likely to
deal with internal instead of interstate, strife. Despite this,
its overall record since 1991 has been positive. Failures have
arisen from inadequate planning and resources, lack of political
sophistication, or insufficient political support from key
states. Above all, peacekeeping missions have foundered when the
warring parties lack a commitment to peace (as in Somalia).
Post-Cold War successes in internal peacekeeping
operations--including very substantial peace-building and
humanitarian activities in Namibia, Central America, Mozambique,
Angola, and Haiti--demonstrate the possibilities for future
peacekeeping operations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With political support from major powers and key regional actors,
bloody civil strife that had endured for a decade or more in
Southern Africa and Central America has ceased. Prospects for
more representative government and democracy have improved
greatly in both regions. Indirect benefits have also been
substantial, including South Africa's peaceful transition to a
multiracial democracy and a reinvigorated economy. In the Middle
East, more traditional peacekeeping operations continue to serve
very important U.S. interests: maintaining peace between Israel
and its neighbors and forestalling renewed Iraqi aggression.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Extensive support from the U.S. and others has helped the U.N.
Secretariat improve its capability to plan, deploy, command, and
sustain peacekeeping operations of modest scale, and to prepare
for still larger operations. For example, by mid-1995, the U.N.
Peacekeeping Office had over one hundred experienced military
officers on loan to its staff, including a German lieutenant
general, a Dutch major general, and a dozen Americans. In
contrast, it had a staff of three in mid-1993. It also had
established a twenty-four-hour command-and-communications center
and consolidated previously dispersed logistics functions. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Secretariat has developed a preliminary roster of earmarked
or standby units from member states, and work is proceeding on a
deployable headquarters unit; however, limits on these
capabilities clearly remain. Shortfalls in financial support from
member states, chief among them the United States, impede further
improvement. Entrenched bureaucratic inefficiencies and rivalries
within the Secretariat, and between the Secretariat and separate
U.N. agencies, significantly inhibit coordination and rapid
reaction. Continued improvement of U.N. capabilities,
particularly logistics, training and C3I, will reduce the amount
of support requested from the U.S., lower costs, and enhance
operational effectiveness.<hr><blockquote><b>Expanded Peacekeepin
and Peace Enforcement in Somolia</B><p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Expanded peacekeeping in Somalia began after the failure of
UNOSOM I accompanied by the specter of 500,000 Somalis dead from
famine by the fall of 1992 and hundreds of thousands more in
danger of dying. The U.S.-led coalition approved by the Security
Council in December 1992 had a mandate of protecting humanitarian
operations and creating a secure environment for eventual
political reconciliation. At the same time, it had the authority
to use all necessary means, including military force. By March
1993, mass starvation had been overcome, and security was much
improved. At its peak, almost 30,000 U.S. military personnel
participated in the operation, along with 10,000 personnel from
twenty-four other states. Despite the absence of political
agreement among the rival forces, periodic provocations, and
occasional military responses by UNITAF, the coalition retained
its impartiality and avoided open combat with Somali
factions--blending its coercive powers with political dialogue,
psychological operations, and highly visible humanitarian
activities. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On May 4, 1993, UNITAF was succeeded by UNOSOM II, but the
transition was badly managed. Basic U.N. deficiencies in
planning, C3I, and political acumen were compounded by an
expanded and intrusive mandate; greatly diminished military
capabilities; more aggressive Somali opposition; uncertain
support from the United States; differences within the coalition;
and uncertainty by the Security Council, the Secretariat, and
others. Subsequently, UNOSOM II crossed the "Mogadishu (or
Beirut) line" and became a badly flawed peace enforcement
operation. (In Beirut in 1983 and Mogadishu in 1994, military
forces came to be seen by parties to the local conflict as
co-belligerents rather than impartial peacekeepers.)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Somalia, peace enforcement was only an implicit element of the
original U.N. mandate, which focused on peace-building
(disarmament, political reconciliation, and economic
rehabilitation). However, after a confrontation between the
Somali National Alliance (SNA) and the U.N. led to the killing of
twenty-five Pakistani peacekeepers, the Security Council made the
operation's peace-enforcement mission explicit. It was executed
by both U.N. forces and a 1,000-man U.S. rapid-reaction force
under U.S. operational control, with the authority of the United
Nations. (There was also a 3,000-man U.S. logistics unit under
U.N. operational control.) A lack of decisiveness, cohesion, and
command and control by the undermanned U.N. mission (half the
strength of UNITAF, with some 20,000 personnel) and a series of
armed clashes between U.S./U.N. forces and the SNA created a
virtual state of war and undermined the effectiveness of the U.N.
operation. Confusion over the dual-command relationship between
the U.S. and UNOSOM II was another complicating factor, with a
U.S. general officer serving as both the U.N. deputy forces
commander and commander of U.S. forces. A clash on October 3-4
left eighteen U.S. personnel dead and seventy-eight wounded,
along with over one thousand Somali casualties. Public outcry in
the United States contributed to the decision to withdraw U.S.
forces in March 1994. That, coupled with continued internal
strife and SNA hostility toward the U.N., led to a total U.N.
withdrawal in March 1995. This was executed skillfully, without
casualties, in a carefully planned combined U.S.-U.N.
action.</blockquote><hr>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Expanded peacekeeping operations go beyond even the more complex
peacekeeping operations considered in the previous section. They
are larger in magnitude (20,000 personnel or more), more costly
($1 billion or more), and confront a potentially more hostile
operational environment because consent from disputants may be
nominal, incomplete, or, at times, nonexistent. Accordingly, they
have involved more assertive mandates and rules of engagement,
including the use of force under authorization of Chapter VII of
the U.N. Charter. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The only Cold War era U.N. operation in this category--in the
Congo--resulted from an unplanned expansion of the mission's
original mandate, activities, and personnel between 1960 and
1964. Eventually, the mission abandoned impartiality and employed
military force to help achieve a political outcome deemed
desirable by the United States.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Between 1992 and 1995, expanded peacekeeping operations were
undertaken in Cambodia (UNTAC), Bosnia (UNPROFOR), Somalia
(UNITAF), and Haiti (MNF) in response to serious internal
political and military strife and critical humanitarian and
human-rights conditions. The United States was, in all cases, a
leading advocate and active participant in generating these
missions, but had no units involved in UNTAC and UNPROFOR.
Initially, all carried primarily humanitarian and peace-building
objectives (e.g., saving lives, repatriating refugees, organizing
elections, rehabilitating the local economy, monitoring human
rights, reforming civil administration, disarming and
demobilizing militias, and training a new cadre of police), as
opposed to merely providing military assistance to a diplomatic
mission or monitoring the military aspects of an interstate
accord. However, the dynamics of implementation meant that the
dominant issue and key determinant of success became the use of
military power and its relationship to other activities. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The mandates, objectives, and uses of available military power
varied among the four operations. The MNF in Haiti and UNITAF in
Somalia had Chapter VII enforcement authority from the outset,
which explicitly authorized them to use force, not merely in
self-defense, but as needed to achieve their objectives. In
practice, force was used sparingly and essentially in
self-defense rather than systematically and coercively; yet both
missions maintained a clear upper hand over actual or potential
opponents and created an acceptable degree of security for the
local population. UNTAC, operating under Chapter VI, achieved
essentially the same objective by stressing political dialogue.
Basic impartiality was maintained in all cases. <BR>
UNPROFOR in Bosnia was given Chapter VII authority for specific,
limited objectives in 1994, which were shared in a confused,
dual-key arrangement with NATO. Coordination problems between the
U.N. and NATO and confusion amongst key governments severely
hampered operations until August 1995, at considerable expense to
the credibility of both organizations.<hr><blockquote><b>Expanded
Peacekeeping in Haiti and Cambodia</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Haiti. The U.S.-led Multinational Force for Haiti (MNF) began on
September 19, 1994 with the approval of the Security Council,
which, at the same time, approved the follow-on U.N. operation.
The credible threat of overwhelming force--combined with
skillful, eleventh-hour diplomacy--<BR>
enabled U.S. forces to land unopposed and avoid the negative
consequences that combat would have brought. The MNF initially
employed over 20,000 U.S. military personnel, plus some 2,000
personnel from a dozen other countries. The mission was to
restore democracy by removing the de facto military regime,
return the previously elected Aristide regime to power, ensure
security, assist with the rehabilitation of civil administration,
train a police force and judiciary, help prepare for elections,
and turn over responsibility to the U.N. A prior but unfulfilled
political agreement between the parties on Governor's Island (New
York) in 1991 served as a template to shape objectives. There was
a major commitment to peace-building by civilian agencies of the
U.S. government, particularly USAID, closely coordinated with the
U.N. and numerous other international, regional, and
non-governmental organizations. The mission was successfully
completed on March 31, 1995, thanks to well-executed political,
military, diplomatic, and humanitarian activities. U.S. special
operations forces played an essential role in establishing
security and assuring de facto public administration in rural
areas.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Advanced planning and coordination for the transition were well
managed by the U.S. and the U.N., as were the selection and
training of senior leaders to sustain continued cooperative
international action. In contrast to the Somalia transition, the
U.N. deployed an advance headquarters element to Haiti six months
prior to the change of command. On March 31, 1995, a smaller U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Haiti (UNMIH) succeeded the powerful MNF,
with a March 1996 deadline for completion, after a newly-elected
President is scheduled to take office.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cambodia. This mission originated with a 1991 Paris agreement
amongst the five permanent members of the UNSC, aimed at getting
Vietnamese troops out of Cambodia and curbing the power of the
Khmer Rouge. The objectives of the 20,000-person military and
civilian force were: reform of civil administration and police
forces; relief and repatriation of over 500,000 refugees and
internally displaced persons; clearing of mines; the
demobilization of militias; monitoring the departure of foreign
military forces; and managing the organization and conduct of
elections. U.S. military personnel were present only as
observers. Initially, the mission sought to assume de facto
administrative control over Cambodia and disarm all combatants;
however, facing serious armed opposition from the Khmer Rouge, it
cut back its intrusive mandate and kept the channels of dialogue
open rather than creating an adversarial relationship (as in
Somalia). This decision avoided what would have been a very
bloody and disruptive conflict, putting the mission at serious
risk. It allowed free elections to be held in 90 percent of the
country. The mission was successfully terminated in September
1993.<p><img src="ch1107.gif" align="right"><b>Army Rangers

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When norms of international conduct have been egregiously
violated, the U.N. Security Council may decide upon peace
enforcement action. Peace enforcement is most likely to meet its
demanding objectives when coercive military force is employed on
a sustained basis without necessarily adhering to the principles
of consent or impartiality. Nevertheless, the military objectives
are limited in nature, such as protecting safe areas, enforcing
no-fly zones and cease-fires, or compelling disarmament.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the cases of UNOSOM II in Somalia and UNPROFOR in Bosnia,
expanded peacekeeping operations produce considerable conflict
with local parties and evolved into peace enforcement on the
ground, in part due to confusion by the U.N. Security Council and
key governments as well as in the execution of operations on the
ground. In the cases of Cambodia and Haiti and UNITAF in Somalia,
the potential for conflict was present, but a skillful
combination of force and diplomacy allowed the operations to
proceed successfully, avoiding conflict and the need for peace
enforcement on the ground.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali frankly admitted in
his January 1995 report to the General Assembly and Security
Council that the United Nations lacks the resources and
capabilities to manage complex peace operations properly,
especially those involving large military forces in a combat
environment. For its part, the United States must also consider
many issues--such as financial cost, diversion of national
military resources from other missions, the risk of casualties,
and the fragility of domestic and international support for peace
operations--in the context of whether participating furthers
important national interests. Doubts have also been raised about
the efficacy of using military force to pursue a durable
political agreement in states where political institutions have
been destroyed, and the wisdom of using force in conflicted
situations when impartiality and consent are vital to success.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whatever the frequency of future expanded peacekeeping or
peace-enforcement operations, U.S. involvement in them will
continue to be critical. In missions that enjoyed strong,
consistent backing from the United States--such as Cambodia and
the U.S.-led operations in Somalia and Haiti--there was a unity
of purpose and cohesive command. They established a dominant
position at the outset and maintained it, skillfully combining
political, military, and humanitarian activities. In contrast,
the U.N. missions in Somalia lacked a realistic mandate and
coherent support, politically or militarily, from those states
with the most influence and interest in the area. They also
suffered from internal U.N. weakness in the face of tough
opposition. Operations in Bosnia were also plagued for two years
by indecisiveness and internal dissension (compounded by
dual-command arrangements), owing to limited and uncertain
support by the United States and others; the U.N.'s inherent
weakness; and ruthless, calculating opponents who felt threatened
but not cowed by the U.N. presence and tried to exploit it.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When expanded operations are under consideration, the issues to
consider include: how to set the objectives clearly and with as
narrow limits as possible; what resources are likely to be
required over the anticipated duration of the mission and how
much support can be expected from other countries and
organizations; whether the resultant degree, duration, and cost
of a U.S. commitment is merited by the national interests
involved; how these interests can be articulated persuasively;
and the likelihood of sustained domestic political support.
Humanitarian motivations can generate very strong initial
pressures for U.S. involvement; however, in the absence of a
coherent policy and a politically salable rationale that has been
communicated effectively, public support typically fades soon
after difficulties arise. Indeed, nation-building--that is, de
facto trusteeship--requires such a long-term commitment of
large-scale resources that the U.S. is likely to avoid this
responsibility unless there is an overwhelming U.S. interest in
the country.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A variety of steps can be taken to limit the resources required
from the U.S. The size of the operation can be minimized if the
mission avoids direct confrontation with opposing parties, seeks
to contain rather than eliminate conflict, avoids excessive
intrusion into internal affairs such as nation-building or
externally created political reconciliation, and phases
operations out after an initial period--if necessary, even if
total success has not been achieved. The U.S. need not play a
major role in every operation; in some, it may contribute a minor
share of the personnel and resources by emphasizing its unique
and specialized capabilities and encouraging others to provide
the bulk of military forces required. In instances where a major
U.S. contribution is required, the U.S. can still reduce the
longer-term burden by planning at the outset for other nations to
contribute follow-on forces once threatening initial obstacles
have been overcome (as in Haiti).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Peace-enforcement missions are normally given strictly limited
objectives. Protection of safe or no-fly zones and of relief
deliveries can often be achieved by combined military and
political activity without abandoning impartiality. However, if
actions become so intrusive that they jeopardize the core
interests or major military capabilities of any of the parties to
the conflict, the mission will likely become enveloped in major
hostilities. At this stage, it must pull out or shift from peace
operations to virtual war. To be successful, future operations
will have to navigate this potentially dangerous situation.
Furthermore, peace forces are much more likely to be successful
in such situations when they possess overwhelming military
superiority and good C3I, are not deployed in exposed positions
or vulnerable to retaliation, have a good understanding of the
local political scene, and maintain political dialogue with all
sides.<p><b>IFOR Areas of Responsibility in Bosnia</b><img

Peace Enforcement in Bosnia</b><p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.N. operation in the former Yugoslavia was originally
concentrated in Croatia and then separated in early 1995 into
three loosely connected forces--in Croatia, Macedonia, and
Bosnia. U.N. military personnel in Croatia, who arrived in March
1992, numbered 15,000. Moderately armed, they were charged with
monitoring an existing cease-fire. In Macedonia, the U.N.
undertook the first preventive deployment in its history, with a
force of 1,150 lightly armed personnel, half of them from the
United States. In Bosnia, the mission's initial objective was
support for a major humanitarian relief operation by the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No U.S. military units participated in the U.N. Protection Force
(UNPROFOR), although U.S. aircraft and naval vessels provided the
bulk of the NATO naval blockade and air attack forces, plus
logistics and C3I acting in its support. The USAF also mounted a
separate humanitarian airlift and airdrop for Bosnia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1994, the U.N. mission for Bosnia was given an expanded
mandate by the Security Council: to enforce weapons exclusion and
no-fly zones, and to deter attacks on designated safe areas for
civilians. Enforcement was to be shared with NATO air units,
subject to U.N. approval. Use of military force was hamstrung by
major differences, however, both within NATO and the Security
Council, and among NATO, U.N. field commanders, and U.N.
headquarters. Serbian actions also proved daunting (e.g., hostage
taking of U.N. personnel), while Bosnian government forces
exploited safe areas to launch raids on Serb forces UNPROFOR was
not given the resources needed to carry out its expanded mission
as set forth in numerous UNSC Resolutions. The Serb capture of
U.N.-protected safe havens in July 1995, the Croatian capture of
Serb-held areas, and the brutal expulsion of Serbs in August 1995
led to a full-scale reassessment--by the United Nations, the
United States, and NATO--of the Bosnian mission's role and
mandate. The 30,000-man force in Bosnia was reinforced by a
10,000-man, heavily armed rapid-reaction force from the U.K.,
France, and the Netherlands. The force in Croatia was ordered
withdrawn by the Security Council, since Croatian military
success had vitiated its role of monitoring the lines between
Croatians and Serbs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Until August 1995, despite blatant provocations, force had been
used by NATO hesitantly, weakly and not at all by UNPROFOR. As a
result, credibility was lost by the U.N., NATO, and the U.S. By
mid-August, the U.N. and NATO had greatly improved their
coordination and strengthened their political will. Following
Serb attacks on Sarajevo in late August, NATO undertook a
well-planned air action, reinforced on the ground by the rapid
reaction force, in responding to Serb attacks. At this point,
UNPROFOR, as well as NATO, crossed the key threshold of
impartiality; UNPROFOR became a peace enforcement operation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Using momentum generated by the August-September 1995 joint
Croat-Bosnian offensive and the powerful NATO air strikes, the
U.S. launched a new diplomatic peace initiative. On September 8
in Geneva, the foreign ministers of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia,
and Serbia signed an agreed statement of basic principles on
ending the conflict in Bosnia. On October 12, a cease-fire
officially came into force. In November, proximity talks in
Dayton brokered by the U.S. led to an eventual peace agreement.
President Clinton announced his intention to deploy 20,000 U.S.
personnel as part of the 60,000 person NATO-led force that would
replace UNPROFOR to enforce the peace agreement, and to work with
civilian agencies, coordinated by the High Representative of the
international community called for by the Dayton accords, to
facillitate resettlement of over a million displaced persons and
the holding of elections.</blockquote><hr>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Humanitarian support operations entail conducting, assisting, or
safeguarding the delivery of food and medical supplies,
protecting civilian populations, and so forth. During the Cold
War, they were occasionally conducted in conjunction with peace
operations (e.g., in the Congo and Dominican Republic), but only
infrequently and usually as an afterthought.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Since the end of the Cold War, humanitarian operations have been
undertaken with increasing frequency and scope by the
international community, primarily to reduce the number of deaths
and alleviate human suffering on a massive scale. Military forces
have been a major component of several operations--some of which
were conducted in association with peace operations--providing
logistical support, assisting the activities of civilian
organizations, delivering food and health care directly to
refugees, rescuing emigrants at sea, and protecting humanitarian
operations undertaken by the international community. On
occasion, as in Bosnia and Somalia, the protection of
humanitarian operations by military forces under Chapter VI of
the U.N. Charter (i.e., operating with the consent of the parties
concerned) evolved into peace enforcement under Chapter VII (with
authority to use force).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In April 1991, Operation Sea Angel--a joint task force led by the
U.S. Marine Corps--provided emergency assistance to a million
Bangladeshis stricken by a devastating cyclone.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Somalia, Operation Provide Relief began in August 1992. A
dozen Air Force C-130s delivered 48,000 tons of food and medical
supplies in six months to international humanitarian
organizations, trying to help over three million starving people.
When this proved inadequate to stop the massive death and
displacement of Somali people (500,000 dead; 1.5 million refugees
or displaced), the U.S. in December 1992 launched a major
coalition operation to assist and protect humanitarian
activities. The operation was successful in stopping the famine
and saving an estimated 200,000 lives, as well as de-escalating
the high-intensity civil war into low-level, local skirmishes.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1992, UNPROFOR was established in Bosnia primarily to protect
relief operations. UNHCR was the lead agency in coordinating the
effort. Later, U.N. forces--with no direct U.S.
participation--attempted to provide safe havens and protection
for relief convoys. The U.S. played a major role in the relief
operation by conducting an airlift/airdrop of 69,000 tons to
Sarajevo. These activities alleviated but did not stop the
massive human suffering in Bosnia. UNPROFOR's humanitarian
operations led to clashes with most of the disputants, especially
the Serbs. UNPROFOR eventually became a peace enforcement
operation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In late July 1994, the U.S. military undertook Operation Support
Hope to supply food, medicine, vehicles, water-pumping and
purification equipment, and other items to an international
effort led by UNHCR to assist a million Rwandan refugees. Six
other countries also deployed military forces for this purpose,
among them Japan, France, Israel, and the Netherlands. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another type of humanitarian operation has been conducted by the
U.S. over the past several years in the Caribbean. Operation
Distant Shore intercepted Haitians and Cubans fleeing their
countries in flimsy craft destined for Florida. Though it can be
considered a humanitarian operation insofar as it rescued people
at risk on the open seas, the operation's principal purpose was
to prevent the intrusion of hundreds of thousands of illegal
aliens into the country, a highly charged political issue. By
intercepting these refugees before they reached U.S. soil, it was
possible to return them to their country of origin or confine
them in temporary detention centers. In some instances, Cuba and
Haiti deliberately encouraged emigration in order to apply
pressure on the U.S. Thus, Operation Distant Shore can be seen as
a means of managing a security problem, as well as humanitarian
support.<p><b>Humaintarian Emergencies, 1995</B><p><img

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Each relief operation with a potential requirement for military
support is likely to be assessed in more than just the terms of
the U.S. interests involved. The immediate and long-term need for
U.S. help, the availability of other assistance, probable costs,
and attainability of objectives will also be evaluated. Whenever
civilian agencies are given the job, perhaps with military
logistics support, the potential that disputants might control or
manipulate food distribution and that the operation could become
entangled in unresolved domestic power struggles must be
considered as well. Without proper oversight, humanitarian
missions can evolve unintentionally into political-military
operations with totally different objectives and requirements, as
occurred in Somalia and Bosnia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The military cannot seek to be a replacement for civilian
humanitarian organizations. Humanitarian support seems to work
best when the military relinquishes operations to civilians as
soon as the latter are able to manage them. Owing to their
unmatched logistical and organizational capabilities, however,
the armed forces are uniquely able to provide a massive, rapid
response to crises in remote locations and will likely continue
to do so in partnership with civilian organizations. Given the
inclination of the U.S. public to support humanitarian causes,
continued use of military assets for such missions seems
probable.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Peace operations provide a useful array of instruments for the
pursuit of important U.S. interests and values--notably the
preservation or restoration of stability, the enhancement of
democracy and human rights, and the alleviation of humanitarian
crises. Even if U.S. security is not immediately threatened,
instability, violence, and large-scale human suffering often pose
a long-term menace to important U.S. political and economic
interests. Under proper circumstances, the various forms of peace
operations have demonstrated a capacity to preclude, limit, or
resolve conflict and to relieve human suffering. Collective
action offers an alternative to inaction or unilateral action,
with the added advantage of a reduction in material and financial
costs for the U.S. and an increase in political effectiveness.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The least militarily intensive peace operations--conflict
prevention and peacemaking operations--have had a mixed record of
success. Yet they remain a viable instrument of policy because of
their relatively low cost, small size, and sustainability. Such
preventive measures may be used more frequently in the future,
especially given the favorable contrast with costly extended
peacekeeping operations and the increased efforts by the U.N.,
many member states, and PVOs to make them more effective and more
rapidly responsive. Still, greater U.S. military and civilian
cooperation with others in this effort is fully justified by the
low level of expenditure, the potentially high benefits, and the
anticipated cost savings.<p><img src="ch1106.gif"><p><b><P

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Peacekeeping operations have generally worked best when the
warring parties have reached an enduring settlement, although the
presence of peacekeeping forces, coupled with capable diplomacy,
can also provide a valuable face-saving cover needed to forge a
cease-fire and other agreements. With the end of superpower
rivalry, peacekeeping operations have generally focused on
resolving internal conflicts in individual states rather than
cross-border aggression. The missions are thus more complicated,
since there is less control over armed elements and, in some
cases, virtually no administrative structures or organized
leadership with which to work. As a result, the operations have
become multidimensional, incorporating such considerations as
human rights, police training, election monitoring, and
institution-building. Such versatility has led to a steady demand
for their deployment, and continued use in the future seems
inevitable, given the troubled state of the world. Moreover, they
are of modest cost, especially when there is broad, international
participation and support, and the degree of U.S. participation
can be minimized. Thus, continued U.S. active support rests upon
a calculation of national interest versus cost. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Coordination among interested member states, the United Nations,
regional organizations, and PVOs has become even more pivotal to
success for both the political and military dimensions of
peacekeeping. The Organization of American States has gained
experience in peacekeeping; the CIS is developing a capability;
serious projects are underway to improve the peacekeeping
capabilities of the Organization of African Unity; and the OSCE
is interested in developing its peacekeeping role. NATO is for
the first time deeply involved in peace operations. Numerous
Asian, African, Latin American, and European armies (including
those from the CIS) are improving their own peacekeeping
potential, in some cases with help from the U.S. International
and non-governmental organizations are following the same
approach. This trend deserves encouragement since it will tend to
make other countries both more receptive and more effective when
needed for peace operations. For the U.S., this means further
improvement in its own interagency capabilities and its
coordination with PVOs. It also means more work in helping the
U.N. Secretariat, regional organizations, and individual
countries become more proficient. In particular, the U.S. can
provide valuable help in improving planning, logistics, training,
and C3 capabilities. U.N. and regional organization approval will
continue to be very important as legitimization, enhancing the
prospects of participation or support by more states. This means
closer, sustained attention to diplomatic and
military-to-military efforts aimed at strengthening U.S.
relations with other countries.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some degree of U.S. military involvement can frequently make the
difference between success and failure for both conflict
prevention and peacekeeping operations. U.S. special
skills--supplied by small numbers of specialized personnel for
headquarters, C3I, psychological operations, civil affairs, and
special operations functions--can provide the essential extras to
ensure success. In addition, U.S. participation in an operation
will often inspire others to contribute, while U.S. absence is
apt to deter others, as well as harm the overall conduct of
operations and erode U.S. influence. This means a greater U.S.
concentration on how to enhance prospects for success with
limited participation, rather than assuming that the U.S. will
play the dominant role. Whatever role the U.S. plays, it is
essential to pay close, continuing attention on the ground and in
Washington to articulating U.S. objectives and interests, and
explaining clearly how operations are proceeding. Such measures
will help build and sustain support at home. <p><img

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The prognosis for expanded peacekeeping and peace enforcement is
less certain. By its own admission, the United Nations lacks the
capability to manage these ambitious missions, and the serious
problems of the operation in Bosnia and the failure of the
Somalia mission, plus very high costs, have undermined support
for such activities. Thus, additional operations, involving large
military forces under U.N. command, are not likely to be
undertaken any time in the near future, unless Washington decides
that an expanded peacekeeping or peace enforcement mission would
serve important U.S. interests and opts to form a coalition to
undertake the action (as in Bosnia, secceeding UNPROFOR). The
U.S. government might seek a Security Council or regional
endorsement to mobilize international support for an effective
coalition under U.S. or perhaps under NATO leadership and C3I, as
it did for IFOR.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The number of military establishments capable of engaging
seriously in peace enforcement is not likely to increase
significantly in the near term, despite U.S. military assistance.
Therefore, future coalition-formation efforts may focus primarily
on countries that already possess advanced military capabilities.
Other countries are more likely to be considered for supporting,
rather than principal, tasks in such a coalition. Operational
effectiveness in rapidly changing situations is likely to be
impeded if arrangements are made with an eye to political
symbolism. Dual-command arrangements (e.g. U.S.-U.N. in Somalia,
NATO-U.N. in Bosnia) are an example of arrangements that pose
serious operational difficulties. Moreover, UNSC Resolutions are
not always realistic in their operational implications for forces
on the ground.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Humanitarian operations continue to receive a great deal of
attention in Washington and around the world. Military support
has proven its utility as a partner in such operations in
northern Iraq, Somalia, Bangladesh, and on the Zaire-Rwanda
border. A number of other countries are expanding their military
as well as civilian capacity to support humanitarian operations.
Similarly, important work continues within the U.S. armed forces,
other government agencies, and some NGOs to institutionalize and
improve military-civilian cooperation in humanitarian operations.
