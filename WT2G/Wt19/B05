<H1>Earthwatch Helps Public Tune In On Environment</H1>

</CENTER>

After 22 years, 5,700 radio programs, three published collections of scripts, and 10 major awards from environmental and educational organizations, Wisconsin Sea Grant's Earthwatch Public Service Radio Program continues to provide a huge and growing national radio audience with sharp, concise programs about the environment and science, particularly about the Great 

<P>

<H2>Lakes and the oceans</H2>



Earthwatch is a weekly series of five, two-minute programs produced by the Sea Grant Institute and the Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Every two weeks, institute staff and student writers prepare and record 10 Earthwatch programs and distribute them on cassette tape free of charge to more than 150 radio stations throughout the Great Lakes region and beyond. The program's appeal is reflected in the fact that a third of these stations have carried the program for more than five years. 

<P>

Earthwatch's high quality has won it numerous awards, and in 1992 the United Nations Environment Programme added Earth-watch's name to its "Global 500 Roll of Honour" at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.

<P>

<H2>22:1 Return on Investment </H2>



Although commercial radio is a fiercely competitive market, Earthwatch is currently given free airtime by 84 commercial radio stations throughout the country. 

<P>

This is particularly remarkable given that commercial stations no longer are required to provide public service programming and could otherwise sell that airtime to advertisers. The fact that so many commercial stations broadcast Earthwatch at their own expense provides further  evidence of the program's mass audience appeal.     

<P>

Market surveys indicate that the value of commercial radio airtime donated to Earthwatch in 1993 was $527,000 -- a 10:1 benefit: cost return on the annual investment of $52,000 federal Sea Grant dollars. The figure is even more impressive when noncommercial airtime is factored in. More than 80 noncommercial outlets -- including 75 radio stations and seven reading services for the blind -- also broadcast the program.  

<P>

In 1993, the estimated value of noncommercial airtime, based on the average price of two minutes of commercial airtime, totalled more than $588,000. Together, commercial and noncommercial airtime donated to Earthwatch totalled nearly $1.12 million for a benefit:cost return on the federal investment of more than 22:1.

<P>

<H2>Promotes Science Literacy</H2>



While Earthwatch is designed to promote public environmental literacy through the mass media, program scripts with lasting informational value have been recycled into books, and electronic copies are now available online as well. Three collections of Earth-watch scripts have been published under the title Earthwatching,  the most recent of which, Earthwatch-ing III, featured a teacher's guide. 

<P>

Earthwatch scripts produced since January 1990 are available to the estimated 20 million users of the Internet global computer network via the UW-Madison "gopher" information server. UW-Madison computer records show that nearly a thousand Internet users access this collection of scripts every month.

<H3>Marine Toxins</H3>



<H1>Studies Unravels Mystery Of Public Health Threat</H1>

</CENTER>

Toxic or harmful algal blooms, commonly called "red tides," are a serious economic and public health problem throughout the United States and the world. 

<P>

In the New England region, the most serious problem is paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), a potentially fatal human neurological disorder caused by ingesting shellfish that have accumulated toxins as they feed on dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium. These toxins also can affect marine organisms and animals throughout the food chain, and they have been linked to massive die-offs of fish and humpback whales.

<P>

For more than 10 years, the Sea Grant Program at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) has provided support for a series of studies on the regional red tide phenomenon. Led by biologist Don Anderson, WHOI Sea Grant researchers have published more than 45 papers on this subject, providing a wealth of physiological, genetic and ecological information for those confronting similar problems elsewhere in the United States or the world. The WHOI program is cited by many as a model for red tide investigations.

<P>

<H2>First Findings</H2>



Shortly after PSP first was reported in Massachusetts in the early 1970s, Sea Grant supported Anderson and his co-workers to study Alexandrium ecology in Cape Cod salt ponds. The experience and information gained from these small-scale studies then led to larger, more ambitious field investigations of the widespread coastal algal-bloom phenomena responsible for PSP outbreaks in the southwestern Gulf of Maine.

<P>

With Sea Grant support, researchers at WHOI were the first to describe the dormant cyst of Alexandrium, a life cycle stage that allows the alga to initiate new blooms and disperse to new regions after overwintering in sediment. 

<P>

These researchers also were the first to map cyst distributions throughout the region, discovering Alexandrium cysts in Connecticut and Long Island, N.Y., where PSP had never occurred. 

<P>

Subsequent to these discoveries, researchers monitored shellfish in those areas and detected PSP at levels that could have caused serious illness and death in human consumers if quarantine notices had not been posted. 

<P>

Anderson's group also identified a key hydrographic feature underlying PSP outbreaks in the coastal waters of the region. They discovered a buoyant coastal current, originating in the rivers of southern Maine. The current travels southward, carrying populations of Alexandrium hundreds of miles in a few weeks. The location of the plume and its associated toxic cells vary in a predictable manner with rainfall and wind, and this understanding now provides the cornerstone of a predictive capability that someday will allow regulatory officials not only to monitor the movement of the water mass using remote sensing techniques, but to predict where and when PSP outbreaks are likely to occur. This knowledge of Alexandrium transport and bloom dynamics proved especially important in the public controversy surrounding a proposed new Boston Harbor sewage outfall that would alter the nutrient loading into Massachusetts Bay.  

<P>

Many opposed to the project cited the possibility for increased red tides as an adverse impact, with potentially drastic effects on the northern right whale, an endangered species. In the many symposia and public discussions that took place, Anderson's group frequently was called upon to provide insight based on the legacy of Sea Grant-funded red tide research.  

<P>

This issue highlighted the conflict between scientific uncertainty and the public's need for predictions and advice, and revealed many areas where information still was lacking.  These areas now are the subject of ongoing Sea Grant investigations, co-sponsored by a Massachusetts state agency.  

<P>

<H2>National Plan Prepared</H2>



At the national level, sustained Sea Grant research funding at WHOI has had a significant impact on the nature of harmful algal bloom (HAB) research throughout the United States. Anderson now is working closely with several federal agencies to mount a coordinated, national attack on the diverse HAB phenomena that affect our coastal states.  

<P>

A national plan has been prepared to guide research and monitoring programs on all aspects of the HAB problem, from toxin detection to resource management to bloom ecology. Separate initiatives now are emerging from this plan, such as a joint NSF- and NOAA-sponsored workshop to establish a science plan on the oceanography and ecology of HABs. 

<P>

Sea Grant support of research on red tides at WHOI thus has established a center of excellence for regional problems, and the knowledge and experience gained has been instrumental in formulating and implementing a national attack on this problem.

1997 Call for Proposals</H1>
</CENTER>

The Center for Field Research invites proposals for 1997 field grants awarded by its affiliate Earthwatch.  Earthwatch is an international, non-profit organization dedicated to sponsoring research and promoting public education in the sciences and humanities.  All funds awarded by Earthwatch are derived from the contributions of Earthwatch members who pay for the opportunity to join scientists in the field and assist with data collection and other research tasks.  On average, each volunteer contributes $600 - $900 towards the field grant and spends 12 to 16 days in the field.  Grants range from $8,000 - $100,000 depending on the project length and number of volunteers involved.  Preliminary proposals for Earthwatch field grants should be submitted at least 13 months in advance of anticipated field dates. Full proposals are invited upon review of preliminary proposals.  Information about Earthwatch field grants is available on The Center's World Wide Web site:  (<A HREF="http://gaia.earthwatch.org/cfr/cfr.html">http://gaia.earthwatch.org/cfr/cfr.html</A>) or by contacting:

Albert F. Eble and Robert Scro synthesize the scientific literature on the eastern oyster's general anatomy (Chapter 2), covering structures such as the mantle, gills, and labial palps as well as the functioning of the digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems.  Eble draws extensively on his own unpublished studies. Subsequent chapters cover  specific features of oyster anatomy in more detail, for example, Carol Morrison summarizes details on the structure and function of the adductor and mantle musculature (Chapter 4), andAlbert Eble surveys the research (Chapter 7) on the heart and circulatory system.

Few fields in oyster biology have progressed as rapidly in the last decade as studies in oyster diseases and disease mechanisms. Since the early twentieth century, when an outbreak of an unidentified disease led to massive mortalities of eastern oysters in Prince Edward Island, Canada, disease has been a major concern for the oyster industry and resource management. Since the late 1950s, diseases have been responsible for devastating oyster mortalities , particularly in Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay. Susan Ford and M.R. Tripp (Chapter 17) describe the major infectious diseases of the eastern oysters -- Juvenile Oyster Disease and Dermo, MSX, and SSO -- and the oyster's responses to them. They review the subject of defense mechanisms by describing interactions between cellular and humoral elements in oysters and a variety of biotic and abiotic agents.
<P>
The oyster's primary means of defense are hemocytes that are found in hemolymph, the oyster's circulatory fluid. Thomas Cheng (Chapter 8) surveys our understanding of hemocytic processes.

<CENTER>Reducing Bycatch to Help Build Sustainable Fisheries<H2>
</H2>
</CENTER>
Bycatch is the portion of a commercial catch that is not targeted and is either economically undesirable or is governmentally regulated and, therefore, cannot be landed. Bycatch is discarded at sea and often results in nearly 100 percent mortality. While the impact of bycatch-induced mortality on stock recruitment is unknown, the unhealthy condition of many of the world's fisheries is focusing attention on factors contributing to the decline of desirable stocks. Thus, the economically tenuous commercial fishing industry is becoming proactive in promoting methods to reduce bycatch both as a conservation measure and as a means to avoid even more restrictive regulations.
<P>
Closely coupled Sea Grant research and technology transfer is making progress in bycatch reduction. This effort is particularly important because bycatch caps are set for certain species. When the caps are met, the fisheries are closed even if the target species quota has not been landed. In the North Pacific, closures resulting from the cap placed on halibut bycatch cost approximately $100 million in lost fish and opportunity in 1991 alone. Therefore, Washington Sea Grant is conducting research to increase the precision of halibut bycatch mortality data and to develop methods to help halibut bycatch survive through better onboard handing.
<P>
The size of fish caught as bycatch in trawl fisheries is directly related to the shape and size of the mesh used for the targeted species. In the North Pacific, a project supported by Washington Sea Grant, industry, and the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation recently demonstrated that undersize walleye pollock (bycatch) can escape larger mesh trawls even when a single load weighs 200,000 pounds. On the East Coast, net characteristics also influence bycatch in the mixed groundfish fishery. All species respond differently to stimuli created by the net and provide challenges to scientific understanding, but further work on species and general fish size selection should result in predictive models for specific fishery applications.
<P>
Sea Grant research on selective gear has already cause changes in fishing practices. Work by Maine-New Hampshire and Rhode Island Sea Grant programs has contributed to the development of a shrimp separator trawl used in North Atlantic waters that reduces bycatch of small groundfish. As a result, many New England states have passed shrimping regulations requiring separator trawls to be used in state waters. In addition, based on Virginia Sea Grant research to reduce bycatch of undersize scallops, the New England Fishery Management Council has amended its Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan to incorporate use of dredge rings of a larger size.
<P>
In the Southeast and Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery, trawls with small mesh are used to retain shrimp, causing as many as 10 pounds of undersize finfish bycatch to be taken for each pound of shrimp. To help reduce this disproportionate amount of bycatch, Georgia, Louisiana, MIT, Mississippi-Alabama, North Carolina, and Texas Sea Grant programs have conducted tow tank experiments, diver observations, remote video observations, and experimental trawling to develop bycatch reduction devices (BRDs).
<P>
The simplest type of BRD is the fish-eye, a metal support sewn into the codend of a net to hold open a hole that allows finfish to escape. Bycatch of some species such as redfish and croaker can be reduced over 50 percent when BRDs are used, but their performance is highly variable. The loss of shrimp when using BRDs is of continuing concern to shrimpers. In replicated fishing experiments with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service and concerned shrimpers, Georgia Sea Grant has identified some causes of shrimp loss in BRDs that can be corrected.
<P>
The bycatch of marine mammals in various set net fisheries is an extremely volatile issue. Maine-New Hampshire and Alaska Sea Grant specialists are experimenting with subtle underwater sound to warn mammals about the presence of fishing nets. Preliminary results are encouraging. In Alaska, documentation of marine mammal interactions with specific fisheries has helped managers and industry focus limited resources on the most important bycatch issues so that changes in fishing practices will have the greatest impact.
<P>
A national conference convened by Alaska and Oregon Sea Grant in 1992 resulted in fishing industry leaders agreeing to work together on bycatch. In the future, Sea Grant will continue its work with NMFS and fishermen to reduce bycatch in the more intractable fisheries such as mixed groundfish and shrimp. In addition, Sea Grant is providing leadership through a Rhode Island Sea Grant scientist who is serving on an international working group to address the problems of bycatch. All of this work is important to NOAA's goal of building a sustainable U.S. fishery. (For details, Bud Griswold, 301/713-2431)

<H2>Biotechnology: Combatting Marine Pathogens</H2>
</CENTER>

Many viruses and bacteria in marine and coastal waters contaminate aquatic animals and cause illness in humans. Other pathogens cause disease in fish and shellfish and are responsible for large-scale mortality of animals in natural fisheries and aquacultural operations. While some of these pathogens are indigenous to aquatic environments, others are present because of pollution. Sea Grant scientists are taking several paths to solving problems associated with marine pathogens. 
<P>
In Alabama, Louisiana and North Carolina, Sea Grant researchers are working on rapid and unequivocal assays for pathogens in seafood. Using DNA technology, they are developing practical methods to detect Hepatitis A Virus and "Vibrio" and "Salmonella" bacteria that oysters and clams can filter from polluted waters. Taking a different approach, Rhode Island Sea Grant researchers are using antibody technology to develop biosensors that directly detect pathogens in seafood. 
<P>
At California Sea Grant, scientists are developing methods to precisely delineate polluted coastal waters so that bans on fishing and recreation can be restricted to the smallest possible areas. They are attempting to use gene probes to provide characteristic profiles of the bacterial and viral populations in unpolluted areas. These will be compared to profiles of waters that can be polluted by sewage effluents, storm water runoff, and harbor discharges. 
<P>
To prevent spread of disease and ensure that healthy stocks are used in aquaculture, Sea Grant scientists in Maine, Minnesota, New York, and Oregon are developing diagnostic tests for several diseases. These include an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to diagnose bacterial kidney disease (BKD); a test, providing a reading within minutes, for infectious necrosis virus in finfish tissue samples; an antibody test for a rickettsial disease; and a procedure for detecting infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in hatchery facilities. Oregon researchers already have developed an effective vaccine for IPNV and are attempting to clone interleukins of rainbow trout so that they can be evaluated as general immunostimulants to combat many salmonid diseases. 
<P>
Other Sea Grant programs are also working on vaccines to combat fish diseases. BKD affects Atlantic and Pacific salmon worldwide. Because antibiotics currently approved for use in aquaculture do not inhibit BKD, researchers in Washington are developing a vaccine for the disease. In Maine, researchers are creating a single finfish vaccine against two diseases that spread rapidly in high density aquaculture. By using genetically engineered bacteria, the researchers plan to develop methods to produce, on a practical scale, a bivalent vaccine against a lethal "Vibrio" bacterium and the virus that causes pancreatic necrosis. 
<P>
Hawaii Sea Grant scientists have developed techniques to culture the virus that causes runt-deformity syndrome and is responsible for enormous losses in crustacean aquaculture. Building on this research, Arizona scientists developed a DNA probe for diagnosing the disease. The test is used to certify health of crustacean brood stocks and juveniles headed for grow-out facilities. It will help protect natural fishery stocks by preventing inadvertent introduction of the disease to new areas. 
<P>
Sea Grant also is conducting research to counteract pathogens in natural fisheries. Dermo and MSX are parasitic diseases that have almost destroyed the oyster fishery in Chesapeake Bay. To control a parasitic disease, its natural history and its cellular interaction with hosts must first be determined. Recently, Maryland Sea Grant scientists and researchers at two other centers independently took a major step in this direction by developing a technique to culture pure, reproductive strains of the dermo parasite in the laboratory. The new culture technique is expected to be a key to defining dermo's infective processes and to devising a strategy for protecting oysters from it. Other researchers in Maryland and Virginia are working on practical methods to introduce MSX-resistant oysters to the Bay. 
<P>
In developing new technologies for ensuring public safety, Sea Grant scientists will advance the molecular sciences and apply state-of-the-art technology to solving problems that inhibit development of aquaculture and use of fishery resources. This area of research will continue to receive attention as $3.2 million in new NOAA Sea Grant funding is awarded in 1994 for projects in marine biotechnology (For details, David Attaway, 301/713-2451 or <A HREF="mailto:dattaway@rdc.noaa.gov">dattaway@rdc.noaa.gov</A>)

<H2>Coastal Erosion Study Results in Action
</H2>
</CENTER>
Along certain areas of the Texas coast, erosion is a severe problem.  It was so severe at Sargent Beach in Matagorda County that only 600 feet of land separated the Gulf and the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway (GIWW).  As the erosion continued, the county¹s <A HREF="http://texas-sea-grant.tamu.edu/">Texas Sea Grant</A> outreach specialist became increasingly concerned as block after block of homes disappeared into the Gulf.  He also worried that one large hurricane could easily breech this land strip, cutting off waterborne commerce on the GIWW and destroying thousands of acres of valuable wetlands as well as the bay system ecology.
<P>
Major industries such as mining, chemical manufacturing, and petroleum refining depend on water transportation.  Because of the GIWW, these industries, along with their respective payrolls and tax payments, have located along the Texas coast.
<P>
To acquaint the public, industry, business, and government of the consequences of ignoring this erosion problem, the Texas Sea Grant outreach specialist organized meetings and workshops.  He also raised money to have an economic study conducted.  The study showed that, in Texas, the GIWW directly contributes more than $3 billion annually to the state¹s economy. In addition, the study indicated that closing of the waterway would cost the local economy $20 million a day and jeopardize about 150,000 jobs.
<P>
Information from this study caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to speed up its normal construction schedule for shore protection.  The Corps is now building a seven-mile-long seawall to protect Sargent Beach and to retard erosion before the Gulf breaks through.

Research and Education Program Developed to Save Greenwich Bay
</H2>
</CENTER>
Greenwich Bay, a 15-square mile estuary in Rhode Island, faces critical problems such as deteriorating water quality, closed fisheries, and increased conflict over use of limited space. Although local and state governments were prepared to take action to stop the bay¹s pollution and sustain its fishery, little was known about the bay as an ecosystem.  In addition, many of the citizens serving on the local volunteer boards and commissions lacked the knowledge necessary to make well-integrated local land use and waterfront decisions.  
<P>
To provide these volunteers with the information they needed to set priorities and guide decisions, <A HREF="http://seagrant.gso.uri.edu/riseagrant">Rhode Island Sea Grant</A> has launched a multi-faceted program combining research and education. The research component of this program focuses on the fate and transport of pollutants in Greenwich Bay and on translating this knowledge to improve management of the bay and its resources.  The focus of the education component has been on translating this knowledge to improve management of the bay and its resources. 
<P>
Before beginning the educational facet of the program, local and state officials in the watershed were contacted to assess their training needs. An eight-week Sea Grant educational course was then developed and conducted by a project coordinator from the University of Rhode Island¹s Coastal Resources Center.  Central to this course was a training manual that covered information pertinent to the issues affecting the bay. 
<P>
Twenty-eight members of three Rhode Island town boards and commissions in Warwick, East Greenwich, and North Kingstown recently completed this eight-week course.  These officials are now better equipped to deal with the sophisticated technical issues involved in making wise decisions on the future of Greenwich Bay.

<H2>Research Provides New Tool for Alaska Fishery Managers
</H2>
</CENTER>
Hatchery pink and chum salmon returning to Juneau area waters last summer had a unique new bar code imprinted on their inner ear bone. These codes were imprinted through a method adapted by <A HREF="http://www.uaf.alaska.edu/seagrant/">Alaska Sea Grant</A> that takes advantage of a natural process in the fish.
<P>
Newborn salmon add a new layer to the otolith (inner ear bone) each day. These layers, some light and some dark, resemble a bar code when viewed through a microscope. Scientists at Cornell University and Uppsala University in Sweden discovered that by raising and lowering the water temperature as little as two degrees they could artificially put more easily recognizable layers on the otolith. 
<P>
Five years ago, Alaska Sea Grant researchers, in partnership with the Douglas Island Pink and Chum Hatchery (DIPAC), adapted the bar coding process for large-scale use in Alaska hatcheries. Since then, millions of young salmon released at the DIPAC hatchery have been imprinted. 
<P>
State fishery managers use the code to distinguish wild and hatchery salmon stocks. Now that all members of a cohort group can be identified, more data can be collected to aid managers in making decisions. In addition, hatchery managers use the code for problems such as determining how their stocks are affecting local fisheries. 
<P>
Currently, the bar coding process is being used by other Southeast Alaska hatcheries. In the future, this new technology will also be used in Prince William Sound where the Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation will code hundreds of millions of its juvenile salmon to learn how wild and hatchery salmon can be better managed there.

<H2>Former Students Fill Top Spots in Academia, Government, and Industry
</H2>
</CENTER>
For the past 25 years, Sea Grant education has been making a difference. That is what a recently completed survey of former <A HREF="http://h2o.seagrant.wisc.edu/home.html">Wisconsin Sea Grant</A>-supported graduate students shows. 
<P>
The survey revealed the following:
<BR><UL>
<LI>In the last 25 years, these former students have received 396 graduate degrees (152 Ph.D.s and 244 Master¹s). 
<LI>These graduates work in 46 of the 50 United States as well as in 31 foreign countries. 
<LI>Forty-two percent of survey respondents currently work in the private sector, 35 percent in the academic sector,  and 21 percent in the public sector.
</UL><P>
Judging by their vitae, the Wisconsin Sea Grant-trained graduates have become national assets. They have joined the executive suites of major corporations, become senior scientists in government laboratories, started their own businesses, become professors and been elected to public office.
<P>
Positions held by these former students range from a laboratory director for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to an eighth-grade science teacher to a director of environmental health and laboratories for a Midwestern city of 200,000.
<P>
And the benefits multiply. A former Wisconsin Sea Grant student, now a professor of marine geochemistry at the University of Michigan, estimates that to date he has taught oceanography to more than 3,000 undergraduates and instructed 500 more in his summer geology field research course. In addition, he has taught marine geochemistry to 100 graduate students and served as major professor for eight Ph.D. students and 15 Master¹s students, some of whom have received support from Michigan Sea Grant during their studies. 
<P>
The guiding philosophy of the Wisconsin Sea Grant education subprogram continues to be that education--especially graduate education--is a risk-free investment with an excellent rate of return. (For details, <A HREF="mailto:bill.graham@noaa.gov">William Graham</A>, 301/713-2448).

<H2> Coral Reef Ecosystems<BR>
Protected Through Volunteer Program
</H2>
</CENTER>
Honolulu's world-renowned Hanauma Bay attracts as many as 10,000 visitors a day. Over the years, such heavy use has taken its toll on the bay. Ninety percent of the nearshore coral reef has been killed, and fish populations have changed radically because of constant hand feeding. Realizing the need to reverse the damage to the marine life of the island's second most popular tourist attraction, <A HREF="gopher://gopher.hawaii.edu:70/1/seagrant">Hawaii Sea Grant</A> along with state and local government agencies and an environmental group created the Hanauma Bay Educational Program (HBEP).
<P>
HBEP is a volunteer-driven effort to increase public knowledge about island reef ecosystems and to promote the stewardship of Hanauma Bay and other coral reefs of Hawaii through public education. To accomplish this goal, specialists from Sea Grant and other organizations trained volunteers in conducting free natural history interpretive walks for visitors. Visitors are now taught the importance of minimizing their impact on the environment by not trampling on or collecting the delicate corals.
<P>
The program also includes a beach-side information desk and cleanup patrols. In addition, HBEP volunteers visit the islands' public schools to educate students about the fragility of coral reefs and to encourage stewardship of the entire marine ecosystem.
<P>
The combined undertakings in the schools and at the bay itself have proven surprisingly successful. The volunteers' cleanup patrols and educational efforts have helped to reduce pollution of the bay and stem the degradation of the nearshore reef. More visitors, for example, are now using waterproof sunscreen products whose chemical ingredients do not leach into the water and onto the living reefs. Also, most visitors have stopped feeding the fish inappropriate foods. The word has gotten out that bread, peas, and corn are not acceptable food for the fish. Visitors who bring these foods to the bay can now change them for a packet of "fish friendly" foods at the information desk staffed by HBEP volunteers.
<P>
Recently, HBEP was recognized for developing creative and practical environmental solutions to restore the reef at Hanauma Bay. It was awarded a 1993 Chevron Conservation Award from the nation's oldest privately-sponsored program for recognizing environmental role models. (For details, Bud Griswold, 301/713-2431)

<H2> Drilling for Oil Improved
</CENTER>
</H2>
Drilling is a substantial part of offshore petroleum production costs. Lost time caused by the failure of drill strings (long pipes with a drill at the end) in offshore areas can exceed $1 million per drill hole. Therefore, in 1986, an <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena/org/s/seagrant/www/mitsg.htm">MIT Sea Grant</A> researcher was asked by industry to apply knowledge gained from his Sea Grant-sponsored work on the vibration of marine cables and risers to problems associated with the dynamics of drill strings.
<P>
Building upon the results of previous Sea Grant supported research, one year's additional MIT Sea Grant funding served as seed which enabled an industry consortium-sponsored project to be initiated to solve the costly drill string failure problem. Afterwards, industry assumed full support of the project and, by the sixth year, the consortium had reached its peak membership of 14 companies in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
<P>
Greatly exceeding original expectations, the project not only resulted in reduced lost time, but also stimulated the establishment of a new surface-vibration measurement industry which monitors drilling performance by measurement of drill-string vibration. In addition, the project resulted in the identification of a destructive drill-bit vibration mechanism. This finding led engineers at AMOCO and Eastman-Christianson to invent a vibration-resistant bit which is now commercially available.
<P>
Along with these industrial developments, the MIT Sea Grant project also was instrumental in the graduate education of nine students, three of whom earned a Ph.D., five a masters degree, and one a postdoctoral. (For details, <A HREF="mailto:john.ahrens@noaa.gov">John Ahrens</A>, 301/7l3-2435)

<H2>Helping Coastal Managers Deal With Nutrient Overenrichment</H2>
</CENTER>
Increasing coastal development has led to a reduction in water quality along much of the coast of the United States. Although toxic pollutants are problems in many areas, the Environmental Protection Agency has identified excess nutrients (eutrophication) as the major water quality problem in U. S. estuaries. Sea Grant has a long history of research and outreach activities addressing the eutrophication issue and, as a result, understanding of the behavior of nutrients in coastal environments has advanced significantly. However, many aspects of the problem still need to be better understood.
<P>
Sea Grant researchers in Rhode Island and North Carolina are addressing the effects of nutrients on shallow embayments, paying particular attention to the responses of seagrasses. In North Carolina, investigators are questioning whether the contrasting response of three seagrass species to increased levels of nutrients may lead to changes in composition of the seagrass communities. Rhode Island investigators have developed elaborate mesocosms, where an entire shallow-water ecosystem can be simulated, including sediment, plants, animals, and water. They are testing various scenarios of nutrient input and flushing rates to predict the impacts on coastal ponds of increased population density and changes in land use patterns.
<P>
Knowledge of nutrient cycling in the water column of estuaries and coastal waters has improved substantially, but gaps remain. For example, it is known that much of the nutrient inputs to coastal estuaries comes in the form of inorganic compounds, but scientists are just beginning to understand the significance of organic nutrient inputs. New Jersey Sea Grant researchers are assessing the impact of the large fraction of nitrogen that enters coastal estuaries in the form of dissolved organic matter. The results of this and similar studies may lead to a reevaluation of the strategy of concentrating nutrient reduction efforts on inorganic inputs.
<P>
North Carolina Sea Grant researchers are investigating the interplay of light and nutrients in controlling phytoplankton productivity. They are trying to predict the outcome of scenarios, such as an increase in agricultural runoff, where the increase in sediment input would result in more available nutrients but less available light. Other North Carolina investigators are assessing the impact of chronic, long-term increases in nutrients on estuarine and coastal ecosystems versus acute, short-term nutrient pulses such as those resulting from storm events.
<P>
Most eutrophication research has taken place in temperate estuaries, but tropical environments, such as coral reef ecosystems, are equally susceptible. In Florida, Sea Grant researchers are attempting to distinguish the effects of anthropogenic nutrient inputs on coral reef ecosystems from those due to natural inputs of nutrients from offshore waters. They are looking both at the reef systems as they exist now and at the historical response of the reefs as captured in the coral skeletons laid down during many years of growth. At Hawaii Sea Grant, the mechanism through which the corals take up nutrients from the waters that pass over the reefs is the subject of an investigation that will lead to better models for predicting the impact of nutrient increases.
<P>
Much of the information critical to developing and evaluating management responses to the nutrient problem comes from long-term monitoring programs. Although Sea Grant does not support environmental monitoring per se, there has always been interest in investigating novel approaches that would improve the efficiency or sensitivity of monitoring programs.
<P>
Currently, a Delaware Sea Grant researcher is developing techniques to use molecular probes on phytoplankton to measure the concentration of cellular proteins that respond to nutrient limitation. This assay would be extremely sensitive and could be carried out without the long incubations that are now necessary. Maryland Sea Grant investigators have developed indices for monitoring eutrophication that use oxygen measurements to follow whole ecosystem metabolism. Presently, they are modifying these indices for use in Chesapeake Bay to better account for the importance of the Bay's shallow-water regions.
<P>
The coastal management community needs more information and better tools with which to deal with the problem of nutrient overenrichment, and the Sea Grant network is responding to the challenge (For details, Leon Cammen, 301/713-2435 or <A HREF="mailto:lcammen@rdc.noaa.gov">lcammen@rdc.noaa.gov</A)

<H2>New Technology Promises Boost to Marine Aquaculture</H2>
</CENTER>
Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing primary production sectors in the U.S. However, this country lags behind others in developing aquaculture's full economic potential, and it is only a modest competitor in the world marketplace. A major factor contributing to this limited development is the inability to dependably and cost-effectively culture the microscopic, single- celled marine algae needed to feed the larval stages of both marine shrimp and fish and all life stages of mollusks.
<P>
Traditionally, algal feed for aquaculture is grown in batches which requires using many culture tanks to ensure continuous production. This method is labor intensive and conducive to culture collapse since most facilities grow the algae outdoors where contamination occurs. In some marine hatcheries, the costs of producing the algae alone is as high as 50 percent of operating expenses.
<P>
Researchers at the Delaware and Texas Sea Grant programs had some success growing algae on a larger scale using the batch culture method but, because of cost and contamination problems, new methods of culturing algae were needed.
<P>
Therefore, during a project on ocean thermal energy conversion in the Virgin Islands, Sea Grant researchers investigated the possibility of continuous algal culture using nutrient-rich, deep ocean water. Their work showed that algae could be harvested continuously without resorting to batch culture techniques.
<P>
Then, with the help of computers and process control, Louisiana Sea Grant engineers developed a laboratory scale, computer-automated system, called a turbidostat, for continuously culturing algae. This system provides precise control of the process, increases algal production tenfold over the beach culture method, and reduces problems of contamination.
<P>
However, on a commercial scale, high energy needs for artificial lighting and temperature control made the continuous culture of algae indoors uneconomical. To reduce production costs through energy savings by using natural light, researchers at Georgia and Louisiana Sea Grant, in a pilot-scale project, are currently investigating use of the computer-automated turbidostat under greenhouse conditions.
<P>
In addition, the Louisiana Sea Grant researchers are combining the positive attributes of both the indoor continuous culture and the outdoor pond culture technologies into a computer-automated, hydraulically- integrated, serial turbidostat algal reactor (HISTAR).
<P>
To reduce algal production costs, HISTAR combines the precise control and high production capabilities of the computer-automated turbidostat with large outdoor tanks. The system physically consists of an indoor turbidostat unit connected to a series of outdoor continuous-flow, stirred tank reactors (CFSTRs). The turbidostat produces a high quality, dense algal suspension that is continuously injected into the first of the large tanks.
<P>
As algae flows from one CFSTR to the next, the standing crop is increased until the desired concentration is reached by the final tank. This method permits precise control of the algae at the front end, while taking advantage of large outdoor tanks and natural lighting to produce the mass quantities of algae required for most commercial operations. Of equal importance is that contaminants can be "washed out" of the system by manipulation of the hydraulic retention time.
<P>
HISTAR is in the early stages of prototype testing. Following demonstrations on the Louisiana State University campus, it will be tested in a commercial setting.
<P>
The goal of this Sea Grant research is to develop a centralized marine algal production ability with regional distribution facilities that would supply algae and secondary feed products to commercial aquaculture businesses. This arrangement would remove from the individual businesses the burden of growing algae, which would reduce their production costs and facilitate expansion of their growout activities. It would also keep algal culturing technology near to research experts, enabling technological advances to be easily implemented and transferred to the aquaculture industry.

<H2>Partnerships Formed to Meet Educational Challenges</H2>
</CENTER>
Precollege education is changing. The need to achieve national and international excellence in the future workforce requires a concerted, multi-agency effort focused on education. Sea Grant is responding to that challenge by providing leadership through partnerships.
<P>
What happens in today's classrooms is not what happened 20 years ago. Text books are no longer the only curriculum guide, cookbook-type directions are no longer the prototype for science experiments, and teachers are no longer the ultimate source of knowledge. Partnerships, cooperative learning, electronic communication, interdisciplinary courses, contextual learning and scientific literacy are additions to the educator's vocabulary.
<P>
To respond to needs for educational reform, Sea Grant programs are providing leadership in training teachers and producing relevant curriculum materials, and they are also participating in partnerships to reach out to a much larger audience in the education community. Two national programs now in progress exemplify the successful integration of multi- agency resources to support common education goals.
<P>
"Operation Pathfinder: Oceanography and Coastal Processes for Elementary and Middle School Teachers" is a national course in marine science education offered through a partnership that includes Sea Grant programs with other NOAA components including the Office of Coastal Resource Management, the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, and the National Environmental, Satellite and Data Information Service. The Oceanographer of the Navy and the Office of Naval Research are funding partners and provide technical resources. So that Operation Pathfinder can reach the Pacific Island area, the Department of Interior is providing funding and logistical assistance.
<P>
Operation Pathfinder is offered in six regions: Northeast Coast; Mid-Atlantic Coast; South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico; Great Lakes; West Coast; and Hawaii and Pacific Island. Within most regions, sites rotate among different Sea Grant programs.
<P>
Though the regional courses have a national format, each takes the flavor of its location. Regardless of the site, all Pathfinder teachers study six major themes: physical parameters (tides, currents, coastline processes): marine and aquatic habitats; marine and aquatic biology; marine and estuarine pollution; plate tectonics; and deep ocean technologies. Teachers are required to develop activities and units for inclusion in their home classrooms, conduct staff development sessions, and participate in a long-term evaluation effort. Participants in the three-credit graduate course are selected in regional competitions from applicants who teach predominately minority students and also meet additional course criteria.
<P>
Designed to be a five-year program, plans for Operation Pathfinder 1995 are underway for sites in Delaware, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Washington, and Wisconsin. Future plans are to reach teachers in all 50 states, provide a network to facilitate sharing, and produce classroom materials using the latest oceanographic and coastal research findings.
<P>
"The Global Change Education Workshop for Nonformal Educators" is a training program for non-classroom educators such as 4-H agents, extension agents, and Sea Grant and Space Grant educators. This three-year effort is a partnership among Sea Grant programs, Project Earthlink, and NOAA's Office of Global Programs. It began with regional planning sessions in 1993 that resulted in a national three day videoconference on global change in November 1994.
<P>
The simultaneous broadcast reached educators who gathered in Hawaii, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Each site downlinked four broadcasts during which national experts discussed their research on global change issues. While all the sites listened and watched, members from the seven audiences phoned in their questions. To take back to the classroom, each participant received the Global Change Education Resource Guide which provides background articles and activities on the major global change themes: natural climate variability, greenhouse effect, sea-level rise, ozone depiction ecosystem response, and decisionmaking under scientific uncertainty.
<P>
Currently, the global change education effort is moving from national coordination to individual state efforts. After a year of these local efforts, a second national videoconference is planned to train additional educators.
<P>
Partnerships help meet the challenge for education reform. Programs such as Operation Pathfinder and the Global Change Workshop service the education community drawing upon the rich diversity of resources from the partners. The results are economically effective, high quality opportunities that improve the quality of teaching in the United States (For details, Lundie Spence or Shirley Fiske, 301/713-2431 or <A HREF="mailto:sfiske@rdc.noaa.gov">sfiske@rdc.noaa.gov</A>)

By studying how the Eastern oyster builds its shell South Carolina Sea Grant researchers have laid the groundwork for developing new materials that could be valuable alternatives to the non-biodegradable substances now used by industry and consumers. They found that as the oyster grows its shell some oyster molecules promote crystal growth while others regulate or terminate it.
<P>
Synthetic mimics of these molecules which are based on natural amino acids have various commercial applications. For example many industries use nonbiodegradable chemicals to reduce crystal growth in pipes, heat exchanges, and boilers. The new materials not only reduce this growth but also are largely biodegradable. Another use for these materials would be as a detergent additive. The most effective detergents include dispersants which keep soil and minerals off glassware and clothes but which for the most part are nonbiodegradable. The new material when added to such detergent formulations would make them decompose naturally.
<P>
In the course of their research the investigators also discovered a class of oyster molecules with super-absorption properties. They are now trying to develop a synthetic mimic of these molecules which could lead to the replacement of non-biodegradable chemicals now used in disposable diapers adult health care products and medical and hospital supplies.

The South Carolina scientists have filed several patents for their discoveries that have been transferred from laboratories to businesses. The Donlar Corporation a venture company based in Bedford Park Illinois is currently setting up a pilot facility to develop methods for producing these new environmentally friendly materials on a large scale. Major chemical corporations have also shown an interest in the concept. In addition another start-up company Biotechtronix located in Pendleton, South Carolina, has been formed based on the special instruments that were developed for analysis used in the research.

<H2>Increasing the Margin of Safety with Seafood Canning
</CENTER>
</H2>
For over two decades home canners of seafood have been advised to use the same processing time for both raw and smoked fish. When concerns about the adequacy of this canning process surfaced, <A HREF="http://seagrant.orst.edu">Oregon Sea Grant</A> researchers were prompted to re-examine seafood home canning information. Using computerized sensors they discovered that to destroy bacteria home canneries should increase smoked fish processing time for pint jars by approximately 9 percent an additional l0 minutes.
<P>
To get the word out the researchers published their findings in a respected food safety journal. As a result the U.S. Department of Agriculture will soon include this processing information in its nationally distributed manual <I>Complete Guide to Home Canning </I>(Ag. Information Bulletin no. 539). The Sea Grant researchers also distributed nationally and internationally their own publication containing the new guidelines. In addition they helped create a 15-minute video on home canning of smoked fish. This video was broadcast during a national satellite conference to approximately 200 sites in 31 states and viewed by hundreds of volunteer food safety instructors and outreach staff.
<P>
The Oregon Sea Grant research helps not only individual consumers but also marine business. Seaport Fisheries, a Native American company in Kirkland Washington, was marketing smoked fish in pint glass jars when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, concerned about the potential for botulism, asked the small company to document its processing procedures. Oregon Sea Grant's existing guidelines backed up the fledgling company's processing methods and saved the company from a possible disaster. In an effort to expand Seaport Fisheries is currently negotiating with a large California distributor to market its smoked salmon.

<H2>Research Improves Prediction of Wave Conditions</H2>
</CENTER>
In January 1988, an unexpected storm striking California generated the largest waves ever recorded in the Southern California Bight. Damage was particularly heavy in the Redondo Beach - King Harbor area where waves crashed through a breakwater and destroyed an estimated $16 million worth of coastal structures.
<P>
This storm forced California coastal planners to revise their estimates of extreme wave conditions. To make these estimates, planners turn to computer models. Unfortunately, the Southern California Bight is a challenging region for modelling waves, because the Channel Islands partially shelter the coast from storm waves arriving from the North and South Pacific. In addition, the islands, submarine canyons, and shallow banks of the Bight create very complex wave patterns.
<P>
Although wave data had been collected at a number of locations, usually for specific needs, the complexity of conditions within the Bight made it difficult to relate such data to other locations where there are no wave instruments.
<P>
Therefore, with support from the California Department of Boating and Waterways, California Sea Grant researchers adapted two computer models to allow scientists to use an existing wave-monitoring network to estimate swell conditions at all coastal locations in Southern California, even those without instruments. This adaptation is important because instrumenting and processing data from a single site can cost tens of thousands of dollars annually.
<P>
The models developed in this project are presently being used as part of the "Orange County Storm and Tidal Wave Study." This study will provide for better planning of future coastal structures through improved prediction of coastal erosion.
<P>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the California Department of Boating and Waterways are also using the research results to plan future expansion of the Coastal Data Information Program, which maintains a network of gauges for monitoring wave conditions primarily on the West Coast and Hawaii. Daily swell predictions from this model for Southern California are now available on the World Wide Web for use by harbormasters, mariners, surfers, and others who need "quasi-real time" information (WWW location: splashuesd.edu).

<H2>New Life Given to Aging Waterfronts</H2>
</CENTER>
The South Fork and the Willapa Rivers were once the economic heart of the small town of Raymond, Washing ton. The riverbanks were lined with mills, log booms and shipyards. Much of that industry, along with the jobs it generated, has vanished. During the 1980s alone, timber related employment dropped by 40 percent. As industry declined, so did the waterfront. Riverside buildings collapsed, and the riverbanks filled with trash.
<P>
Then, two years ago, a group of Raymond's citizens began to look at the rivers in a new way, as the basis for a different kind of economic development. Thanks in part to a plan developed with the assistance of <A HREF="http://www.wsg.washington.edu/">Washington</A> and <A HREF="http://seagrant.orst.edu">Oregon</A> Sea Grant specialists and the National Coastal Resources Research and Development Institute, Raymond is reclaiming its waterfront. 
<P>
The city has obtained $1.3 million in state and federal funding to demolish abandoned buildings, construct a waterfront park, and transform an abandoned rail corridor into a foot and bike path. That path may eventually link Raymond with South Bend, located five miles down- stream, where the Willapa River empties into Willapa Bay. Raymond's new downtown park and public dock will be the permanent home of the tall ship <I>Krestine</I>, now temporarily moored at the port of Willapa Harbor.
<P>
During the same two-year period, outreach specialists at Sea Grant programs in Washington and Oregon also helped the city of Warrentown, Oregon, develop its waterfront plan. Situated at the mouth of the Columbia River, Warrentown has received a grant to develop a waterfront park on the Skipanon River near the city's center.

<H2>Test Developed to Detect Scrubbed Lobsters
</H2>
</CENTER>
A sustainable lobster fishery is vital to the socioeconomic well-being of many rural coastal communities in Maine. Therefore, laws have been passed making it illegal to harvest egg-bearing lobsters. In the past, it has been difficult for officials to enforce this law because a widely used technique for removing eggs of berried females leaves no obvious external signs. This technique--dipping berried females in chlorine bleach--is used by short-sighted individuals who then sell the non-berried females. Now, thanks to recent work by <A HREF="http://unhinfo.unh.edu:70/unh/acad/special/seagrant/index.html">Maine Sea Grant researchers</A>, enforcement officials have a simple method of detecting these scrubbed lobsters.
<P>
Using a conventional light microscope, the researchers examined the swimmerets both on untreated lobster tails and on tails treated with a chlorine bleach solution. They found that on untreated swimmerets, pairs of fine, uniformly arranged hairs extended from a central shaft (seta) creating a characteristic feather-like pattern. However, the setal hairs of swimmerets of lobsters dipped in bleach were not in the typical feather pattern. Instead, the hairs were highly disorganized and bent and some were even missing. It was also observed that differences in swimmeret hairs were not specific to chlorine bleach, but were indicators that the lobster had been exposed to a chemical irritant.
<P>
To verify these findings, the researchers, working with NOAA¹s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in Portland, conducted the same tests using a scanning electron microscope and got the same results. NMFS officials have worked with the researchers from the beginning of this project and are responsible for enforcing the law against harvesting egg-bearing lobsters. 
<P>
These findings by the Maine Sea Grant researchers are included in a manual to be published by the Lobster Institute, a research and educational organization that represents lobster interests from Newfoundland to New York. The manual, which describes how to detect lobsters that have been dipped in bleach or other irritating solutions, also includes chemical-color reaction tests developed, in part, by Woods Hole Sea Grant researchers.

<H2>Partnership Results in Successful Harvest of Scallops
</H2>
</CENTER>
For the past 20 years, the Long Island Sound has been depleted of bivalves because of pollution and excessive commercial harvesting. Last fall, aquaculture students were able to harvest scallops from the Sound that were grown using a proven aquaculture method.  This harvest was made possible by a partnership that was formed to start a demonstration bay scallop farm in the Sound. 
<P>
Partners in this project were the Bridgeport Regional Vocational Aquaculture School and an advisor from the Peoples Republic of China, a marine biologist visiting as part of the NOAA Bilateral Agreement with China. In addition, the project had support from <A HREF="http://www.ucc.uconn.edu/~wwwsgo/">Connecticut Sea Grant</A> and NOAA¹s National Marine Fisheries Service Milford Laboratory.
<P>
To launch this project, the Aquaculture School students first conditioned the parent scallops to spawn in tanks at the school. They next placed the seeds or embryonic scallops in Chinese-lantern-style mesh bags.  These bags were then tied to moorings in the Sound and suspended in the water by buoys to protect the scallops from crabs and other seafloor predators.  After tending to the bags in all types of weather, the students successfully harvested approximately 12,000 bay scallops.
<P>
To celebrate, the students invited guests to come taste their first harvest. Educators and marine experts from as far away as Shanghai attended the reception.
<P>
The Aquaculture School is a regional magnet facility designed to give students not headed for college job skills in the marine industry. In the future, the school¹s scallop farm will continue to operate and be an integral part of the curriculum.  In addition, the techniques and procedures learned during the scallop project will be adapted to other aquaculture crops that students at the school are planning to culture.

<H2>Fishermen Recycle 22 Tons of Gear
</H2>
</CENTER>
North Carolina's commercial fishermen recycled nearly 22 tons of crab pots and nets in February, attacking a solid waste disposal problem and setting a good environmental example to boot. The material was collected in nine coastal counties where, for two weeks, the crabbers, shrimpers and other watermen toted their worn-out net webbing and old crab pots to 17 locations.
<P>
Local waste haulers pitched in to collect the refuse, which was trucked to the East Carolina Vocational Center in Greenville for baling.
<P>
<A HREF="../NCSG/index.html>North Carolina Sea Grant</A> and the North Carolina Office of Waste Reduction coordinated the effort. It was funded through NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, which has also supported commercial gear recycling programs in other coastal areas. In addition, the program had support from local fishermen and the North Carolina Crabbers League of Aware Watermen.
<P>
Weighing in at 20 tons, crab pots- about 4,600 of them- accounted for the bulk of the material. All the metal pots went into a pile for meltdown and reuse by local scrap dealers.
<P>
As expected, nets made up only a fraction of the collection by weight. In the Southeast trawl fisheries, nets are usually patched and repaired rather than discarded. Only 3,500 pounds of trawl and gill net material were collected. It was baled and shipped overseas where the recycled fibers may appear in jackets, sneaker bottoms and bicycle seats.
<P>
This pilot program is just a beginning in the effort to address the problem of marine debris and solid waste from the fishing industry. It is estimated that a quarter of a million crab pots are disposed of by North Carolina crabbers annually. Many end up in landfills but some are tossed along riverbanks and into tidal creeks.

The ability to create reliable, permanent welds underwater could save industry and the military time and money in repairing ships, off-shore rigs and underwater infrastructure. Currently, large hyperbaric chambers are used to keep water from the work area during underwater welding. Operating these chambers is very expensive.
<P>
In a breakthrough in underwater wet welding technology for use in commercial applications, <A HREF="http://www-ohio.osc.edu/seagrant.html">Ohio Sea Grant</A> researchers have developed a welding electrode nicknamed "Black Beauty" for the appearance of its waterproof coating. Testing, during a project sponsored by NOAA's National Coastal Resources Research & Development Institute, documented that Black Beauty can withstand the two major hazards of underwater welding: porosity and hydrogen cracking.
<P>
To help commercialize this technological breakthrough, Ohio Sea Grant has established the Underwater Welding Center. Based at The Ohio State University, the center disseminates new underwater welding information to industrial users and provides databases, training, and research and development services.
<P>
To handle the potential national and international demand, a new company, Applied Welding Technologies, Inc., has been formed to manufacture and market the new electrode. It is predicted that a potential annual sales volume of 150,000 pieces, about 40 percent of the total domestic market, is a reasonable estimate for the market in this country alone. The related welding equipment sales could be $1.5 million annually.
<P>
However, the potential for the international market is considered to be even greater. Because of the superb performance of the new electrode during pressure vessel testing in Harbin, China, the Harbin Research Institute of Welding has expressed interest in promoting the electrode in the huge Chinese market.
<P>
Interest in the new electrode has also been shown by the U.S. Navy. It is funding the Ohio Sea Grant researchers to evaluate the electrode's applicability for wet welding repairs underwater in lieu of costly and time-consuming dry-docking. (For details, Dick Kolf, 301/7 13-2445)

<H2>Shipwreck Parks Boost Small Town Economies</H2>
</CENTER>
The cold, fresh water of the Great Lakes preserves the remnants of several thousand shipwrecks that hold clues to the maritime history of the region. Thanks to 15 years of work by Michigan Sea Grant, these shipwrecks attract thousands of recreational divers each year, as well as many archaeologists.
<P>
In the early 1970s, <A HREF="gopher://gopher.great-lakes.net:2200/11/partners/SeaGrant/Mich">Michigan Sea Grant</A> researchers showed the benefits of establishing preserves to protect these Great Lakes shipwrecks and to stimulate scuba diving and associated tourist spending in coastal communities. These findings culminated in state legislation authorizing the designation of state bottomland preserves.
<P>
As a result, Michigan Sea Grant outreach specialists helped establish nine bottomland preserves and arc working on a proposed tenth one. They then helped communities secure financial resources for important projects in the reserves such as buoying shipwrecks so they can be easily found and protected from dive boats inadvertently dropping anchor on them.
<P>
Work by Sea Grant also aided communication among he widely scattered preserve communities along Michigan's coastline and along Lakes Superior, Huron, and Erie and resulted in the formation of the Michigan Underwater Preserves Council. The Council markets diving opportunities in the preserves and encourages appropriate state policy for managing the resources.
<P>
In addition, Sea Grant-sponsored diving safety research has provided vital guidance to communities near preserves in developing management plans for dive accidents. Michigan Sea Grant diving specialists also train dive rescue personnel and emergency medical technicians.
<P>
The development of these underwater preserves has significantly boosted the economy of a wide range of businesses in Michigan's coastal communities. A recent Michigan Sea Grant study suggests that diving activity provided an economic stimulus of at least $1.5 million 'over a two-year period for the small towns near the preserves. Forty percent of these expenditures are for dive services; the other 60 percent are for other services, such as lodging and food.

The first two private companies in the world to achieve profitable abalone production are located in California, and the industry there is growing rapidly. Last year, California sales of products from abalone aquaculture hit $3 million. A large percentage of the meat was exported to Asia.
<P>
Much of this success can be attributed to California Sea Grant researchers who, in cooperation with industry, identified the major bottlenecks in abalone production:  control of spawning, control of larval metamorphosis, and acceleration of growth. The researchers first focused on learning the natural environmental triggers that control  these processes.
<P>
For example, they found that a hormone called prostaglandin is a natural trigger that induces spawning. A simple and inexpensive application of this finding was then developed, in which hydrogen peroxide is used to stimulate the animal to produce prostaglandin. This convenient and reliable method is now widely used by the industry.
<P>
The researchers then tackled problems associated with the metamorphosis of abalone larvae into their juvenile form, It was found that this process can be conveniently induced in hatcheries by using an inexpensive chemical, GABA. Currently, this method is also being used by an increasing number of California producers.
<P>
The California Sea Grant research group is now taking aim at the problem of abalone growth, which is often slow. They have discovered that growth can be significantly accelerated by adding to the water very low concentrations of hormones normally produced by the animal. Present research efforts are aimed at developing a simple method for stimulating the abalone itself to produce these growth-accelerating hormones.
<P>
The California aquaculture industry is very active in assisting this effort Producers have provided technical assistance, abalone, and stocks of feed algae. Other active collaborators are in Japan, the Netherlands, and Taiwan. (For details, <A HREF="mailto:leon.cammen@noaa.gov">Leon Cammen</A>, 301/713-2435)

<H2> Research On Harmful Algal Blooms</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
Although "red tides" and other unusual plankton blooms have occurred for centuries world-wide, algal blooms harmful to human health appear to be occurring more frequently in the coastal zone and estuaries of the United States. Spreading both regionally and globally, these blooms increase the risk of health problems for seafood consumers and coastal residents. 
<P>
When toxic blooms do appear, the need to protect human health by closing fisheries results in severe economic losses to the shellfish, aquaculture, and finfish industries. Compounding these losses are those incurred when other bloom-forming species, harmless to humans, cause fish and invertebrates to die. Food webs leading to higher levels may be altered, thus affecting the normal functioning of an entire ecosystem and reducing the yield of harvestable marine resources. 
<P>
The Sea Grant network is tackling this problem through a comprehensive, interdisciplinary research program. Investigators are looking at topics ranging from the causes of the blooms and new methods for detecting them before they affect seafood to an assessment of the total economic impact of the problem. 
<P>
Sea Grant investigators in Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Texas are trying to understand why harmful algal blooms are becoming much more common. Among the factors being considered are: changes in oceanographic conditions; alterations in nutrient inputs due to coastal development; and increases in the amount of ultraviolet radiation that the algae receive because of atmospheric ozone reduction. In addition, researchers are looking at why some algae are becoming increasingly toxic and at the effects of marine viruses as potential agents to control algal abundance. 
<P>
In California, North Carolina and Rhode Island, Sea Grant researchers are developing more rapid and sensitive methods to detect the presence of harmful algal species before they endanger seafood consumers. Methods being investigated range from those that hone in on the genetic make-up or optical properties of single cells to airplane sensors that measure light absorbance of entire plankton communities. 
<P>
Of greatest concern to the public, of course, is the potential presence of toxins in seafood. Sea Grant researchers from California, New York, and Texas are working with marine animals to see how they take up algal toxins through feeding and other means. The researchers are trying to predict how long it takes the animals to get rid of ingested toxins and become safe for human consumption. They have learned that marine animals respond very differently once the toxic algal blooms disappear; some become safe for consumption in a few days, while others may remain toxic for months. 
<P>
Although scattered estimates exist of severe economic losses from closure of fisheries due to algal toxins, the figures have never been compiled systematically for the entire U.S. coastline. Sea Grant investigators Massachusetts and Rhode Island have begun to gather estimates of the true cost of this problem to the national economy. 
<P>
Eliminating harmful algal blooms from the environment is not expected to happen soon. In fact, as the understanding of marine ecosystems increases, it may be found that these blooms play important roles in the functioning of natural ecosystems. 
<P>
In responding to this important coastal resource problem, Sea Grant has developed an innovative and comprehensive research program drawing upon not only the biological and physical sciences but also social sciences and economics. The ultimate goal is to better understand harmful algal blooms so as to reduce their impact on seafood consumers, coastal economies, and U.S. fisheries.

<H2>New Technology to Strengthen<BR>
U.S. Recreational Boat Industry</H2>
</CENTER>
In the United Stales, recreational boating is a multi- billion dollar industry. The State of Michigan, for example, with the nation's longest continental coastline Of 3,200 miles, has recreational boat registrations approaching one million. Very similar numbers are registered by California, Florida, and Texas and many other states are not far behind.
<P>
As in almost all other areas of engineering technology, the U.S. has been the leader in the design and production of the world's recreational boats, both in numbers and in quality. Consistent with recent trends, however, its leadership is being lost to international challenges. This is particularly true in the outboard engine and propulsion system market, but the threat in the market for boat hulls and hull components is imminent.
<P>
Sea Grant has invested in applying U.S. superiority in basic engineering research to secure and maintain the leadership that the nation has always enjoyed in this very important coastal industry.
<P>
The challenge of modem recreational boat design is fourfold: functionality, occupant safely, safely for people and animals in the water, and minimal environmental impact. In the past, the dominant focus of the U.S. recreational boat industry has been on functionality. Other boat design challenges have only recently been brought to the forefront and considered equally important. The design issues have clearly become complex enough to warrant a more systematic and rigorous engineering approach to recreational boats for the next generation.
<P>
Sea Grant's research effort in recreational boat engineering and design is centered at the University of Michigan. Over the past five years, Michigan Sea Grant researchers have addressed the dynamics of recreational planing boats. They have worked to extend basic hydrodynamics theories of vessel planing to more accurately predict the fluid flow, and resultant fluid pressures and forces, on general boat hull forms when planing in calm water or through waves. These fluid forces dictate boat performance, such as the power required to achieve a desired speed and the boat's motion and pounding characteristics in waves at a given speed.
<P>
In support of the Sea Grant work, Hydrodyne Ski Boat Company of Fort Wayne, Indiana, has provided a boat constructed and outfitted especially for checking and verifying the new computational methods developed by the Michigan research team. Measurements of hull surface pressure distributions and propeller shaft thrust and torque as well as observation of propeller blade cavitation (rapid formation and collapse of low-pressure water vapor bubbles around a spinning propeller) are being conducted this summer and fall.
<P>
In August, University of Michigan marine engineering students competed in the first annual Solar-Electric Boat Races held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The races were sponsored by Johnson Controls, Inc., and hosted by Marquette University. The Michigan entry, Vee-n-Verse, a unique carbon-fiber inverted-V hull form with a surface piercing propeller, was designed, engineered, and built using the new Sea Grant technology. The construction and hardware costs were supported by an array of industrial sponsors, including NUCON Marine Systems, Ford Motor Company, and Trinity Marine Group. On the boat's first time out against well-established Japanese competition, it took third place in the sprint races and was awarded the prize for technological achievement.
<P>
With new predictive engineering tools having reached a useful state of development and with the guidance and support of several key companies in the recreational boat industry, Sea Grant now plans to target its research effort in recreational boats toward specific applications of the new technology. The first application, to be conducted at the University of Michigan, is a multi-year effort to establish concepts for safer, more efficient, and ecologically-sound recreational boat propulsion, and to assist the U.S. industry with implementation from concept to practical design. Based on the long-standing leadership of the University of Michigan in the field of naval architecture, Michigan Sea Grant is quickly becoming a center of excellence for recreational boat design.

<H2>New Oil Recycling Market Developed</H2>
</CENTER>
A <A HREF="http://www.wsg.washington.edu/">Washington Sea Grant</A> demonstration project has opened a new market for the oil recycling industry. The project, which benefits both business and the environment, addresses the problem of used oil filters discarded at marinas. Without adequate disposal sites, commercial and recreational boat operators put these filters in dumpsters or leave them on the dock or in other areas where they might ultimately pollute the water. Therefore, Sea Grant brought together a marina director and the recycling industry - which already was collecting and recycling oil and oil filters from land activities - to participate in a pilot project.
<P>
The project established a used marine oil filter collection, crushing, and recycling demonstration in Everett at one of the state's largest marinas. Among the benefits realized from the project was that up to a quart of oil that normally would remain in an individual filter was reclaimed and recycled rather than allowed to enter the environment. Moreover, the entire oil filter was recycled and removed from the waste stream since both the metal and rubber were recovered after treatment at a recycling center.
<P>
This pilot project was so successful that the Port of Everett plans to continue it without Sea Grant assistance. A similar Washington Sea Grant-sponsored project was started at the Port of Seattle Fishermen's Terminal, the largest commercial fishing moorage facility in the state. Another Washington marina at Oak Harbor is working with industry to install an oil filter crusher, and the Alaska Ferry System is considering a similar effort in Bellingham.

<H2> Research on History of Fish Populations<BR>
Aids Resource Managers
</CENTER>
</H2>
Although the Pacific sardine and the northern anchovy have supported major fisheries off California during the 20th century, volatility in these stocks has made them notoriously difficult to manage. Their boom-and-bust history has been attributed, in varying degrees, to overintensive fishing, biological interactions among species, and environmental influences associated with large-scale climatic change.
<P>
A recently published study by California Sea Grant researchers provides information critical to unraveling the sources of variability in these fish stocks. By analyzing fish scale deposits found in sediments in the Santa Barbara Basin off southern California, the researchers discovered that during the past 1,700 years, sardine and anchovy populations have varied over periods lasting about 60 years. Further sediment analyses showed nine major sardine population recoveries and subsequent collapses during the 1,700-year period, with the average recovery time being 30 years.
<P>
Of particular interest is the conclusion that the timing of the collapse of the sardine population in the early 1950s was consistent with the natural population cycle, though the magnitude of the collapse may have been related to fishing pressures. The researchers also reported that the present recovery of sardines is not unlike those of the past in its rate or size. Research on the relationships between population cycles, fishing pressure, and change in ocean climate is continuing. Fisheries managers from the United States and Mexico are presently using the information to develop management strategies for the sardine fishery that will not interfere with the present recovery.

<H2>Providing Information to Better Manage Fisheries</H2>
</CENTER>
Today, most of the effort expended on understanding what controls fishery populations focuses on the effects of fishing. Most population models used in fisheries management account for natural mortality but fishing mortality is the only variable that can be accurately estimated and controlled. Thus, while management focuses almost exclusively on controlling fishing effort, the success of any management scheme is dependent on understanding factors other than fishing that influence or regulate population abundance. For example, in the past, volatility in the Pacific sardine and the northern anchovy fisheries made them difficult to manage. Recently, a California Sea Grant study provided critical information showing that, over the past 1,700 years, sardine and anchovy populations expanded and collapsed in approximately 60-year cycles. Now, U.S. and Mexico fisheries managers can develop appropriate management strategies for these fisheries.
<P>
Understanding the underlying biological and physical factors that regulate fish populations and account for natural variability is an ongoing research priority of the National Sea Grant College Program. New York Sea Grant studies on bluefish in the Middle Atlantic Bight and estuarine areas of New York show that summer-spawned fish remain in continental shelf waters until early juvenile stages. Then they are transported to the estuaries. Juveniles of spring-spawned fish are significantly larger than those of the summer spawn when they enter the estuaries. Under "typical" conditions, the larger spring-spawned fish have higher survival rates. During those years when northern transport in continental shelf waters is weak, the summer-spawned fish make up a larger portion of the year-class. Results to date suggest that both spawning populations contribute significantly to each year-class.
<P>
Great Lakes Sea Grant researchers in New York and Wisconsin are focusing on the predator/prey interactions between stocked salmonids and their food species. Studies are underway to estimate whole lake biomass of planktivorous fishes (prey species) in Lakes Ontario and Michigan. Information from these studies will be used in the development and testing of trophodynamic models designed to predict the consequences of species interactions.
<P>
Virginia Sea Grant has supported research on blue crab for more than 12 years, much of which deals with identifying the factors controlling population abundance. Early studies showed that adults spawn at estuary mouths. Larval stages are spent in surface waters over the continental shelf, and the last larval stage (megalopa) enters estuaries where it settles and metamorphoses into a juvenile. Sea Grant programs in Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi-Alabama, New York and South Carolina along with Virginia are focusing research on identifying the mechanisms that help reentry into estuaries and the factors influencing survival of juvenile crabs.
<P>
Washington Sea Grant research on Dungeness crab suggests the life cycle of this crustacean is similar to the blue crab's. Adults spawn in nearshore waters, larval stages inhabit offshore surface waters, and megalopa are transported to nearshore waters and Settle in shallow benthic environments along the coast or in estuaries. The relative importance of these nursery areas to the fishable population is undetermined. However, studies on other crustaceans such as spiny lobster by Florida Sea Grant and on American lobster by Sea Grant programs in Maine-New Hampshire and Rhode Island have shown that the availability of juvenile habitat plays a significant role in regulating population abundance of these species.
<P>
Because of Sea Grant's leadership, understanding factors that influence or decide population abundance has blossomed into one of the most dynamic areas of fisheries investigations. The NOAA Coastal Ocean Program's effort in fisheries ecosystems and the NOAA/National Science Foundation Global Ecosystem Dynamics Program (GLOBEC) can trace their roots to Sea Grant's pioneering work in this area. In fact, many researchers involved in these major ecosystem investigations began as Sea Grant researchers or students.
<P>
Sea Grant will continue to support fundamental research in this new and exciting area of fisheries research. In addition, Sea Grant will take the next step and begin to develop ecosystem-based management models and strategies. Such models will incorporate mechanisms of population control, natural- and human-induced environmental fluctuations, and multi- species interactions. Also, to provide effective mechanisms for building and rebuilding sustainable fisheries, Sea Grant will provide fisheries managers, industries, and coastal communities with information needed to understand the social, economic, and legal impacts resulting from new management strategies.

<H2>Research on Nearshore Waves</H2>
</CENTER>
During severe storms and hurricanes, waves are responsible for millions of dollars worth of property damage every year and sometimes take their toll in human lives. By moving sediment along the shore or in onshore/offshore directions, waves can also cause damage by creating new erosion patterns which alter the shoreline's natural features, and affect coastal and offshore structure. Because of this, nearshore and shallow water waves--those occurring in depths of about 10 meters or less--are extremely important considerations when coastal structures are designed. Predicting the impacts of waves becomes even more important as population, coastal development, and water levels increase along U.S. shores. Current Sea Grant research into nearshore waves is framed by a number of complicated factors including complex underwater topography, offshore islands, wave/ sediment interaction, and shallow and confined bodies of water. 
<P>
Two areas where wave conditions are extremely difficult to forecast are the Gulf of Maine and the Southern California Bight. In these areas, complex underwater topography and irregular shorelines combine with islands and offshore banks to create complicated interactions of shoaling, refraction, and diffraction. These interactions cause nearshore wave conditions to vary greatly even in short distances along the coast. Maine-New Hampshire and California Sea Grant researchers are addressing problems of predicting wave conditions in these difficult nearshore locations. Their findings will aid coastal planners in efforts to limit wave-induced damage to shoreline structures from severe storms and erosion of beaches. 
<P>
Discovering the interactions of shallow water waves with sediments on the bottom is another complex problem for researchers to solve. Waves generate currents that move the sediment, which in turn modifies the waves passing over it. This feedback mechanism causes a "Catch 22" situation for researchers struggling to understand and quantify the phenomenon. MIT Sea Grant has supported a two-pronged approach to solve this dilemma by using both carefully designed laboratory studies and advanced theoretical work. This approach has yielded the most advanced theories on the energy losses of waves propagating over sand beds and on the resulting sand movement and bed modification. 
<P>
At tidal inlets, wave conditions are important because of their influence on movement of sediments along the shore. The U.S. ocean coastline is dominated by sandy barrier islands separated by tidal inlets. Waves, currents, and sediment interact in unusually complex manners at inlets and affect the coastline for great distances. To design effective strategies to protect harbors and beaches from erosion, Delaware Sea Grant researchers are currently conducting theoretical research on this problem and soon will be initiating related laboratory work. Their efforts will complement theoretical and laboratory studies of tidal inlets being conducted at the South Carolina and Florida Sea Grant programs. 
<P>
Wave generation and propagation in shallow and confined bodies of water are particularly hard to predict. As part of a general effort to predict the physical status of the Great Lakes under the Great Lakes Forecasting System, Ohio Sea Grant is supporting wave prediction research. Maryland Sea Grant is initiating advanced research on wave prediction for Chesapeake Bay. In addition, Florida Sea Grant is developing an inexpensive PC-based wave forecasting system for the state's coastal waters. These efforts have general aspects which will be useful to other coastal areas of the country. 
<P>
Along parts of the Pacific Northwest coast, wave conditions can be so severe that typical seabed pressure wave gauges are damaged or destroyed during the very storm events that they should be documenting. Oregon Sea Grant researchers are avoiding this problem by measuring waves off the Newport coast with a microseismometer installed at The Hatfield Marine Center a mile-and-a-half from the coast. This unique method of measuring waves has proved to be quite effective in documenting their intensity during severe winter storms. 
<P>
Discovering the physical processes governing waves will ultimately enhance the ability to protect both life and property from their impacts. Results from Sea Grant's wave research will be used by coastal planners, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Army Corps of Engineers to lessen the damage caused by waves through erosion or during storms.

Effective Coastal Management Developed Through Research
</H2>
</CENTER>

Effective coastal management depends on laws, policies, and institutions that work. Sea Grant specialists evaluate these management tools, examine how to make better decisions, and propose new ways to tackle coastal problems.
<P>
Several states, including North Carolina, have moved to strengthen legal management of their ocean resources. To support this legal effort, scholars from North Carolina Sea Grant evaluated laws that govern the area from mean high tide to the limit of the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone. Their review included state and federal laws and jurisdictional issues that affect activities such as seafloor mining, oil and gas development, fisheries management, and pollution discharge. Based on this review, the report submitted to the state¹s Ocean Resources Task Force made specific recommendations for action where the current management regime is unclear or deficient. 
<P>
In Hawaii, the lack of coordination among government agencies hindered ocean resources management. To explore possible solutions, policy analysts from Hawaii Sea Grant studied Australia¹s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. They determined that the Authority offered a useful model. For a Hawaii version to work, however, an Authority would have to be established by law and given responsibility for managing the living and non-living resources as a single ecological unit within the exclusive economic zone of the Hawaiian archipelago.
<P>
Estuaries, like archipelagoes, present daunting management challenges. Specialists in public policy, planning, and administration from Rhode Island Sea Grant analyzed the evolution of the 16-year effort to understand and manage the Chesapeake Bay resources. Their intent was to determine the extent to which learning, adaptation, and flexibility (adaptive management) were features of the governance system.  The specialists found that, as new information became available, both Bay research programs and institutional arrangements changed significantly. This flexible, adaptive approach made it possible for the management program to evolve from a rather simple one to today¹s complex program. This capacity to learn and adapt has resulted in a sophisticated set of baywide indicators of ecosystem health and of institutions that coordinate federal, state, and local management. The Chesapeake experience suggests that managers can address estuarine restoration and protection most effectively through an adaptive process, one that is exploratory, evolutionary, and based on close ties between science and management.
<P>
Ocean governance at the national level is no less complex. Although the United States has an extensive body of ocean law and policy in place, it has yet to develop a national ocean governance strategy to achieve sustainable development of the nation¹s marine resources. Because these laws focus on individual resources, they are typically unable to address interrelationships and conflicts. Political scientists from Delaware Sea Grant are addressing the challenge of ocean governance in the United States. Based on an analysis of these laws and policies, they have defined the necessary features of a National Ocean Governance Strategy. These features would include a long-term vision, a stewardship ethic, and specific goals for sustainable development. In addition, the scientists have spelled out the analytical studies required to implement such a strategy and suggested several possible approaches to getting the process started.
<P>
Public participation can play an important role in coastal management decisions. Researchers from the New York Sea Grant Institute assessed the importance of local context in a community-based water resources program aimed at the cleanup of the 42 most polluted locations on the Great Lakes Basin. Survey data enabled the researchers to pinpoint conditions that significantly affect the design and conduct of public involvement programs. Among these conditions are level of community awareness, state of the local economy, and strength of local leadership.
<P>
Rigorous evaluation is critical for ensuring the effectiveness of coastal management. An interdisciplinary team from Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington Sea Grant programs has begun the first comprehensive assessment of the national Coastal Zone Management Program in its 24-year history. The project, conducted with support from NOAA¹s Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, will evaluate the effectiveness of the 29 federally-approved state and territory  CZM programs. The project focuses on the extent to which these programs have addressed the core objectives of the 1972 Coastal Zone Management Act, specifically, protection of natural resources, provision of public access to the coast, assistance in the development of coastal dependent uses, and simplification of procedures for coastal management decision-making.

<CENTER>Changing Demographics and Marine Science Education<H2>
</H2>
</CENTER>
In the future, decisions affecting U.S. coastal resources will be in different demographic hands. According to census projections, minority groups will make up nearly 50 percent of the population by 2050. However, these groups are traditionally underrepresented in the marine sciences and in resource management.
<P>
To change this trend, Sea Grant programs nationwide are providing minorities help at all levels of the educational pipeline. They are developing marine science projects that directly involve middle and secondary students, train teachers, and create educational materials. To bring under- graduate and graduate students into the enterprise of science, Sea Grant is providing support for scholarships, research assistantships, and fellowships.
<P>
Minnesota Sea Grant has developed a summer institute focused on training teachers how to make marine science more relevant to Native American middle and high school students. Teachers will be trained to teach the environmental history of the Lake Superior region in a cultural context. The goal of this project is to increase the number of Native American students pursuing elective science and environmental courses. For undergraduates, Minnesota Sea Grant has developed the American Indians in Marine Science (AIMS) project. It provides a 3-year, university research- based program with financial, academic, and mentoring support for students. Three reservations in Minnesota have comprehensive natural resource management agencies. Two of these agencies are now headed by AIMS graduates.
<P>
In other work with Native Americans, Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant directly involves students of the Poarch Creek Band Reservation in camps which, in response to tribal requests, focus on environmental education. So far, 120 elementary to high school students have participated in these camps.
<P>
To reach inner-city students, Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant is cooperating with Mobile County Public Schools as part of the system's inner-city education enhancement plan. Sea Grant is providing in-service teacher training to incorporate marine sciences into the system's fourth-grade curriculum. The consortium is also providing African- American middle school students an opportunity to attend a sea camp in Mississippi as part of an enrichment program.
<P>
In Texas, the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) has a large and rapidly increasing population of Hispanic students and teachers. To enhance these teachers' skills to teach marine sciences, Texas Sea Grant is offering three different workshops. One will cover barrier island ecology, another features interdisciplinary classroom activities using marine resources, and a third utilizes an atmospheric curriculum. About 90 teachers will participate in the workshops overall.
<P>
Working with the state's education department, Hawaii Sea Grant is contributing to an interactive TV curriculum for use throughout all island schools. Intended for at-risk youth in fourth and fifth grades, the curriculum will be based on Hawaiian culture, and a television series will be developed as a component of the state's distance learning program. University scientists will serve as living textbooks and role models for participants.
<P>
Puerto Rico Sea Grant, working with the Commonwealth's education department, has significantly increased the level of marine science activities throughout the island's high schools. This has been accomplished through a dovetailed effort of extensive teacher training, and the development and introduction of marine curricular activities such as guided educational field trips for students and teachers.
<P>
At the national level, NOAA Sea Grant has developed an initiative to offer regional workshops through six Sea Grant programs-Hawaii, Mississippi-Alabama, New Jersey, New York, Southern California, and Wisconsin. An estimated 120 elementary and middle school minority teachers or teachers who instruct predominately minority students will attend the summer 1994 regional workshops where they will be taught new techniques to teach marine sciences. The workshops will be supported by the Oceanographer of the Navy, the Office of Naval Research, and the Naval Oceanography Command; the Department of Interior, and NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service and its Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.
<P>
Sea Grant alone cannot change the demographics of marine science education. In all cases, Sea Grant educators will continue to work with state education departments and national and state teacher associations, and will continue to leverage Sea Grant dollars with funds from other sources.

<H2>Sea Grant and Partners Will Provide<BR>
Training to Assure Safe Seafood Products</H2>
</CENTER>
Proposed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations will require workers to be trained in proper handling of seafood. In addition, to ensure product safety, seafood processing plants will be required to have an approved plan for monitoring their production lines by hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) procedures. These procedures will consist of four steps: identifying hazards that can potentially affect a product; identifying critical points in processing where failure could create a hazard; establishing a plan to systematically monitor processing and keep records of such monitoring; and taking and documenting corrective actions.
<P>
The new regulations, which will apply to approximately 5,000 U. S. seafood plants and factory ships as well as to foreign processors, are supposed to take effect in 1996. Expected to eliminate most causes of microbial contamination in seafood, the regulations will allow the seafood industry to police its own quality control at crucial stages of production. However, implementing the regulations will require that tens of thousands of seafood workers, inspectors, and regulators become familiar with HACCP procedures for a variety of fishery species and associated products.
<P>
To aid the seafood industry in complying with the FDA regulations, the National Sea Grant College Program spearheaded the formation of an alliance of industry, government regulators, and the nation's Sea Grant universities. Called the "Seafood HACCP Alliance," it will initiate an educational program in seafood safety procedures.
<P>
The alliance includes the Sea Grant network, the FDA, the Association of Food and Drug Officials, and the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference. Other partners in the alliance are NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the National Fisheries Institute, and the National Food Processors Association.
<P>
This alliance will bring regulars and industry together to increase the safety and quality of processed seafood and to restore consumer confidence in the nation's seafood. It will focus on training and education and will use educational programs designed to complement voluntary quality control measures already in place at many U.S. seafood plants. Alaska, California, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina and Virginia Sea Grant programs will play lead roles in this educational effort.
<P>

<P>
  Goals of the alliance include:
<P>
  Developing and implementing a HACCP   training curriculum for seafood workers,   inspectors, and instructors.
<P>
  Designing a method to evaluate and certify   training.
<P>
  Training a cadre of "Seafood HACCP   Instructors" and establishing criteria for   acceptable content of training programs and   for instructor qualifications.
<P>
  Preparing and distributing educational   materials that promote proper seafood   handling.
<P>
  Developing a compendium of safe seafood   processing methods.
<P>
  Exploring use of pilot-testing to introduce   HACCP procedures.
<P>
  Helping design monitoring plans.
<P>
The foundation of the Seafood HACCP Alliance is built in significant part on state regulatory programs and related activities in the Sea Grant and Cooperative Extension Service networks around the nation. In the future, Sea Grant anticipates the alliance will become a self-sustaining program (For details, David Attaway, 301/713-2451 or <A HREF="mailto:dattaway@rdc.noaa.gov">dattaway@rdc.noaa.gov</A>)

<H2>Sewage Outfall Studies Save Taxpayers Money</H2>
</CENTER>
Ocean sewage outfalls are major sources of contaminants to coastal ocean ecosystems. Although this method of disposal has advantages in terms of economy and relative societal impact, it raises important concerns about seafood safety, public health, and ecosystem health and preservation.
<P>
The ocean offers relatively rapid dilution of many harmful substances, but it can also carry particulates bearing trace metals, bacteria, viruses, DDT and other harmful substances. To discover the potential impacts of these substances on urban populations and coastal ocean ecosystems, the University of Southern California (USC) Sea Grant Program sponsored studies of the White's Point sewage outfall. It is the largest outfall in the U.S., discharging an average of 330 million gallons per day onto the Palos Verdes shelf adjacent to Santa Monica Bay. 
<P>
These studies have produced a wealth of information about the behavior of effluents in the marine environment. Such information increases the ability of sanitation authorities to develop environmentally sound policies for managing urban waste. 
<P>
For example, the White's Point research aided modeling efforts at the Orange County Sanitation District sewage outfall, which enabled managers to assess the effect of sewage effluents on nearby coastal ecosystems. As a result, Orange County water officials give credit to USC Sea Grant for providing the effluent information that has helped them receive secondary treatment waivers under EPA's stringent water quality requirements. Thus, over a 30-year period, taxpayers are saving as much as $50 million a year that would have been spent on additional treatment facilities.
<P>
As demonstrated by Orange County sanitation authorities, USC Sea Grant research at the White Point's outfall has greatly improved the information base from which to make decisions about treating wastewater in Southern California. In addition, lessons learned here can be applied to other large sewage treatment plants around the nation. (For details, <A HREF="mailto:john.ahrens@noaa.gov">John Ahrens</A>, 301/713-2435)

<H2>Christmas Trees Help Protect Vital Dunes</H2>
</CENTER>
What can be done with that old Christmas tree after the holiday season?  Several years ago, a Texas Sea Grant advisory agent in Brazoria County and a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent collaborated on an idea to prevent erosion of the county's shoreline by recycling those trees.
<P>
Begun as a demonstration project, Dunes Day has evolved into a special event in which volunteers stake down Christmas trees to help in the development of dunes. By trapping wind-blown sand, the trees help establish a strong frontal dune line to protect the shoreline from erosion and high tides. In addition, during storms such as hurricanes, the dunes protect the hinterland where there are more valuable properties such as homes, industries, and businesses. 
<P>
Texas Sea Grant was one of the many sponsors of this year's annual event, which took place in January. It drew more than 300 volunteers who staked down an estimated 14,000 trees. 
<P>
However, the tons of sand trapped and miles of dunes constructed are not the only testimony to the volunteers' victories over erosion and subsidence. The volunteers also mentor local school groups and science clubs. This training done in the classroom is followed by hands-on experiences. One result is that people who have built the dunes are not inclined to trash them. The project also keeps discarded trees from landfills, saving space for future needs, and the new dunes provide a home to many plants and animals.

<H2>Device Improves Oyster Growth Rate and Quality</H2>
</CENTER>
To address the problem of smaller oyster harvests along the East Coast, a <A HREF="/NCSG/">North Carolina Sea Grant</A> researcher has developed a system that uses floating bags called chubs. The tubular mesh bags each have floats to keep them suspended in the water and contain about three dozen seed oysters. The chubs protect the oysters from predators and lift the shellfish off the muddy estuary bottom into the top of the water column where currents are stronger and there is more oxygen and food. Thus the oysters grow more rapidly with less opportunity for succumbing to diseases.
<P>
Compared to oysters grown in the wild, the chub-produced oysters reach market size in half the time (12 to 18 months) with proportionately less shell and more meat. The new system, which simplifies the maintenance and harvest of oysters, has the potential to move shellfishing away from labor-intensive operations toward more efficient agribusiness. Further tests are needed to determine whether the chub growout system is practical on a large-scale commercial basis.

<H2>Disease-Causing Parasite Cultured in Scientific Breakthrough</H2>
</CENTER>
Dermo (<I>Perkinsus marinus</I>) has been causing mass mortalities of the Chesapeake Bay oyster since the mid-1980s. Now, a <A HREF="/MDSG/">Maryland Sea Grant</A> researcher has developed a method for culturing that protozoan parasite in the laboratory. The laboratory breakthrough is the critical first step in finding a cure for the disease caused by the parasite. The next step is to learn the strategies the parasite has evolved to avoid the oyster's natural defense mechanisms and how it causes the disease that kills the oyster.
<P>
The Chesapeake Bay once supplied more than half the oysters eaten in this country, but the bay harvest now only accounts for approximately 10 percent. This dramatic decline of bay oysters and its commercial fishery is coupled with the increasing recognition that the loss of oysters could help account for deteriorating water quality. Scientists have estimated that the bivalves, which filter-feed on algae clouding the bay, once filtered the volume of the bay every week.

<H2>Noisemakers Keep Porpoises From Drowning in Nets</H2>
</CENTER>
To solve the growing problem of harbor porpoises drowning after becoming entangled in gillnets, a <A HREF=" http://unhinfo.unh.edu:70/unh/acad/special/seagrant/index.html">New Hampshire Sea Grant</A> outreach specialist has been testing an adaptation of a device which has proven successful in keeping whales away from fishing gear. The device has small spherical metal balls with battery-operated noisemakers inside that make the fishing gear more "visible" to marine mammals.
<P>
The specialist, using statistically designed experiments with both control and "acoustically armed" nets, outfitted four gillnetters with the device to test it with harbor porpoises. <A HREF="http://kingfish.ssp.nmfs.gov:80/home-page.html">NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service</A> cooperated in the research by providing 60 days of observer coverage.
<P>
The acoustically armed nets did not have a single incidence of porpoise entanglement while the control nets had 10. To validate the initial findings, a larger more statistically significant project will be carried out later this year. In the meantime, Rhode Island Sea Grant is planning to modify the noisemaking device for use by the swordfish driftnet fishery to avoid marine mammal entanglement problems.

<H2>Navigational Safety Improved
</H2>
</CENTER>
<A HREF="http://unhinfo.unh.edu:70/unh/acad/special/seagrant/index.html">New Hampshire Sea Grant</A> researchers have designed a device which not only will improve navigational safety but also should save taxpayers millions of dollars. The device, a collision tolerant pile structure (CTPS), will be used to support the markers or lights known as aids to navigation (ATONs). The ATONs are used in shallow waterways to mark safe passage routes for all types of marine craft.
<P>
The rigid wood pile structures now used by the U.S. Coast Guard to support ATONs are easily damaged when struck by commercial vessels. These collisions can sometimes destroy the wood structure as well as the ATON, leaving the channel unmarked and the pile position unknown; damage can also result to the vessel. This situation poses a safety hazard as well as an environmental hazard since many cargoes contain petroleum products that could be spilled.
<P>
Hundreds of these structures are lost annually, and the replacement cost of each is $5,000 to $10,000. By replacing the wood piles with the new CTPS, costs can be tremendously reduced and navigation safety greatly enhanced.
<P>
The CTPS designed by New Hampshire Sea Grant consists of an ATON mounted on a single pile which has a foam core. It is hinged just above the mudline and contains compression springs that return it to an upright position after a collision.
<P>
To test the device, three prototypes were designed by Sea Grant researchers and built for the U.S. Coast Guard. The CTPS had to be able to survive five collisions a year to fully meet the design goals set by the Coast Guard. Two were deployed in the Houston Ship Channel in 1990 and have withstood repeated collisions-m ore than 20 each-and are still operating as designed. A third was installed off the New Hampshire coast to check responses to severe environmental forces. It too has operated as anticipated.
<P>
The results have so pleased the Coast Guard that it has ordered 30 more CTPS to be built at a cost of about $20,000 each. They will be deployed in critical navigation areas around the country. (For details, <A HREF="mailto:shirleyfiske@noaa.gov">Shirley Fiske</A>, 301/7132431)

<H2>Shrimp Growers Better Able to Compete in World Markets
</CENTER>
</H2>
Because of high labor costs, U.S. shrimp growers have turned to capital intensive, highly automated aquaculture systems to complete in world markets. Now, thanks to Arizona researchers supported by <A HREF="../index.html">NOAA Sea Grant</A>, growers will be able to use a simple, diagnostic gene probe in kit form to screen aquacultured shrimp for infectious hypodermal hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV).
<P>
IHHNV causes runt deformity syndrome in while shrimp, the major species grown in the U.S. It is linked to significantly lower shrimp growth and harvest rates which translate into lower market values and reduced profits for growers.
<P>
While working on characterization of IHHNV, the researchers found a method to clone its genome, an event which marked the first such accomplishment for a marine invertebrate virus. This step led to the development of gene probes for IHHNV.
<P>
After issuing a patent disclosure for the diagnostic probe, the researchers worked with DiagXotics Inc., a company in Wilton, Connecticut, which specializes in manufacturing test kits for aquaculture applications. The collaboration resulted in a simple, ready-to-use kit which gives results within 12 to 24 hours. Growers can use it to analyze tissue samples from shrimp of unknown health to test if IHHNV is present or to assess the prevalence of IHHNV infection by testing a selected number of individuals from a shrimp population. Test results can be used to develop management strategies such as using a different hatchery supplier for the next crop to avoid further contamination. In addition, the kit can be used as a means to certify the health status of postlarvae or juveniles headed for grow-out facilities, or as a nonlelthal method for certification of broodstock. 
<P>
Besides the IHHNV gene probe, three other probes are under development by Arizona researchers and DiagXotics for use with three different shrimp viruses. These probes will provide essential tools to the U.S. shrimp aquaculture industry so that it is not as prone to the catastrophic disease losses that have recently affected shrimp aquaculture interests overseas.

<H2>Remote Sensing for Science, Commerce, and Public Safety</H2>
</CENTER>
The ability to monitor the Earth's environment via satellites increases understanding of environmental processes and contributes to both economic efficiency and public safety. With rapid development of remote sensing technology, scientists and managers can now obtain data on spatial and time scales previously impossible or unaffordable. Sea Grant, in cooperation with other NOAA elements, actively supports the technological development of new capabilities in remote sensing applications for the ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes environments.
<P>
One of the first applications of satellite sensing has been to measure radiances from the sea surface at wave lengths representative of phytoplankton-like pigments. These radiances, converted to bio-optical parameters such as ocean color and plant pigment concentrations, are widely used in global change studies, by fisheries managers, and by commercial fisheries to optimize catch. However, the water-leaving radiances are a small portion of the total signal received by the satellite and, before valid data can be obtained, corrections must be made for atmospheric interferences.
<P>
Utilizing imagery from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), California Sea Grant scientists are developing new procedures for handling the atmospheric radiance terms. This will result in more accurate estimates of pigment concentrations from the CZCS and, thus, of ocean productivity and color. In addition, the pigment extraction algorithms developed will be applicable to the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWIFS), the ocean color sensor to be launched in 1994.
<P>
Data on bay-wide productivity will be essential to evaluating the success of the nutrient reduction program in Chesapeake Bay. To meet this need, the new SeaWIFS satellite will provide synoptic data through time. Since coastal and estuarine waters are much more turbid than ocean waters, special algorithms are needed to convert radiances into pigment concentrations. Maryland Sea Grant researchers, working closely with the NASA SeaWIFS Office, are developing the algorithms necessary to measure bay productivity over time.
<P>
The COASTWATCH program, developed by NOAA's Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service with support from NOAA's Coastal Ocean Program (COP), makes Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) weather satellite images available in near-real-time to the marine community. Ohio Sea Grant and NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL), with COP support, have developed the Lake Erie Forecast System (LEFS) as a pilot for a Great Lakes Forecast System. Using NOAA models run on the Ohio State supercomputer, the LEFS utilizes lake-surface temperature derived from the AVHRR provided by the COASTWATCH center at GLERL, along with data from NOAA's Weather Service and the U.S. Geological Survey. Forecasts include three-dimensional currents and temperature distributions, water levels, and wave heights. To improve LEFS forecasts, current Ohio Sea Grant research is focused on developing improved predictive functions for surface heat flux from AVHRR data.
<P>
Readily available COASTWATCH near-real-time AVHRR images are spurring new applications research. Woods Hole Sea Grant researchers have found that sea-surface temperatures (SST) derived from these images help to study bloom dynamics of the dinoflagellate causing outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in the Gulf of Maine. A warm coastal current, believed to carry the dinoflagellate to the south, was easily resolved by SST imagery, demonstrating its great promise to provide early warning of conditions conducive for bloom development and movement.
<P>
In addition, Wisconsin Sea Grant scientists have combined SST COASTWATCH data for Green Bay with bathymetric and substrate data from the National Geophysical Data Center to identify bay areas at high risk for zebra mussel colonization. This information, combined with census data identifying areas where colonization would have a major impact, enables industry and governments to direct resources to the most critical locations.
<P>
Michigan Sea Grant scientists are using COASTWATCH images to develop black-and-white temperature contour maps of Lake Michigan. Intended to help recreational fishermen locate fish, the maps can be faxed to ports and marinas. A demonstration project is currently underway and, if successful, this technology will be transferred to the private sector.
<P>
Currently, the U.S. fishing fleet uses antiquated remote sensing technology that significantly diminishes AVHRR imagery information. In contrast, some foreign fishery fleets and managers are moving to a high resolution picture transmission system coupled with a geographic information system (GIS). California Sea Grant scientists are developing software for a remote sensing/GIS system that would integrate remotely sensed data, environmental observations, bathymetry, fish catch statistics, and weather conditions into a real-time information resource tool to be used by both fishermen and stock assessment managers. Working closely with NOAA's Marine Fisheries Service and the West Coast commercial and sports fisheries, fishing and stock assessment management groups will be field testing the system this year.

<H2>Exploring the Oceans with Unmanned Vehicles</H2>
</CENTER>
Exploring the oceans has depended on sampling from surface vessels or on using manned submersible vehicles. In both cases, the process is slow, and the coverage in time and space is necessarily very limited. Operation of both manned submersibles and sophisticated unmanned tethered submersibles called remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) requires very costly support from large surface vessels. The hazards, the unknowns, and the expense of exploring for research and for resources increase dramatically with depth. Therefore, the deep oceans remain a mysterious and a largely unexplored frontier. Scientists are quick to point out that more is known about the surfaces of other planets than about the ocean depths on Earth.
<P>
In recent years, it has become clear that special purpose, unmanned submersible vehicles can augment or replace manned submersibles. Indeed, the ROV is already considered "state of the art" for many survey, inspection, and simple work tasks. The ROV, however, suffers from serious limitations due to the "tether" that connects it to a surface ship for power and communication purposes. The tether is easily entangled on obstacles, and produces serious hydrodynamic drag on the vehicle when it is operating at greater depths. Clearly, the goal of providing an affordable means for exploring unmapped environments otherwise unreachable by humans can only be met by a truly free-swimming or Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).
<P>
AUV research by Sea Grant has been concentrated at the Florida, Hawaii, MIT, New Hampshire, Texas, and Washington programs. Cooperation and joint sponsorship of various projects have been received from NOAA's National Undersea Research Program, the Office of Naval Research (ONR), National Science Foundation, Advanced Research Projects Agency, Naval Surface Weapons Center, Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Center, and also from many industrial supporters. Work to date has largely been directed at the key technical issues such as navigation and control systems, optical and other sensors, power systems, and communication among vehicles and with surface ships.
<P>
Recent research successes have created the prototype of a new class of AUV capable of vastly increasing human presence in the ocean. Although there are still major engineering issues to be addressed, technology has progressed to the point where small, long-range AUVs can economically execute missions that are impossible to perform with tethered vehicles (such as in under-ice operations) or are expensive with conventional methods (such as in deep ocean surveys).
<P>
Sea Grant AUV research is now focused at MIT. The MIT prototype vehicle, Odyssey 11, was built from components costing less than $75,000. It weighs 360 pounds, can travel 170 miles at depths up to 3.7 miles, and is the first deep diving AUV to carry a sonar system and two acoustic navigation systems.
<P>
During March 1994, Odyssey 11 undertook its first major scientific mission. With ONR support, the vehicle was launched from a hole cut through five-foot thick ice at a camp approximately 170 miles offshore of Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's northern coast. It made several runs beneath the ice, conducting preliminary tests of under-ice mapping and obtaining data on conductivity, temperature, and depth before piloting itself back into a capture net at its point of entry.
<P>
In upcoming missions, plans call for Odyssey 11 to study hydrothermal vent systems on the Juan de Fuca Ridge off the Washington coast in August and on the East Pacific Rise west of Central America in October. The ultimate goal of Sea Grant's work on AUVs is to develop a network in which many low-cost AUVs operating interactively from remote sites will collect oceanographic data over greater areas and for longer periods. This scope of scientific data collection has not been possible before. It should open a new era in understanding the oceans and their resources.

<H2>Helping Coastal Businesses Deal with Change</H2>
</CENTER>
Businesses in coastal regions are experiencing rapid changes in their business environment. For example, enterprises engaged in the seafood industry, coastal tourism and recreation, and marine trades face greater burdens than in the past because of factors such as scarce natural resources, environmental and public safety regulations, waterfront displacement, and increased competition.
<P>
To grow and sustain themselves, these businesses must be able to respond quickly to changing markets, adjust to changes in regulatory requirements, adapt new technology or processes as they become available, and evaluate economic options. Assisting both small and large coastal businesses is a major, ongoing challenge for the Sea Grant network. Through scores of daily contacts, Sea Grant helps coastal businesses deal with change.
<P>
Because New England groundfish stocks are at an all-time low, New Hampshire Sea Grant is working to develop a sustainable East Coast hagfish fishery. Collaborating with Washington Sea Grant, which had experience working with Pacific hagfish, and with additional support from the New England Fisheries Development Association and NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, Sea Grant outreach specialists are teaching New England fishermen the best methods to harvest hagfish. The hagfish are then sold to South Korean markets where they are processed and their skin is used to produce leather goods. Currently 10 vessels from Gloucester, Massachusetts, north to Stonington, Maine, are fishing for hagfish, providing income opportunities to some of New England's beleaguered groundfishermen. First-year landings are anticipated to be valued at $600,000.
<P>
Aquaculture is a highly competitive, dynamic industry subject to a great deal of risk and uncertainty. Remaining a viable producer requires a firm grasp of biological and production techniques as well as the ability to use financial information to make business decisions. To help potential investors assess the current financial status of an aquaculture business, Sea Grant business specialists nationwide have adapted fundamental tools for financial decisionmaking. One of these tools is Maryland Sea Grant's computer-based aquaculture financial simulator (AQUASIM). It is designed to evaluate the inherent risks associated with aquaculture businesses such as fluctuating market prices and uncertainty about fish survival during production. Since every aquaculture operator has different views about the performance of his enterprise, AQUASIM, using a semblance of artificial intelligence, helps quantify the expectations of production performance and is adaptable to almost any species being cultured. Distributed nationally, AQUASIM has been used to assess nearly 50 planned or existing culture operations in Maryland alone.
<P>
Coastal tourism development is very important to the economic base of coastal communities. Therefore, Ohio Sea Grant, with support from the National Coastal Resources Research and Development Institute, conducted Tourism Business Retention and Expansion Programs in counties bordering Ohio's Lake Erie Coast. The core component of these programs is a set of visits to tourism businesses to obtain information about their business issues. Visitors are also surveyed to obtain information about their activities and expenditures. This information is then used to help communities develop marketing strategies for their recreational amenities and to help local economic development programs assist tourism businesses more effectively.
<P>
In the future, Sea Grant will continue to provide outreach services critical in helping businesses operate efficiently and increase productivity, adapt new technologies and processes, and train a workforce that will produce quality goods and services in return for good wages.

<H2>Green Bay Study Offers National Model
</H2>
</CENTER>
The Green Bay PCB Mass Balance Study is the first complete input-output study ever conducted on what happens to a toxic chemical in an aquatic ecosystem. Because of this landmark national study, resource managers now have a much-needed mass balance model for assessing the sources, movements, and ultimate fates of toxic industrial and agricultural chemicals in U.S. waters.
<P>
This five-year study was funded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) because of national concern about persistent toxic chemicals in the environment. The deciding factor in the EPA's choice of Green Bay as the site for this unprecedented national study was the wealth of available expertise and scientific data on Great Lakes contaminants developed by <A HREF="http://h2o.seagrant.wisc.edu/home.html">Wisconsin Sea Grant</A>-sponsored research over the past 25 years.
<P>
Though focused specifically on polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, this model will also help decisionmakers identify the most cost-effective strategies for cleaning up lead, dieldrin, cadmium and similar toxic chemicals in the Great Lakes and coastal estuaries. Covering 1,640 square miles, Green Bay is the largest freshwater estuary in the world. In size and other physical characteristics, it is similar to the Delaware Bay estuary.
<P>
Launched in 1988, the Green Bay Mass Balance Study involved researchers from a dozen universities nationwide, six federal agencies, and the Wisconsin and Michigan departments of natural resources. Wisconsin Sea Grant scientists and former Sea Grant-supported students were among the study's Lead investigators.
<P>
The study showed that- except for cleaning up one highly contaminated stretch of the river- the most effective strategy for eliminating PCBs from Green Bay over the next 25 years was simply to let them become buried in bottom sediments.
<P>
Thanks in large part to the long-term Sea Grant investment in PCB and Green Bay research, Wisconsin will save hundreds of millions of dollars cleaning up the bay. In addition, the nation has a highly successful model for developing rational and cost-effective strategies for cleaning up its contaminated estuaries and bays, which ultimately may save the U.S. billions of dollars.

<H2>Crab Meat Recovery Increases Industry Yields
</H2>
</CENTER>
Since steam-processed blue crabs yield only about 10 percent meat by weight when hand-picked, the blue crab industry generates about 180 million pounds of waste each year. In Georgia, the picking room scrap was either discarded in landfills or processed into low-value crab meal. For help in recovering meat from crab picking wastes, two of the state's largest processors contacted Georgia Sea Grant researchers.
<P>
This led to a three-year <A HREF="http://alpha.marsci.uga.edu/gaseagrant.html">Georgia Sea Grant</A> project during which annual minced meat recovery by the two processors increased from 20,000 pounds to more than 400,000 pounds. As a result, waste disposal costs lowered and profits increased from the sale of the recovered meat for human consumption as an extender in deviled crab, seafood stuffings, soups, and chowders and for pct food. Minced meat sales made the difference between net profit and net loss for one of the processors.
<P>
To achieve these results, Sea Grant researchers first conducted studies to evaluate the characteristics of byproducts separated into four groups-minced white meat, minced leg meat, minced claw meat, and mixed minced meal. Chemical, sensory, microbiological, and nutritional qualities were then determined for these meats.
<P>
Next, the seafood technologists developed processing recommendations for minced meat products. For example, they found that low temperature pasteurization reduced discoloration. In addition, they found that lactic acid dips or mild steaming of picking-room byproducts reduced bacterial levels and that blending surimi with minced crab meat improved the flavor, odor and texture characteristics of the recovered meat.
<P>
This project did more than cut costs and increase profits and employment in Georgia's blue crab industry. Consumers benefited from safe, new seafood products and extenders; stress on landfills was lightened; and science of safe seafood processing was advanced with the new data that was developed.

<H2>New Coho Breed Spurs<BR>
Domestic and Foreign Markets
</H2>
</CENTER>
Through selective breeding, <A HREF="http://www.wsg.washington.edu/">Washington Sea Grant</A> researchers and private aquaculturists have tripled the growth rates of native coho salmon. This new coho breed now helps support a $5 million domestic industry.
<P>
Since the supply and quality of coho eggs available from hatcheries varied greatly according to the size of wild returns, a salmon farming company, Domsea Farms, Inc. of Manchester, Washington, decided try to develop its own stock.
<P>
Therefore, research began in 1977 as a collaborative effort between Washington Sea Grant and Domsea. Domsea supplied the fish, manpower, and rearing facilities. Sea Grant provided the breeding expertise and a crucial intangible: commitment. Ten years of support was provided, enough to cover five breeding cycles.
<P>
The primary goal of the Washington Sea Grant/Domsea program was to create and maintain domesticated broodstock capable of rapid growth and good survival in intensive culture conditions. Results from the Sea Grant 10-year project exceeded expectations. A 1977-78 vintage yearling weighed no more than 300 grams, while mature fish averaged about 850 grams. By 1990, yearlings tipped the scales from 650 to 900 grams; mature two-year olds reached a whopping 3,000 grams.
<P>
Domsea, now called Domsea Broodstock, Inc., sells five to eight million domesticated coho eggs annually to aquaculturists in Chile, Europe, Japan, and the United States. The Washington-based company is the primary egg supplier for domestic coho farmers who brought approximately two million pounds of fish to market during 1993.
<P>
The significance of the Washington Sea Grant/Domsea breeding program extends beyond the development of a new variety of fish. Internationally, it is a prototype for marine breeding; locally, it serves as a model for the future of the West Coast aquaculture industry. (For details, Eugene Fritz, 301/713-2451)

<H2>Menhaden Bycatch Study Helps Save Jobs
</CENTER>
</H2>
Fishery managers, regulators, and the general public have become increasingly concerned about bycatch or the incidental harvesting of non-target species. Their major concern is that commercial fishers are wasting resources by harvesting both the important game fish .and the prey of major commercial and recreational species.
<P>
From Maine to North Carolina, recreational fishing and environmental groups have sought legislation to restrict menhaden fishing, particularly in coastal waters of the Mid-Atlantic Bight. So far, legislation prohibiting menhaden fishing in state waters has been passed by New Jersey and Delaware. And, in 1994, legislation was introduced to restrict it in Virginia, North Carolina, and Rhode Island.
<P>
This legislation has been introduced because of concerns that the menhaden fleet harvests excessive levels of bycatch. To address these concerns, the <A HREF="/VASG/index.html">Virginia Sea Grant Advisory Program</A> conducted a one year study on bycatch levels in the Mid-Atlantic menhaden fisher. Results of the study, funded by the Saltonstall-Kennedy Program of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (<A HREF = "http://kingfish.ssp.nmfs.gov:80/home-page.html">NMFS</A>), demonstrated that for every 2,440 menhaden harvested, approximately one fish or shellfish other than menhaden was caught, which was 0.041 percent of the total harvest.
<P>
The study results were published in <I>Bycatch and the Fishery for Atlantic Menhaden in the Mid-Atlantic Bight: An Assessment of the Nature and Extent of Bycatch</I>. This report was used by Virginia and North Carolina legislators and served as a partial basis for their decision not to restrict menhaden fishing in state waters.
<P>
As a consequence, what could have been a threatened industry continues to operate, employing more than 800  individuals. Those 800 jobs represent an approximate annual payroll of $18 million dollars. (For details, Bud Griswold, 301/713-2431)

<H2>Wetlands Research Yields Insights into Coastal Problems</H2>
</CENTER>
Coastal wetlands in the U.S. are literally between a rock and a hard place. On one side there is rising sea level and, on the other side, there is frequently something that does not allow transgression such as a housing development, a shopping mall, or an interstate highway. By studying the physical processes responsible for forming wetlands, scientists can gain valuable insights into potential solutions for many related coastal problems.
<P>
The study of the processes that determine the form of tidal flats has suffered because there is a lack of understanding about the erodibility and transport of the fine-grained material that dominates a wetland. Physical properties of sediment deposits in wetlands tend to be nonhomogeneous. They also vary with salinity and are strongly influenced by the associated plant and animal life. Because of recent research advances in many scientific disciplines, Woods Hole Sea Grant scientists believe this is an advantageous time to study the physical processes that are important on tidal flats. Part of this study will be to design and field test instrumentation for measuring the bulk properties of fine sediments in situ. The researchers also plan to develop a theoretical and empirical framework for assessing fine-grain sediment erosion and transport in the context of tidal flats.
<P>
In an era of rising sea level, one important question about wetlands concerns the nature of their transgression into the hinterland. To answer this question, Delaware Sea Grant researchers are trying to determine the rates of marsh transgression into the state's uplands and river valleys. It appears that current wetlands are considerably narrower than those of 3,500 years ago. Further, in all probability, with sea level rising at an increasing rate, future wetlands will be narrower than those of today. In addition, there is clear evidence that tidal wetlands are being rapidly destroyed by shoreline erosion. These findings indicate that Delaware's tidal marshes are both dynamic and fragile.
<P>
To predict the future extent of Delaware's wetlands and the characteristics of their transgression into the uplands, the researchers are developing conceptual and numerical models. These models will be useful in helping coastal managers and planners make wetland policy decisions. They will also be used to provide reasonable answers to "what if" scenarios. Since much of both the East and Gulf coasts is morphologically similar to Delaware's coast, these models should have general application.
<P>
It is often assumed that there is a direct link between recent anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases and global warming and that this, in turn, is leading to sea level rise. Connecticut Sea Grant researchers indicate this simple scenario is probably not correct. Detailed investigations of tidal marshes along Long Island Sound indicate that there was a pronounced increase in the rate of sea level rise about 1700 AD. However, modern global warming only became apparent about 1870 AD. Data collection is continuing, and it is being collated with related data from all over the world. It is expected that what currently appears to be an anomalous finding will be resolved to yield new insight into this complex problem of interaction among greenhouse gases, climate, and sea level rise.
<P>
Until recently, people living on the Oregon coast did not feel threatened by earthquakes. However, new understanding of plate tectonics suggests that strong subduction zone earthquakes can occur not only off Oregon's coast but also off the coasts of Washington, Northern California, and British Columbia. In addition to the threat of earthquakes to these coasts, there is also the threat of flooding due to tsunamis. Although, in modem times, earthquakes and locally-generated tsunamis have not been observed in these areas, there is a real need to determine how often such events might occur and how severe they might be. Therefore, Oregon Sea Grant scientists are examining the geological record of wetlands and flood- plains along the state's coast to identify past catastrophic events and to evaluate the potential for future devastating coastal subsidence, erosion, and flooding generated by earthquakes along the Juan de Fuca Ridge and North American plates off the Pacific Northwest coast.
<P>
As a result of these and other studies, scientists are beginning to be able to quantify the importance of wetlands, which moderate floods, maintain water quality, and provide critical habitat for many species of plants and animals. Louisiana Sea Grant has published a report to educate the public about these valuable natural resources. Called "The Fragile Fringe: Coastal Wetlands of the Continental United States," it is a comprehensive perspective on the status of U.S. wetlands.

<H2>Navigational Safety Improved
</H2>
</CENTER>
Late last year, skills learned at ><A HREF="http://www.wsg.washington.edu/">Washington Sea Grant's</A> fishing vessel safety training classes paid big benefits to the captains and crews of two vessels caught in a winter storm. Both vessels, part of the Dungeness crab fleet, were making a run to the fishing grounds to drop pots, when the storm hit with winds of 55 to 60 miles per hour.
<P>
On one boat, a shifting load of crab pots apparently knocked a crew member overboard. He was pulled unconscious from the water by the crew and revived by the captain who used cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) learned at a Sea Grant first aid course. Meanwhile, a second boat was taking on water. When a Coast Guard helicopter arrived on the scene and lowered an emergency pump, the captain knew exactly what to do. It was the same type of pump he had readied and started in drills during a Sea Grant safety and survival class 10 days earlier. And, since Sea Grant coordinates its safety program with Coast Guard air and boat stations, the captain was also familiar with Coast Guard procedures. 
<P>
In addition to these two captains, Washington Sea Grant trained over 130 persons last year in fishing vessel safety classes conducted at ports around the state. The classes have very intensive "hands-on" training. This type of training, also offered on the Pacific Coast by the <A HREF="http://info.alaska.edu/UA/UA_Fairbanks/SeaGrant">Alaska</A> and <A HREF="http://seagrant.orst.edu">Oregon Sea Grant</A> programs, enables crews to avoid succumbing to panic when there is an emergency at sea. Sea Grant has found that having equipment demonstrated and used, having fishermen get into their survival suits and crawl into life rafts in both swimming pools and harbor areas, having proper training in first aid and the use of CPR, and having onboard drills are extremely important and critical in saving both lives and property.

<H2>New Business Spurred by Pump Design
</CENTER>
</H2>
Manufactured by the firm Composite High Pressure Technologies (CHPT), the DELPUMP is a direct descendant of the DELBUOY, a wave-driven desalination system developed under the sponsorship of <A HREF="/DELSG/">Delaware Sea Grant</A>. Although DELPUMP is presently more of a commercial success than its ancestor, it owes its existence in large part to the component engineering undertaken for the DELBUOY. While designing the wave-powered pump, much was Iearned about water-lubricated polymeric bearings and composite construction allowing for the complete redesign of conventional metallic pumps.
<P>
This knowledge gained about high performance engineering plastics and composite materials was used to design the DELPUMP from scratch as a reverse osmosis seawater desalination pump. This approach differs greatly from other pump companies that have taken oil-field type pumps and reworked them to operate in reverse osmosis service. Advantages inherent in the DELPUMP's design such as corrosion resistance, light weight, and no oil lubrication make it well suited not only for use in desalination but also for submersible, food/chemical processing, industrial, machine tool, and mining applications.
<P>
The student who collaborated in the design of the DELBUOY earned his doctoral degree in marine studies and subsequently became the president of CHPT, Inc., which he formed in 1991. DELPUMPS have been sold to all four branches of the U.S. military, the Canadian Army and Navy, several commercial reverse-osmosis system assemblers (domestic and international), and companies supplying filtration equipment to the chemical processing industry.
<P>
Although the ancestor, DELBUOY, is not quite ready to be offered for commercial sale, it has strong potential. The DELBUOY produces fresh water from sea water without using electricity, fuels or motors and, since the DELBUOY is wave-powered, it is ideal for island and coastal areas where drinking water is in short supply. The concept is sound and the pump has been demonstrated extensively in conjunction with Puerto Rico Sea Grant off its coast. When financing is available to carry it through the transition from limited to full production, DELBUOY could be even more of a commercial success than DELPUMP.

<H2>Socioeconomic Research Supports Fisheries Management
</H2>
</CENTER>
The Sea Grant network sponsored a National Issues Forum--Can America Save its Fisheries?--recently at the National Press Club in Washington, DC. Speakers from industry, government, and the scientific community discussed the problems facing U.S. fisheries and possible solutions to those problems.
<P>
Although no single change in the management of the nation¹s fisheries will solve all their ills, controlling access is one mechanism that is receiving serious consideration. For example, Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs), are beginning to be used as a method of allocating a share of the allowable harvest to individuals. In turn, these shares can be transferred or traded. The primary feature of ITQs is the assignment of exclusive property rights for the harvest of a commonproperty resource. While ITQs are not viewed as a total panacea (they are complex to implement, for example), they will help provide a rational approach to managing fisheries through economic incentives that lead to resource conservation. 
<P>
Sea Grant programs nationwide have conducted long-term, socioeconomic research on fisheries management, including consideration of market-like mechanisms for allocating access to fish stocks. California Sea Grant conducted some of the earliest work studying how the implementation of  ITQs in other countries could serve as a model for the U.S.  Sea Grant researchers in Delaware and New Jersey played a key role in designing an ITQ system for the Atlantic surf clam and ocean quahog fishery, the first application of ITQs in the U.S.  Since the ITQ management system was implemented in 1991, these fisheries have stabilized.  Delaware Sea Grant is now continuing research to understand how existing firms adapted and how  income was redistributed.
<P>
Recently, the state of North Carolina placed a two-year moratorium on the sale of new commercial fishing licenses. North Carolina Sea Grant was asked to administer for the state a study of future management options and to derive better data about the people who fish. As part of this effort, Sea Grant social science researchers will be working with the fishing industry to discuss what types of limited entry might work in North Carolina.
<P>
An economist and legal scholar at Maine-New Hampshire Sea Grant are jointly studying the new approaches to rights-based fisheries management that might be created to control fishing pressure. Each of the management strategies to be studied -- fractional shares, ITQ banks, and fishery trusts -- seeks to solve some of  the well-known problems with limited entry or ITQ schemes. 
<P>
Since very little is known about the cumulative impacts on other fisheries from limiting access to a target species, Oregon Sea Grant researchers are looking at the impact of access limitation on a system of linked fisheries--groundfish, Dungeness crab, and pink shrimp.   In Texas, the expected incorporation of limited entry into managing the shrimp fishery will constitute a major change in this industry.  Texas Sea Grant researchers are studying the economic impacts of a limited entry program by developing a general, bioeconomic-fisheries-simulation model for the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery.  And in Alaska, Sea Grant economists are developing a model to assess alternative access limitations programs for the groundfish and crab fisheries. 
<P>
Currently, Sea Grant has two new major efforts to study the socioeconomic impacts of innovative fishery management strategies. In Rhode Island, one part of a multidisciplinary Sea Grant effort will be to assess the full economic and social consequences of implementing the actions necessary to rebuild the New England groundfish stocks. In Oregon, a team of researchers and outreach specialists is developing the socioeconomic knowledge needed to assess the impacts on people from changes occurring in the Pacific Northwest fisheries. 
<P>
These Sea Grant  socioeconomic research and outreach efforts related to fisheries management are helping to provide the information base that will be needed to secure a stable future for the families, businesses, and communities that depend upon having a sustainable fishing industry.

Oil Spill Receives Quick Response
</H2>
</CENTER>
The worst oil spill in Rhode Island's history occurred in January after stormy seas caused the tugboat Scandia and its barge to run aground on the state's south shore. Before salvage workers were able to stop the flow of oil, almost a million gallons leaked from the barge into Block Island Sound.  <A HREF="http://seagrant.gso.uri.edu/riseagrant">Rhode Island Sea Grant</A> researchers and outreach specialists were able to quickly respond to this accident not only because they were on site and supported by a small amount of  rapid response funds but also because of the long-term history of Sea Grant research and outreach activities in the area.
<P>
Within hours of the accident, a Rhode Island Sea Grant researcher was at work running an innovative hydrodynamic computer model he had previously developed for Narragansett Bay. He produced an animated model to predict the path of the leaked oil and, for several days, continued these predictions.  They were passed on to the Rhode Island Marine Safety Office and then to the U.S. Coast Guard to aid their containment and cleanup efforts.
<P>
Braving stormy seas, Sea Grant outreach specialists, accompanied by scientists from the Narragansett Laboratory of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), were first on the scene to assess the oil spill's damage to the environment.  Using a University of Rhode Island research vessel, they obtained samples of fish, surface and bottom water, and  bottom sediment for chemical analysis by the EPA.
<P>
Another Sea Grant researcher, who has been studying the area's lobster fishery for many years, accompanied fishermen to pull pots to evaluate the effects of the oil spill on lobster abundance.  Divers returned to the site later to gather additional estimates of abundance for comparison with Sea Grant baseline data.
<P>
Within days of the accident, the Sea Grant communications staff developed a WWW site (<A HREF="http://brooktrout.gso.uri.edu:80/riseagrant/oilspill.html">http://brooktrout.gso.uri.edu:80/riseagrant/oilspill.html</A>) that provided information about the spill to a concerned public and the media.  This information was also used by the Governor's Office as a source for scientific statements about the accident, particularly on how it related to seafood safety and tourism.

<H2>
Program Promotes Environmentally-Friendly Lawn Care
</H2>
</CENTER>

Estimates show that homeowners use 10 times more chemicals per acre to grow attractive lawns than do farmers to grow crops. These fertilizers and pesticides, under some conditions, can contribute to nonpoint source pollution problems in coastal waters.  To educate homeowners how to care for lawns and landscapes using environmentally-friendly practices, <A HREF="http://www.cce.cornell.edu/seagrant/">New York Sea Grant outreach specialists</A>, supported by both NOAA and the USDA Cooperative Extension Service, initiated  the "Homescape for Water Quality" program. It is modeled after a program conducted by the Cooperative Extension Service in a Virginia county.
<P>
In the fall of 1994, a typical suburban development in western New York was targeted to participate in the first Homescape program. Homeowners from this development were teamed up with Master Gardener volunteers who had been recruited and trained by New York Sea Grant outreach specialists.  These volunteers worked closely with the homeowners, helping them to take and interpret soil tests to accurately predict fertilizer needs and to fill out pre-surveys of  past lawn and garden practices. In addition, the Master Gardeners recommended lawn and landscape care practices that were beneficial to the environment. 
<P>
Data collected from homeowner post-surveys indicate that important changes in lawn care behavior took  place. Use of slow-release fertilizers replaced those that allow nitrogen to run-off property in heavy rain, and the total amount of fertilizer applied was cut in half on some properties. People also found that environmentally-sound gardening techniques actually took less time than traditional approaches. Furthermore, one happy homeowner calculated he saved $250 using the new practices and his lawn has never looked better. 
<P>
Last fall, residents from another development in western New York signed up to participate in the Homescape program, and it is expanding to other regions of New York including Long Island and the Hudson River Valley. This spring, with the help of New York Sea Grant outreach specialists, these homeowners will be able to make decisions about lawn and landscape care that will save time, money, and the environment.

<H2>Powerful Tool Aids Researchers and Resource Managers
</H2>
</CENTER>
A <A HREF="http://www.seagrant.wisc.edu/">Wisconsin Sea Grant</A> researcher and his students have provided scientists with a powerful tool, a computerized fish bioenergetics model. This model, which enables scientists to gather data about how fish collect and spend energy, is being used by researchers and fisheries managers throughout the nation and abroad as a research and management tool.
<P>
The original bioenergetics model was first successfully used to help sustain Lake Michigan¹s forage fish base, which supports a billion-dollar salmon and trout sport fishery. The model predicted that forage fish populations, particularly the alewife, would decline if fishery managers continued to increase salmonid stocking rates. The model¹s prediction proved correct when, four years later, Lake Michigan¹s once-abundant alewife population declined 86 percent. Forewarned, fishery managers reduced stocking pressures to avoid a complete collapse of the valuable fishery.  
<P>
As a result, the <A HREF="http://h2o.seagrant.wisc.edu/greatlakes/glnetwork/glnetwork.html">Great Lakes Sea Grant Network</A> and state and federal fisheries managers developed a coordinated two-year regional study of the diets of predator fish, providing the first simultaneously collected database for predator-prey systems in each of the Great Lakes. Since then, the state, federal, and provincial fishery agencies responsible for stocking policy in Lakes Michigan, Ontario, and Superior have employed bioenergetics models to help guide management policy. Today, the Wisconsin Sea Grant bioenergetics model forms the framework for Great Lakes stocking decisions.It also is heavily used by state and federal fisheries managers nationwide, from Lake Ontario to the Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Wyoming to the Northwest¹s Columbia River.
<P>
Wisconsin Sea Grant has helped sponsor more than two dozen workshops on the fish bioenergetics model and trained more than 350 scientists. In addition, Sea Grant has distributed nearly 1,000 copies of the model software and manual. (For details, <A HREF="mailto:bill.graham@noaa.gov">Bill Graham</A>, 301/713-2448)

<H2>Marine Compounds Reap Big Profits
</H2>
</CENTER>
Developed by <A HREF="http://www-csgc.ucsd.edu">California Sea Grant</A> researchers, a unique class of marine compounds generated $686,000 in royalties last year and over a million dollars to date, placing them among the university¹s top ten royalty-producing inventions. The compounds, a closely related group called pseudopterosins, are extracted from a creature called the Caribbean sea whip. They have been licensed to two companies for very different purposes.
<P>
For medical use as anti-inflammatory drugs, pseudopterosins have been licensed to a small pharmaceutical firm. The company has completed preclinical tests of one pseudopterosin, a potent topical anti-inflammatory compound, and filed an investigational new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It is expected that clinical trials on human subjects will focus on the drug¹s potential as therapy for irritant contact dermatitis.
<P>
For cosmetic application, use of the natural extract has been licensed to a speciality chemicals firm that supplies natural bulk ingredients to the cosmetics industry. At present, the natural extract is included in a boutique line of skin care products.
<P>
These represent the first of what will probably be a number of significant uses for derivatives of the pseudopterosins. Looking ahead to the next generation of pseudopterosin-derived drugs, the researchers will attempt to develop drugs for inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and asthma. 
<P>
For fiscal year 1994-1995, the University of California reported revenues of over $63 million in fees and royalties on over 400 inventions. Net income (income after expenses and distributions to joint holders, inventors, and the State of California) is available to support ongoing campus research and educational programs.

<H2>New Uses for Fish Boost Economy</H2>
</CENTER>
Whiting, a fish found in abundance off Oregon's coast, was once shunned by commercial fishermen because its flesh deteriorated quickly after being caught, making it unprofitable for use by onshore processors. The fishing industry realized whiting's economic potential, however, after Sea Grant and other researchers showed U.S. processors how surimi products such as imitation crab and shrimp could be made from plentiful domestic species.
<P>
<A HREF="http://seagrant.orst.edu">Oregon Sea Grant</A> worked with industry to help develop new harvesting, onboard handling, and processing techniques to overcome the rapid breakdown of whiting flesh. As a result, whiling became a feasible seafood for use by onshore processors. In 1992, approximately 50,000 metric tons of whiting, more than double the previous year's production, were processed at Oregon shore-based plants. Estimates show a local economic impact of over $30 million.
<P>
With this increase in whiting processing came an increase in fish waste. To find a use for the leftover fish carcasses, Oregon Sea Grant contacted fertilizer, meal, and compost producers. One business, the family run Thorpe Valley Farms of Eugene, Oregon, expressed interest in using the fish waste for composting. With technical assistance from Sea Grant, Thorpe Valley was able to develop a nutrient-rich potting soil made from Ieftover Pacific whiting carcasses and sawdust mix. This year, the company made 10,000 cubic yards of compost by using about 2,500 tons of whiling waste. Gross sales for the firm should be about $750,000 in 1993 with hopes to double this sales figure next year. (For details, <A HREF="mailto:john.ahrens@noaa.gov">John Ahrens</A>, 301/7l3-2435)

<H2>Research Assists Groundfish Plan Development
</H2>
</CENTER>
Responding to management and industry needs, <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena/org/s/seagrant/www/mitsg.htm">MIT Sea Grant</A>, in cooperation with the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), took the lead on a preliminary assessment of the potential socioeconomic impacts of a proposed amendment to the New England Groundfish Multispecies Fishery Management Plan. Proposed Amendment S recommends rebuilding overfished stocks through a broad range of measures that include cutting in half the cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder harvest rates. Such a reduction, even phased in gradually, will clearly have major impacts on fishermen and their communities.
<P>
Sea Grant researchers found that because of the extreme diversity in the New England groundfish industry, impacts of Amendment S are likely to vary across regions and communities, age and ethnic groups, and gear types and vessel sizes. The uncertainty about how each sector and each individual will be affected creates tension and anxiety among all involved in the fishing industry. Fishermen anticipate bankruptcy and the loss of their homes, which often provide collateral for their vessels.
<P>
Some ports with a disproportionate concentration of mid-sized vessels, in particular, face severe losses of individual ownership of vessels. Ports with mid-sized fleets may be at greater risk than ports characterized by fleets of larger vessels or smaller vessels that predominate in small, rural ports. In addition, the impacts could be deeper in communities where kinship is an important employment factor- where there is family involvement in all aspects of the industry from fishing to processing and marketing.
<P>
The findings of the technical report have been incorporated into the draft EIS by the NEFMC's plan development team, and the socioeconomic findings have been used to brief an interagency group convened to discuss potential effects and economic mitigation for the New England region. As a result of this initial MIT Sea Grant assessment pointing out the diverse distribution effects and the lack of information about them, NMFS is developing requirements for further social impact studies, with additional projects likely to be conducted by universities and colleges.

<H2>Research to Improve the Safety of Divers</H2>
</CENTER>
Millions of dives are performed each year by U.S. civilian divers. Most of this activity by recreational, commercial, scientific, and governmental organizations occurs in states that are served by a Sea Grant program. Therefore, Sea Grant is uniquely suited, through its university-based network and its outreach programs, to support research beneficial to divers and to communicate those useful research findings to them.
<P>
 Several Sea Grant programs are involved in research concerning the prevention and treatment of decompression sickness (DCS), a health hazard associated with diving and working underwater. It is marked by pains in the joints, cramps, paralysis and, potentially, death unless prevented by gradual decompression or treated with recompression.
<P>
 Scuba divers using compressed air breathe mostly nitrogen. While underwater, the diver's tissues accumlate dissolved nitrogen. Typically, too rapid a return from high pressure underwater to surface pressure causes nitrogen bubble formation and DCS. Therefore, safely eliminating nitrogen from the body is important for preventing or treating this sickness.
<P>
 Although it is well known that breathing oxygen hastens nitrogen elimination, New York Sea Grant researchers have shown that when the amount of oxygen inhaled is increased, it constricts blood vessels, thereby lowering the heart's pumping performance and slowing the elimination of nitrogen from the tissues. Thus, researchers believe that the increased levels of oxygen are less effective in washing out nitrogen than commonly thought, indicating a need to modify present decompression tables by lengthening them.
<P>
 In another approach to eliminating nitrogen, New York researchers are investigating the potential use of medications for the prevention and treatment of DCS. They tested volunteers who had been prescribed various medications and identified two drugs that increased the nitrogen elimination rate up to 20 percent. Researchers believe that if there are no side effects to taking these medications, they could be used to enhance nitrogen washout during recompression treatment or after a dive.
<P>
 Hawaii Sea Grant researchers are evaluating the role the blood's complement system plays in DCS. The complement system is part of the body's defense system against invasion by foreign substances. Researchers believe bubbles in the blood, which are common during and after decompression, may activate this system. Currently, they are investigating the possibility of minimizing the activation of the complement system or deactivating it to prevent or alleviate DCS.
<P>
 In addition, a greater understanding of the complement system may enable scientists to predict an individual's susceptibility to DCS. Researchers at Sea Grant programs in New York and Hawaii are investigating the complement system's role in the large variations that exist between individual divers' susceptibility to DCS. This work could lead to the screening of divers and to decompression procedures that could be carried out on an individualized basis.
<P>
 Divers having untreated DCS with limb bends are in danger of developing hyperbaric osteonecrosis, a degenerative form of bone disease that can permanently disable divers and tunnel workers. Using sheep, Wisconsin Sea Grant researchers found that recompression therapy of limb bends within four hours of onset prevented the development of bone necrosis. This finding appears consistent with successful clinical outcomes in recompressed commercial divers, and the study is being extended to include semi-professional and recreational divers. The researchers are now trying to discover the effects on bones of delaying recompression treatment.
<P>
 Another potential problem for scuba divers is panic or near-panic behavior. Wisconsin Sea Grant researchers surveyed 500 scuba divers and found that 54 percent have experienced this behavior. Additionally, they found that responses to stress can be influenced by personality structure, gender, protective clothing, and water temperature. These findings have led to the development of a Body Awareness Scale, which has proven valid and reliable in evaluating 600 male and 300 female volunteers. This scale is currently being applied by Wisconsin Sea Grant researchers in efforts to modify the stress response of scuba divers.
<P>
 For the foreseeable future, wet diving techniques will continue to be a focus of Sea Grant scientific research. The major benefit of this research will be to reduce human suffering and the loss of human lives from diving accidents. In addition, it will increase productivity for working divers and enjoyment for recreational divers. (For details, Gene Smith, 301/713-2427)

<H2>Plants Protect Threatened Shorelines
</H2>
</CENTER>
From New Jersey to Texas, in Mexico and throughout the Caribbean, plants from Horticultural Systems, Inc. (HSI) are helping restore damaged coastal ecosystems and protecting fragile beach environments from natural and human threats. The company's many clients include government agencies at the federal, state and local levels, and private firms involved in coastal engineering.
<P>
Much of HSl's success can be attributed to <A HREF="http://gnv.ifas.ufl.edu/~seaweb/homepage/fsg.htm">Florida Sea Grant</A>. By providing research and the support and advice of outreach specialists, Sea Grant has enabled the company to grow from a backyard, two-person hobby into a 15-acre nursery with 50 full-time employees who produce four million plants each year.
<P>
Of particular importance to HSI was Sea Grant research exploring the use of micropropagation techniques to create "offspring" from a superior plant in the laboratory. This enabled growers to "custom design" vegetation that survives better than similar plants growing in the wild, which is a valuable attribute for the harsh growing conditions found in coastal and beach environments.
<P>
Also of vital importance to HSI was Sea Grant research showing that sea oat seedlings inoculated with a fungi had a greater survival rate when transplanted at the beach than did untreated seedlings. In addition, the root systems of the treated oats were better able to hold sand in place.
<P>
In return for Sea Grant's support, HSI has served as a valuable test ground and experiment station for Sea Grant researchers who are working to protect America's increasingly threatened shorelines. Together HSI and Sea Grant have shown what can be accomplished through a partnership approach among industry, universities, governments, and people.

Unlike life-supporting water in the natural environment, water used in aquaculture systems requires intense and special treatment. The high density of animals and the feeding levels used in commercial aquaculture systems require efficient nitrification ability, maintenance or adequate dissolved oxygen and acid Levels, and solids removal.
<P>
Using a new approach, Louisiana Sea Grant researchers have developed and patented bead filters for use in aquaculture systems. These new filters accomplish both nitrification and solids removal in a single, efficient unit that requires far less space than alternative filters.
<P>
The filtering systems have proved reliable, are easily maintained and well-adapted to automation-qualities believed by many in the aquaculture industry to be the key to success in large-scale recirculating aquaculture technology. The advantages of this new approach include excellent water conservation, reduced environmental impacts from wastewater discharge, and better control Or the animals' feeding, health and habitat requirements.
<P>
These versatile units are being manufactured by companies in Louisiana and Texas and are available in various sizes. They not only have improved The efficiency of aquaculture enterprises nationwide but also have provided the technology needed to produce a wider variety of species in high density systems.
<P>
For example, a tropical fish producer with facilities in California, Florida and Pennsylvania purchased 10 of the large bead filters for his systems. Louisiana's first tilapia producer operates a multiple 40,000-gallon lank system with eight of The bead filters. A bead filter was installed to cleanse crawfish for market by a Louisiana firm. Two ornamental fish retailers in Baton Rouge purchased several hundred bead filters for in-store use. The bead filters are also being used by a Louisiana alligator producer; university researchers in Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas to culture shrimp, hybrid striped bass, rangia clams, red drum, catfish, and lobsters; a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fish hatchery in Montana; and a Florida firm for a fish exhibit prepared for the Walt Disney Epcot Center.

<H2>Research On Toxic Pollutants</H2>
</CENTER>

Public concern regarding toxic pollutants in the environment has been heightened by the many well- documented cases of serious impacts on human health from both manufacturing and construction industry pollutants. Similarly, many cases have been reported of the acute effects that oil and pesticide spills have on aquatic life and ecosystems. 
<P>
However, it is difficult to learn how long-term exposures to low levels of toxic pollutants affect marine ecosystem functions and populations. Therefore, a major area of Sea Grant research on toxic pollutants focuses on their transport, transformations, and fates in the marine and Great Lakes environments. These processes control an organism's level and duration of toxic exposure. 
<P>
Researchers are particularly interested in the release of toxic metals from contaminated sediments and the metals' subsequent uptake by marine organisms. Many Sea Grant field and laboratory studies are identifying the environmental conditions that control the release of metals. Metal speciation measurements, using new electrochemical analytical technology, are permitting researchers to accurately measure the biologically active forms in sediments, waters and marine organisms, and to determine true rates of uptake. 
<P>
Sea Grant research into the environmental behavior of toxic organic compounds has shifted from studies which identify and quantify sources. Projects now focus on understanding the processes controlling the transport and fate of these compounds. For example, concentrations of many toxic organic compounds such as PCBs and DDT accumulate in plankton and are biomagnified as they pass up the food chain. Understanding and quantifying the routes taken by these compounds in complex food webs is critical to developing models for predicting toxicant behavior in the environment. 
<P>
The behavior of toxics when they interact with colloids is also being explored by Sea Grant researchers. Colloids are particles existing naturally in lake and ocean waters, but they are too small to be seen with a light microscope. Recently, technology was developed to separate colloids from truly dissolved material and larger particles. This ability to measure colloids has expanded research on their interaction with pollutants. The high surface area per unit volume of colloids enables them to readily adsorb many pollutants. Understanding this interaction will lead to better models of the transport of pollutants in coastal and Great Lake waters. 
<P>
Another major area of Sea Grant research concerns the effects that toxic pollutants have on aquatic ecosystems and their plant and animal components. At the cellular level, research is directed toward developing indicators of exposure, stress, and genetic damage. At the organism level, research is focused on how toxic pollutants affect the reproduction and growth processes critical to determining populations. For example, research by Wisconsin Sea Grant has shown that even very low levels of PCBs and dioxins, while not lethal to adult lake and rainbow trout, can cause significant mortality to eggs and fry. These results are important to understanding the reproductive failure of stocked lake trout in the Great Lakes. 
<P>
In regional, multi-agency approaches to solving environmental problems, Sea Grant scientists are investigating how toxic pollutants affect estuaries. A team of Texas Sea Grant scientists is participating in the Environmental Protection Agency's Galveston Bay Program. Their research will help to identify and better understand the sources and transformations of toxic metals in the bay. 
<P>
Supported by both NOAA and EPA, Maryland and Virginia Sea Grant scientists are participating in the comprehensive Chesapeake Bay Toxics Research Program. The program is focused on the transport and fate of toxic substances and on how these substances affect both ecological processes and bay organisms. 
<P>
Learning the real effects of low-level toxic pollutants on aquatic ecosystems and their inhabitants is an especially difficult research challenge. The answers will not come quickly and will require the attention of the best researchers in the field. Addressing this challenge, in cooperation with other NOAA elements and federal agencies, is a major Sea Grant undertaking.

<H2>Continued Studies of Juvenile Oyster Disease (JOD) in the Northeastern United States (R/ODR-01)</H2>
Many oyster aquaculture operations in the northeastern United States, from Maine to Long Island Sound, saw production plummet 50 to 90 percent, beginning in 1990 because of juvenile oyster disease (JOD). Researchers are continuing work with a grower in Long Island Sound to breed JOD-resistant oysters; evaluations of oysters bred in 1994 showed mortalities in selectively-spawned strains were greatly reduced; at present they are testing the susceptibility of two other oyster species to JOD.

<H2>Continued Studies on the Identity of Juvenile Oyster Disease (JOD) Causative Organism in Northeastern United States Oysters (R/ODR-04)</H2>
In trying to determine the identity of the juvenile oyster disease (JOD), researchers have largely eliminated a dinoflagellate or a bacterium as the primary disease agent. Suspecting the infective organism to be a ciliated protist, which is known to parasitize oysters and other invertebrates by first invading the mantle epithelium, Eugene Small is working to culture and identify the protist, and to test its infectivity in oysters.

<H2>Production of disease-free oysters for use in oyster recovery area research (R/ODR-02)</H2>
A key feature of the Maryland Oyster Roundtable Action to restore oyster stocks to the Chesapeake Bay is the setting aside of oyster recovery areas, low salinity regions for planting disease-free oysters -- one way to provide such oysters is to rear them in hatcheries under controlled conditions. This project represents a first step in determining whether disease-free seed can survive and grow in natural habitats; the researchers will produce sufficient numbers of young oysters for planting on 3 to 5 acres annually, will monitor the survival, growth, disease onset and mortality over a three-year period, and then quantify changes in the bottom communities associated with oyster reefs.

<H2>Cooperative Regional Oyster Selective Breeding (CROSBreed) Project (R/ODR-08)</H2>
For nearly 25 years, scientists at Rutgers have been breeding oyster survivors of MSX attacks to produce lines with high resistance to MSX.  Unfortunately MSX-resistant oysters have not proven resistant to Dermo.  In an ambitious project, scientists in the mid-Atlantic have embarked on a regional program to breed MSX-resistant oysters for resistance to Dermo as well. These oysters will be spawned at the Haskin Research Lab at Rutgers and grown out in three different sites in Delaware and Chesapeake bays.  The goal is to demonstrate the utility of such resistant lines across different environments and, ultimately, to make these strains of oysters available for aquaculture and repletion programs.

<H2>Crassostrea viginica Pathogens in Chesapeake Bay Oyster Populations: A Dual Disease Simulation  Model of Parasite-Host Interactions over a Large Spatial Scale (R/ODR-05)</H2>
A rational basis for assessing strategies to manage seed areas or brood stocks will need to predict the potential consequences of alternative restoration strategies. This project will model  oyster populations subject to the influences of the environment (e.g., water temperature, salinity, circulation) and two lethal parasites, Dermo and MSX. In the long run, managers and scientists will be able to apply this model to address "what-if" questions that could better steer management towards the most promising tactics for restoration.

<H2>Evaluation of American Oyster Stocks for Resource Rehabilitation: Disease Resistance and Genetics (R/ODR-03)</H2>
MSX and Dermo appear less virulent in regions outside the Chesapeake Bay, which suggests that oysters from those areas may possess traits which enable them to better survive infection. Do these traits have a genetic basis? The researchers will collect oysters from regions throughout the Atlantic range of the eastern oyster to evaluate their genetic relatedness. Offspring of these broodstocks will be deployed in representative sites in Maryland and Virginia. Survival, growth and condition of offspring will be monitored throughout the project. Promising genotypes will be selected and maintained for future selective breeding of disease-resistant strains.

<H2>Assessing the Presence and Virulence of "Dermo" Disease in the Environment Using a PCR-Based Diagnostic Assay for the Extrachromosomal Plastid Genome of Perkinsus marinus (R/ODR-06)</H2>
One vital need to protect against transferring infected oysters into uninfected areas is the ability to detect the presence of disease in broodstock, spat and adult oysters, even at very low levels, as well as in the environment into which oysters might be planted.  Research by Vasta and Marsh is continuing the development of molecular probes for Perkinsus marinus. Specifically, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a unique DNA molecule found only in Perkinsus is used as the basis of a test which can detect the parasite at levels several orders of magnitude below that of current techniques.

<H2>The Molecular Basis for the Etiology of the Oyster "Dermo" Disease: Gene Regulation Events Susceptible to Chemical Inhibition (R/ODR-07)</H2>
How is Perkinsus marinus able to invade its oyster host, evade detection and thus subsequent attack by cellular defense mechanisms, and why is Crassostrea virginica more susceptible to Dermo than closely related species? Answers to such questions may make it possible to inhibit infection, bolster host immunity or identify genes which confer improved resistance to the parasite. Researchers in this project are working to identify nutritional and other factors in the oyster¹s cells and tissues which regulate the ability of P. marinus to reproduce within its host and to determine the adaptations which allow the parasite to evade destruction by the oyster¹s hemocytes. The ultimate goal is to develop chemical strategies to block the ability of the parasite to detect, enter or proliferate within the body of the oyster. The activity of the parasite in the eastern oyster will also be compared with that in the more resistant Pacific oyster.

Every week extension agents and specialists receive inquiries from people who want to start an aquaculture business.  Most, we know from experience, will never get to the point where they actually start an enterprise.  Because of lack of capital, lack of experience, or the developing realization that this business takes more than just a notion, many fall by the wayside.
<P>
For those who do stick it out, there is the knowledge that they are getting into one of the fastest growing areas of American agriculture.  It's an industry that has seen a great deal of growth during the past two decades and seems to have a bright future.  How do you go about getting into business and where are some of the areas where you will face challenges?  Let's take a look at some of them:
<P>
<A NAME="SPECSEL"></A>
<H4>Species Selection
</H4>
This is one of the first things you will need to do and it will, in many cases, also decide on the production system that you will use.  Fish such as tilapia require warm water.  If you decide to raise them, you will have to use an enclosed reuse system to retain heat in the cold months.  On the other hand, if you're raising trout, you will need cold water.  That means you won't be trying to raise them in ponds on the Eastern Shore where summer water temperatures can go over 90 degrees F.  If you are going to pursue shellfish aquaculture, you will need to have a salinity profile in the areas you are considering. Many areas of Maryland are too fresh to be able to raise species like <I>Mercenaria</I> (hard shell) clams.  In short, you need to match the biological needs of the animal to the growing area and system.
<P>
<A NAME="SITESEL"></A>
<H4>Site selection
</H4>
Location can be critical to success in aquaculture.  Not only must the biology of the animal be taken into account, but available utilities, transportation system, and proximity to markets. Aquaculture operations can use large amounts of electricity to drive pumps, aerators, and other equipment to keep fish alive and energy is often expensive.  Investigate off peak power rates with your utility company since this may save you a great deal.  Also, three phase power is cheaper than using single phase but it may not be available in many rural areas.
<P>
Roads and airports need to be considered since you're going to be moving fish and/or shellfish and need to get to market rapidly.  Are there truck terminals where you can ship your product with companies that handle fresh product?  How reliable are the airlines in getting fresh product to market?  Are there other producers nearby to pool loads and feed shipments with?
<P>
Most importantly, what is the price of the real estate that you're going to need?  How much water is available in surface or underground sources and what is the quality of that water?  Spending time investigating these things at the beginning will save you from expensive mistakes that could jeopardize your business before you get your first crop to market.
<P>
<A NAME="CAPITAL"></A>
<H4>Capital
</H4>
Financing an aquaculture business is usually hard.  Banks have little experience with them in many areas.  Those that would freely make a loan for a poultry operation will be reluctant to make one for aquaculture because they have not done so before and may have heard of one or more that never made it to financial success.  Government loan and/or guarantee programs can sometimes be used to help minimize the banks exposure in a loan.
<P>
Bear in mind that few aquaculture ventures develop a cash flow in a short time.  Many take several years in order to develop one.  In that respect, financing an aquaculture business can be more like starting an orchard rather than grain farming.  You need to allow for that in your financial planning.
<P>
In all instances, spending the time to put together a professional looking business plan will assist you. It shows the banker that you have taken time to do your homework in gathering and analyzing the economic figures and a good business plan will be used to guide your business as it develops.
<P>
<A NAME="PERMITS"></A>
<H4>Permits
</H4>
This can be a frustrating road, depending upon what you want to do.  If you are developing ponds on existing farmland, you may not have many problems.  If, on the other hand, you want to engage in open water aquaculture in the Chesapeake Bay using one of the experimental permits, you may be in for the bureaucratic ride of your life.  Find out beforehand what permits you will need, including such things as zoning changes.  Doing so will keep you from being surprised at some point down the road.  Many states have aquaculture coordinators who can advise you on the permits you will need for the operation you're proposing.
<P>
<A NAME="MARKETS"></A>
<H4>Markets
</H4>
You need to have an idea of where you are going to sell your product and who your competition is going to be.  Marketing is the strategic positioning of your product and should not be confused with sales.  If you are going to be raising 50 or 100 acres of fish that will come to size at a particular time, your market strategy will be far different than someone who has a few cages of fish in a pond and can afford to harvest a few hundred pounds at a time.
<P>
Aquaculture is a fascinating business and offers potential for those who have the drive to seek out opportunities, plan their business strategy, and pursue their goals.  It's not easy but it can be done.  Doing the background work necessary to make sound business decisions is critical to success.  We all probably heard it enough during our school years but, if you want to get into the business, it is still necessary to, "Do your homework"!

<A NAME="DIETS"></A>
<H2>High Energy Diets For Fish<BR>
by Rich Bohn,  Southern Maryland Area Agent
</H2>
</CENTER>
	Aquaculture is a risky business and often dependent on fair weather as well.  Farming salmon and trout in sea cages and raceways may seem well controlled, but storms and floods often mean lost fish and equipment.  Raising fish quickly can reduce this risk by shortening exposure time.  Both systems are also under scrutiny because of excess nutrients entering the environment, but recent advances in altering fish diets may provide a partial solution to both problems.
<P>
As our understanding of energy use and fish metabolism has increased, high energy diets have been developed to speed growth rates.  Higher levels of proteins and fats and lower amounts of carbohydrates can increase growth rates when the diet is fed properly.  By using contents with higher digestibility, nitrogen and phosphate wastes also appear to decrease; reducing nutrient impacts leaving fish farms.
<P>
Much of the research began with salmon raised in ocean pens.  Diets using around 40 percent protein and up to 36 percent fat were produced using extruders, which can maintain fat content in diets better than other types of pellet makers.  Fish were fed the diet to their maximum capacity daily, increasing the growth rate substantially.  The food conversion ratio (feed to flesh) was similar to standard diets used by the industry, but fish reached market size in less time.
<P>
Diets developed next for trout farms use 45 percent protein and 28 percent fat, and have shown similar success.  Differences in diets between species reflect the optimum ratio of digestible protein to total digestible energy needed by different species of fish.  Incorrect ratios can cause excessive fat deposits which are lost during processing or impact flesh quality.
<P>
While additional research is required before applying the approach to other fish farmed in our region, the results have shown promise for reducing growing times and the environmental impact of nutrient wastes. Finishing diets may also be needed in some instances before marketing.  Salmon used for smoking, a process that requires leaner fish fillets, are often placed on a lower fat and protein diet for the final four to eight weeks before processing.
<P>
Finishing diets also may be changed to improve fillet quality or even extend shelf life after processing. However, the research always demonstrates the importance of proper feeding practices, in addition to appropriate diets, in reducing growing times as well as feed costs.

<H2>Choptank River Oyster Recovery Area Activities Begin<BR>
by Don Meritt, Shellfish Aquaculture Specialist
</H2>
</CENTER>
The summer of 1995 began a new era in oyster repletion as the oyster hatchery at the University of Maryland Horn Point Environmental Laboratory (<A HREF=" http://co.cees..edu/hpel/hpel.html">HPEL</A>) geared up to produce seed oysters for use in the Choptank River oyster recovery area.  As the first major thrust of the historic Oyster Roundtable Action Plan for Oyster Recovery in Maryland, the Choptank River received some two and a half million oyster seed.  
<P>
Seed oysters were produced from local broodstock spawned in the hatchery.  The larvae were then set using a newly refurbished production setting system at Horn Point.  The newly set oyster spat were then transported to nursery areas in the upper Choptank where they remained for a few weeks and allowed to grow.  Once the spat had reached planting size (1/2 to 3/4 inch) they were deployed on specially built beds for final growout.  The beds were constructed during 1994 by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources using dredged shell mined from the upper Chesapeake Bay.  A ten acre shell plot was divided into two segments, one which received hatchery seed this summer and a second plot which is due to receive a similar amount of seed during the summer of 1996.  
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="oyster.gif" ALT="[oyster]">
Oyster seed produced in the HPEL hatchery were monitored for disease during the hatchery phase and while they were deployed in the nursery areas.  Monitoring will continue as part of a scientific evaluation that includes researchers from other University of Maryland departments and the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory.  Data collected will help with understanding oyster spat growth, survival, and the dynamics of disease pressure that has so severely limited oyster production in the Chesapeake Bay in recent years.  
<P>
The test plots will also be used to document the overall changes in the area and should contribute to a better understanding of the ecological value of oysters to the Bay's general health.  Oysters are the foundation of what were major reef structures scattered throughout the Bay and its tributaries.  Many of these reefs have undergone major changes as oyster populations have severely declined.  Other organisms which depend on this reef structure for food, shelter, or substrate have also undergone drastic population changes.  This study is designed to better quantify the importance of oysters to these associated organisms.
<P>
The work in the upper Choptank this summer was funded by the Department of Commerce NOAA, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, and the Maryland Oyster Recovery Partnership.  This cooperative effort was accomplished by coordinating the efforts of researchers, watermen, and management agency personnel, and by utilizing schoolchildren brought to the region by the Living Classrooms Foundation. Middle school students from the Baltimore area were instrumental in providing much of the labor involved in moving large volumes of material from the hatchery to the nursery areas and from the nursery areas to the planting grounds.  In this way, the project got a much needed labor force and the students got a first hand demonstration of what is involved in oyster repletion and a great hands on example of the Bay's ecology.

<A NAME="REUSE"></A>
<H2>Water Reuse Short Course: Some Lessons From School<BR>
by Steve Bogash, Enterprise Consultant
</H2>
</CENTER>
From July 10 thru July 15, 1995, Dr. Michael Timmons of Cornell University led a group of producers and extension representatives on an excursion into the world of recirculation aquaculture systems.  This "Short Course on Water Reuse Systems" was supported by the Regional Extension Project of the Northeastern Regional Aquaculture Center (NRAC), one of five such centers funded by the USDA.  The project reimbursed travel and tuition for extension agents and specialists within the region to attend.  The knowledge gained will be put to use in their respective states for the benefit of the aquaculture industry.
<P>
Rich Bohn (Southern Maryland Area Agent) and I attended the program representing the University of Maryland. While it seems that the engineering aspects of recirculation have come a long way in recent years, an operator must still be part engineer, part grower, and part magician to keep a system operating well.  Fish kills and other lesser but still equally serious problems that affect the bottom financial line are still common in water reuse systems. Still, the promise of producing economically competitive fish in reduced water demand systems continues to attract attention and research. The design of recirculation aquaculture systems and their subsequent management continues to evolve and develop.
<P>
The following are some of the rules regarding the systems which we learned at the course:
<P>
Tank Design:
<OL>
<LI>Too deep a tank and the solids are removed too slowly from the system.
<LI>Too shallow a tank and the fishes swimming motion keeps the waste particles in suspension, making removal more difficult.
<LI>Keep in-tank disturbances to a minimum.  Remember that every valve, pipe, sensor, etc. provides locations for organic residue buildup.
<LI>As tank diameter increases, the depth can also increase and still operate efficiently.
<LI>Design your drain grids to be as large as possible but still retain fish. This will lessen opportunities for biofouling.
</OL>
<P>
Other system design rules:
<OL>
<LI>Capture the waste solids before they enter the pump.  Once the solids go through the pump, their size is greatly reduced, making them much more difficult to remove.
<LI>If a foam fractionator is used, install it before the biofilter.
<LI>Use HD polystyrene (approximate R value = 5/inch) for any building insulation. Avoid batts or fiberglass insulation for your structure since these hold far too much water. 
<LI>Every gallon per minute of well capacity can effectively service 1,000 gallons of system operating capacity.
<LI>Each pound of food will generate 1.375 pound of carbon dioxide and 2-3 gallons of sludge.
<LI>4 grams of oxygen are required to oxidize every gram of ammonia broken down by the biofilter. Adding oxygen before the biofilter will greatly increase ammonia removal by increasing the oxygen available to the bacteria in the biofilter.
</OL>
<P>
Of great interest in recirculation aquaculture is the development of microbead biofilters. These operate in the same fashion as the more standard biofilters, that is they provide a large surface area for the nitrogen-cycling bacteria to react with the water undergoing treatment.  One large difference is the greatly decreased cost per square foot of reactive area and the much smaller floor space required for support. The beads in question are simply polystyrene micro beads, commonly used in casting Styrofoam objects.  Dr. Timmons and his staff have become adept at designing and building components from many common materials.
<P>
Recirculation aquaculture systems show promise for locations that either have limits on the size of a system or the quantity of water available.  As technology and management skills improve, it appears likely that we'll see more enterprises develop that concentrate on water reuse technology.

<H2>Seafood Technology Specialist Joins SGEP Staff</H2>
</CENTER>
Tom Rippen has joined the Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program staff as a Seafood Technology Specialist.  He will be based at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore in Princess Anne and will work primarily with the seafood processing industry.
<P>
Tom earned degrees in fisheries and food science from Michigan State and has spent the past fourteen years as a Cooperative Extension Service specialist at Virginia Tech and director of the Virginia Seafood Research and Extension Center in Hampton VA.  He has published articles on seafood pasteurization and sea scallop processing, and has authored two industry reference manuals on blue crab processing.  He gained a national reputation in seafood technology research and outreach and has been involved in many regional efforts including "Aquaculture In The Mid Atlantic", where he helped develop many of the programs aimed at seafood processing and quality.  He also was a principal educator in "Fish Tech", which trained many of this region's home economists in seafood quality, preparation, and nutrition.
<P>
The faculty of the Sea Grant Extension Program would like to welcome Tom to Maryland and we look forward to supporting his program activities.  He will be a contributor to the Maryland Aquafarmer, including information on the important area of seafood technology which impacts farm raised, as well as wild produced, species.

<H2>Food Safety Regulations Affect Aquaculture<BR>

<A NAME="USFDA"></A>
<H4>U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)</H4>
The U.S. FDA regulates the production and marketing of sea foods entering (or likely to enter) interstate commerce under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  As with other sea foods, the safety and wholesomeness of aquaculture products fall within FDA's purview.  The agency has announced its intentions to more aggressively monitor the aquaculture industry in the future, including proper use of approved therapeutics and prevention of product contamination with agricultural chemicals or pathogenic microorganisms.  Growers can expect to bear increased responsibility for documenting compliance with the Act.  Issues which may not at first appear to be of a product safety nature may, in fact, be very significant. For example, run-off from surrounding farmland into grow-out ponds may contaminate products with disease-causing bacteria or chemical contaminants.
<P>
<A NAME="HACCP"></A>
<H4>HACCP</H4>
Most business managers are familiar with quality assurance strategies such as Total Quality Management (TQM) and ISO 9000.  Whereas ISO 9000 is the international standard system for manufacturing industries, the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system is the international standard for the food industry.  Numerous national and international organizations have endorsed HACCP as the most effective and rational approach for achieving a safe food supply.
<P>
Under HACCP, processors identify potential food safety hazards and implement a system of controls and checks which reduces the probability of unsafe products reaching the consumer.  HACCP development involves a series of steps beginning with a thorough analysis of potential hazards (Hazard Analysis) at each processing operation, given the expected end-use of the product.  Steps which must be controlled to assure safety or other requirement are designated Critical Control Points (CCPs).  At these points (and only there) Critical Limits are established.  The appropriate parameters are Monitored to assure that these limits (such as product storage temperatures) are not exceeded.  Records are kept as documentation that the CCPs are under control.  When a critical limit is exceeded, a Corrective Action is taken and documented.  The final step is periodic Verification that the HACCP system is working.
<P>
<A NAME="SEVEN"></A>
<H4>Steps for Implementing the Seven Principles of HACCP</H4>
<UL> 
<LI>Assess Hazards -- include input from employees, advisors
<LI>Identify Critical Control Points (CCPs)
<LI>Define Critical Limits for CCPs -- e.g.. maximum value or range
<LI>Monitor CCPs -- usually  simple in-line measurements
<LI>Determine/Take Corrective Action -- e.g.. an adjustment or hold product for testing
<LI>Establish Record keeping System -- e.g.. pre-printed forms
<LI>Verify that the System is Working -- audits, product testing
</UL>
<A NAME="REGS"></A> 
<H4>Proposed Regulations</H4>
Most seafood processors are currently excluded from the prescriptive process controls and record-keeping requirements of the canned food industry, provided processors show evidence, satisfactory to the FDA, that they produce safe products processed under sanitary conditions.  However, this situation is expected to change in 1996 when FDA publishes regulations for a national mandatory HACCP-based inspection program for the seafood industry.  
<P>
In January 1994 FDA published proposed rulemaking (Federal Register vol. 59, no. 19) detailing the responsibilities of industry under mandatory HACCP inspection.  They also released guidelines and model HACCP plans to assist the seafood industry in developing HACCP systems acceptable to the agency.  Much of the proposal is very specific, including such areas as plant clean-up and employee practices previously covered only under the umbrella Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).  FDA would have access to HACCP records during inspections to determine if problems occurred prior to their visit and how those problems were resolved.  Even if no other problems are identified, an inadequate HACCP plan will likely constitute a violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
<P>
Comments solicited by the Federal Register announcement are under review and final rules should be published by early 1996.  Implementation is not expected until mid- to late 1996 and an additional one year phase in period is likely.  The actual requirements under HACCP vary according to the expectations of the responsible regulatory agency or company.  For example, corrective actions and verification procedures are usually predetermined during HACCP development but, in their proposed rules, FDA would not require them in the written plan.
<P>
Aquaculturists (growers) were excluded from FDA's HACCP proposal.  Also excluded were transporters (e.g.. trucking firms), and retail and food service sectors which are inspected by state and local agencies.  The proposal would place responsibility for HACCP on processors and importers.
<P>
Aquaculturists may question their need to develop an HACCP program given this expected exclusion. However, the issue is quite complex.  FDA's position is to conduct HACCP inspections at facilities of the type they currently inspect.  For this reason, they include warehouses and wholesale companies in their definition of "processor", even though these firms may not directly handle the product.  This policy allows FDA to inspect and intercept non-compliant products at some point in distribution.  It seems doubtful, therefore, that FDA will permit the direct sale of aquaculture products to end users without HACCP controls, even when each step (production and harvesting, trucking, retail) appears to be excluded.  For example, simply icing or boxing fish is likely to meet the definition of processing for inspection purposes.
<P>
Even if FDA does not directly inspect aquaculture facilities, they will require processors who receive aquaculture products to provide documentation that the products they purchase are under HACCP controls. This liability will almost certainly translate to an economic reality for producers:  buyers of seafood for processing plants and wholesale distribution companies may soon purchase only from suppliers who operate under HACCP.
<P>
Special provisions apply to molluscan shellfish, which come under the National Shellfish Sanitation Program, jointly administered by the FDA and designated state agencies.  This program will become more HACCP-like as it too, falls under the proposed HACCP inspection system. 
<P>
<A NAME="IMPLY"></A> 
<H4>Safety and Management Implications of HACCP</H4>
The extent of regulatory scrutiny and the complexity of HACCP plans is determined largely by the type of products produced.  Pathogenic bacteria and viruses are generally regarded as the greatest safety hazards in seafood.  Since adequate heating kills these microorganisms, ready-to-eat products and raw molluscan shellfish attract the most concern.  They are not normally cooked or fully reheated at time of consumption.
<P>
Any product which is deemed to be high risk, especially when it involves numerous, complex processing steps is likely to require extensive monitoring and Record keeping.  Complexity results from the number of potentially hazardous operations, or their interaction, which may be difficult to control.  Hazards are heightened, for example, by steps involving the combination of raw ingredients from various sources or reliance on multiple processing parameters to assure the destruction of pathogens.  Most processors will require assistance with assessing the food safety significance of value-added processing procedures, and with the identification of appropriate HACCP controls.
<P>
<A NAME="HAZARDS"></A> 
<H4>Hazards of Priority to Aquaculture</H4>
In the "Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide" FDA identifies three safety categories (chemical contamination, food and color additives, and aquaculture drugs) and three non-safety categories (filth, decomposition and parasites) which should be controlled in aquaculture.  Implicit in their comments is the need to implement HACCP at the grow-out site to control hazards, including the contamination of products with agricultural chemicals.
<P>
The agency identifies several pathogenic bacteria of concern in seafood including a few which are especially significant for aquaculturists:  Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and, Staphylococcus aureus.  The first three microorganisms are associated with ponds and other outdoor facilities.  C. botulinum is a soil organism which, under certain conditions, can produce the toxin responsible for botulism poisoning.  Listeria and Salmonella are often associated with the intestinal tracts of livestock and wildlife, including birds which may frequent ponds.  Individuals may also shed these bacteria.  Listeria is readily tracked into packing facilities on feet and adapts especially well to cool, moist areas such as storage coolers.  Staph. aureus is most commonly transferred to food by people during handling.  Other pathogens also should be considered during hazard analysis, and new organisms will emerge in the future.
<P>
As previously stated, FDA expects to hold processors responsible for products produced by aquaculture producers.  FDA anticipates that processors will periodically visit production sites and audit procedures.  They recommend that, before product is accepted, field agents review the grower's animal drug and medicated feed usage records and any veterinary prescriptions.  FDA also expects that products will be periodically tested for drug residues.
<P>
An aquaculture setting offers the potential for tight controls.  However, aquaculture products are not inherently safer or of higher quality than their wild harvest counterparts.  Only through effectively managed safety and quality assurance programs is this potential realized.  For liability reasons, the aquaculture industry is urged to be extremely cautious when promoting food safety as a marketing advantage.

Aquaculturists and others interested in the fish business would do well to get hold of a copy of the National Marine Fisheries Service annual fishery statistic report entitled "Fisheries of the United States, 1994 (NMFS, Current Fishery Statistics No. 9400, August, 1995).  The document is available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.  The phone number is 202-512-1800.
<P>
Examination of the information available in Fisheries of the United States reveals much about the trends and status of the fishing industry and its implications for the growth and development of aquaculture. For example, one can find that total U.S. fish landings were down ever so slightly (less than 0.1%) from the record 1993 landings.  However, the value fishermen received for their catch was up 11 percent over 1993, due to higher dockside prices.
<P>
The gap between imports and exports of edible seafood products increased to $3.5 billion in 1994, following several years of decrease.  The increase in the value of exports was more than offset by record imports.  Shrimp continues to dominate fishery imports, accounting for over 40 percent of the value of imports.  Salmon dominates the export market with over 22 percent of the export value.
<P>
Seafood consumption increased to 15.2 pounds per person in the United States in 1994, 0.2 pounds higher than in 1993.  This is still a full pound per person lower than the peak consumption in 1987, but it is still the highest since 1989.  The 0.2 pound increase was accounted for by fresh and frozen product, while canned and cured consumption remained level.  Of the fresh and frozen product, fillets and steaks increased 0.2 pounds, and the ubiquitous shrimp increased 0.1 pound to a record 2.6 pounds per person.  These increases were slightly offset by a 0.1 pound per person decline in fish sticks and portions consumption.
<P>
Aquaculture production and value information is not available in Fisheries of the United States, but it contains a wealth of information about the marketplace in which aquaculture competes.

Currently the possession or stocking of grass carp (<I>Ctenopharyngodon idella</I>) in Maryland is illegal, yet there is considerable interest in using the species as a means to control nuisance aquatic vegetation. At a recent meeting of the Maryland Aquaculture Advisory Committee there was a special session devoted to the pros and cons associated with the introduction of grass carp  as a biological control for aquatic vegetation in Maryland ponds.  Speakers presented their perspectives about the potential or concerns of introducing grass carp into Maryland.  I provided an overview on the biology and ecological requirements of the species while the others, including Dr. Bob Bachman, Maryland DNR; Mary Jo Garreis, Maryland Department of the Environment; Ernie Tresselt and Andy Gillis, representatives of Maryland's aquaculture industry; and John Sproch of Pennsylvania and Hugh Warren of the Catfish Farmers of America, as representatives of industry interests outside Maryland, presented specific points of view.  
<P>
The meeting brought to light many misconceptions and concerns about the species and people came away with a better understanding about the <B>potential</B> of grass carp as an effective biological control as well as the <B>damage</B> they can bring if stocked in the wrong situations or allowed to escape into the natural waters of the state.  The primary theme of the meeting was that live diploid (reproductively viable) grass carp should not be allowed in the state for biological control purposes. The following text is a compilation of my presentation, and excepts taken from the presentations of several of the speakers.
<P>
<A NAME="LIFE"></A>
<H4>Life History of Grass Carp</H4>
The grass carp (<I>Ctenopharyngodon idella</I>) is a native of China from the Amur River south.  This is why many culturists of the fish for food purposes euphemistically refer to this fish as the White amur instead of labeling it with the negative connotation usually associated with carp species in the U.S.  As a carp, it is a member of the minnow family, Cyprinidae, along with its cousins, the common carp, goldfish, and many other minnows.
<P>
Introduced in the U.S. in 1963 by researchers at Auburn University and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the fish was sought as a means to biologically control noxious aquatic vegetation in lieu of the "more hazardous alternative -- chemicals."  By 1972, the fish had been introduced (legally or illegally) into 40 states, and now is known to reproduce in the Mississippi and Missouri River systems with reports of reproduction occurring in the Trinity River-Galveston Bay system in Texas.  They have been found in Chesapeake Bay waters in the tidal Potomac, James, Mattaponi, and Cohansey Rivers, and in the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.
<P>
Grass carp are a hardy, highly migratory, eurythermic (able to live in a wide variety of temperatures), herbivorous species of fish that normally is found in freshwater systems.  However, the species tolerates salinities up to 17.5 parts per thousand (ppt) for short periods of time and can live in salinities less than 9 ppt, although they do not grow well or reproduce at those salinities.  The fish is also very tolerant to poor water quality conditions in that the lethal range of dissolved oxygen is in the 0.3-0.4 parts per million range. As a migratory species, the fish will leave static ponds or rivers if the opportunity presents itself and will move both upstream and downstream of their original stocking location.  That is why screened barriers, even on emergency spillways, are a crucial management strategy.
<P>
In the southern U.S., the males mature in two years while the females mature by age three.  Spawning normally occurs during springtime when river temperatures reach 19-20 C (66-68F).  The fish require moving water for the eggs to hatch.  Classified as pelagic spawners, the fish move upstream during early spring and, when the conditions are right, they release their eggs, which are then fertilized in the open water column.  
<P>
Under culture conditions, a mature female produces an average of 820,000 eggs, or about 60,000 eggs per kilogram of body weight.  When the eggs are first released they are about 1.2 millimeters in diameter and, as long as there is flowing water, the eggs will float.  Because of this "semipelagic" condition, the eggs require long stretches of flowing river water to allow them to hatch.  If the water flow stops, due to the nature of the eggs being slightly heavier than water, they will sink to the river bottom and die from oxygen depletion or be covered with silt.  
<P>
In general, hatching time is temperature dependent, and at 19C (66F) the eggs need about 112 river miles of uninterrupted flow or about 40 hours to hatch if the flow rate is about 3.8 feet per second.  Yet, at 28C (83F) the eggs need only about 31 miles of river flow at about 3 feet per second or about 11 hours to hatch.  Using this information, the only Maryland river that would probably support reproduction of grass carp would be the Potomac because all the other rivers are very short or are tidally influenced and the first slack tide will probably result in the eggs sinking to the bottom.  There is a valid empirical argument that due to the salinity of some of the rivers changing the specific gravity of the water it may be possible for the eggs to remain afloat until the tide turns, in which case the Susquehanna River below Conowingo Dam may be another system that could support reproduction.  However, this argument is purely academic as, to my knowledge, no one has looked at the effects differing specific gravities of the water have on suspension of the egg.
<P>
When the eggs hatch the larvae are around 1/4 of an inch long and white in color.   This white coloration and the fact that they have a proclivity to school in large groups, coupled with their initial poor swimming capabilities, make them very susceptible to predation from largemouth bass, catfish, white perch, and a host of other predators.  However, the fish is very fast growing and can quickly outsize a predator susceptibility range.  The record grass carp is recorded in excess of 110 pounds, although the more common sizes are 25 pounds or less.  Triploid grass carp, although they are reproductively sterile (see below and accompanying article on Biotechnology in Aquaculture),  usually do not grow as big as their diploid counterparts and usually only live a few years.
<P>
<A NAME="FOOD"></A>
<H4>Food Habits</H4>
Grass carp are very effective herbivores and consume a large variety of vascular plants and some algae and, stocked at very high densities, can completely eradicate the vegetation from a given system --dependent on the size of the system, the plant species present, and the number of grass carp present.
<P>
In the early life stages, grass carp feed on small planktonic animals such as copepods and <I>Daphnia</I> . As they grow, they switch to planktonic and filamentous algae, then to more fleshy plants such as <I>Hydrillia</I>  by the time they are juveniles.  
<P>
Grass carp have specialized structures in their throats called pharyngeal teeth that grind together as plant material passes through them and breaks the food into small particles.  This grinding action affords an efficient means for the fish to digest important nutrients found in food because, for an herbivore, grass carp have a very short digestive tract and they process and eliminate food quickly.  Using the pharyngeal teeth and digestive system, the fish is able to digest 60-70% of the nutrients eaten, however, actual assimilation of the entire plant matter is poor, ranging from less than 30% to as high as 70% depending on the species of plant consumed.  Poor assimilation efficiency is one of the ecological concerns in that it releases a considerable amount of partially digested plant material into the water that can cause water quality problems when the plant starts to decay.
<P>
Feeding begins when water temperature is around 52F and is optimal between 68-86F.  Small fish prefer small or soft stemmed plants such as duckweed and soft pond algae, while older fish accept more fibrous plants.  In general, a fish less than 6 pounds will eat close to 100% of its body weight per day, while a fish over 12 pounds will eat less than 26% of its body weight per day.  They feed very little to not at all in the absence of preferred food or under crowded conditions.
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, grass carp are not indiscriminate feeders, in fact they are very selective in their food choices.  These choices depend on a variety of factors such as geographical location of the fish; size, age, and density of the fish; system composition and density of the plants; and water quality.
<P>
In general, grass carp prefer <I>Hydrilla, Elodea, Egeria, Potamogeton</I>   (common pondweeds such as sago pondweed and redhead grass), watermilfoils (except Eurasian), duckweed, watermeal, bladderwort, coontail, the naiads, and filamentous algae.  They do not like tough waxy-type plants such as water lilies, water pennyworts, lotus, cattails; <I>Ludwigia</I>  ; Eurasian watermilfoil; and occasionally tape grass or wild celery. One problem with the more waxy-type plants is that since grass carp do not have teeth in the front of the mouth they cannot bit off pieces of larger-leafed plants and therefore cannot get the plant leaf into the back of their throat where the pharyngeal teeth are situated.  Thus, these plants are rarely eaten.
<P>
Due to their selectivity, grass carp will feed very little to not at all on non-preferred aquatic plants until all or nearly all of the more preferred species are eliminated.  They will simultaneously graze on several species of plants at the same preference level.  They will not actively seek out animal prey (beyond the larval stage), but will consume them in the absence of plant matter or if they are incidental to the vegetation they are consuming.
<P>
One of the problems with feeding selectivity is that the non-targeted species can overachieve and grow at a pace much faster than they would have if the preferred species had not been cropped at all.  The corollary to this faster compensatory growth is that you have to stock higher levels of grass carp to control the fast growing non-preferred species.  At the much higher stocking rates the control of non-preferred plants can be achieved but the ecological risk is much greater.
<P>
<A NAME="CONCERN"></A>
<H4>Ecological Concerns</H4>
One of the biggest questions that needs to be answered in Maryland before consideration can be given to allow the use of grass carp as an effective biological control is if there are viable alternatives that serve the same purpose without the potential environmental risk that grass carp pose.  Unfortunately there is no clear cut answer to that question because the only real viable option is chemical control which, like grass carp, poses a considerable environmental risk if used improperly.  Compounding the chemical problem is the fact that many of the places where an effective biological control is preferred over chemical control are those places where the water is being used for irrigation purposes.  Obviously, you cannot use an herbicide in a golf course irrigation pond or in a pond from which a farmer is watering his crops or livestock.  
<P>
So there are certain situations where chemical control is not a viable option and mechanical control (physically removing the vegetation) is not feasible either.  Therefore biological control may be the best answer, yet, with biological control, the most obvious concern is the potential eradication of all plant material from the pond.  Aquatic plants are part of the natural ecology of an aquatic ecosystem and are needed in certain percentages to keep the natural balance of the environment.  Also plants are the primary source of oxygen production in ponds upon which all animal life depends for survival, and act as a protective haven for small fish and insects from larger predators.  Thus eradication of all the plants places the entire aquatic ecosystem in danger.
<P>
The ecological effect grass carp have on a system is dependent on many factors, most importantly is whether or not the target plant is a preferred species, whether or not the plants are at a high or low biomass, and whether the system has a historical record of lush growths.  Low stocking rates on high plant biomass can result in the target plant spreading or increasing density such as what happens to ornamental shrubbery once it is pruned.  Likewise, if the target plant is one of the non-palatable or nonpreferred species, the effect of these plants is magnified because of the elimination of other plant competitors for the naturally limited availability of nutrients and space. Thus stocking rates sufficient to control non-palatable target plants will result in substantial impacts to both submersed and emersed flora.  Other concerns include the direct competition grass carp would have on species of animals that have overlapping food habits such as waterfowl, or that depend on the vegetated habitat for protection, growth, and reproduction, such as sportfish.
<P>
If the stocking rate is high enough and the target plant species is a preferred plant, grass carp can ultimately eliminate all the plants in the system causing dramatic imbalances in the natural ecology. Likewise, inefficiency in digestion can lead to water quality problems.  Together these changes in the aquatic plant community can affect the overall ecology of the community, by increasing phytoplankton and filamentous algae production resulting in increased "turbidity" which, in turn, further reduces plant growth because of shading.
<P>
Conversely, if the target species is a highly palatable plant and of relatively minor composition of the abundant and diverse plant community, then it may be possible to effect control by using a relatively low stocking rate.
<P>
<A NAME="MGMT"></A>
<H4>Management Strategies</H4>
Although there is a sound management strategy for stocking rates of grass carp in relation to the species and density of plant biomass, because it is illegal to stock grass carp in Maryland, discussing the management strategies and stocking recommendations is irrelevant.  Maryland's DNR is the agency responsible for the protection and management of our state's natural resources and at this time they feel that the risks posed by grass carp (even triploids) outweigh any advantage the fish may provide.  Therefore, until state resource managers change their mind about the grass carp's status, it is highly advisable not to stock the fish in Maryland.  Use other alternatives and consult with your county extension office, Maryland's Departments of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and/or the Environment about what options are available to you for controlling and managing aquatic vegetation in your ponds.

<H2>Biotechnology In Aquaculture:<BR>
 Production Of Triploid Fish<BR>
by Reginal M. Harrell, Aquaculture<BR>
 and Biotechnology Specialist
</H2>
</CENTER>
We often read or hear about fast growing sterile fish called "triploids."  What exactly are they, and do they perform as well as claimed?  The first part of the question is easy to answer, the second appears to depend on the species and situation.
<P>
Triploids are fish or hybrids that have been genetically manipulated to possess an extra set of chromosomes (the structures found in cells that contains all the genetic material that makes an organism what it is).  Almost all plants and animals have only two sets of chromosomes -- one set from the mother and one set from the father.  Triploids have been artificially manipulated to contain three sets of chromosomes -- usually two from the mother, and one from the father.  The creation of triploids is the type of chromosomal manipulation with which most aquaculturists are familiar.  This technology has created fish farming industries, such as the triploid grass carp in the Southeastern United States.
<P>
The reasons for originally creating triploids were sound.  In theory, because the triploid has three sets (an odd number) of chromosomes, when it came time for the fish to mature and develop reproductive products (eggs and sperm collectively known as gametes), the odd number of chromosomes would cause mispairings and misalignments during the gamete formation process, and result in failure of the sexual product to form.  Thus, the organism would be functionally sterile.  Also, in theory, because the fish would be sterile, all the energy (food) taken in by a triploid would be used directly to meet the organism's normal everyday requirements to survive (metabolic functions) and to grow.  The energetic intake would not be split between and normal metabolism, growth, and the formation and maturation of the reproductive system.  Triploid fish should grow faster than normal diploids because part of a diploid's energy intake is partitioned into reproduction.
<P>
Because fertilization occurs externally for most species of fish it is relatively easy to manipulate the chromosome number.  Techniques have been developed to produce haploid (one set of chromosomes), triploid (three sets), and tetraploid (four sets) fish and even produce fish whose chromosomes come solely from the mother (gynogens) or father (androgens).  
<P>
The techniques that are used to alter the chromosome number are similar and can be divided into three categories: <B>temperature, pressure, and chemical shocks</B>.  Most researchers use temperature or pressure with the exception of shellfish culturists.  These physical shocks are applied to eggs that are newly fertilized (See Figure 1).
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="triploid.gif" ALT="[triploid diagram]">
An unfertilized egg has two complete sets of chromosomes -- one in the egg nucleus and one in the second polar body (a remnant set of chromosomes that are left over from earlier egg maturation and development processes).  Under normal conditions, when an egg is fertilized, the second polar body is discarded and the single set of haploid (<B>1n in Figure 1</B>) chromosomes from the sperm unites with the single set of haploid chromosomes (1n) in the egg nucleus and a diploid (<B>2n or two sets of chromosomes</B>) state is established.  In triploid induction, the second polar body is forcibly retained in the egg and contributes its haploid set of chromosomes (<B>1n in the Figure 1</B>) to the fusion of the sperm and egg nucleus. Consequently, the fertilized egg will contain three haploid nuclei: one from the egg nucleus, one from the sperm, and one from the second polar body.  The three haploid nuclei will fuse to form a triploid zygote nucleus which creates a triploid organism (<B>3n in Figure 1</B>).  
<P>
The second polar body is forcibly retained by one of the three types of shock mentioned above.  In pressure treatments, pressure chambers are used to apply the shocks.  These devices range from cylinders attached to a mechanically operated screw-press to those controlled by computers.  Pressures used to shock eggs range from 7,000 to 10,000 psi for several minutes.
<P>
Temperature baths are more frequently used to shock eggs.  Both cold and warm temperatures can be used to alter ploidy number.  Although both warm and cold shocks can be used for either warm or cold water fishes, heat shocks seem to have produced the better results from coldwater species, while cold shocks seem to have produced better results in warmwater species.  In general, the temperature needed to produce the best results is near the lethal limit for that species.  The temperature needed to alter chromosome number is quite precise, so it is important that both water bath volume and temperature control mechanisms are sufficient to prevent temperature fluctuations while the eggs are being shocked.
<P>
Cytostatic chemicals such as cytochalsin-B are theoretically suitable for chromosome set manipulation and have been used frequently in shellfish production however, it appears to be unsuitable for use on fish eggs.  The complex membranes of fish eggs appear to act as a barrier to the chemicals.
<P>
Lastly, triploids can be created de facto by crossing a tetraploid with a diploid producing offspring that have three sets of chromosomes.  The direction will, of course, depend on which sex has the tetraploid set of chromosomes making a diploid pronucleus.  To avoid confusion with triploids created by the interference of meiosis (forcing retention of the second polar body), triploids created in this manner are called <B>interploid triploids</B>.
<P>
In general, the exact timing of treatment after fertilization is not critical, but the window of opportunity is narrower at higher incubation temperatures.  This is compatible with cytological observations in developing eggs.  Higher temperatures are also used for short periods, and duration of these is critical for survival of the eggs -- at low temperatures the duration of treatment is not critical.
<P>
The critical features of the techniques for chromosome set manipulation to produce triploids are (a) the nature of the post-fertilization shock treatment, (b) the timing and duration of this treatment, and (c) the species of fish to be manipulated.
<P>
In summary, triploids should be larger than their diploid counterparts because the cell size is larger; the nucleus contains 33% more genes for growth; and triploids reportedly do not divert energy for growth into gamete production, reproduction, or care of young.  Unfortunately, improved growth is not 100%.  Even when growth was  monitored after sexual maturity, which is when superior growth should be expressed, some triploids do not produce the expected growth bonus. 
<P>
However, more importantly and more successfully, triploids are created to produce sterile fish so that a species that might cause adverse environmental impacts can be cultured on farms or used in natural resource management.   The grass carp is a good example where triploidy induction has thus far achieved those goals.

<H2>Aquatic Vegetation Management Tip</H2>
</CENTER>
Have you ever heard someone say,  "If a pound of treatment is good then two pounds will be twice as good"?  This could not be further from the truth when it comes to applying herbicides to control or manage aquatic vegetation, or for that matter any use of chemical control whether they be for aquatic or terrestrial use.  The recommendations that come with the labels on each container of herbicide are there for a reason. They have been carefully researched and should be adhered to closely.  Follow the recommendations so you will not be the one responsible for causing a fish kill either in your pond or downstream.  Indiscriminate use of chemicals will probably be much more expensive in the long-run and you will likely not achieve better control of your nuisance plants.
<P>
Remember, you need to have permits to apply herbicides in Maryland.  In order to obtain one, you need to properly identify the nuisance aquatic plant and plan to use the appropriate control agent.  In all instances, remember to <B>read and follow the label</B>.  Contact your local County Extension office or District Soil and Water Conservation office for further information.

<H2>Farm Pond Management Tip</H2>
</CENTER>
Fall is the time to apply lime to your ponds to assist in improving productivity.  Proper pond and soil pH helps the fertilizers you apply in the springtime be more available for the plankton responsible for the desired blooms.  If applied at the proper rate, allowing the lime to interact with the pond's current soil structure and chemistry, should provide stability by the spring.  If you have not yet taken soil samples from your ponds to get liming recommendations <B>do it now</B> so you will have time to apply the lime so it will be available to the pond by next spring.  Soil sample bags can be obtained from your local County Extension office.  Be sure to mark "Farm Pond" on the outside of the bag.

<A NAME="ZEBRA"></A>
<H2><I>Zebra Mussels</I>  : A Concern To Agriculture<BR>
by Dan Terlizzi, Water Quality Specialist</H2>
</CENTER>
Zebra mussels are natives of Europe and western Asia that were introduced into the Great Lakes from ballast water discharge in 1986.  Since their discovery in 1988 they have spread rapidly throughout the Great Lakes, the Mississippi and Hudson rivers and now threaten the Chesapeake region.  Zebra mussels are fresh water fouling agents and can interfere with any use of water including municipal water, power generation, or industrial water intakes.  In addition, zebra mussels can have severe environmental impacts by interfering with food chains and competing with native species.  Agriculture is no exception, and it is fair to say that any agricultural use of surface water, in particular aquaculture, is likely to be impacted in areas of zebra mussel infestation.
<P>
For the past three years, with funding from NOAA National Office of Sea Grant, Maryland Sea Grant has been preparing for the arrival of Zebra Mussels in the Mid Atlantic region.  A large part of this effort has been directed at educational activities including fact sheets, identification cards, posters and public presentations to increase public awareness of the problem.  Most of these activities have been undertakes cooperatively with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to avoid duplication and make the most effective use of funding.  Zebra mussel impacts on the environment and municipal water supplies have been emphasized previously and we will continue addressing these topics, however other areas of concern like agriculture will be emphasized in future efforts.
<P>
Agricultural activities dependant on surface water in the Chesapeake region are likely to be impacted by zebra mussels.  The developing aquaculture industry, for example, includes fresh water ponds that are fertile, have high lime content, and high concentrations of phytoplankton (microscopic plants), all of which favor the growth of zebra mussels.  Fish culturists routinely depend on pumping and aeration devices to maintain water quality that are likely targets of zebra mussel invasion.  Piping to supply water to overhead irrigation systems are also a concern.  In the former Soviet Union, clogging of irrigation pipes by zebra mussels has been a problem for some time.
<P>
Agriculture is at a significant disadvantage compared to other water users like municipal water systems since effective and relatively inexpensive treatment like chlorine cannot be applied at the point of intake to prevent zebra mussel fouling.  Irrigation systems would require expensive dechlorination before irrigation water could safely be applied to crops.  Natural controls for zebra mussels in agricultural applications do not appear to be promising.  Water chemistry of irrigation systems includes high ammonia and low oxygen that were hoped to interfere with zebra mussels but so far do not appear to prevent zebra mussel fouling. Biological control agents like the black carp are known to eat zebra mussels, but are as controversial as the grass carp which is used for aquatic weed control (see article entitled <A HREF="#CARP">Grass Carp: A Biological and Ecological Overview</A> in this issue), and are not likely to be accepted readily into the Chesapeake region.
<P>
When zebra mussels do arrive in this area it appears that options to agriculture will be limited to switching to ground water or using sand filters as in drip or trickle irrigation systems.  In areas infested with zebra mussels, knowledge of peak times of abundance and high fouling risk will enable farmers to avoid surface water that could lead to clogged irrigation systems.

<H2>
U.S. Fisheries Flat in 1995<BR>
Doug Lipton, Marine Economic Specialist
</H2>
</CENTER>

According to the National Marine Fisheries Service  (<I>Fisheries of the United States 1995</I>  ) the supply of edible fish on the U.S. market was down slightly in 1995, compared to the previous year. Landings of edible fish and imports amounted to 13.7 billion pounds. A decline from the previous year in  landings of 153 million pounds was partially offset by an increase in imports of 139 million pounds. The rise in seafood imports brought the total value of imported product to $6.79 billion in 1995, though there was also a slight rise in seafood exports to $3.26 billion.
<P>
Per capita consumption dipped back to 15.0 pounds per person from the previous 15.2 pounds. After tremendous growth in the 1980s, per capita consumption has remained at around 15.0 pounds in the 1990s. The decline in per capita seafood consumption was mainly for fresh and frozen products, which fell 0.4 pounds. Canned and cured seafood consumption was up 0.1 pounds for canned salmon and 0.1 pounds for canned tuna. Within the fresh and frozen category, per capita consumption was down 0.2 pounds for fillets and steaks,  though it rose 0.3 pounds for fish sticks and portions. Per capita consumption of shrimp was also down 0.1 pounds.
<P>
Fishermen's revenues from 1994 to 1995 showed little change.  Ex-vessel prices (the price paid to fishermen at the dock) were up only 1.5% which was not enough to keep up with the overall rate of inflation of 2.8%.  Since the decline in edible fish landings was around 2%, the price rise was not enough to compensate, and revenues fell 0.5%.
<P>
Although 1995 will go down as an uneventful year in the aggregate U.S. seafood market, there are indications that without aquaculture products, the situation could be a lot worse. For example, tilapia imports increased 34% in value over 1994 imports with a total imported value of $34.1 million. As recently as 1992, tilapia imports were only $6.1 million.

<A NAME="AGENT"></A>
<H2>New Sea Grant Extension Agent In Southern Maryland</H2>
</CENTER>
Jackie Takacs has joined the Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program as its newest marine agent.  She will be stationed at the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES) Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) in Solomons Island, Maryland, where she will undertake outreach programs in aquaculture and other marine-related issues.  
<P>
According to Doug Lipton, Coordinator of the Sea Grant Extension Program, "Jackie's experience with both shellfish and finfish aquaculture will be a tremendous help as we work on oyster restoration and other projects in Southern Maryland."  Lipton says that Jackie will be able, for example, to help the state as it attempts to get the most out of the oyster hatchery at Piney Point.
<P>
Ken Tenore, marine scientist and head of CBL, is excited about the new position.  "CBL has its roots in Southern Maryland," he says, "and this gives us a chance to work with other parts of the University to mount a new outreach effort in this part of the state."
<P>
Jackie will begin her new job on November 4 and can be reached at CBL (410-326-7356).  Jackie replaces Rich Bohn, who left Sea Grant Extension to become the executive director of the National Aquaculture Association.  The Sea Grant Extension Program is a joint effort of the Maryland Sea Grant College and the Cooperative Extension Service, in cooperation with the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, the Columbus Center, and other partners.

<H2>
Oyster Habitat Restoration in Severn River<BR>
Robert Pfeiffer, Executive Director<BR>Oyster Recovery Partnership  
</H2>
</CENTER>
A long-range project to restore oyster populations in the Severn River will provide habitat for invertebrate and vertebrate species, many of which have a recreational value. The restoration effort, undertaken by the Oyster Recovery Partnership, in cooperation with the United States Naval Academy, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the Severn River Association and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES), will also demonstrate the value of the oyster to improving water quality in this heavily developed river.
<P>
There are 813 acres of charted, natural oyster bottom in the Severn that are closed to public harvest as established in the 1993 Maryland Oyster Roundtable Action Plan. The first area to receive oysters is the Old Fort Bar located at the junction of Carr's Creek and the Severn River in front of the Naval Experiment Station.
<P>
The oyster seed was produced at the CEES  Horn Point Environmental Lab hatchery.   In August they were transported by truck to a nursery area on Mill Creek, north of Greenbury Point, where they were protected from predators and allowed to grow in the nutrient-rich waters of the creek. In late October, midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy loaded the bags of seed oysters onto boats belonging to members of the Anne Arundel Watermen's Association and moved the seed, between 1/4 to 1/2 million oysters, to the Old Fort Bar.
<P>

<H2>
Feature: Pond Management in Maryland:<BR>Part II, Harvesting your Pond<BR>
Reginal M. Harrell, Finfish Aquaculture Specialist
</H2>
</CENTER>
Part I of Pond Management in Maryland: "Species Considerations and Pond Stocking" appeared in the <A HREF="Spring96.html">Spring 1996</A> issue of Maryland Aquafarmer.  It covered such topics as stocking procedures, selecting and obtaining the proper fish, and species profiles. Part I and past issues of Aquafarmer are on the worldwide web: <A HREF="index.html">
http://www.mdsg.edu/MDSG/Extension/Aquafarmer/index.html</A>
<P>
Why would you go about managing a farm pond for recreational fishing if you aren't going to fish it?  The goal of managing a farm pond, therefore, is to provide good fishing opportunities.  Surprisingly, however, this cannot be accomplished without control and management of the fishing pressure.  Fish removal is a necessity for the pond to remain in balance.  Balance means that there is the proper ratio of predators to prey at all trophic, or nutritional levels.  In other words, there must be plenty of food (i.e., insects, and small aquatic organisms like worms) for the bream (species such as bluegill and redear sunfish) to eat, there must be plenty of bream for the largemouth bass to eat, and there must be enough bass to control the bream reproduction potential.  To effectively accomplish this task, you need a harvest plan as part of your overall management scheme. 
<P>
Let's examine a proper management schedule for harvesting your pond.  Assuming that you have followed the previous recommendations (Aquafarmer, Spring 1996) and reclaimed your pond or you have just filled a new pond, then you are ready to stock your fish. Stock bluegill, redear, and hybrid sunfish in the fall of the first year, and largemouth bass in the spring of the second year.  You should not begin fishing the largemouth until the third year, when they reach at least 14 inches.  You can fish the bluegill and redear population the first summer following the fall stocking.  
<P>
Be careful: you can easily overharvest, especially the bass, when you first begin fishing your pond, so make sure you that don't take too many large bream the first year and that the bass have reached maturity and spawned at least once before you start removing them from the pond.  Likewise, never remove largemouth bass less than 14 inches in size as they are very aggressive feeders and help maintain the proper balance between the bass and the bluegill.  If you catch a bass under 14 inches, carefully handle and release it while the fish is still in the water.  Do not take the fish out of the pond and do not hold it -- you increase the risk of hurting the fish and making it susceptible to disease.
<P>
To maintain a balanced pond, once you have begun harvesting you can safely remove four to five pounds of bream for every pound of largemouth bass taken.  In a nonfertilized pond with agricultural run-off, such harvesting equates to about 20 to 25 pounds of bass per acre per year and 80 to 100 pounds of bluegill and redear.  In a completely nonfertilized pond, the bass harvest rate drops to 10 to 15 pounds and about 40 pounds of bream per acre per year. In a fertilized pond managed for maximum yield, you can take about 30 to 35 pounds of bass per acre each year, which would relate to 120 to 160 pounds of bream per acre per year (see table).  
<P>

In a Fertilized Farm Pond</B><BR>
<HR>
</TD>
<TD ROWSPAN=8 VALIGN=CENTER ALIGN=LEFT>
During the first year of fishing a fertilized pond, you should not take more than about 80 pounds of harvestable bluegill (about 320 fish) per acre, though after the first year, you can increase that harvest level to the 150 to 160 pound range (about 600 to 700 fish).  Harvest the channel catfish, hybrid sunfish, hybrid striped bass, and rainbow trout at whatever rate you desire because these fish are replenished by restocking, not reproduction.
<P>
Once the fish reproduction is well established in the pond (second to third year) all bream caught should be removed from the pond since they reproduce rapidly.  Remember, bluegills can reproduce two to four times a year, and if there are not plenty of bass available to feed on them, the only bluegill that will grow to harvestable size are the ones that were initially stocked.

<P>
If too many bluegill survive, they can prevent bass from spawning successfully: bluegill enter bass nests and eat the eggs while bass are off chasing other bluegill away. Eventually all the eggs can be eaten and the bass spawn could fail.  In addition, because so many small bluegill are feeding on the same size and types of food, none of them get enough to eat and therefore do not grow larger than four inches.  Thus, undersize bluegill should not be returned back to the pond.  
<P>
Spread your harvesting throughout the entire fishing season and do not take too many adult fish, especially bass, early in the season--otherwise you will overcrowd bluegill. Keep good records of your harvests and ask friends who fish your pond to do so as well.  Once your annual harvest quota for largemouth is met, you should simply release any largemouth you catch, regardless of the size.  Include in your harvest records the number of non-bass and bluegill caught so you will have an idea of when you need to restock.

Fall is the time to control your large grassy aquatic plants such as sedges, rushes, and <I>Phragmities</I>   (Common Reed) and cat tails.  While herbicides can be used on these plants anytime during the growing season, it is best to treat them once this plant "heads-out" or flowers.

<H2>Student Aquaculture Project at the<BR>Columbus Center, Baltimore<BR>
J. Adam Frederick, Extension Education Specialist
</H2>
</CENTER>
Under the direction of award-winning teacher Bob Foor-Hogue, students at South Carroll High School in Carroll County, Maryland,  have designed innovative aquaculture systems in a science research course.  The aquaculture projects provide a means for studying aquatic systems while integrating other subjects like engineering, math, computer aided drafting, and writing. The unique curriculum allows students  to solve practical problems while working as part of a team. The aquaculture projects have been used to teach fundamental concepts about water quality, raising fish for restocking local streams, and practicing techniques like tagging and anesthetizing fish. 
<P>
Students at South Carroll High School have designed and built seven aquaculture systems, ranging in size from 150 gallons to 550 gallons. Students design the systems using computer aided drafting with three-dimensional graphics, and they produce their own multimedia programs including animations. In addition, the students write their own grants to support the funding for these projects and have successfully procured money each school year. This is science at its best.
<P>
For the Columbus Center, Bob Foor-Hogue and his students will incorporate a student designed aquaculture exhibit that will be constructed in the second phase of the Hall of Exploration opening. The exhibit will feature three model systems for highlighting the aquaculture research at the Center of Marine Biotechnology and the student-based research at South Carroll High School-- it will also illustrate how aquaculture provides an exciting way to study many aspects of science. The exhibit will also feature the restocking and wetland preservation work performed by the students in the field. Visitors to the Hall will be able to see a "work in progress" as students and teachers collaborate in constructing and stocking the systems with such fish as yellow perch, trout and shad.
<P>

<A NAME="TOUR"></A>
<H2>Aquaculture Tour to Virginia and North Carolina<BR>
Steve Bogash, Sea Grant Faculty Extension Assistant
</H2>
</CENTER>
On April 29 and 30, 1996, Maryland Sea Grant Extension organized a van trip of potential aquaculturists to the aquaculture research operations at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, and the University of North Carolina Hendersonville and to a commercial producer near Asheville. The purpose was to observe aquaculture efforts at these facilities in an effort to enhance the development of aquaculture enterprises in Western Maryland and the surrounding region. 
<P>
While Virginia Tech's facility was undergoing reconstruction after a serious fire, the staff was outfitting the new facility to directly compare three different types of biofilters. Though much of the work at Virginia Tech will continue to focus on tilapia, researchers are also examining the potential of more exotic species such as paku. The paku has all the endearing looks of a piranha but has evolved to eat the fruits and nuts that fall into South American rivers. While our group was there, the paku were consuming zucchini squash. A graduate student was also running a study on the candy stripe darter, attempting to induce breeding while in captivity. 
<P>
Jeff Hinshaw was our host at the North Carolina Hendersonville Research Facility.  Ongoing work focuses on atlantic salmon, freshwater prawns and yellow perch. The prawns and Atlantic salmon are part of a  cooperative research project with the nearby Biltmore Estate on their 40 acre  reservoir. The 25,000 acre estate has a goal of producing as much of the food for their restaurant as possible. The estate is also producing several thousand pounds of rainbow trout in large net pens on the same reservoir. This is also the site of the most elegant floating dock system this writer has ever seen. The docks are constructed of stainless steel covered styrofoam interlocking sections. They are wide, easy to work on and one of the most beautiful cases of pure overkill ever. 
<P>
The driving force for the trip was to visit a producer in the hills just outside Asheville, North Carolina.  Working with local regulatory authorities and UNC aquaculture staff, the producer has constructed a concrete stepped raceway system that consists of two parallel stepped runs. The system currently produces over 70,000 pounds of rainbow trout a year with only minimal energy inputs. All aeration comes from water falling approximately three feet through screens between sections in the raceways. Waste is collected in a basin at the exit to each section and periodically vacuumed out to a settling tank. From the settling tank the waste is pumped to a sand filter composter. The treated water is then returned to a settling pond before returning to the stream from which the water was originally drawn upstream. This system has huge potential for sections of far Western Maryland and the surrounding region.
<P>

<A NAME="ALGAE"></A>
<H2>Toxic Algae and Aquaculture<BR>
Dan Terlizzi, Water Quality Specialist
</H2>
</CENTER>
When a fish farmer has spent months raising his crop to near market size and then watches helplessly as the fish float dead to the surface, it is a devastating loss, exceeding the value of the fish. Tony Mazzaccaro, owner and manager of Hyrock Farms, recently suffered a major fish kill, possibly due to 
Pfiesteria piscicida, the so-called "phantom" dinoflagellate, a fish killer discovered several years ago in North Carolina, 
<P>
Toxic algae, including Pfiesteria, have made the news recently, in the New York Times as well as in the mid-Atlantic region. They pose serious risks to human health and to aquaculture. And they occur frequently enough to emphasize the need for a better scientific understanding of the factors that 
influence their growth so that we can more effectively manage fresh water and  estuarine environments. 
<P>
Throughout the world, the frequency of algal blooms, among them, toxic species, seems to be increasing. Reports in aquaculture publications on fish loss from such blooms have become commonplace. For some years, various flagellates, including dinoflagellates, have been appearing in areas where they were not previously seen.  In 1987, for instance, the first recorded instance of human illness related to a diatom toxin, demoic acid, was observed in Nova Scotia; in California in 1991, there were reports of pelican deaths which were attributed to the pelicans feeding on anchovies that had accumulated demoic acid from diatoms. Even algal species that do not release toxins can pose problems to fish if the blooms are dense enough. Chaetoceros, a widely distributed group of diatoms common in the Chesapeake and known for having long and sharp cactus-like spines, can injure the gills of fish at high bloom densities.
<P>
Whether the fish kill at Hyrock Farms was the result of Pfiesteria or other dinoflatellate species, it should focus our attention on the problem of algal management in aquaculture systems in estuarine and marine waters. With help from Maryland Sea Grant and working in cooperation with researchers in North Carolina, plans are in development to prevent introductions of Pfiesteria from the estuarine supply waters to production ponds at Hyrock. The goal is to eliminate Pfiesteria from ponds where it is already established and to manage all ponds to prevent other undesirable algae from becoming dominant. The fact that toxic blooms can occur in Maryland waters is another wake up call -- the message is that aquaculturists have to be alert to changing conditions in their ponds and must monitor water quality regularly.

Animal Drug Availability Act Passes
</H3>
After considerable maneuvering, debate and effort, the Animal Drug Availability Act of 1996 achieved passage in the final days of the 104th Congress, and was signed by President Clinton on October 9, 1996. The law had  broad support from animal husbandry organizations and Congress. It will provide for a much earlier, clearer definition of the "substantial evidence" required for New Animal Drug approvals and combination drugs, and streamline the consideration process by the Center for Veterinary Medicine. The law also contains a "veterinary feed directive," outlining a category of manufactured animal feeds containing drugs without requiring prescriptions or over-the-counter approval, allows the Food and Drug Administration to set import residue tolerances for animal drugs not allowed in the U.S., and simplifies licensing procedures for feed mills.

Delaney Clause Reformed
</H3>
In early August, the President signed the Food Quality Protection Act, which addresses a number of issues concerning pesticide registration, use and risks. One portion of the bill, called the Delaney Clause, had been unchanged since its establishment over thirty years ago. Originally passed to protect consumers from carcinogens in processed foods, the "zero tolerance" level it established had been upheld repeatedly in court, thus threatening continued registration or use of a number of crop protection chemicals. Meanwhile, "safe" levels yielding "reasonable certainty of no harm" applied to raw foods. Reform of the Delany Clause brings processed foods into compliance with these standards.

With all the recent articles about the imminent demise of the Chesapeake Bay blue crab, we thought that readers of  Maryland Aquafarmer would be interested in the following article that was sent to us by our friend, Mr. Harold B. Kennerly of Salisbury, Maryland.
<H2>
CRAB CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON
</H2>
</CENTER>

At the request of Governor Herbert R. O'Conor, a conference will be held in the offices of the Secretary of the Interior on March 24th between the Governors of Maryland and Virginia and Secretary Ickes, to discuss steps to be taken on the conservation of the Chesapeake blue crab.
<P>
In the last few years the crab population has declined to a point where successful operations are no longer profitable in many sections.  Governor O'Conor recognizing the serious threat to the industry, has made every effort to work out the details of this conference in the hope that adequate immediate steps will be taken to effectuate a rapid recovery of the crab population.  He feels that conservation of this species is of particular importance now, in light of the present emergency and the pressing need for a high production of food.
<P>
The Maryland representatives at this conference, besides the Governor, will include the Commission of Tidewater Fisheries, Mr. George Harrison, Tilghman,  and Mr. Albert Woodfield, Galesville, members of the Maryland Marine Fisheries Compact Commission, Mr. John Handy, Crisfield, member of the Commission of Research and Education, and Dr. R.V. Truitt, Director of the Department of Research and Education.
<P>
The article is from Vol. 2, No. 11 of the "Maryland Tidewater News," a bi-weekly newsletter of the Department of Tidewater Fisheries, Annapolis MD.  The date: March 20, 1942!

A Book Review by Don Webster<BR>Eastern Shore Area Agent
</H2>
Dr. William K. Brooks has reached from beyond the grave.  His book, The Oyster, published in 1905, has been reissued by its original publisher, Johns Hopkins University Press, and stands in stark condemnation of how Marylanders have politicized their oyster industry for over a hundred years.  "We have wasted our inheritance by improvidence and mismanagement and blind confidence; but even if our beds had held their own and were today as valuable as they were fifty years ago, this would be no just ground for satisfaction, in this age of progress, to a generation which has seen all our other resources developed and improved."
<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
Brooks was writing in a period when the oyster harvest had started to recede from a 10,500,000 bushel annual yield.  Harvests had routinely been in these eight digit figures and yet he foresaw the destruction that was occurring through indiscriminate gathering.  He also had an unshakable faith that, with cultivation methods, harvests could not only be maintained at these high levels, but increased.  He was one of Maryland's first Oyster Commissioners and, in that position, argued for the first surveys of the State's oyster bars, a feat which took place early in the 1900s.  Unfortunately, most of his other strongly held opinions on how to increase the harvest for the betterment of the citizens were never instituted.
<P>
I first read Brooks twenty two years ago when my wife gave me a mint copy that she had found in an old book store as a present.  I have treasured it since.  The impact of the first reading was immense.  His warnings, laid down with laser precision, have not diminished to this day.
<P>
This edition is enhanced with an introduction by Kennedy T. Paynter, Jr., one of today's bright young oyster scientists.  He essentially reinforces Brooks' arguments and updates them with references to contemporary oyster literature and the industry crisis resulting from the two devastating oyster diseases, MSX and Dermo. The interesting factor in the diseases, however, is that they have likely been spread by the same well-intentioned mismanagement that has characterized the fishery for over a century.
<P>
If you follow the history of conflict in public policy regarding the Maryland oyster industry, you find that about every generation a new scientist comes to the same conclusions as Brooks, and has about as much success in effecting a long lasting and meaningful change in the industry.  Today, however, there is a recognition of the oyster not just as a commercial entity but as an important benthic organism and effective biofilter that can be of significant value in helping to cleanse the Bay from excessive phytoplankton.
<P>
While the reprint is excellent, it unfortunately cannot come close to the original.  The first edition is bound in green with a gilt oyster upon the cover.  The original lithographic illustrations are a magnificent sepia tone, and are not well reproduced in the latest volume.  Some plates seem to have been photographed from less than perfect originals as wrinkles and tears seem evident in the camera reproduction on a few.  Perhaps, if this volume sells well, a special collector's edition should be considered that would reproduce the original binding and plates.
<P>
Brooks' popular treatise on oysters contains the basics of how an oyster works, explained in a form easy enough for youngsters to understand.  Indeed, in addition to his prowess as a biologist, Brooks was an excellent popular writer -- in explaining the amazing fecundity of the oyster, for instance, he calculated that, if all descendants from a single female lived and reproduced only once, in the fifth generation their mass would make up more than eight times the volume of the Earth!  And this was in the days before computers. 
<P>
Brooks traces the culture of oysters through manipulation of spawning and catching spat in the water to the early Romans and discusses successful culture operations in Europe and various parts of the United States. The examples serve as argument for  how the Chesapeake Bay could become an oyster goldfield, if properly managed.  "Our opportunities for rearing oysters are unparalleled in any other part of the world, and in another place I have shown that, in other countries, much valuable grounds have by cultivation been made to yield oysters at a rate per acre which, on our own great beds, would carry our annual harvest very far beyond the sum of all the oysters which have ever been used by the packers of Maryland and Virginia."
<P>
In his chapter  "The Cause of the Decline of our Oyster Industry, and the Protection of our Natural Beds" Brooks notes that the primary problems for measuring production are lack of access to planting grounds and theft of privately cultured oysters.  These problems remain today as two of the most persistent in inhibiting production through non-public means.  
<P>
Brooks' final chapter is "The Remedy," where he gives  ideas about how oyster harvest from the Bay could be increased, although he has enough humility to note that there are many divergent interests and viewpoints. His proposals, however, remain as relevant today as when they were written.  "To ourselves and to our posterity we owe it that our resources shall be fully developed, for our oyster-beds are our greatest source of wealth, and upon them, more than upon our commerce, our manufactures, or our farming land, the future wealth and prosperity and population of our State depend."
<P>
The Oyster should be in the collection of every person who values the Chesapeake Bay and its natural resources, including,  every politician and policy maker in Maryland.  The trick then, of course, would be to get them to read it.  I have noted with interest, during my years dealing with the oyster industry, that those politicians who most promoted themselves as the saviors of the seafood industry were often those who were the proximate cause of its demise.
<P>
Perhaps William K. Brooks, in his second time around, will be able to change a few hearts and minds about the potential of this great estuary and its oyster industry.  But even if that doesn't occur, he will still be seen as a visionary with a hard, practical streak.  Not unlike Kennedy Paynter and some of his contemporaries who will perhaps have more luck during their careers.

The Oyster is $14.95 (paperback) and can be ordered by calling The John's Hopkins University Press, 1-800-537-5487.

<H2>Aquaculture In The Mid Atlantic/USTFA Joint Meeting
<BR>
Don Webster, Eastern Shore Area Agent
</H2>
</CENTER>
"Aquaculture In The Mid Atlantic" (AMA), the largest continuing aquaculture education program in the region, will join with the United States Trout Farmers Association (USTFA) this fall for a joint convention and trade show.  It promises to be an excellent program and you should make plans now for attending.
<P>
The program will be held on September 26-28, 1996 at Chateau Camelback in the Pocono region of Pennsylvania.  Educational programs will be held along with social events and the trade show.  Workshop topics will include subjects for cold water fish production, water quality management, fish health and many other useful topics for current and prospective fish farmers.
<P>
The 1996 program marks a change for Aquaculture In The Mid Atlantic, which conducted its 1995 program with Aquaculture Expo at a major national program in Washington, D.C.   AMA now intends to move its meetings from spring to fall at the request of industry.  The program will also change to developing more focused topics at meetings, rather than the broad range aquaculture programs that have been held in the past.

Put the dates on your calendar now and start planning for this event.   Further information will be available in this newsletter as the program develops.

<A NAME="POND"></A>
<H2>Pond Management Program<BR>
by Don Webster, Eastern Shore Area Agent</H2>
</CENTER>
Are you thinking of putting in a new pond?  Do you have one that needs management?  Do you have problems with aquatic weeds during the summer?  Would you like to have a pond with a good population of fish to catch?  These will be some of the topics discussed in at the Rising Sun Library in Cecil County on May 1, 1996 at a Pond Management Program sponsored by the University of Maryland Cooperative Extension Service.
<P>
Don Webster and Reggie Harrell of the Sea Grant Extension Program will join host Dave Wilson in an evening program designed to help you plan and manage your ponds for maximum enjoyment.  The program will start at 7 pm and conclude by 10 pm.  It is free and open to all citizens regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, or handicap, but a call to the Cecil County Extension Office at 410-996-5280 will be appreciated so that we can have enough program material for everyone to take home.
<P>
Ponds can be used for many purposes and can be a source of great enjoyment.  But they can just as easily become major annoyances for their owners.  Each year the Extension Service receives many calls from pond owners who have had fish die or had their ponds taken over by unsightly weeds because of poor planning or management. Taking preventative steps now can keep you from having to deal with these problems later.
<P>
We will be discussing some of the design considerations for new ponds and ways to fix problems in older ones. Water quality management topics will be presented along with some ways that you can ensure that your pond will be healthy and productive for many years to come.  Since fishing is one of the primary uses of many ponds, we'll go over stocking programs recommended in this area to produce healthy populations of fish.  And, because aquatic plants can quickly get out of hand and become a source of trouble, we'll be showing you some of the most common plants and talking about methods to control them so that you can enjoy a trouble free season with your pond this year.

<H2>Bohn Becomes Naa/Ustfa Executive Director
<BR>
by Don Webster, Eastern Shore Area Agent</H2>
</CENTER>
He began his career picking oysters on the tidal flats of the Pacific Northwest --certainly one of the most humble forms of learning a job "from the ground up".  He recently left the University of Maryland to take a position as Executive Director of the National Aquaculture Association and the United States Trout Farmers Association.  In between, Rich Bohn learned a lot about aquaculture.  And he passed that knowledge on to many others.
<P>
Rich came to Maryland eight years ago to serve as the Area Agent in Southern Maryland.  He had previously been at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science operating their oyster hatchery.  Before that, he had been employed by a commercial oyster producer in the state of  Washington.  Rich was a graduate of the University of Washington where he joined that long list known generically as "another one a Ken Chew's students".
<P>
Eight years ago aquaculture offered a lot of development potential in Maryland.  The Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program had decided to move an area agent position to St. Mary's County and staff it with someone who knew how to raise shellfish as well as finfish.  After an extensive search, Rich was hired and brought a lot of expertise to our region.  He worked with farmers to develop cooperative demonstration projects and became involved in 4-H projects and community events designed to help spur production and create demand for locally produced aquaculture products.
<P>
Rich enthusiastically supported state and regional programs in aquaculture such as Aquaculture In The Mid Atlantic, our annual conference providing educational seminars and a trade show for the industry.  He served as Chairman of the conference when it was held in Annapolis in 1992 and thereafter became a member of the Board of Directors.  He continued to work on the program so that it would continue as one of the best in the country.  Due to his continuing support, the 1996 conference will be held jointly with the US Trout Farmers Association (see article in this issue), allowing us to continue working together on yet another project.  Other regional activities included appointment to the Technical Committee of the Northeastern Regional Aquaculture Center (NRAC).
<P>
For several years Rich became involved in the development of fish health policy in the state and region.  In this "hot button" area he worked closely with industry and agencies in trying to see that regulations and procedures were developed that would help the aquaculture industry protect itself while being realistic.  His connections to agriculture brought an appreciation of the policies developed for other animal livestock and the belief that these could be expanded to include aquaculture with maximum effect and minimal difficulty.
<P>
We worked closely during his years here.  I always looked forward to speaking with him, as I did frequently, and we planned and conducted many programs during that time.  From pond management to aquatic weed control to crab shedding to cage aquaculture, we enjoyed teaching people and making new friends from those who came to the programs.  Perhaps that's one of the best rewards about a career in extension.  That interest in people will serve Rich well in his new job.  While we will miss his expertise, we wish him well in his new position and look forward to helping support the efforts of the organizations he will be working for in developing the aquaculture industry.

<A NAME="TRAIN"></A>
<H2>In Service Training For Teachers</H2>
</CENTER>
Aquaculture has found a ready home in many school systems where it is used to teach biology, water chemistry, production, and other topics.  The National Council for Agricultural Education has been a leader in developing curricula and providing training for teachers through Regional Aquaculture Learning Centers.  They have announced teacher in-service programs for 1996 for agriscience teachers interested in infusing aquaculture education into their vocational agriculture curriculum.  Other secondary and post-secondary teachers, educators, and extension personnel are also welcome to attend.
<P>
Session are hands-on and focus on aquaculture education techniques using instructional materials developed by the Council in partnership with USDA.  The formal training program for the Mid Atlantic will be held in Pennsylvania on May 9 and 10 with three or more Introductory Workshops to be announced for later dates.  For more information on these programs, contact a member of the Sea Grant Extension Program.

<H2>Successes And Failures In Commercial Recirculating Aquaculture</H2>
</CENTER>
Virginia Tech's outreach programs are a class act.  Now they, in conjunction with USDA, the <A HREF="../../../NSGO/index.html">National Sea Grant College Program</A>, and others will be holding a three day conference in Roanoke on July 19-21 on recirculation aquaculture systems.  It promises to be one of the best that has been seen on the subject.  If you're interested in controlled production, this should be a program you will want to attend.  The wide ranging topics will feature experts with practical experience in commercial scale recirculating aquaculture systems.  It will be designed to educate producers as well as many others who have an interest in the application and success of these production systems.
<P>
Individual sessions will include fish health and welfare, business plans and management, food safety and quality, system design and management, waste and byproduct recovery, and the application of these systems for shellfish as well as finfish.  Tours will include commercial and research facilities.

<A NAME="BALLAST"></A>
<H2>New Invaders From Ballast Water<BR>
Rich Bohn, Southern Maryland Area Agent</H2>
</CENTER>
Aquaculture is often considered to play a major role in the movement of non-native aquatic species.  As fish and shellfish are moved for restocking or grow out, transport water may contain unidentified passengers.  However, <A HREF="../../Research/index.html">Maryland Sea Grant research</A> may have identified another, less recognized transport mechanism by examining ballast water in ocean going vessels.  And the success of the transplants may be far greater than has been previously suspected.
<P>
Researchers at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center have been examining the ballast water from ships landing in Norfolk, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland.  These are primarily bulk tankers which carry the largest volumes of ballast.  While over half of the ships were from the Northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, a wide variety of other originating ports were identified.  Interestingly, most of the ships appear to arrive with ballast water of high temperature and salinity.  Less than 20% of the ships ballast had salinities below 15 parts per thousand or temperatures below 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F.)
<P>
Using 80 micron mesh nets, over 90% of the ballasts were found to contain live organisms.  Barnacles, bivalve molluscs, copepods, diatoms, dinoflagellates, and polychaete worms were found on over 40% of the ships sampled. Nearly 100 of the over 150 organisms found have been identified by species.  Small live plankton have been identified in about 90% of the ballasts checked using whole water samples, and sediment samples from the ballasts have shown plankton cysts and/or vegetative cells in about 70% of the ships sampled.
<P>
Are the organisms viable, or simple present?  Over 190 cultures of species have been successfully started from the ballast of 36 ships.  Current testing examines survival in differing salinities and temperatures, with early indications that invasive success depends on the quality of the receiving water.  Discharging the ballast from the ship is also being examined to determine the effect upon potential survival.
<P>
Settlement plates placed in both Norfolk and Baltimore harbors to look for invaders have resulted in at least three new species descriptions for Chesapeake Bay, all only from organisms known from sites at least one thousand miles away.  All three were identified from Norfolk harbor.  Samples from 1995 are still being examined, but it seems likely that further study will only increase the number of invaders identified.  By understanding the circumstances of successful transport, it is hoped that economical and safe methods of removing non-native species from ballast water can be achieved.

Part I: Species Considerations and Pond Stocking 
</H3>
Recreational fishing has long been a favorite pastime in North America, and the nation's farm and recreational fishing pond program has contributed to the continued interest and success in this outdoor recreation sport.  According to the 1991 national hunting and fishing survey conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Commerce, 35.6 million U.S. residents over the age of 16 spent over 511 million days fishing in 1991.  These trips related to $24 billion dollars spent of fishing and fishing related expenses.  The survey covered the nation's lakes, rivers, streams, and oceans, but a large percentage of those hours were spent relaxing on the banks of a farm pond.
<P>
Not only do small private or public ponds provide hours of stress reducing fishing enjoyment in our hectic lives, but ponds have many other hidden treasures just waiting to be found.  For instance, a pond is a natural ecosystem with complex interactions between plants, animals, nutrients, and man.  Much of our current knowledge of aquatic ecology has its roots in understanding the intricacies of and interactions of small lakes and ponds.
<P>
You don't have to fish to enjoy the pleasures a pond offers.  Take your children and spend some quality time together by sitting quietly on the banks and enjoying what nature has to offer.  Observation is a powerful educational tool. Allan Eckett uses a small lake on the Illinois-Wisconsin border to exemplify the complexities of nature insightful book in his book Wild Season (Bantam Books, Inc.) when he notes that, "...there is a purpose to all things and among all creatures: there is a purpose in being born and in living; there is a purpose in reproducing and in the rasing of young; there is purpose even in death, for while death among wild creatures in nature may be harsh and unexpected, it is, unlike death in man, rarely tragic, rarely needless and never wasteful."  
<P>
Maryland has well over 13,000 farm ponds, and most have potential to be managed for hours of enjoyable fishing. Others may be suited for wildlife and waterfowl management, for production of fish for sale, or for irrigation or fire safety purposes.  All have a small, but collectively significant, role in conservation of Maryland's natural resources, whether helping to prevent silt and agricultural or urban nutrient runoff from entering the Bay, providing sanctuary for migrating waterfowl, or helping to recharge aquifers.  They also offer a unique perspective of nature.  If you are fortunate enough to have a pond, enjoy the beauties and pleasures it offers, and appreciate the value and role these small ecosystems play in protecting our resources.
<P>
We will assume you already have a pond and won't go into details about construction.  We also assume you want to manage your pond for recreational fishing.  If you do not have a pond on your property and are considering constructing one, or if you are not interested in fishing but want to know more about it's ecology, contact Maryland's Department of Natural Resources (DNR), your local County Extension Service Office, the Maryland Sea Grant Extension Service, or the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Stocking
</H3>
Before you stock your pond with fish there are a few items to improve your success.  Proper management requires that you follow basic principles to maximize harvestable fish.  Following these guidelines doesn't mean that catch all you desire every time, but will improve the quality of your fishing and the frequency of success.
<P>
Successful management involves using a combination the right species of fish, proper stocking rate, and maintaining a controlled harvest to produce the correct balance of predators (for example, largemouth bass) to prey (for example, bluegill).  Maintaining a balanced population should provide you with long and enjoyable hours of fishing.  Often, productive fishing versus unproductive depends upon the pond owners willingness to carry out the recommended procedures and management practices.
<A NAME="PART3"></A><H3>
Pre-stocking Procedures
</H3>
One of the hardest things pond owners have to do reclaim their pond.  Reclamation requires eliminating existing fish so you can start at the beginning.  If you stock fish on top of an existing population, you will fail because it's difficult to achieve the right predator-prey balance.
<P>
Pond reclamation can be achieved through the use of a fish toxicant, most often rotenone.  The chemical enters the fish's bloodstream through the gills and interferes with the respiratory system by inhibiting oxygen transport in the red blood cells.  The fish then suffocate.  Rotenone is quite effective in eliminating all the fish in a pond.  It is widely available, relatively inexpensive, and is most effective if applied in warm weather such as August or early September.  It also detoxifies more rapidly in warm water.  
<P>
Before you begin <B>always remember to have the proper permits</B> or have a certified pesticide applicator make the application.  Fish toxicants are considered a pesticide and you must have the permits before you treat a pond.  Contact your County Extension Service office, the DNR, or the Department of Agriculture for the latest procedure and permit requirements.
<P>
While there are many different strategies for recreational fishing pond management, the best technique involves starting in late summer or the fall of the year by stocking your prey population (bluegill) and in the following spring stocking your predator population (largemouth bass).  The bluegill can be fished in the first summer after stocking but the largemouth bass should not be fished until the second year.
<P>
By reclaiming the pond in late summer it will provide plenty of time for the pond to be refilled by the fall and be ready to receive your bluegill for stocking.  If you need to reclaim a pond at another time of year, it is best to apply the rotenone at least three weeks before you plan to stock your fish to allow time for the chemical to detoxify.  
<P>
The pond can be prepared by drawing the water down as low as possible.  This serves the purpose of concentrating the fish and providing a much lower volume of water that is to be treated thereby lowering costs by reducing the total amount of toxicant you have to use.  Lowering the water also helps ensure a total kill and it helps prevent treated water from escaping downstream.  Make sure all drains are closed and that there are no leaks.  You do not want rotenone treated water to move downstream and cause a fish kill as you may be legally and financially responsible for fish killed beyond the pond.
<P>
Rotenone is applied at a rate of one to three parts per million or milligrams per liter of water.  Three parts per million is approximately one gallon of 5% liquid rotenone, or 8.1 pounds of 5% emulsifiable powdered rotenone, per acre foot (one surface acre of water with an average depth of one foot).  As an example, consider that your pond is initially five acres in size and averages ten feet deep, or 50 acre feet.  However if you draw the pond down to one acre with an average depth of two feet you reduce the volume to two acre feet.  By drawing the pond down instead of needing 50 gallons of rotenone (or 405 pounds) to treat the full pond at a rate of three parts per million you now only need two gallons or 16.2 pounds.  
<P>
If the pond is fed by a stream that originates on your property you need to treat the entire stream.  If the stream originates somewhere other than on your property consult Maryland's DNR about your options.  In either case, to be on the safe side, it would be wise to consult the DNR.  You can treat the stream at a rate of one quart or one and one-half pounds of powdered rotenone for every 300 linear feet of stream.  Remember to have the pond drawn down so there is no overflow of the rotenone downstream of the pond.  
<P>
As mentioned, it is best to apply the rotenone when the water temperatures are warm (above 70 degrees F).  At these temperatures rotenone should detoxify within seven days.  It takes longer to detoxify in cooler water.  For instance, at 60 degrees F detoxification will take about two weeks, and at 50 degrees F it will take almost a month.  To protect your investment in new fish it is wise to place a small cage in the pond and put a few bluegill or minnows in the cage for 24 or more hours to determine if the rotenone has detoxified.   If, after 24 hours, the fish are still alive, it is ready to stock.  The water should also not be used for livestock watering during this time.
<P>
Liquid rotenone is best applied by a sprayer or by pouring a diluted solution in the prop-wash of an outboard motor.  In deeper ponds you may have to use a pump and a perforated hose to get the chemical down toward the bottom.  The powdered form is cheaper than the liquid and can be mixed with water to form a slurry and then sprayed in the pond.  In ponds with heavy vegetation or those exceptionally deep, the powder can be mixed with sand in a 1:3 ratio and a small amount of gelatin to form a paste, which can then be applied to the area of concern.  Be careful not to disturb much of the pond bottom when applying the chemical as organic matter decreases the effectiveness of the toxicant. Most important however, when applying any herbicide or pesticide <B>READ AND FOLLOW THE LABEL AND WEAR THE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING!</B>
<P>
Most fish will die within 24 hours after treatment and will come to the surface, although you may continue to find fish for several days, especially if the water is cool.  The Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of rotenone for human consumption so all the fish should be netted and buried.  Applying quick lime over the top of the buried fish will control odor and the fish will decompose quicker.
<A NAME="PART4"></A><H3>
Selecting the Proper Fish
</H3>
Many fishermen like a variety of fish to catch and often will put many kinds of fish in a pond assuming they will reproduce and become established.  While this can happen often it is not to the point that the pond owner had hoped and the fish become stunted (grow very slowly and do not reach harvestable size).  They can also compete with more desirable species, or cause disease problems.  Because wild fish or certain combinations of species are not suited for recreational fishing ponds due to the imbalances of the predator-prey ratios, it is recommended that only certain species of fish be stocked in recreational fishing ponds.  These include largemouth bass, bream (bluegill, redear, or hybrid sunfish) and, if desired, channel catfish.  Considerable research has been conducted over the last 50 years and the proper combinations of these species have been established and proven successful over most of the United States.  In Maryland only largemouth bass, bluegill, and catfish are approved for stocking without special permission.  If you want to stock redear, hybrid sunfish, or hybrid striped bass, you will have to get approval from Maryland's DNR.  Also on the approved list are the forage (prey) species fathead minnows and golden shiners, but these are not generally recommended.
<P>
For the best chance of having a well balanced pond, you need to stock an appropriate ratio of largemouth bass, bluegill (and redear or hybrid sunfish alone if you like variety), and channel catfish.  The stocking rate will be dependent on how much effort you are going to put into managing and fishing your pond.  Small ponds (less than one acre) are difficult to manage for bass and bream fishing. As a general rule of thumb however you stock the pond in a ratio of bream to bass of 10:1.  
<P>
If you are not going to aggressively manage and fish your pond you should stock with 350 bluegill, 150 redear, and 50 largemouth bass per surface acre.  Depth is not important in these recommendations because most natural food is produced in the upper few feet of a pond.  You can also stock 50 channel catfish fingerlings.  The bluegill and redear sunfish should be one to two inches long and are normally stocked in late summer or the fall of the year.  The largemouth bass should be two to four inches and are stocked in the summer following bream stocking.  Channel catfish are stocked at two to four inches and are stocked in the fall along with the bluegill or eight to 10 inches if they are stocked in a pond with adult largemouth bass to prevent the bass from eating them.  Hybrid sunfish (normally a cross between a bluegill and a green sunfish) can be substituted if desired but will probably have to be restocked since most hybrid sunfish are males.  Ponds with hybrid bream need to be periodically drained, poisoned, and restocked.  Also hybrid bream should not be stocked in a pond with adult largemouth bass unless the bream are over five inches in length because the bass will eat them. 
<P>
If you want to double fishing success for pounds of fish that can be taken from your pond then you need an aggressive management program.  You will have to fertilize your pond and fish it more actively.  If you are not going to aggressively fish your pond it is not recommended that you start this accelerated management program.  If you are going to, then you will double your initial stocking density.  That is 700 bluegill, 300 redear, and 100 largemouth bass to the acre. The channel catfish stocking rate is 100 per pond or 50 per acre, whichever is greater.  Channel catfish usually do not reproduce in recreational fishing ponds and will have to be occasionally restocked.
<P>
Recently, pond owners have been stocking hybrid striped bass at 100 per acre.  Stocking hybrid striped bass in ponds in Maryland also requires special permission from Maryland's DNR.  Hybrid striped bass should be eight to ten inches long at stocking.  Although hybrids are another predator to the pond, indications to date do not reveal negative impact upsetting the predator-prey balance as bream often remain in the shallow waters while the hybrid striped bass prefer the open water.  Stocking pure striped bass in your pond is usually unsuccessful as survival in ponds less than 500 acres in size is rare.
<P>
Another option if the water is too cold during the summer months (constantly less than 65 degrees F) for a good bass-bream pond is to stock rainbow or brook trout.  It is normally best to stock fall spawned fish that are five to six inches long, although they are more expensive.  Fall spawned fish are less variable and unpredictable compared to spring fish. In either case, fish should be harvestable size by the spring following stocking.  Do not stock trout during the warm season, and normal stocking rates for trout are about 600 fall fingerlings or 1,500 to 2,000 spring fingerlings per surface acre.  You can improve your trout production by daily feeding with an artificial diet.
<P>
As an important reminder, do not stock any other fish species in your pond.  It will only lead to trouble and an unbalanced situation where the fish will become overcrowded and stunted, which leads to poor fishing.   Common carp will only muddy the pond and grass carp are illegal in Maryland.  Crappie and bullhead are competitors with the bream and will also lead to stunting and overcrowding.  Shiners and other minnows can become too large for the bass to eat and compete with the bream for food as well.
<A NAME="PART5"></A><H3>
Obtaining Your Fish
</H3>
Maryland's Department of Natural Resources has just recently started a sportfishing management program.  They will set up a site visit for your pond and make recommendations.  They will also provide largemouth bass and bluegill, but not redear sunfish or channel catfish.  These will have to come from commercial suppliers.  Remember that you will need special permission to have redear sunfish.  Applications for fish from DNR have to be in to the Annapolis office by 15 May. Other species of fish are occasionally delivered to various locations around the state.  Contact your local feed and seed stores to find if they are a cooperator with fish suppliers.
<A NAME="PART6"></A><H3>
Species Profiles
</H3>
<A NAME="PART6A"></A><B>Largemouth bass</B>.   This species is the major predator in the pond and is a highly sought after game fish.  Actually not a bass at all, largemouth bass are a member of the sunfish family which includes the bluegill, redear sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, and many others including smallmouth bass and spotted bass.  The true bass family includes species such as striped bass, white bass, and white perch.  The largemouth bass is dark green to light green with dark stripes or blotches on the sides and a white belly.   As the name says it is also recognized by it's large mouth.
<P>
Largemouth bass normally feed on insects, fish, crawfish, frogs, snakes, ducklings, or just about any animal that it can swallow.  Young fish are active feeders all day long while the adults mostly feed late in the evening and early in the morning.  The adults usually spawn during their second spring at a size of 9 to 12 inches long.  Spawning usually begins when the water temperature reaches 60 to 70 degrees F and occurs only once a year.  The male makes a nest on the bottom using his tail to fan out a depression up to two feet in diameter and six inches deep.  The size of the nest is usually dependent on the size of the male.  Although the nest may be made in muddy bottoms, gravel substrate is usually best. Once the nest is made, the male courts a female and encourages her to lay her eggs in the nest.  A female can lay between 2,000 to 15,000 eggs, dependent on size and condition.  After the female lays her eggs the male runs the female off and protects the nest.  He aerates and keeps silt off the eggs by fanning the nest with his tail.  
<P>
Once the eggs hatch (three to 12 days depending on water temperature) and the fry begin to actively feed around the nest in a school.  The male still provides protection for his offspring for about 10 more days, after which the fry fend for themselves.  The fry will remain in schools until they are about one inch long then they will head to shallow water for protection from predators.
<P>
Several factors can affect largemouth bass reproduction and survival.  The first is water temperature.  
<P>
Sudden drops in water temperature while the eggs or fry are on the nest can be fatal.  Secondly, the eggs and fry are easy targets for predators such as the bluegill or other fish.  Last, there may be insufficient food in the pond to support the young fish when they leave the nest.
<P>
<A NAME="PART6B"></A><B>Bluegill</B>.  Probably the most popular and sought after fish in North America the bluegill is a deep-bodied panfish that has a small head and an irregularly shaped black spot located at the base of the soft dorsal (top) fin.  Known by most people as bream (also a collective name for many sunfish), it also has broad, dark vertical bands often seen on the sides of the fish when it is in water.  The males are dark and gray to bluish on the sides with the belly being a deep orange especially when it is spawning season.  Females have a lighter cream-colored belly and light yellow or light gray sides.  Both sexes have an elongated dark blue or black "ear flap" or operculum.
<P>
Bluegill prefer to eat insects but will occasionally eat small fish.  They will also occasionally eat small crawfish, snails, and worms.  During times of food scarcity they may feed on algae and aquatic plants.
<P>
Spawning usually occurs at one year of age and the spawning season runs from mid-May through the summer and into the fall if the temperature is high enough (over 80 degrees F).  Bluegill can spawn more than once a year and produce 2,000 to over 50,000 eggs.  The fish nests in colonies in water one to three feet deep.  Like the largemouth bass the male makes the nest (12-16 inches) with his tail.  The female lays her eggs in the nest and the male fertilizes them and then guards the nest. The eggs hatch in two to five days depending on temperature and the fry remain in the nest for an additional three to five days before they move into shallower waters.  Because they are so prolific, they are the primary source of food for the largemouth bass.  
<P>
<A NAME="PART6C"></A><B>Redear Sunfish</B>.  More commonly known as a "shellcracker" because of their proclivity to eat snails and small mussels, the fish is a popular sportfish due to their large sizes.  Fish over a pound in size are not uncommon.  Although the growth rate is similar to bluegill the redear is usually the larger of the two due to the fact that they are harder to catch.   The redear has a beautiful "earflap" which is black with a red-orange border.  During the spawning season, the males have a bright-orange border.  The pectoral fin, the one right behind the gill cover on each side of the fish) is very long and pointed. The rear portion of the fish does not have the dark spot found in bluegill.

<P>
Reproduction occurs when the fish is one year old and it nests in similar colonies as the bluegill.  However, it prefers building it's nest near aquatic vegetation if it exists within the pond.  A female redear lays between 2,000 and 10,000 eggs depending on size and condition.  After spawning is completed, like the bluegill the female redear leaves or is driven from the nest and the male takes up the role of protector.   
<P>
<A NAME="PART6D"></A><B>Hybrid Sunfish</B>.   As mentioned above, if you desire to stock your pond with hybrid sunfish instead of bluegill you will need special permission from Maryland's DNR.  Hybrid sunfish are attractive to pond owners because of their fast growth, hybrid vigor, susceptibility to angling, and their ability to occupy different habitats within a pond.  
<P>
Most hybrid sunfish are a cross between male bluegill and a female green sunfish, although combinations of bluegill and redear or redear and green sunfish are also produced.  So the fish is of mixed parentage and because of that the progeny are usually intermediate in appearance between the two parents.  
<P>
Hybrid sunfish have differing capacities for reproduction because of differential sex ratios, which is dependent on who were the parents.  For instance, a cross between redear sunfish and green sunfish (the female is usually listed first) results in a progeny sex ratio of almost 1:1.  But a cross between bluegill and redear results in almost 100% of the offspring being male.
<P>
One problem with hybrid sunfish is that the nests they make can be very large and deep.  In fact the fish can made a nest depression in the pond bottom so deep that if you had to put clay in your pond to prevent seepage, the nest may go through that layer and cause the pond to leak.  
<P>
Reduction and population decline in the hybrid sunfish is due to fishing pressure, predation by largemouth bass, and reduced reproductive success.  Unfortunately hybrid sunfish are unable to maintain an adequate prey base in the pond for largemouth bass, which causes the bass population quality to decline.
<P>
Before you consider stocking hybrid sunfish in your pond you should think out all the pros and cons of each cross, and the fact that you will have to restock the pond on a frequent basis.  Otherwise, hybrid sunfish can be a fun group of fish to have in the pond from a fishing perspective.
<P>
<A NAME="PART6E"></A><B>Channel Catfish</B>.  Channel catfish are fun fish to have in a pond because they are a bonus fish in that they provide an additional source of meat and sport.  Actually channel catfish can be stocked in a pond by themselves and offer a good sportfishing opportunity.  Normally channel catfish reproduce in sportfishing ponds unless there are suitable structure such are hollowed out logs or muskrat dens for them to lay their eggs.  For those fish that do reproduce however, if the pond is clear, the eggs and young are usually eaten by the bass and/or bluegill.
<P>
Channel catfish will eat almost anything they can get into their mouths.  However, they prefer insects, small fish, worms, snails, and crawfish, and they readily accept and artificial diet such as catfish chow.  The average weight of channel catfish in ponds is around two pounds.
<P>
If channel catfish are stocked as the only species in the pond then they should be stocked at a rate of no more than 200 per acre in an unfertilized pond, or no more than 500 per surface acre in a fertilized pond.  If you are going to feed the fish with an artificial diet on a daily basis then you can stock as high as 2,000 per surface acre.  Ponds smaller than one acre are usually stocked with channel catfish alone and provide excellent fishing with little management.
<P>

<H2>Aquatic Vegetation Management Tip<BR>
Reginal M. Harrell, Finfish Aquaculture Specialist
</H2>
</CENTER>
As spring temperatures begin to warm your pond, you will notice the emergence of algal mats and the beginnings of vascular plants starting to show up.  Now is the time to be proactive in aquatic vegetation control.  As these mats and patches of vegetation develop, spot-treat the area with the appropriate herbicide.  If you start early you should be able to keep the plant growth under control and prevent the aquatic plant from becoming and aquatic weed.  Remember, aquatic vegetation is a natural part of the pond's ecology and plants are very beneficial to the overall health of a pond.  It is only when the plant growth becomes out-of-control that radical measures must be taken.  It is a lot cheaper to spot-treat your pond as opposed to a complete eradication effort.  <B>Do not forget you must have the proper permit to apply herbicides.</B>  Also do not wait until the plants have taken over the pond to apply for the permit.  Be proactive!  Plan ahead!

<A NAME="START"> </A>
<I>If successful, Multi-scale Experimental Ecosystem Research Center Studies could revolutionize the way environmental policy is formulated, implemented and evaluated.</I>
<P>
From the Chesapeake Bay to Puget Sound to the Seto Inland Sea in Japan, coastal waters have been hit with declining  
health in recent decades - but just how much of that decline is related to human activities remains uncertain. Experiments to answer such questions generally take place in the laboratory, and laboratory findings often have a complex and unclear connection to actual aquatic ecosystems.
<P>
In the Chesapeake, for example, countless factors affect the impact of nutrient enrichment or toxic chemicals, factors such as water circulation, turbulence, dissolved oxygen levels, biological and chemical interactions, in both sediments and water.  Can realistic techniques be developed that will make it possible to extrapolate laboratory findings to the real world? 
<P>
That is the aim of an ambitious, long-term research project at the University of Maryland System's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES). Tom Malone, director of the CEES Horn Point Environmental Laboratory and head of the Multiscale Experimental Ecosystem Research Center - or MEERC -  calls it "an incredible challenge."
<P>
"Its funding by the Environmental Protection Agency," says Wayne Bell, CEES Vice-President for External Affairs, "is, to put it simply, visionary. If successful," he adds, "it could revolutionize the way environmental policy is formulated, implemented and evaluated."
<P>
The goal is no less than trying to develop a fundamental understanding of how aquatic ecosystems function. "Our hope," says Malone, "is that from controlled experiments and simulation models we will eventually make it possible to predict  how such systems respond to any type of environmental stress, whether it be nutrient enrichment, toxic chemicals, heavy metals, sea level rise or temperature change."
<P>
Over the next five years, investigators will undertake increasingly complex experiments using various-sized experimental systems called "mesocosms." However, measuring the ecological changes in these different mesocosm environments as they respond to stresses such as nutrient enrichment is only the first step. Using simulation models to analyze empirical results represents a second step. The "daunting goal," though, as CEES scientist Mike Kemp says, is to discover if there are relational or scaling rules among the different mesocosm experiments that will enable them to extrapolate their results to real world settings.
<P>
 <A NAME="LAB"> </A>
<H3>Lab Experiments and Environmental Regulations</H3>

Natural aquatic systems, no matter how small or how large, are too messy for conducting finely-tuned experiments. Biological and chemical conditions in the sediments and overlying waters, for example, are in continual flux, whether from natural cycles or the impacts of human beings.  Mesocosms, on the other hand, can be controlled, thereby serving as surrogate ecosystems - whether small indoor tanks or large outdoor enclosures, they contain water, sediment and living organisms. For an experiment on the effects of nutrients or toxic compounds on phytoplankton production or fish mortality, the mesocosm can be dosed with known concentrations of each and a range of ecosystem effects measured. 
<P>
Regulatory limits on contaminants have not been based on such sophisticated understanding of how ecosystems affects contaminants. Those limits are generally based on dose-response reactions - in plain words, how a species reacts to a toxic compound in a small, controlled space. Typical experiments, for example, might use a species of fish in an aquarium with controlled conditions of salinity, temperature and light. A measured concentration of the chemical in question is diluted in the water and the fish is then left on its own. How long does it take for the fish to die or to exhibit a "sublethal response," for instance, damage to its reproductive or endocrine system? It is from such laboratory observations  that regulatory agencies set toxic discharge limits.
<P>
These observations, however, do not take into account the more complex reactions a contaminant undergoes in a real aquatic system or an ecologically complex mesocosm, reactions such as the interactive effects of the contaminant with sediment particles in the water or uptake by phytoplankton, or recycling by benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms, let alone the effects of turbulence or the role of species higher in the food chain. Consequently, it is nearly impossible to extrapolate with predictive confidence lab findings to the real world ecosystem itself. And as a result, environmental regulations must often rely on research that is augmented by best guesses.
<P>
It is because of such experimental limitations that research labs have been using mesocosms to try to simulate conditions in aquatic systems. For some years, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has supported the University of Rhode Island's Marine Ecosystem Research Laboratory (MERL) - large enclosed mesocosm tanks located on the shores of Narragansett Bay. Conditions in these tall cylinders have been designed to mimic the biology, chemistry and turbulence common to the Bay's sediments and waters. 
<P>
The 14 MERL tanks make it possible to replicate experiments and to compare the effects of different contaminant concentrations. As surrogates for Narragansett Bay, MERL mesocosms have been fairly effective in giving reasonable  results. They do, however, have limitations - they are expensive to operate and they are unique to the Narragansett Bay system. According to most researchers, applications of MERL results to other ecosystems have significant limitations. 
<P>
It is such limitations that the MEERC project with its differently scaled mesocosms, or multicosms, is trying to overcome.
<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/MEERC1.gif" ALT=""><BR>
<I>This tank is one of 40 mesocosms at the CEES Horn Point Environmental Laboratory set up to mimic the dynamic conditons of a natural ecosystem.</I>
<P>
 <A NAME="APPROACH"> </A>
<H3>The Multiscale Approach</H3>	

"Some people originally thought that CEES was going to do mini-Chesapeake Bays," says Karen Morehouse, Director of EPA Centers and Special Programs in the Office of Exploratory Research. There was some thought that these mesocosms were going to be exact microscale duplicates." That is not the case at all - the multicosm concept, she emphasizes, is unique. The long-term goal is to develop models that can be used to account for the complex interaction and feedbacks of aquatic systems, whether they be Chesapeake Bay or Puget Sound. To do this means first trying to determine if there are clear physical and mathematical relationships in laboratory mesocosm experiments. 
<P>
One set of mesocosms is looking at the biological and chemical responses to nutrient loading in tanks containing sediments and overlying waters. Two other sets of mesocosms are looking at the biological response of marshes and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) to nutrient loading. In a few years, the sediment-water mesocosms and the marsh-SAV mesocosms will be linked together physically; for now, scientists are working to understand each of these systems separately. 
<P>
In this first year, the sediment and overlying water (called pelagic-benthic) experiments have focused on three sizes of mesocosms and replicates: 0.1, 1.0 and 10 cubic meters.  With some forty different tanks, the researchers are watching to see how these three sizes respond to different types of nutrient loading. 
<P>
Our initial aim, says Michael Kemp, is in detailing how tank sizes and configurations affect biological responses to various types of nutrient loading; for instance, they are dosing tanks with high and low concentrations of continuous nutrient enrichment, as well as with high pulses of nutrient enrichment. Of the forty tanks, there are two separate configurations with three different volumes that have the same depth, and three different volumes that have the same ratio of diameter-to-depth, though they each differ in depth.
<P>
 <A NAME="BEGIN"> </A>
<H3>A Beginning</H3>

The data collected from one mesocosm would be large in itself, but the data from three different volumes, two configurations, and replicate experiments are downright massive. Though researchers are currently analyzing this first year's data, they have, says Mike Kemp, preliminary results on how planktonic, bottom-dwelling and wall growth (periphyton) communities in the different mesocosms responded to nutrient dosing. 
<P>
While it is difficult to generalize,  Kemp and his colleagues have been learning about the scale-dependency of mesocosm behavior. 
<UL>
<LI>Under nutrient-rich water conditions associated with springtime, the rate of algal production to water surface area was similar for all mesocosm sizes; however, algal production to water volume was least in the deepest mesocosms. In contrast,<P>
<P>
<LI>Under relatively low nutrient conditions of summertime, algal production per water volume was constant for all mesocosms, so that photosynthesis per unit of water surface area (and light energy) was highest in the deep tanks.
</UL>
<P>
Kemp says these findings suggest that results from mesocosm experiments should be scaled to real world conditions by depth in spring but by volume in summer. The implication is that seasonal variations in nutrient and light availability may change the appropriate scaling criteria for mesocosm experiments.
<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/MEERC2.gif" ALT=""><BR>
<I>CEES scientist Mike Kemp is heading a team of researchers who are trying to determine how mesocosm size and shape affects the results of an experiment.</I>
<P>
While these studies on the scaled behavior of sediment and overlying water communities are one major elements of the MEERC project, two others are marsh mesocosm studies, headed by Court Stevenson, and SAV ecosystem studies, headed by Laura Murray. Their research is exploring how mesocosm complexity influences marsh and SAV productivity and nutrient retention. 
<P>
During this first year, Stevenson and Murray have been asking questions that surprisingly, they say, have not been asked before. For example, how does ecosystem complexity affect responses to nutrient loading on marsh plants and on submerged aquatic vegetation? Does the ability of plant communities to absorb and transform nutrients vary with the form (dissolved vs. particulate) and the route of delivery, for example, groundwater vs. surface water? How do water circulation and the abundance of animals at higher trophic levels affect the responses of plant communities to nutrients and other climatic effects?
<P>
As a first-step simulation of marshland, Stevenson is employing large rectangular tanks of sediments planted with one or several species of grass. Nitrate-rich groundwater slowly seeps through the sediments, which are also on the receiving end of water that replicates tidal effects. The initial version of these experimental systems works effectively, maintaining healthy plant communities over long periods of time. "This year we will vary plant species composition," says Stevenson, "and examine response to groundwater nitrate under different tidal regimes."
<P>
"We're excited about these experiments," he says, "because nobody has ever replicated tidal marsh systems with groundwater inputs being varied while varying species composition. We believe," he adds, "we are carving out new ground."
<A NAME="EXPLOR"> </A>
<H3>Research that Is Truly Exploratory</H3>
<P>
"CEES scientists are asking very basic questions," says Karen Morehouse, "questions that have to be asked. Our applied research is a house of cards if we don't have the answers." While nobody has done this kind of research, Morehouse points out, the political and scientific risks in such work are considerable. Such research requires long-term funding, meaning there are no quick answers - not an inconsequential issue in a climate in which politics often requires short-term results. Although Congress required EPA to set aside funding for exploratory research in 1979, "it is often difficult," she says, "to justify research support that is not immediately applicable." MEERC, like three other EPA-funded research centers, is eligible for continued funding over ten years.
<P>
 	"We may find that you cannot extrapolate anything meaningfully from the lab to the real world," says Morehouse, "though we know that if CEES comes up with anything, it will be valuable.  Unless we understand the basic way that aquatic ecosystems operate, then we have no business setting standards and regulations."  This kind of research is essential, she believes, for EPA and other regulatory agencies.
<P>
"Understanding the system and predicting effects gives us a better chance of setting accurate regulations and defending them. After all," she adds jokingly, "EPA is famous for making indefensible decisions."
<P>
It is years too soon to know whether CEES researchers can successfully develop models to characterize the wildly complex dynamics of these mesocosms and then discover if there are rules that enable them to extrapolate among differently-scaled systems. The answers may depend on increasingly sophisticated mathematics and, perhaps, luck - but that is another story.

<H2>Aquaculture And The University Of Maryland</H2>

What's going on in aquaculture within the University of Maryland System?  We'd like to give you a complete rundown on all the things going on at our institution but just don't have enough space in this newsletter to do that!  But we will give you a brief tour of our facilities and the units involved in aquaculture and hope you'll want to find out more.
<P>
The University of Maryland considers aquaculture to be an important part of our agricultural industry.  Aquaculture has long been a part of our state and the business has experienced a sustained growth over the past decade.  The University will continue to be a part of that development with strong research and outreach programs designed to answer critical questions for our industry and provide the best teaching and educational products for that support.
<P>
The University currently operates several facilities dedicated to aquaculture:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies' Horn Point Environmental Lab near Cambridge is the site of oyster and striped bass hatcheries.  Constructed in 1976 to conduct research on oysters, the facility has had and continues to have a prominent place in the development of aquaculture on these important animals.  It is one of the only commercial scale oyster hatcheries located on brackish water.  Current research includes production of seed oysters for rehabilitating areas devastated by disease and domestication work on striped bass for aquaculture.  The faculty involved in these projects have joint appointments with the Sea Grant Extension Program as Shellfish and Finfish Aquaculture Specialists.
<P>
<LI>The Crane Aquaculture Facility, located in Baltimore County, was constructed and formerly operated by the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company.  It is currently operated by the Agricultural Experiment Station and conducts work on the domestication of striped bass.  The stocks include some of the most important groups of domesticated animals developed to date and the facility has had the active support of the expanding striped bass aquaculture industry.
<P>
<LI>The Aquaculture Facility at Fells Point belongs to the Maryland Biotechnology Institute.  Here, research into the high tech world of genetics and bioengineering is carried out which will help carry the industry into the future.  Among the most prominent project are those which will allow the spawning of striped bass on demand, thereby reducing the reliance upon an annual spawning run of natural stocks.  Also among projects carried out here are studied to produce oysters which will survive in the face of the severe challenges of the diseases which have led to the virtual collapse of the shellfish industry in the Mid Atlantic.
<P>
<LI>At the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, the Small Farm Institute conducts work on the application of closed or recirculation system technology to the local industry.  Included in this is the use of hydroponics for innovative waste handling.  Specialists on staff include a fish disease diagnostician and a new cooperative unit with the National Biological Service is led by a specialist in fish nutrition.
<P>
<LI>At the College Park campus the new Animal Science/Agricultural Engineering complex contains "wet" labs for research into aquaculture and seafood topics.  The Ag Engineering Department is engaged in research on biofiltration, waste treatment, and seafood processing technology and has an Aquacultural Engineering option in their graduate programs.  The Animal Science Department has been engaged in several seafood technology research projects and has laboratory space for future work included in their new facilities.
<P>
<LI>A Fish Disease Diagnostic Unit is located in the Avrum Gudelsky School of Veterinary Medicine at College Park and is available for industry to obtain identification and control measures for health problems occurring in their fish stocks.  Many growers have utilized the services of this highly regarded staff of professionals and they are always ready to work with producers to identify and help control diseases which can ruin fish production in a short time.
<P>
<LI>The Pathology Department at the School of Medicine at the University of Maryland Baltimore City also contains a diagnosis unit that works with industry for fish health and control problems.
</UL>
<P>
These units represent a substantial commitment of resources by the University to aquaculture and fisheries and demonstrate the interest in this industry by faculty members.  The Sea Grant Extension Program has formal and informal ties to most of these units in providing outreach programs to the industry.  Outreach activities include workshops and conferences to disseminate current research information to the industry and one-on-one work with producers to help develop new aquaculture businesses and expand existing ones.
<P>
The <A HREF="../index.html">Sea Grant Extension Program</A> consists of three Area Agents backed up by five specialists in disciplines related to fisheries and aquaculture.  The SGEP conducts programs from a few hours duration on general topics to week long, intensive short courses in such areas as Striped Bass and Hybrid Production and Oyster Aquaculture.  Agents and specialists also assist in planning and conducting regional programs such as "Aquaculture In The Mid Atlantic", an annual conference begun in Maryland in 1979 and currently sponsored the Land Grant and Sea Grant Colleges and state aquaculture associations in six Mid Atlantic states.

<H2>Soft Crab Production Workshops Scheduled</H2>
Maryland producers can learn about the latest equipment and methods for shedding soft crabs at four regional workshops to be held this spring.  Sponsored by the Sea Grant Extension Program of the University of Maryland Cooperative Extension Service, the programs are open to all people.  On the Western Shore, programs will be held at the Town Hall in Chesapeake Beach in Calvert County on Tuesday, April 25 and the Charlotte Hall Library in St. Marys County on Wednesday, April 26.  The following week the program will move to the Eastern Shore and be held at the Wicomico County Extension Office in Salisbury on Tuesday, May 2 and at the Senior Center in Centreville in Queen Anne's County on Wednesday, May 3.  Both meetings are scheduled from 7 to 9 pm.
<P>
The workshops will cover flow-through and recirculation systems.  There have been many innovations in crab shedding in recent years and the program will show how to design the best system for you and how to operate it for maximum profitability.  Seafood production requires people skilled in various management techniques and recirculating, or closed, production systems allow you manage your water quality better than any other.  That's why there are several hundred of these systems currently operating in Maryland.  Rich Bohn, Area Agent for Southern Maryland and Don Webster, Area Agent for the Eastern Shore will be teaching the programs.  Both have worked with closed shedding systems for many years and their program will include slides of innovations in the industry.
<P>
Some of the topics to be discussed will be: choosing the system that's right for you; shedding systems components and how they fit together; biofilter design, start up and maintenance; and monitoring your water quality for healthy production.  They will also include handling tips for keeping mortality low.  There will be information packets for those attending which will include designs and monitoring charts to be able to run your system more efficiently.
<P>
While there is no charge for attending either of these meetings, pre-registration is requested to ensure that enough program materials are available for those who attend.  Please call Thelma Robinson at the St. Mary's County Extension Office at 301-475-4482 to register for the Western Shore programs or June Thomas at the Wye Research and Education Center in Queenstown at 410-827-8056 to register for the Eastern Shore programs.

<A NAME="BILL">
<H2>New Aquaculture Bill Filed</H2>

Aquaculture legislation has been filed in Congress by Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii.  The title is the National Aquaculture Development, Research, and Promotion Act of 1995.  It will provide for the coordination and implementation of a national aquaculture policy for the private sector by the Secretary of Agriculture.  The legislation calls for the establishment of a coordinated research and development program that will impact federal aquaculture programs and foster expansion of this important industry.

The bill is similar to one that died as the last session of Congress ended.  Senator Akaka introduced the bill on April 5th where it was referred to the Senate Committees on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.  It currently has seven cosponsors.

<H2>Aquaculture Conference Coming To D.C.</H2>

By Don Webster, Eastern Shore Area Agent
<P>
"Aquaculture In The Mid Atlantic", the largest aquaculture educational program in this area, is joining with "Aquaculture Expo VIII" this June for a special program, open to all persons, to showcase the aquaculture industry in a national forum.  The Mid Atlantic program, begun by the University of Maryland as a one day shellfish workshop in 1979, has evolved into a major event, now sponsored by the Land Grant and Sea Grant Colleges of six Mid Atlantic states.
<P>
The 1995 program will be held at the Washington Hilton from June 24-27, 1995 and will feature a broad range of programs to help veteran growers and beginners alike.  Growers will be coming from all over the US to participate in workshops designed to highlight the benefits of aquaculture production and to let decision makers become aware of the problems that they face as a developing industry.
<P>
On the 24th there will be a full day program, cosponsored by the Aquaculture Engineering Society, on Technologies for Intensive Aquaculture Systems.  This is an update on the previous session held several years ago at Cornell University in New York and is once again coordinated by Mike Timmons.  Also on the 24th will be a special session on Biotechnology In Aquaculture, coordinated by Reggie Harrell of Maryland .  He has put together an outstanding group of speakers who will cover the technical, legal, and ethical topics relating to the subject.  The keynote speaker will be Dr. Rita Colwell, President of the Maryland Biotechnology Institute and President-elect of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  To further broaden the audience, George Flick and Tom Rippen of Virginia Tech will present a program on Issues in Processing Technology.  George is a former Director of the Mid Atlantic conference and one of the leaders in food technology research.  He and Tom will cover the increasingly important safety issues on seafood processing and handling.
<P>
Sunday, the 25th will see a full day special session on Effluent and Waste Management, coordinated by John Ewart of Delaware.  The program will feature an international slate of speakers and will cover all aspects of the topic.  For those who want to learn about production, Dan Terlizzi of Maryland will put on a half day program featuring the Culture of Ornamental Fish and Plants.  Come find out why these products offer such an exciting opportunity.  A program for teaching teachers about Aquaculture In The Classroom will be held.  It is organized by Bob Keenan of the Maryland Education Center for Agriculture, Science, and Technology.
<P>
Monday's program will be packed with information.  Jim McVey of the NOAA's National Office of Sea Grant has produced an outstanding program covering Offshore Technology-The Horizons of Aquaculture, looking towards the future where we may be producing fish and shellfish in coming years.  Also during the morning session will be a program organized by Aggie Spicer of West Virginia, entitled The Realities of Aquaculture, where producers will tell you what the real world of aquaculture production is really like.  The American Tilapia Association will weigh in with a program on that increasingly important species before the educational programs break for a General Session with an exciting keynote speaker.  William Lord-Butcher, President of SeaPerfect Plc of London, one of the world's largest producers of clams and scallops, will address the assembly on "Investing in Aquaculture".  During the afternoon, the National Aquaculture Association will conduct a special program on Aquaculture and the Political Process, letting you become aware of how your government operates and how you can affect decisions concerning your business.
<P>
On Tuesday, June 26, shellfish will take center stage with a program on Shellfish Aquaculture: Problems and Promise.  Coordinator Don Meritt of Maryland has drawn on speakers from all regions of the country and both the public and private sectors to show how shellfish production has declined in some areas while expanding in others.  Bill Daniels and Bernie Petrosky of Delaware State have produced an excellent program on Perspectives on Aquaculture Development, which will highlight the legal and regulatory constraints that retard the growth and development of the industry.  Bill Sieling, Chief of Maryland's Seafood Marketing Office, has developed a program on the Realities of Marketing your product.  If you can't successfully do that, you will never succeed in the industry.  Experts will give you tips on what to look for and how to go about selling your product.  The afternoon will feature another program which will follow up the topic of the Realities of Financing Your Operation.  This is organized by Charles Coale and Pat Lacey of Virginia Tech who have put together some of the best programs that we've had in past years.
<P>
The 28th will feature four great tours organized by Brad Powers and the staff of Maryland's Office of Aquaculture.  There will be trips to highlight Eastern Shore Aquaculture; Cold Water (Trout) Production; Plants and Ornamentals; and one to High Technology and Biotechnology facilities. These will fill early and space is limited to one bus per trip so be sure to sign up soon.

<H2>Aquaculture And World Carrying Capacity</H2>
By Doug Lipton, Resource Economics Specialist
<P>
A new study released by the Worldwatch Institute entitled "Full House" Reassessing the Earth's Population Carrying Capacity" (L.R. Brown and H. Kane, W.W. Norton and Company, New York, 1994) makes for interesting reading regarding the role of aquaculture in meeting world demand for food.  For example, the study points out that between 1950 and 1988, world seafood production per person increased 126 percent.  However, between `1988 and 1993, seafood production per person declined 9 percent.  Not even recent increases in aquaculture production have been able to keep pace with world population increase and the decline in wild fisheries in the past few years.
<P>
At first glance, this would appear to be good news for the future of aquaculture.  Population is going to continue to increase at a rapid rate, with the author's projecting 3.6 billion people added between the period 1990 and 2030.  Seafood will become more scarce relative to the size of the world population, and prices will increase, making aquaculture a more attractive investment.
<P>
A more thorough analysis reveals, however, that aquaculture production will have to compete for grain in other uses such as direct consumption and for production of poultry, meat, and dairy products.  This is going to make aquaculture feed more costly, countering the gains from increased demand due to population growth.  In projecting world food production to the year 2030, the authors do not envision aquaculture contributing significantly more than is currently being produced.
<P>
While one can argue about some of the assumptions used to make these projections, the trends are generally well accepted.  What the authors fail to realize, though, is that aquaculture is still in its technological infancy relative to production of other agricultural products.  Therefore, the potential for technological advances in aquaculture that result in significant cost lowering increases in efficiency is very high at this time.  The implication for practicing aquaculturists is that even profitable technology today may not be profitable in the future.  We must continue to innovate and improve the production process in a changing world.

<H2>Bay Aquaculture Permits Available</H2>
By Rich Bohn, Southern Maryland Area Agent
<P>
The question of whether fish or shellfish culture in Chesapeake Bay may be feasible could be addressed soon.  The State of Maryland has developed regulations for experimental permits to be made available to aquaculturists.  A tidal wetlands permit, a joint state and federal regulatory pathway through the US Army Corps of Engineers (ACE), will be used to issue permission.  While the regulatory requirements of federal agencies have not been clearly defined, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has outlined the information required in applying for these permits.
<P>
The experimental permits will be used to demonstrate the feasibility of aquaculture in Chesapeake Bay, and business plans are a required part of the permit application.  The production system must adequately address safeguards to prevent escapement of stocks and avoid being a hazard to navigation.  The plan must also include monitoring of environmental conditions to assess impacts on the Bay.  The systems should minimize environmental effects, protect wild resources, and not interfere with current recreational or commercial fisheries at the site.
<P>
Ten permits will be made available for culturing finfish, and two have already been granted.  Net cages are the preferred production method, and the fish must be native to the Chesapeake, minimizing adverse effects of unintentional release.  The sites must encompass one half acre or less of surface, and must be above "barren bottom" or those with low or absent numbers of commercial shellfish.  Permits will run for five years, with renewal probably available thereafter.
<P>
Ten sites are also to be made available for shellfish culture.  Due to interest in oyster aquaculture, the Department is willing to allow two aquaculturists to share a single lease, each half not to exceed five acres in size.  Racks or floating systems are permissible, and oyster seed must be approved for culture in Chesapeake Bay.  Barren bottom conditions are also required at these sites.  The permits will be issued for five years, with renewal an option.
<P>
In both cases, permits will be open to comment from involved agencies and organizations, including state fisheries staff, tidal advisory committee, and sport and commercial fishing groups.  A public hearing is required, and under some circumstances a lease may also be needed from the Maryland Board of Public Works.
<P>
Permits will track concurrently through the federal system, via the ACE Navigable Water permit, and be open to comment by other federal agencies.  The state permit requires approval by the Department of the Environment under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act as well.

<A NAME="MONITOR"></A>
<H2>Monitoring Open Water Sites</H2>
The first two open water permits were issued to Bill Voorhies of Wittman and Pintail Point Farm, located in Queenstown.  Bill has spent his first production season raising striped bass in cages off his pier in Harris Creek and has been successful in selling his entire production.  He plans to continue and expand to the limit of his permit and his observations on the natural activity in the vicinity of his cages has been very interesting with many other fish and shellfish inhabiting the area.
<P>
Pintail Point has raised striped bass in net pens in two locations while they pursue the issuance of a permit for a 300 foot long pier from which to moor their pens in future.  In order to find out what the environmental impacts would be from their operation, a cooperative group study was organized last year.  The group consisted of representatives from Pintail Point Farm; the University of Maryland's Agricultural Experiment Station, Sea Grant Extension Program, and Horn Point Environmental Lab; the Maryland Department of Natural Resources; and the Maryland Department of Agriculture's Office of Aquaculture.
<P>
Benthic community structures were analyzed before the pens were used and will be continued for some time after they cease to be used.  Monitors were emplaced around the grow out areas to record ambient conditions throughout the day.  Farm managers took daily water quality measurements and delivered weekly samples to the University lab at the nearby Wye Research and Education Center for analysis, while others went to the Horn Point Lab.  The DNR did a monthly screening of fish health.  The objectives were not only to assess the impacts of open water fish culture on local waters but to be able to develop criteria for siting future production facilities and to minimize the monitoring to those critical factors necessary for accurate judgements.
<P>
The first year program went very well and yielded useful information, much of which came as no surprise to those in aquaculture.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Background nutrient loads from waterfowl in the area were high enough to mask most of the measurements from the fish culture operation.  This should change in 1995 when the pens are moved to the proposed pier site, away from the cove that is currently being used.
<P>
<LI>Fouling on the pens was very heavy.  This came as no surprise to those used to dealing with Bay waters during the summer months.  Better methods of retarding fouling through modification of pen design and cleaning schedules are being looked at.
<P>
<LI>Pintail Point is continuing to hold the fish for another growing season to look at the feasibility and economics of producing two and a half to three pound animals.  The market continues to look promising for larger fish.
<P>
<LI>Fish health screening turned up fewer problems on the farmed fish than they usually find in wild populations.  The scientist involved in this part of the study is looking at an interesting phenomenon in the liver which may be related to winter kill in catfish and could result in management techniques to mitigate it.
<P>
</OL>
This cooperative project has combined many groups and agencies that are actively interested in promoting the wise use of the Chesapeake Bay for enhanced production of fish and shellfish.  By working together to gather meaningful information we can be assured that the industry will be able to grow while protecting the natural waters of the state for the benefit of all for many years to come.

<H2>Chili Today, Hot Tamale</H2>
Although anti-fouling paints have been great for boaters, they can be harmful to the marine environment.  These paints work by releasing toxins into the surrounding water to discourage the growth of barnacles, algae, and other sea life.  Copper-based paints have been used for decades, and in general contain fewer metallic compounds.  In 1988, the use of newer, more toxic organotin anti-fouling paints was restricted.  In many states, only boat yards with special licenses can purchase and apply tributyltin (TBT) based anti-fouling paints.
<P>
A new alternative paint currently being tested uses a unique, non-toxic ingredient: hot pepper!  It is reported that inventor Ken Fischer thought of the idea as he ate a deviled egg laced with hot sauce and mulled over a $1200 bill for painting the hull of his sailboat.  A Maryland based spice company is supplying the hot peppers for the paint, which is hoped to be on the market within a year. (Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission newsletter)

<A NAME="SALES"></A><H2>Sales And Use Tax Exemptions</H2>
<P>Several years ago, Louis Goldstein, Maryland's long time Comptroller of the Treasury, issued a ruling stating that aquaculture was to be considered agriculture for the purposes of sales and use taxes.  Mr. Goldstein has long been a supporter of both agriculture and aquaculture and his ruling was meant to reflect the fact that farmers should be treated equally, whether their crops were on land or under water.  We offer some questions and answers about the exemptions for use of the industry.
<P>
<H3><I>Are sales of agricultural equipment exempt from tax?</I></H3>

The sales and use tax does not apply to sales, including rental, to a farmer of farm equipment used to raised livestock and poultry, prepare, irrigate or tend the soil, plant, service, harvest, store, clean, dry or transport seeds or crops.  Farm equipment is treated as personal property entitled to sales and use tax exemption even if attached to real property.
<P>
<H3><I>What else is included in this exemption?</I></H3>

Both replacement parts and components, including hydraulic oil, are also exempt.
<P>
<H3><I>What about farm vehicles?</I></H3>

The sale to a farmer of a vehicle used only in the farming business and about the farmer's home is exempt.  Replacement parts and additional equipment for these vehicles are also tax exempt.  A farm vehicle is the one that qualifies for a registration plate containing the word "farm" if titled and registered in Maryland.  Vehicles used to haul products for resale or to haul farm products for another person who is not a farmer do not qualify.

<H3><I>Is aquaculture given the same treatment as agriculture?</I></H3>

Yes.  Commercial aquaculture and agriculture are treated the same way for sales and use tax purposes.
<P>
<H3><I>Are there any exemptions for food processing?</I></H3>

Yes.  If a farmer is engaged in processing food for sale, there are exemptions available for purchases of capitalized equipment and consumables.  These exemptions are explained in business tax tip #9, Sales and use tax exemptions for production activities.
<P>
<H3><I>Does the tax apply to sales of livestock?</I></H3>

No.  Sales, for agricultural purposes, of livestock including poultry, are not taxable.  Also exempt are sales of feed or bedding for livestock.  The raising of horses for breeding purposes is an agricultural purpose, but the maintenance or sale of riding, show or race horses is not.  The raising of livestock by members of 4-H or similar organizations for agricultural educational purposes qualifies for tax exemption, but the maintenance and sale of pets, dogs for breeding purposes and animals for testing purposes does not.
<P>
<H3><I>Are there any exemptions for agricultural supplies?</I></H3>

Yes, When sold for agricultural purposes, seeds (including plants and seedlings), fertilizer, lime, fungicide, herbicide and insecticide are exempt.  These items are exempt when used for raising vegetable at home but are not exempt when used to maintain a flower or other decorative garden or lawn.  The tax does not apply to sales of containers used by a farmer to transport farm products to the market or to sales of baler twine or wire.  Fuel for use in farm equipment or a farm tractor is also exempt.
<P>
<H3><I>Are tax numbers needed to claim agricultural exemptions?</I></H3>

No.  It is not necessary for purchasers to register with the Comptroller's Office in order to claim agricultural exemptions.
<P>
<H3><I>What records of sales should vendors who sell agricultural equipment and supplies maintain?</I></H3>

When the record of sale does not clearly include all elements necessary to justify exemption, a vendor may ask for a signed statement to indicate that the customer is a farmer or that the purchases will be used only for agricultural purposes.  Even if a certification is provided, a vendor must, however, collect the tax if he or she knows that the purchase does not qualify for exemption.
<P>
<H3><I>What kinds of items are not exempt?</I></H3>

Only those items sold under the specific conditions described in publication #9 (referenced above) are exempt.  Sales of hand tools, carpentry, cleaning and maintenance supplies, materials to be incorporated into realty and items for personal use are taxable. 
<P>
<H3><I>Are there any special provisions for sales by farmers?</I></H3>

Yes, The tax does not apply to the sale of an agricultural product by a farmer.  Sales of flowers, sod, decorative trees, shrubs and any other product usually sold by a nursery or horticulturist do not qualify for this exemption.
<P>
In case you need answers to specific questions to the sales and use tax exemption for aquaculture, your local Sea Grant Area Agent can be contacted for further reference to the Maryland Treasury Department's Taxpayer Services offices.

<H2>17th Milford Aquaculture Conference</H2>
<H3>
February 24-26, 1997<BR>
New Haven, Connecticut
<P>
Don Webster, Eastern Shore Area Agent
</H3>
</CENTER>
Many years ago, Walter Blogoslawski of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service saw the need for a meeting of oyster growers and hatchery operators.  It was to be an informal get together where they could talk about their successes and problems during the year and discuss possible solutions with scientists.  Although the conference was purposely limited during the early years to those in actual shellfish production, it proved to be too good to hold back.  Today, the Milford Aquaculture Conference stands as one of the region's most comprehensive aquaculture meetings.
<P>
For 1997, the conference will be held on February 24-26 at the Quality Inn Conference Center in New Haven Connecticut.  The meeting will review shellfish disease, shellfish and finfish aquaculture production, and shellfish research activities.  The conference begins in the evening of the 24th with a shellfish get-together mixer and poster session.  Growers from throughout the region will provide clams and oysters for the gathering, giving participants an opportunity to sample their products and compare them.
<P>
The Milford Aquaculture Conference has become known as much for its informal sessions as for the formal presentations.  Groups of people interested in working on specific problems affecting the seafood industry gather during the off hours to discuss options and form working groups.  The Northeastern Regional Aquaculture Center, which helps sponsor the meeting through its Regional Extension Project, has frequently used the Milford Conference as a site for meetings of work groups.
<P>
The 1997 conference will include papers that range from nursery bag culture of hard clams by Gef Flimlin of New Jersey Sea Grant to preliminary culture work on tautog by Renee Allen and Dean Perry of NMFS in Milford.  Bay scallop culture has been progressing in recent years and research on this species will be presented by Milford Lab researchers Jennifer Alix and Sheila Stiles.
<P>
Disease has always been a focus of this conference, affecting as it does many oyster growing areas of the east coast.  Results of the 1996 work on Juvenile Oyster Disease will be presented by Earl Lewis of Maryland's Oxford Cooperative Lab.  This is a relatively new disease which has affected young oysters in the New England area and has been a prime focus of recent Milford meetings.
<P>
Kim Harrison, the new Executive Director of the Northeastern Regional Aquaculture Center, will provide an overview of NRAC activities.  She will also include progress on existing studies, and future directions of that important organization.
<P>
Many more papers will be scheduled.  For lodging and registration information contact Walter Blogoslawski at the NMFS Milford Lab at (203) 783-4235.  Last year over 40 people who tried to register at the door were turned away for lack of room. Don't let this happen to you in 1997!

<H2>Tilapia Takes Hold</H2>
<H3>Douglas W. Lipton, Marine Economic Specialist</H3>
</CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2 CELLSPACING=2>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=CENTER>
Statistics indicate that after decades of breeding programs and marketing efforts tilapia is making significant inroads in the U.S. market. The good news for producers so far is that unlike other aquaculture species that have been introduced in the U.S. market, tilapia prices seem to be holding fairly steady for now. Salmon, shrimp and catfish, the other major aquacultured seafood, all experienced significant declines in price as their markets expanded. These price declines are expected as large expansion in supply exceeds the increase in demand that results from new market penetration.
<P>
</TD>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/tilapiaimport.gif" ALT="[Tilapia Import Prices Bar Chart]">
<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
Tilapia import prices, on the other hand, have increased as expanded production in favorable climates has led to increased exports to the United States. The greatest  price increase has been for frozen tilapia fillets which through the first half of 1996 saw the price 45% higher when compared to 1992. Frozen whole tilapia and fresh fillets had much smaller price increases, but any increase at all is a positive sign when supply is rapidly increasing. 
<P>
It is more difficult to get information on prices of domestic tilapia production. The bi-weekly price survey by the Maryland Department of Agriculture reports on prices for live tilapia, the market of choice for U.S. producers. Price in that market held steady over the 1996 period at about $1.90 a pound.
<P>
So far tilapia expansion into the marketplace has matched the demand resulting in steady or slightly increasing prices. Whether this will continue to hold in the future will depend on the worldwide levels of production.

Commercial Recirculating Aquaculture Systems
<H3>Don Webster, Eastern Shore Area Agent</H3>
</H2>
</CENTER>
Recirculating aquaculture systems are:<P>
<OL>
<LI>the system of the future
<LI>the way to go now
<LI>interesting scientifically but a loser financially
<LI>a one way ticket to bankruptcy
<LI>all of the above
</OL>
<P>
Recirculation systems probably generate more controversy than any other production system in aquaculture.  But frankly they are addictive. You can't be interested in aquaculture and not, at one time or another, have wondered about their practicality.
<P>
The thought process runs like this: "If I could bring these animals inside, I wouldn't have to worry about weather affecting their growth. They would grow throughout the year and I could have a consistent harvest, making marketing easier and taking the bumps out of production. I could put them in tanks and get a lot more fish on a given amount of land." But then you carry the thought further  "if I move them inside and heat the water to keep them in their prime growing range, I can't just dump that heated water. If I reuse it, then I have to remove the impurities that go in from the feed cycling through the fish. And I have to do it and make a profit because, ultimately, that's what this business is all about."  
<P>
Anyone who thinks this business is easy has a lot to learn.  But a book is now available that can help you to do just that, Successes and Failures in Commercial Recirculating Aquaculture. 
<P>
The book is a result of an excellent conference at Virginia Tech this past summer. Under the direction of George Libey, who has been a leader in recirculation technology for many years, the organizers did an excellent job. They figured a couple of hundred people would come  500 showed up.  Yes, there is a great deal of interest in the subject.  The title of the conference was appropriate, too, because there have been some spectacular failures which have served to poison the financial community on aquaculture in general in many areas.  Unfortunately, the successes don't seem to draw the same attention.
<P>
The book is available in two volumes from the Northeast Regional Agricultural Engineering Service, which has brought us similar useful volumes in the past. It covers a wide range of topics such as water quality, waste management, nutrition, disease prevention, design and management, environmental improvement, economics, and computer models.  Along with the papers that were presented at the conference are those from two open technical sessions and the poster session, where topics that weren't addressed in other sessions are included.
<P>
Successes and Failures in Commercial Recirculating Aquaculture should be in the library of anyone interested in recirculation systems.  The $65 price tag (plus $7 shipping and handling within the U.S.) is a bargain compared to some of the higher priced publications on the market that don't have half as much useful information.  Engineers, biologists, aquaculturists, scientists, regulators, and financiers will find the information of great benefit in their aquaculture work.
<P>
Copies of the book, as well as previous volumes on intensive aquaculture and recirculation systems, are available from NRAES, Cooperative Extension, 152 Riley-Robb Hall, Ithaca NY 14853-5701.  The phone number for NRAES is (607) 255-7654, the fax is (607) 254-8770, and the e-mail address is <A HREF="mailto:nraes@cornell.edu">nraes@cornell.edu</A>.

This is the second installment of a series on water quality issues that aquaculturists need to be concerned with. The first -- on ammonia -- appears in the <A HREF="Summer96.html#AMMONIA">Summer 1996 issue</A>.
<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

Healthy water quality is the first concern you will have in the rearing of aquatic species -- it is up to you to ensure that your fish or shellfish or plants have a healthy environment. Fish produce wastes that can be toxic, in particular, ammonia and nitrite; unless they are converted to non-toxic nitrate, you can get high bacterial counts, oxygen depletion, disease, off flavors and mortality.
<P>
Monitoring for important chemical properties like ammonia and nitrites and for water conditions such as temperature and pH is essential -- it provides the early warning signals you will need for actions to protect your aquatic crop. 

<A NAME="5A"></A>
<H4>Introduction</H4>
Nitrite (NO<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>=</SUP>) is an intermediate compound in an oxidation sequence called nitrification and occurs naturally as part of the nitrogen cycle, the movement of nitrogen through an ecosystem.
<P>
First, ammonia from fish excretion or other sources is oxidized to nitrite by the bacterial genus Nitrosomonas. Nitrification is completed by Nitrobacter species that convert nitrite to nitrate (NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>). The rate of nitrification is influenced by water temperature, pH, oxygen and other environmental factors that affect growth and metabolism of the nitrifying bacteria; it is also influenced by the abundance of nitrifiers which are themselves influenced by the availability of attachment surfaces, or substrate.
<P>
When the nitrification activity of natural bacterial populations or in biological filters is inhibited, you may see increases in nitrite.

<A NAME="5B"></A>
<H4>Toxicity of Nitrite</H4>

Once in the blood, nitrite readily oxidizes hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which cannot transport oxygen. This condition, known as brown blood disease, causes suffocation of fish, even with adequate levels of oxygen. 
<P>
In freshwater fish, nitrite levels as low as 0.20 parts per million (ppm) can cause deaths and in sensitive fish like rainbow trout, a level of 0.10 ppm nitrite is a concern. More resistant species such as the channel catfish may survive up to 30 ppm nitrite.
<P>
In marine systems, nitrite is less likely to be toxic. Studies suggest calcium in sea water protects against toxicity, while chloride prevents the uptake of nitrite, thus enabling fish in salt water environments to withstand levels that would be toxic in freshwater.

<A NAME="5C"></A>
<H4>Treatments</H4>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=0>
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
In ponds, nitrite toxicity is routinely prevented by adding sodium or calcium chloride at five times the nitrite concentration. To increase the chloride concentration by 1 ppm per acre-foot of water, use 4.3 pounds of calcium chloride or 4.5 pounds of sodium chloride.
<P>
Other methods are available to keep nitrite levels under control, for example, feed rates may be reduced to lower the ammonia available for conversion to nitrite. Increased aeration may accelerate nitrification rates and prevent nitrite from accumulating. In many recirculation systems or smaller pond systems, replacement of part or all of the water with nitrite-free water is a practical solution.
<P>
</TD>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=4>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<CENTER>
<H4>
Treating a Pond for Nitrite: An Example
</H4>
</CENTER>
Assume that a one-acre pond with an average depth of six feet contains 8 ppm nitrite. The chloride required for treatment is 5 (parts chloride) x 8 ppm nitrite, which equals 40 ppm chloride. To determine how much salt to add to the pond, multiply 4.5 pounds sodium chloride by the acre feet of water; then multiply by the ppm of chloride required. In the case of the one-acre pond, 4.5 pounds x 6 acre feet x 40 ppm chloride equals 1,080 pounds sodium chloride.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2 ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
Biological filtration units can be inoculated with commercially available nitrifying bacteria to improve or reestablish activity.
<BR>
</TD></TR></TABLE>


<A NAME="5D"></A>
<H4>Testing</H4>

Because nitrite is toxic to many fish species at relatively low concentrations, you should test frequently. In recirculation systems that support high densities of fish, you may need to test daily. In open pond or cage culture systems, test nitrite several times a week.
<P>
Nitrite tests available from test kit manufacturers generally involve a simple one or two-step procedure. Under acidic conditions, nitrite reacts with sulfanilamide to produce sulfanilic acid. Reaction with N-(2 Naphthyl)-ethylene diamine dihydrochloride (NED dihydrochloride) produces red-purple azo dye that can be measured using visual colorimetric devices or electronic colorimeters. This procedure is very sensitive and permits visual detection of nitrite levels below 0.1 ppm in fresh and salt water.

<H2>Oyster Disease Research Program:<BR>The Commercial Connection</H2>
</CENTER>

The catastrophic decline of oyster populations in Chesapeake Bay -- the consequence of several factors, among them, overfishing, habitat loss and, in recent years, unchecked parasitic disease -- has been the catalyst for federal support of the Oyster Disease Research Program. Its aim, the support of research and extension for developing innovative techniques to restore oysters.
<P>
The research program, with initial oversight by the Chesapeake Bay Office of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, is now administered by the National Sea Grant College. 
<P>
Measurable progress has been made on several fronts in the laboratory and in limited field trials over these last several years, for example, in developing rapid tests for diagnosing disease, in breeding oyster strains that could have better resistance to disease, in better certifying disease-free oyster spat.
<P>
While the  upcoming request for proposals will continue support of fundamental research, the <A HREF="../../../NSGO/index.html">National Sea Grant Program</A> is also seeking partnerships that will involve the private sector and extension/outreach in transferring basic research findings and new technology to the field.
<P>
Contact <A HREF="../../Research/OysterDisease.html">Maryland Sea Grant</A> or your <A HREF="../../../NSGO/NationalSeaGrant.html">local Sea Grant program</A> for a copy of the RFP, or visit <A HREF="../../../NSGO/research/oysterdisease/index.html">National Sea Grant Oyster Disease Program</A> where you will also find descriptions of current research projects.

<I>Maryland Aquafarmer</I>     begins its 13th year of publication with a new look -- though we have changed the format, we will continue bringing you the latest news on aquaculture developments in Maryland and the mid-Atlantic. 
<P>
Readers of <I>Maryland Aquafarmer</I>     know Eastern Shore Area Agent Don Webster, if not personally, at least through the articles he has been writing since 1984. That was the year he started the newsletter -- and for a time Don wrote all the articles, designed it, and produced photo-ready mechanicals for the printer as well. While he has been a first-rate editor, he is more than equal as a writer -- his writing is conversational and exact, which adds up to a stylistic ease. An article such as the one on recirculating systems in this issue is an example. And by all means, read his pointed review in the Fall 1996 issue on William K. Brooks'  <I>The Oyster</I>     (1905), reprinted by The Johns Hopkins University Press -- you will see what I mean. While Don has left editing, he has not left writing; you will continue to get his take on aquaculture.
<P>
For some years, June Thomas has been working with Don at the Wye Education and Research Center, putting Aquafarmer together for printing and handling the continuously changing mailing list. Keeping up with the latter, which she will continue to do, is no ordinary job, especially as subscriber numbers increase, as do address changes -- we're talking major computer literacy here. When asked for remarks about June's contribution, Webster replied, "you can attribute anything to me about June Thomas, as long as it's great." 
<P>
One more acknowledgment -- and this is for Steve Rothman and his staff at the Cooperative Extension Service's Ag Duplicating and Distribution, which has been printing <I>Maryland Aquafarmer</I>     from the beginning. Steve's shop is not only steady and reliable -- the folks there go out of their way to help. And they do terrific work. 
<P>
Finally a note on the University of Maryland System and aquaculture: together with the University of Maryland Cooperative Extension Service and other units of the UM System -- the University of Maryland College Park, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies and the Center of Marine Biotechnology -- Maryland Sea Grant is strongly committed to the development of aquaculture research and education in Maryland. We are working to assist the industry and the public. Toward these goals, you will continue to hear from us -- we also need to hear from you as well on how <I>Maryland Aquafarmer</I>     can best serve you.

<H2>
Aquaculture Conference, September 26-28, 1996<BR>
Don Webster, Eastern Shore Area Agent
</H2>
</CENTER>
AQUACULTURE IN THE MID ATLANTIC, the largest continuing aquaculture education program in this region, will meet with the U.S. Trout Farmers Association (USTFA) and the Pennsylvania Aquaculture Association (PAA) this fall for one of the best meetings yet!  The two-day program will be held on September 26 and 27 at the Chateau Resort and Conference Center in the Poconos of Pennsylvania.  A full day of tours will be held on Saturday, September 28, and will include stops at three commercial trout hatcheries.
<P>
A fish farming trade show will open at 8 a.m. on Thursday, September 26.  At 9 a.m. the seminars will begin with remarks by Randy MacMillan of Clear Springs Foods of Buhl, Idaho, President of USTFA and Charles Conklin of Big Brown Fish Hatchery of Effort, Pennsylvania, President of the PAA.  Educational topics throughout the day will provide a range of fish health and management information from such nationally known experts as Ken Cline of Cline Trout Farms in Boulder Colorado,  Bill Klontz of Nelson & Sons, Inc., Moscow, Idaho, and Dr. Julia Oriani of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.  Other speakers for Saturday will include Chuck Hicks of Missouri, who will speak on production and feeding rates and Dr. Julia Bebak from the University of Pennsylvania, who will talk about bacterial gill disease in young rainbow trout.  John Cassidy of Perdue Speciality Feeds will give an update on world feed prices and Todd Powless of Ziegler Brothers will present a program on reducing production costs.  There will be a reception in the evening in the trade show area.
<P>
Friday's program, September 27, features concurrent sessions in the morning and afternoon.  A Recirculating Workshop will run from 9 a.m. until noon.  Jeff Hinshaw will discuss production of trout fingerlings in recirculating water systems and will be followed by E.W. Wade, Steve Summerfelt, and Joe Hankins on economies of scale in recycling systems.  B. Watten will provide an overview of the National Biological Service's Wellsboro research program; the session will conclude with T.J. McAdams, R.G. Reinhard, George Flick, George Libey, and S.A. Smith from Virginia Tech discussing the incidence of pathenogenic microorganisms in recirculating aquaculture systems containing rainbow trout.  This program will provide an excellent update on the state of recirculation aquaculture technology.
<P>
Concurrent with the recirculation session will be a general session on the following: John Mitchell will discuss oxygen and production; Tom Tomsas will give a presentation entitled Birds, Birds, Birds,  which will cover the bird depredation problem in the aquaculture industry.  Kim Harrison, Executive Director of the Northeastern Regional Aquaculture Center, will give an update on currently funded research directed at industry problems.  The session will conclude with Mike Willensky of Coastal Engineers, Inc., talking about the use of submerged cages for the growout of trout and a final session on solids removal in aquaculture effluent.
<P>
Two concurrent sessions in the afternoon will address critical topics for the industry. In a special workshop from 1 until 5 p.m., speakers from industry, academia, and government agencies will discuss the important topic of quality control and HACCP, in the trout industry, from production through processing. 
<P>
The concurrent afternoon session will  include a discussion of the National Aquaculture Development Plan by Dr. Hank Parker of USDA and an overview of national aquaculture legislation by Rich Bohn, Executive Director of the National Aquaculture Association.  Pennsylvania topics will follow with presentations by a legislator and a representative of the Pennsylvania Fish Commission.  After a short break, Greg Hanson from Penn State University will cover consumer profiles in fish marketing.  This will be followed by a talk entitled  Anti-trust: You Talk Price, You' re Dead Meat!  by Associate Professor Dennis Corgill of the Widener University School of Law in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  Non-traditional water resources for aquaculture will be presented by Joe Hankins of the Freshwater Institute in Shepardstown, West Virginia, and will wrap up the afternoon session.
<P>
On Saturday morning, September 28 at 8 a.m., the tour will leave and will include lunch during a stop at one of the three production facilities.
<P>
This special program agenda differs from previous meetings of AQUACULTURE IN THE MID ATLANTIC and is a must  for those considering trout production, cold water aquaculture, and recirculating systems, or for those interested in fish health and nutrition issues.  For more information, including registration, lodging, and a brochure on the program, contact any  Sea Grant Extension staff. See back page for phone numbers and e-mail addresses.  This program is open to all persons regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or handicap.  
<P>
AQUACULTURE IN THE MID ATLANTIC began as a one day conference on shellfish in 1979 and has grown to an annual educational program sponsored by the Land Grant and Sea Grant Colleges, aquaculture associations, and agencies responsible for aquaculture development in the states of  Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New Jersey.

<H2>Pond Management Program At Wye Field Day, August 22, 1996<BR>
Don Webster, Eastern Shore Area Agent
</H2>
</CENTER>
Reggie Harrell, Aquaculture Specialist, and Don Webster, Area Agent, with the Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program will conduct a program at the Wye Field Day on August 22, 1996.  Using one of the research facilities freshwater ponds, they will cover the uses and design of impoundments to improve operational management.  Ponds are used for sediment control, landscaping, irrigation, fire protection, livestock watering, swimming, and fish production.  Often, several uses are combined into one pond.  Proper design characteristics can minimize problems or enhance opportunities that develop over time.
<P>
Water quality management is the key to having a well managed pond with healthy populations of fish and minimal weed problems.  Major factors will be discussed and test equipment will be displayed and demonstrated that can help to build a record of your pond's parameters.  Soil testing for proper lime recommendations can help to buffer the water, preventing large fluctuations in pH which can stress fish populations.  Fertilization techniques can also help to increase the aquatic productivity of your pond but must be carefully planned and carried out in order to prevent problems from occurring.  The factors involved in carrying out a successful fertilization program will be discussed.
<P>
While aquatic plants are an important part of the aquatic environment, an imbalance can quickly become a problem.  Various types of vegetative problems found in the region will be covered, along with displays of control agents and a discussion of the techniques and tools available to control unwanted vegetation in your pond.
<P>
One of the most useful and widely practiced aspects of having a pond is for recreational and commercial fish production.  The program will include information on proper species, stocking strategies, and management techniques for building successful populations of fish for recreational opportunities as well as use of ponds for commercial production of fish through aquaculture, a potential economic alternative to other agricultural crops.
<P>
We invite you to come to the Wye Field Day and enjoy a full day of interesting education programs on agriculture including field crops and soils, horticulture, and animal sciences along with the pond management program.  Clinics will be featured during the morning and include landscaping for the Bay, the basics of composting using a low-cost aeration system, identifying home garden pests, basics of nutrient management, and worker protection standards for growers.
<P>
A buffet lunch will be held at noon and an afternoon crab feast will be held after events are over.  Tickets for both meals will be available at the registration area.  The program is open to all persons without regard to race, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or age.  We look forward to seeing you at the Wye Field Day  96.  For further information and a brochure announcing activities at the Wye Field Day, contact your nearest Maryland Cooperative Extension Service office.

<H2>Economic Impacts Of Aquaculture In The U.S.<BR>
Douglas W. Lipton, Marine Economic Specialist
</H2>
</CENTER>
A new report, <I>Economy-wide Impacts of U.S. Aquaculture</I>   (from the Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station at Oklahoma State University), documents the linkages that aquaculture production has within the U.S. economy.   The economic study was limited to the impacts of baitfish, catfish, crawfish, ornamental fish and trout production in 1992.  Other species were not produced in significant quantities to justify the added expense in analyzing their impacts.  This limitation left specific data about Maryland out of the analysis even though ornamental production in Maryland is significant.
<P>
 Based on 1992 figures, the study found that approximately $5.6 billion of the U.S. gross domestic product and 181,000 full-time equivalent jobs were linked to aquaculture production.  Economic impacts of production occur in two directions, downstream to the supplying industries, and upstream to the value-added industries. Most of the economic activity and jobs (69%) are related to the upstream or value-added segment of the industry, transportation, processing and marketing.   Aquaculture producers purchase inputs such as feed from supporting industries, which generate income and other spending within those industries.  
<P>
To demonstrate the linkages of fish production and processing to other sectors of the economy, it is interesting to examine where a dollar in expenditures goes.  Using catfish as a representative species, Table 1 illustrates the distribution of expenditures.  In contrast to production cost, where the bulk of the expense goes to feed, most of the cost of catfish processing is paid to labor as seen in Table 2 from the same study.

Only in the states of Mississippi and Idaho did aquaculture make a significant contribution to a state's gross domestic product (GDP), accounting for 2.5% of the GDP,  6.3% of the total employment in Mississippi; and 0.9% of the GDP, 2.3% of employment in Idaho.  As production of other aquaculture species continues to grow, so will its contribution to regional economic activity as measured by industry output and employment.

Overview
</H3>
In any aquaculture operation, whether it is a pond or recirculating system, water quality is your major concern -- successful rearing of fish begins with a healthy aquatic environment. Intensive culture, however, often taxes that environment:  fish produce waste products, primarily ammonia, that unless  converted to non-toxic nitrate can set into motion processes that lead, in addition to direct toxicity, to high bacterial counts, oxygen depletion, fish disease, and mortality. 
<P>
Management of an aquaculture system begins with monitoring for important chemical properties and water conditions -- such chemical testing is the basis for remedial actions you may have to take. The more you know about the chemistry of your system, the better decisions you may be able to make when faced with a problem. In this and the next several issues of Maryland Aquafarmer, we will cover special topics of concern in maintaining healthy water quality, in particular the nitrogen cycle. The nitrogen cycle is the movement of nitrogen, in various forms, between the atmosphere and terrestrial and aquatic environments in response to biological and physical activity.

<A NAME="PART1"></A>
<H3>
Introduction
</H3>
Ammonia and nitrite two of the most toxic compounds (nitrite is the other), in the nitrogen cycle. This cycle begins with the direct excretion of ammonia by fish, a consequence of fish metabolizing protein and amino acids in their feed. Once excreted, ammonia can be absorbed by algae and aquatic vascular plants as their nitrogen source, or it can be oxidized by bacteria in a process called nitrification to the oxidation products nitrite and nitrate.
<P>
Because ammonia removal is dependent on natural microbial processes in most aquaculture facilities, changes in bacterial metabolism and population can produce increased ammonia levels and lead to fish stress or mortality. Such increases can occur rapidly because of the high feeding rates necessary to support product: high feeding rates lead to high waste excretion by fish. The protein level feed supplies may be as much as 40%; about 15% by weight of the protein supplied is ammonia. Feed not consumed by the fish or the protein and amino acids not used in growth and excreted can contribute to high ammonia concentrations.
<P>
Although fish excretion is the primary source of ammonia in aquaculture systems, other natural processes may contribute ammonia, for instance, the decline or grazing of algal (phytoplankton) blooms and denitrification processes in sediments.

<A NAME="PART2"></A>
<H3>
Toxicity of Ammonia
</H3>
Just how toxic ammonia is depends on the form it takes: the un-ionized form of ammonia, NH<SUB>3</SUB>,  is very toxic, while the charged or ionized form,  NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>,  is generally non-toxic. 
<P>
The form of ammonia depends on pH. As pH increases (becomes more basic),  ammonia is converted to  the more toxic or un-ionized form, NH<SUB>3</SUB>, while at low pH or acidic conditions, ammonia is mainly the ionized form, NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>
<P>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
Ammonia toxicity, though not well understood, involves the movement of ammonia from the water into the gills of the fish.
<P>
How sensitive fish are to ammonia will vary with species, age, water quality, and acclimation to their environment. In general, ammonia levels above 0.5 parts per million at a pH above 8 may result in fish mortality.

<A NAME="PART3"></A>
<H3>
Treatments for Ammonia
</H3>
Methods for decreasing the risk of ammonia toxicity include direct reduction of ammonia concentrations and reduction of pH.
<P>
<B>Reducing.</B> Ammonia concentrations can be reduced by diluting your system's water with water from wells or from water storage. In recirculating systems, you can use biological filters which also remove ammonia by the action of nitrifying bacteria that sequentially oxidize ammonia to nitrate, then nitrate  which is not considered toxic.  Hydroponic systems  have been used to remove ammonia while in some crab shedding systems and marine aquaria, algal biological filters have been used for the same purpose. In freshwater systems, ion exchange media such as zeolite clays can be used. The ion exchange process is the chemical "swapping" of a non-toxic charged chemical like sodium (Na<SUP>+</SUP>) or potassium (K<SUP>+</SUP>) for ammonium (NH4<SUP>+</SUP>). These chemical filters can be recharged by flushing them with sodium chloride solutions to displace the attached NH4<SUP>+</SUP> by substituting Na<SUP>+</SUP>.
<P>
<B>pH manipulation.</B> Maintaining a low toxic ammonia concentration by pH reduction can be accomplished in several ways. Because photosynthesis (the process by which chlorophyll-containing cells in green plants such as algae convert light to chemical energy and use inorganic nutrients to synthesize organic compounds and produce oxygen) increases pH, photosynthesis can be reduced by reducing algal populations.  Another technique is by liming or adding bicarbonate to ponds which will buffer pH at about 8 and reduce daily pH fluctuations, which can be stressful at high ammonia levels.

<H3>
Testing
</H3>
Two methods are available for field determination of ammonia; both tests give a total ammonia reading but cannot distinguish between toxic and the ionized forms of ammonia.  The Nesslerization method is widely used in fresh water ammonia testing.  Sample pretreatment with zinc sulfate is often required to prevent interference by calcium, iron, magnesium and sulfide.  The Nesslerization procedure is not considered suitable for use in salt water without modification.  In saltwater testing the salicylate procedure is sensitive and rapid.  Some testing kit manufacturers are adapting the salicylate procedure to freshwater testing because of the increased sensitivity and lack of interference.
<P>
Ammonia should be tested every day, particularly in high density aquaculture systems. Because of the dependence of ammonia toxicity on pH, you should also perform tests to verify pH is at a safe level.

<H2> Crab Survey Results Announced</H2>
By Richard E. Bohn
</CENTER>
<P>
Preliminary data from the annual blue crab population survey, released by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) early this month, revealed some surprising results.  Increasing pressure on the stock is evident from this and previous surveys.
<P>
The survey suggests this won't be a banner year for crabs, and they've been pretty accurate.  Decreases over all size classes have been noted this year.  More important is that incoming numbers (recruitment) of young crabs have been steady for the last four or five years.  What changed is that a greater percentage of adult crabs are being caught, and this may eventually affect recruitment.  But this hasn't happened yet.
<P>
The total number of crabs varies up and down with no pattern scientists can explain.  When lower, like this year, it takes more effort to catch each bushel of crabs.  There is also a greater tendency to keep everything caught.  What also concerns policy makers is the increasing numbers of female crabs being kept, which are double those of the previous year.
<P>
This pressure is not entirely due to commercial fishing.  In 1994, regulations capped the number of commercial crab licenses.  The difference may be attributed to the recreational fishery, and it's a difficult catch to estimate.  The best guess is that twenty five to fifty percent of the crabs go to the licensed recreational crab and "personal use" (1 bushel per day) fishery.  There's plenty of pressure on our crab stocks.
<P>
Currently, the MDNR is reviewing harvesting regulations with an eye towards the results of next year's survey.  Continuing downward trends, particularly in the number of adult female crabs, are likely to mean more restrictions.  Private and commercial harvesters alike need to remember we are sharing a resource and that it is renewable if we just respect it a little.  Here's how you can help:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>If you catch crabs, especially with enclosing gear like pots or bank traps, check your gear often.  Less problems with crowding, low oxygen, predators and just plain stress means better crabs, and less later loss of crabs you release.
<P>
The type of harvest gear doesn't matter if it isn't tended properly, and bank traps in particular should not be used as a holding pen.  They are not designed to hold animals for long periods and may result in unnecessary and needless mortalities.
<P>
<LI>Respect the size limits.  They're designed to allow crabs a chance to survive long enough to breed.  You want that, too.
<P>
<LI>Think about releasing female crabs, especially sponge crabs (with eggs).  This problem will cause new restrictions, for everybody, if we're not careful.
<P>
<LI>Catch just what you need, not what you'd like.  Don't bring that extra bushel for the neighbor who isn't home after all, or "to fill the freezer".  Although most of you with spouses already know that.
<P>
<LI>Treat what you catch with respect.  If you want to keep them alive, start trying to keep them healthy immediately upon catching them.  Keeping crabs cool and moist, or in aerated sea water, extends their shelf life (and it's good food safety).
<P>
<LI>If you catch peeler crabs, release green peelers.  Their shedding success in good systems runs about 50%, compared to 85-95% for ripe peelers.  We don't feed crabs in shedding systems, and often green peelers are still feeding actively, gathering strength to shed.  Throw back paper shell (buckram) crabs, too.  The meat is just awful.
<P>
<LI>If you're not fishing your gear, take it out of the water.  Pots can continue to catch crabs, even after the bait is gone.  Consider putting in a corroding release panel that opens the pot if it's abandoned or lost.  "Ghost pots" are becoming a hot issue; while the magnitude of their impact is unknown, it is certainly not a positive one.
<P>

The responsible use of renewable resources starts with us.

<A NAME="TILAPIA"></A>
<CENTER>
<H2>Bacterial Problem Strikes Maryland Tilapia</H2>
By Ana Baya, Frank Wills and Richard Bohn
</CENTER>
<P>
Tilapia, also known as St. Peter's fish, are increasingly popular fish mainly raised in recirculating aquaculture systems.  Since the summer of 1994, a significant number of cases of a bacterial disease are being reported to Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratories in College Park and Princess Anne.  The streptococcus bacteria being found does not constitute increased risk to humans, but is responsible for some significant disease outbreaks in the normally safe fish culture systems.
<P>
The disease occurs following an episode of stress (such as temperature or water quality shock, or recent transport) and can affect all age groups of tilapia.  Other fish species in the same culture facility may also be affected.  Clinical signs of disease appear several days after the stress, but may be difficult to distinguish from other bacterial infections.  Some signs are missing scales, small body sores, reddening at the base of one or more fins, bulging eyes (exophthalmia or popeye), milky eyes (corneal opacity), and loss of appetite.  As the infection progresses, red sores become ulcers, eyes fill with pus and may then collapse, and the fish die.  Groups of fish usually show a steady and significant death rate over several weeks, rather than a sudden, massive die-off.  Mortality can occur more rapidly and affect greater numbers with continuing stresses.
<P>
The disease is treatable, and many fish can be rescued with the use of approved antibiotics.  The fish should first be screened by an Animal Health Lab to determine which antibiotics will be effective, rather than applying an expensive and inappropriate treatment which may further stress the fish.  Since intensive culturing systems are prone to episodes of stress, preventing the introduction of the bacteria is the most effective way of avoiding the problem.
<P>
Ideally, new fish to be added to any culturing system should be inspected and be accompanied by a health certificate.  It is also prudent to ask the seller if any bacteria or viruses were isolated from the lot of fish you are purchasing, or are common at their facility even without disease outbreaks.  The ability to be on the lookout for specific disease symptoms will shorten your reaction time for correcting them, if they occur.  If this information is not available, then fish may be tested at the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory in College Park.  <B>Contact Dr. Ana Baya (301-935-6074) to schedule submission of at least four live fish from the seller to the Fish Health Lab prior to shipment</B>.
<P>
Despite whether or not consultants, regulators or fish sellers feel pre-testing fish for diseases is important in closed systems, persons operating those systems are at a disadvantage if this information is not available.  It is a matter of quality control.  Fish sellers should be particularly sensitive to this, since disease outbreaks are usually blamed on the source of fish, and without documentation this is difficult to disprove.  Although streptococcus has been identified in Maryland's wild fish, these fish are an unlikely source of disease in a closed system.  <B>Testing fish for diseases before introduction is prudent management, and may prevent a lot of sick or dead fish on your farm</B>.

<H2>Seafood Update '95</H2>
By Gayle Mason-Jenkins
</CENTER>
<P>
Seafood Specialist Gayle Mason-Jenkins has announced that Seafood Update '95 will take place at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore on August 15 and 16, 1995.  The program is sponsored by the Maryland and Delaware Sea Grant Extension Programs and the Maryland Department of Agriculture's Seafood Marketing Program.  The program is designed for home economics professionals including home economics teachers, extension agents, school food service managers and supervisors, dieticians, nutritionists and other food and health educators.  Continuing education credits have been requested from the ADA, AAFCS, and the American School Food Service Association.
<P>
The program will cover a wide range of issues concerning fish and shellfish and feature prominent researchers and educators from throughout the country.  The Role of Fish and Shellfish in the Diet will be covered by Constance Pergerson, R.D. from the Maryland Cooperative Extension Service while Ken Gall of the New York Sea Grant Program will discuss their Aquaculture Marketing Survey.
<P>
Dr. Sue Snider of the Delaware Cooperative Extension Service will speak on Project Food Safety including lesson plans developed under the program.  The increasingly important issues of Seafood Inspection and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) will be covered by an employee from a major seafood company as well as Austin Heute, an Inspector with the US Department of Commerce.
<P>
Consumer Concerns and the Seafood Hotline will be the topic addressed by Robin Smith of the US Food and Drug Administration, while Jean Pennington of FDA will talk about seafood labeling.  Rick Greene of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control will speak on Seafood Consumption Advisories and Risk Assessment and Dr. George Flick of Virginia Tech, one of the leading experts in the country, will address the topic of Seafood Jeopardy.
<P>
On August 16 there will be a hands-on session followed by a demonstration of the culinary arts by James Hughes of UMES who will show how to prepare aquaculture products.  After a question and answer session, you'll pick up a box lunch and tour the UMES Aquaculture Farm before going to HyRock Aquaculture Farm, one of the prime producers of salt water raised hybrid striped bass.  The tour will finish with a trip to Aquamar Industries in Pocomoke City for a look at tilapia produced in a commercial water reuse system.
<P>
For a registration form and information on lodging and travel, contact Gayle Mason-Jenkins at 410-651-6212 or fax her at 410-651-6207.

<H2>Niche Marketing And Aquaculture</H2>
By Douglas Lipton
</CENTER>
<P>
The ecological notion of niches is that different species utilize different components of the ecosystem in how they reproduce, feed and generally make their lives.  The greater the overlap in niches, the greater the competition between species and the more energy and reproductive capacity must be used to out compete the other species.  This is quite analogous to the concept of market niches.  In the case of markets, overlap is a result of firms competing by offering the same or similar products to the generic marketplace.  Profits are less than they could be because of lower prices when there are a lot of competing alternatives for your product, or additional expenses incurred in marketing or advertising.
<P>
In an industry such as aquaculture, where production may be on the margin of profitability, niche marketing may be a way to achieve higher profits.  Niche marketing consists of two components: 1) product differentiation, and 2) market segmentation.  Product differentiation entails distinguishing your product from the generic forms on the market.  One of the promises of aquaculture is the control that the grower has to produce a commodity that the market desires.  In wild fisheries, one must sell what is pulled from the ocean.  There is some limited ability to differentiate product in wild fisheries such as by quality (e.g. hook and line caught salmon versus the lower quality gill-net salmon).  Aquaculture offers the ability to control the size of the product, the time of availability, the color, the taste and other factors.  Aquaculture has a distinct advantage over wild fisheries in offering live product to the marketplace.  There is a great deal of opportunity, mostly not yet realized in aquaculture, to differentiate product.
<P>
The other part of niche marketing is market segmentation.  There are innumerable ways to segment the market.  Some broad categories include segmentation by geographic region and socio-economic status of buyers.  Some buyers make purchase decisions on price alone while others are also interested in the service you provide.  An important way to look at your market is to segment it by the degree with which the population uses your product.  Who are the heavy users, the light users and the non-users?  Find out why they use or don't use your product to the degree they do.
<P>
True niche marketing combines the components of product differentiation and market segmentation.  It entails identifying a segment of the population looking for a particular set of product attributes, producing a product with those attributes and making the buyers aware of the product.  One of the best examples of niche marketing in aquaculture has been the development of the sale of tilapia and other species live to Asian markets in major cities.
<P>
Niche marketing should be considered along with other marketing strategies for your product.  On the down side, it may be a problem to maintain quality assurance and low production costs over a variety of product lines.  Logistically, it may entail large shipping costs for small quantities.  Ultimately, niche marketing should only be undertaken if it increases the profitability of your aquaculture operation.

<H2>Organic Certification For Fish Culture</H2>
</CENTER>
Fish producers may be interested in organic certification for their product as a marketing tool.  It is one that may be investigated as part of a comprehensive market analysis at the start of a business or for one that is currently in production.  Organic certification is not easily obtained but may provide an outlet to markets otherwise not available.
<P>
There are international certification companies which verify organic production practices.  One such operates in over twenty countries and licenses fifty operations around the world representing over 4000 growers of food and fiber, as well as processors, manufacturers, and livestock producers.

	Organic production uses nature as a model and the production system is viewed holistically.  Crop practices encourage and enhance biological cycles within the farming system and minimize all forms of pollution.  They interact in a constructive, life-enhancing way with all natural systems to produce food of high nutritional quality.  In their production they use, as much as possible, renewable resources in locally organized systems and consider the wider, social, ecological and economic impact of the production system.
<P>
Feeds for production of organically certified fish must use grains which are organically grown and minerals derived from naturally occurring mined products.  Fish meal must be from one hundred percent wild marine fish and kelp meal only from the ocean.  Specific feeding practices are required for organic production.
<P>
Environmental factors are considered in the overall operation.  Specific water quality and recirculating requirements apply, as do oxygen, shade, water exchange and waste regulations.  Although some veterinary treatments are acceptable, there are prohibitions on chemicals, hormones, and antibiotics of any kind in the business.
<P>
During harvest, humane practices must be utilized and processing, handling, and storage functions must meet organic requirements.  Food safety and hygiene standards are strictly enforced.  The final product is audited through the product distribution channels through a lot numbering system.
<P>
If you would like more information on organic certification including information on who to contact about program requirements, call your Sea Grant Area Agent.

<H2>Efficacy Of Phytase On Phosphorus Utilization</H2>
By Joseph H. Soares, Jr. and Kathleen P. Hughes<BR>
Department of Animal Sciences, UMCP<P>
</CENTER>
(<I>The following is adapted from the Proceedings of the 1995 Maryland Nutrition Conference for Feed Manufacturers held March 23-24, 1995 and sponsored by the Departments of Poultry Science and Animal Sciences, College of Agriculture UMCP; the Maryland Feed Industry Council, Inc.; and the American Feed Industry Association</I>)
<P>
Nutritionists are continually challenged to improve the efficiency of animal diets and a great deal of effort has gone into determining as closely as possible the dietary requirements of nutrients for the major livestock species.  These efforts continue but are compounded by legal and ecological demands to reduce nutrient wastes that are discharged into, or intentionally introduced to, the environment.  Phosphorus (P) has been determined to be one of the most limiting nutrients for plant growth.  As such, its presence in the environment through leaching from soils or direct entry into waterways has a major impact on eutrophication.
<P>
Because of this, many state and local governments are enacting legislation to reduce phosphorus pollution.  The State of Maryland has been very active in this regard in an effort to restore good water quality conditions to the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.  In 1968, Nelson et al. published data showing that phytase isolated from <I>Aspergillus ficum</I> could hydrolyze over 90% of phytin phosphorus in selected feedstuffs.  It has long been known that phytic acid salts are synthesized by plants and deposited in the aleuron/pesicarp portion of seed.  Phytases occur naturally in fungi, yeasts, and certain plants.  Reid <I>et al.</I> (1974) and Nelson <I>et al.</I> (1976) reported that ruminants via rumen microorganisms can hydrolyze phytates to produce available ortho-phosphate.  Since two-thirds of the phosphorus from plant origin is in the form of phytates, significant improvement in phosphorus utilization could be made by the presence of phytase in the diet.  Cereals are particularly rich in phytates and it is known that monogastric animals do not have the phytase enzyme to hydrolyze the bound phosphate to ortho-phosphate.  This is especially important since typical corn-soybean meal diets contain enough P to satisfy the requirement for livestock such as pigs and chickens.
<P>
Commercially prepared phytase products are available in Europe and Canada but are not approved for use in the United States at this time.  At least one product is a microbial phytase that has been obtained from genetically modified Aspergilli.  Phytase is active at pH 2.5 and 5.5.  Furthermore, Jongbloed <I>et al.</I> (1993) and Mroz <I>et al.</I> (1993) have established that the enzyme's action is mostly in the acid gastric mucosa of the stomach.
<P>
Although calcium (Ca) also forms weaker ionic complexes with phytate the bound Ca as well as other cations (Zn, Fe, Mg) are also poorly available to animals.  The use of phytase in monogastric animal feeds has several potential advantages:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Phytase will hydrolyze bound P to make it bioavailable and reduce or eliminate the need for supplemental P.
<LI>It will also make other essential elements bioavailable.
<LI>Since P is better utilized, less will be excreted into the environment
</OL>
<P>
Recent studies with broiler chickens and pigs have shown that dietary P utilization can be improved by dietary phytase.  Piontillart (1991) showed that naturally occurring dietary phytase (Triticale vs corn) improved weight gains and bone mineralization in growing pigs.  Recently Ketola (1994) and Riche <I>et al.</I> (1994) showed that rainbow trout had improved dietary P utilization when about 300 U/g phytase was added to the diet.  Here is a summary of some recent publications:
<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/Summer95_P.gif" ALT="[Microbial phytase on P bioavailability table]">
<P>
We are currently conducting studies with striped bass to evaluate phosphorus availability when a microbial phytase (Nantophos TM) is added to plant based diets.  Fingerling striped bass were fed a diet containing only plant source phosphorus with 0, 600, 1200, 2400 U/kg phytase or Potassium monophosphate (1.3% of diet; o.5069 available P) for 14 weeks.  Based on weight and length gains at 8 weeks, 2400 U/kg phytase supported growth significantly greater than the controls gains and equal to the Potassium monophosphate supplemented group.
<P>
It appears that phytic phosphorus can be made available to monogastric animals in sufficient quantity to significantly reduce or eliminate the need to add supplemental phosphorus to chicken and pig diets.  Phytase additions may allow greater use of plant proteins in aquaculturally important fish diets thereby enabling nutritionists to formulate lower cost feeds.  Additionally phytase may decrease fecal phosphate levels in livestock reducing soil and water accumulations of phosphorus that are harmful to the environment.

<H2>Aquaculture Producers Sought For Survey</H2>
</CENTER>
The Second Northeastern Regional Aquaculture Industry Situation and Outlook Report is to be produced soon and the researchers are looking for commercial producers who would like to participate.  This publication is sponsored by the Northeastern Regional Aquaculture Center (NRAC) and supported by the US Department of Agriculture.
<P>
The report will update the first one which was produced in 1993 and will attempt to quantify the species produced in the region and the type of operations producing them, as well as the quantity and value of past, current, and future production.  They will also be looking for information on the number of employees engaged in aquaculture, future industry needs, and your opinions on constraints facing the industry.  The information provided by those who participate is kept strictly confidential and the authors stress that only aggregate data will be provided, with no specific reporting of individual responses.
<P>
The first report was very professionally done and has served to give a "snapshot" of the industry in our region.  It has been very useful in showing policy makers what currently exists and what could be developed.  We would urge all commercial producers to respond to their questionnaire when it arrives and, if you don't know whether or not you are on the mailing list, call or write your Sea Grant Area Agent and we'll make sure that your name and address are forwarded for the mailing list.

<H2>Fishery Market News Available By FAX</H2>
By Don Webster
</CENTER>
<P>
For many years, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has provided information on seafood landings, receipts, and prices to the fishing industry.  We used to get the mailed "blue sheets" (New England) and "green sheets" (New York) years ago and found a treasure lode of information in them.  Now the Fishery Market News has gone high tech as NMFS has developed a fax on demand service to provide members of the seafood industry with up-to-date market information.  Included are daily seafood prices from Fulton Market and the Boston auction prices, along with weekly trade leads and other seafood market information.
<P>
If you're interested in trying this service, call 301-713-1415 from a fax machine phone.  At the mailbox prompt, enter 200 followed by the pound symbol, #.  The menu will automatically be sent to your fax machine.  While the service is free, bear in mind that long distance charges will apply.
<P>
One of the most critical needs in aquaculture is knowing who your competition is and what is happening to prices in the market place.  This is a service that should be of interest to anyone in the business of producing seafood in the region.

<H2>Aquaculture And The '95 Farm Bill</H2>
</CENTER>
The 1995 Farm Bill will likely include aquaculture as an important component.   It will call for reauthorization of the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 and the Regional Aquaculture Centers.  Maryland scientists, extension agents, and industry members have long been associated with projects of the Northeastern Regional Aquaculture Center (NRAC) and all look forward to strengthening of them.
<P>
According to the Clinton Administration, "Aquaculture is poised to become a major growth industry", and it is considered to be one of the most promising segments of American agriculture.  They add that, "The United States has an important opportunity to develop a globally competitive aquaculture industry to serve national needs and the international market.
<P>
"Sustainable, environmentally responsible aquaculture development holds particular promise for rural communities.  New aquaculture technologies can create challenging, rewarding new jobs and foster rural economic development by stimulating new business ventures among small, rural and/or minority-owned companies," according to the proposal.
<P>
Meanwhile, Dan Glickman, the new US Secretary of Agriculture, says he is "committed to strong leadership by the Department of Agriculture of Federal programs to support the private US aquaculture industry."  In a recently issued statement, the Secretary pointed out that government needed to maximize efficient use of all Federal programs to support the aquaculture industry.  He noted that this can become an internationally competitive, sustainable industry and that his Department strongly supports cooperation and collaboration with other agencies in the development and implementation of programs and policies that can support private aquaculture.
<P>
The Secretary, who serves as the Chairman of the Joint Subcommittee on Aquaculture (JSA), is committed to fostering teamwork among Federal agencies, through the activities of the JSA, to stimulate development of the industry.  The 1995 Farm Bill will be a primary vehicle for industry support activities to be developed and implemented.

<H2>Blue-Green Algae Blooms</H2></A>
By Dan Terlizzi 
</CENTER>
<P>
Most of us are familiar with the cyclical pattern in ponds of alternating "blooms: of various species of algae.  In the early spring we might find the water colored a golden brown from a bloom of diatoms of olive and green depending on the dominant species.  Later in the season, after these blooms of phytoplankton have been consumed by microscopic crustaceans--shrimp-like creatures-- and the nutrients they contain released back into the water, we may find extensive growths of mat forming algae.  Healthy algal populations are as fundamental to the production rate of the pond as good pasture is to production of beef or dairy, however, excessive algal growth in any form can frequently present the pond owner with difficult management problems.
<P>
In this region when we discuss algae management in ponds we generally refer to the filamentous, mat forming algae or the typical microscopic forms called phytoplankton.  However there is another important type of algae whose blooms can cause problems from off-flavor in pond raised fish to extensive fish mortality.  I am referring to a group called blue-green algae.  Many believe that blue-green algae should not be considered algae at all because many aspects of their cellular structure and metabolism are more similar to bacteria than algae.  One of the conditions that favors blue-green algal blooms in ponds is eutrophication, or high levels of nitrogen and phosphorous, a condition that is fairly typical of ponds in the region, however not all ponds have high nutrient levels appears to be susceptible to blue-green algae.  Factors other than nutrients play an important role in the growth of blue-green algae--high temperature coupled with still weather conditions often result in blue-green algal blooms.
<P>
Even the nutritional needs of blue-green algae cannot be stated without some hedging.  For example some blue-greens can use atmospheric nitrogen to support growth so it is possible that even nitrogen poor environments can experience problems.  Another condition that seems to favor blue-greens is water column stratification or the layering of warm water over cooler deeper water that is associated with the warmer weather of summer.  High organic matter, a condition of particular concern to aquaculture ponds may also be a factor.  As a generalization, the Mid-Atlantic doesn't appear to have problems with the blue green algae as severe as those encountered in the warmer southern states.  However, some pond uses may increase the frequency of blue-green algal blooms in the region, particularly aquaculture, since fish culture increases nutrient levels and organic material often associated with blue-greens.
<P>
Blue-green algae are fairly easy to recognize.  In spite of their name, their color can range from black to pale green.  Most often in ponds they are a light green color that forms distinctive swirling patterns on the water surface.  Often there is a distinctive petroleum-like odor associated with the bloom -- in fact the odor may be present even before the bloom become a problem.  Unfortunately, aside from preventing conditions that may encourage blue-green algal growth there is very little that can be done about blue-greens.  The only chemical treatment developed is Solricin 135 (potassium ricinoleate) a soap made from potassium hydroxide and castor oil.  This product resembles inhibitors naturally produced by aquatic plants, however it has not been very successful in treating blue green algal blooms in aquaculture ponds.
<P>
Understanding blue-green algae may be particularly important for those of you that use ponds for watering livestock.  Some blue green algae produce toxins that can cause digestive upsets even mortality in some cases.

<H2>Biotechnology In Aquaculture</H2>
By Reginal M. Harrell
</CENTER>
<P>
At the recent Aquaculture in the Mid-Atlantic and Aquaculture Expo meeting in Washington, DC, Maryland Sea Grant and the Sea Grant Extension Program hosted a workshop on the <I>Role of Biotechnology in Aquaculture</I>.  As expected, several of the attendees were apprehensive about the workshop or didn't know enough about it to even ask questions.  However, once they found out what the speaker's topics were, attendance to the entire workshop was excellent.
<P>
Many of you are probably like the attendees of the meeting in wondering ... "What in the world is Sea Grant  Extension talking about now?  Biotechnology indeed!  I am finally getting comfortable with normal aquaculture terminology, and now you are going to throw something else at me!  It's hard enough keeping up with aquaculture concepts like biofiltration, carrying capacity, and the like, and now you want me to start considering starwars-type concepts such as transgenic animals, recombinant DNA, and gene-splicing.  Forget it!  Enough is enough!"
<P>
Actually, although these latter concepts are a apart of the molecular aspects of biotechnology, all of the former everyday jargon such as controlled reproduction, ozonation, special formulated growth enhancement diets, founder stocks F1 hybrids, strain specific traits, as well as many others, are also part of aquaculture biotechnology.  Did you realize that improving the efficiency of biofiltration systems and technology, hormonal inducement of spawning, determining efficacious disease treatments, and even simple cross-species hybridization all have their roots in what is now coined biotechnology?  In fact, most aquaculture biotechnology accomplishments have come about without the type, excitement and frequent controversy that can be associated with some of the more esoteric "high tech" efforts we hear about today, such as fish that have some super gene inserted into them.
<P>
How the realm of biotechnology affects aquaculture is much broader than just direct food production issues.  For instance, there is a possibility for aquaculture to play a prominent role in marine biomedicine or biotechnical products.  Several medical as well as industrial products are now commercially produced as direct or natural byproducts of organisms taken from marine animals and plants, such as sponges, corals, and algae.  Instead of harvesting these plants and animals from the wild, what is to prevent an enterprising culturist to devote their production efforts to supplying the raw materials needed for this aspect of biotechnology?  Likewise, another aspect of marine biotechnology is involved in bioremediation of pollutants -- maybe there will be an effort directed to biologically converting aquaculture effluents into a less deleterious form.
<P>
In future issues of <I>Maryland AquaFarmer</I>, we will be addressing how biotechnology in aquaculture has worked to make your vocation (or avocation) more successful, some of the possibilities, and what the future may hold for the industry regarding technological advances.

<H2>Farm Pond Management Tip</H2>
</CENTER>
Summer is the time when farm pond owners should really be actively fishing their ponds.  It is very easy for a pond to get "out-of-balance" from overpopulation of bluegill causing stunting of both bass and bluegill or other sunfish in the pond.  Remember a general rule of thumb is for every pound of largemouth harvested you should be removing about 10 pounds of bluegill (sunfish).  So don't throw those undersized bluegill back into the pond.  Throw them on the pond bank or bury them.

<H2>Maryland Oyster Recovery Partnership</H2>
By Donald Meritt
<P>
</CENTER>
Armed with data that showed oyster harvests in Maryland had reached an all time low, and oyster diseases had reached into virtually all of the State's oyster populations, former Secretary of Maryland's Department of Natural Resources, Dr. Torrey Brown, convened the Maryland Oyster Roundtable in 1994.  This panel of 40 individuals included watermen, environmentalists, resource managers, scientists, politicians, and aquaculturalists.  A series of meetings were held and through much discussion an Action Plan for oyster recovery was formulated and signed by each member of the Roundtable.
<P>
As part of this broad-reaching plan, the Maryland Oyster Recovery Partnership was formed.  Based in the offices of the Maryland Watermen's Association in Annapolis this Partnership has begun the difficult task of coordinating and implementing the many and varied aspects of the Action Plan. The first major thrust of the plan is taking place this summer in the upper Choptank River.
<P>
A cooperative venture involving scientists from the University of Maryland, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, and watermen, and coordinated by the Maryland Oyster Recovery Partnership, the project is preparing to plant some two and a half million seed oysters on a specially prepared area of Choptank River bottom.  The area comprising approximately 10 acres received over 100,000 bushels of dredged oyster shell provided by the MDNR last summer in anticipation of this summer's experimental planting. The seed, produced in the University of Maryland's Horn Point Environmental Laboratory's oyster hatchery, have already begun to be deployed in an isolated nursery area located in the upper Choptank.
<P>
The Choptank River was chosen as one of several Oyster Recovery Areas (ORA's).  The Choptank ORA's are divided into three zones (A,B,C).  In zones A and B only disease free seed oysters can be planted.  No harvesting can occur in zone A but harvesting is permitted in zone B.  Zone C can receive seed oysters even if they are infected and harvest is also allowed.  It is hoped that in doing this oyster seed will be grown to planting size without becoming infected with either of the two disease agents (Dermo or MSX) that have so severely decimated the Bay's natural oyster populations.  
<P>
Hatchery produced seed oysters will be deployed after one or two months in the nursery and will be regularly monitored during the coming months for growth, survival, and disease infestation.  These experimental oyster plantings should provide insight into new and innovative ways to rehabilitate Maryland's once abundant oyster resources and will provide valuable information to the growing number of potential oyster growers in the state.

<H2>Aquatic Vegetation Management Tip</H2>
</CENTER>
By the time summer rolls around, many of you are wondering what happened to my beautiful pond, where did all this algae come from, and what can I do to get rid of it?  Unfortunately, by this time of the year it is too late to treat a pond for vegetation control unless drastic measures are bing considered.  Good aquatic vegetation management and control has to start in early spring and continue throughout the summer into the fall to be effective.  The effective means of controlling unwanted vegetation this time of the year is by direct chemical control or complete drainage and drying.
<P>
Remember that dying and decaying plants can cause severe oxygen depletions in ponds resulting in the death of the fish and other aquatic animals.  If you have to chemically treat your pond for vegetation control in the summer, treat no more than one-fifth to one-quarter of the pond at the time, give the pond at least two weeks to recover from the decaying plant material then treat the next section.  Monitor water quality, get your permits or have a certified applicator apply the chemical, keep records, and always use approved aquatic herbicides for the target species.

<H2>22nd Annual Expo Seminars Offer Production and Profit<BR>
 Don Webster, Eastern Shore Area Agent</H2>
</CENTER>
Seminars at the 22nd Annual East Coast Commercial Fishermen's and Aquaculture Trade Show will be the best in the long history of the show.  They include informative speakers and topics to help watermen and aquaculturists keep more dollars in their pockets and remain up to date on topics affecting the industry.  Seminars are planned with input from industry and are sponsored by the Sea Grant Marine Extension Programs of the Mid Atlantic States, Maryland Aquaculture Association, Maryland Office of Aquaculture, and others.
<P>
The program begins at 10 am on Saturday, January 20 with a session on Tilapia Production and Seafood Marketing.  Speakers are producers of tilapia, a tropical fish with great potential in domestic markets.  The fish are raised in indoor systems in this region because cold winters will kill them.  Explaining "how to do it" will be Doug Burdette of Maryland Pride Farms, Jerry Redden of Aquamar Industries, and John Foltz of Aquafarm Products in Delaware.  Roy Castle will moderate the session.
<P>
Producers will be followed by technical experts.  Steve Hughes will cover nutrition, Tom Handwerker will cover hatcheries, and Frank Wills will tell you how to keep your fish healthy.  These speakers are from the University of Maryland's Eastern Shore campus.
<P>
During the afternoon, the subject will shift to marketing seafood.  Captain Thomas Chou will talk about the growing wholesale markets for live fish.  William Chang of Dynasty Restaurant in Wheaton will discuss marketing to Asian restaurants, and Tim Sughrue of Louis Foehrkolb, Inc. from Jessup Wholesale Fish Market, will cover wholesale markets.
<P>
Concurrent with this program will be another with topics geared towards watermen.  The Oyster Recovery Partnership has been active this year replenishing our shrinking oyster populations.  Innovative work has been done by watermen, scientists, resource managers, environmentalists, and students.  At 11 am Saturday, Bob Pfieffer of the Oyster Recovery Partnership will join Ken Paynter and Don Meritt from the University of Maryland to show you what has been done during 1995 and the projects planned for 1996.
<P>
Watermen who work the Bay know that it can be an unforgiving place which can take a life in a moment.  Keeping safe is a constant job.  At noon, safety experts from Vane Brothers Marine Safety will show you the latest equipment designed to keep you alive.  They will also cover procedures to use to ensure safety for you and your crew as you work the water.
<P>
Quality seafood has always been the hallmark of our industry.  Tom Rippen, Seafood Technology Specialist with the University of Maryland, will chair a program at 1 pm on Saturday.  It will tell you what you need to know to keep up with federal and state regulations and use quality as your advantage to gain and keep better markets.  Tom will lead off with new regulations and how they may impact your business.  Bill Sieling, the head of Maryland's Seafood Marketing Program will tell you about the voluntary grading program for crabmeat and other products.  Jack Fox of Venture Packaging will show the new tamper-evident seafood container designed to assure product quality.  Tom will finish up the program by covering on board seafood handling and quality.  Seafood quality begins on the boat and consumers are demanding assurance that the products they buy are the best.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="GIFs/bluecrab.gif" ALT="[crab]">
1995 brought a lot of controversy throughout the Chesapeake Bay states as the future of the blue crab was high on the list of news stories.  Mike Oesterling of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science has planned a terrific program which will allow watermen to ask questions of the resource managers who make the decisions that affect this important industry.  Beth Gillelan of the National Marine Fisheries Service will show you what the scientists have found out about the blue crab populations.  Jack Travelstead of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission and Pete Jensen of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources will give the state perspective on what has occurred and what is planned for the next year.  These managers have always been willing to talk with the industry about complex problems and this year will be no different. We're sure that you will find this session of interest.
<P>
On Sunday, January 21, we will begin our seminars with a program on Catch and Release Fishing in the Mid Atlantic.  Anglers are finding that they can catch the same fish many times and charter boats are finding that fishermen are developing a new ethic where they don't always measure a fishing experience by the number of fish in the cooler.  Rich Bohn of Maryland's Sea Grant <A HREF="../index.html">Extension Program</A> will man the microphone as he introduces the speakers, who are from Maryland's Department of Natural Resources. Bob Lundsford will give you an introduction to catch and release fishing including current regulations and scientific information.  John Jacobs will discuss local species and how they respond to repeated catch.  Dr. Eric May will show you how types of fishing impact the stocks and Keith Lockwood will cover safe handling tips.  Come hear how to make money out of catching the same fish many times over.
<P>
During 1994, the Maryland legislature authorized experimental use of open water sites for fish and shellfish aquaculture.  At noon on Sunday, January 21, Richard Pelz of Circle C Oyster Ranches, Joe Moore of Pintail Point Farm, and David Chamberlain of Great Eastern Shellfish Company present their experiences in getting permits and starting aquaculture businesses in the tidal waters of the state.  The program will be led by Roy Castle of Maryland's Aquaculture Office.  Watermen can share the experiences and opportunities that are available for production in the Chesapeake and seaside bays.
<P>
We finish Sundays seminar program at 1 pm with a public issue affecting watermen.  During the 1990's commercial fishermen have found themselves legislated out of access to some traditional species. In several states, exclusive fishing rights and bans on traditional fishing gear have led to fishermen out of work or placed increased pressure on remaining stocks.  Gef Flimlin of the New Jersey Sea Grant Advisory Program will introduce Steve Carnahan, Executive Director of the Cape May Seafood Processors Association to give you the commercial fisherman's perception of sportfishing interests in fisheries management and offer ways in which commercial fishermen can work with management groups to retain fair access to stocks.  Judy Widerstrom, Executive Director of the New Jersey Baitfish and Menhaden Alliance will discuss the impact of non-food species as sport fishing interests try to prevent or limit harvest of bait.  To finish off the session, Dr. Bonnie J. McCay of the Department of Human Ecology at Cook College will give you a program on how to participate in the management process to influence decisions affecting your industry.  Dr. McCay has written a publication entitled "Fish or Cut Bait: The Management Process and How to Influence It" and all those who attend the seminar will receive a copy of this informative publication.
<P>
The <A HREF="../index.html">Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program</A> will have a booth at the show.  Please stop by to talk with us about aquaculture and how we can help you find information for you to consider it a business opportunity.  For further information on the Expo, including registration and hours of operation, contact the Sea Grant Extension Area Agents listed in the newsletter.

<A NAME="RISK"></A>
<H2>Paying for Risk in Aquaculture<BR>
 Doug Lipton, Marine Economics Specialist</H2>
</CENTER>
Aquaculture, like other business investments, has its share of risk.  However, risk may be magnified in aquaculture because, with the exception of a few older establishments, it is a relatively new type of enterprise in this region.  The two main sources of risk in your aquaculture enterprise will be production risk and price risk.
<P>
Production risk means that there is a probability that you will not meet your production goals due to mortality from disease or other causes such as poor planning.  Production risk could also result from higher unforseen costs such as equipment breakdown.  Price risk is due to the probability that prices will be lower than expected in your business planning.  Of course, if production and prices can vary, then there is also the probability that they will both be higher than expectations.
<P>
Although they should, rarely do business plans look at the range of expected outcomes.  Instead, they focus on an average outcome, which is almost never obtained.  Using net present value as the economic indicator, there is a great deal of difference in a business plan that states the net present value is expected to be $100,000 from a business plan that has a calculated net present value with a mean of $100,000, but ranges from -$50,000 to $150,000.  Note that in the latter plan, with the range of values, there is a probability that the enterprise will lose money.  An even better analysis would quantify the probability of loss (e.g., there is a 20% chance that the net present value will be negative).
<P>
Each individual aquaculture investor has to determine the amount of risk they are willing to take.  For the amount of money you are investing, a guaranteed $100,000 net present value may be sufficient for you to move forward with the investment, but are you willing to invest the same amount of money when there is a 20% chance of losing some or all of it?  The expected return should be higher for a risky investment compared with a relatively guaranteed return.  For the risky investment, perhaps a mean of $120,000 is high enough to compensate you for the added risk.  The $20,000 difference between the guaranteed and risky investment is known as the risk premium.
<P>
Thus, in order to determine if you are being adequately compensated for your investment in aquaculture, it is essential that you have some idea of the probability of different financial outcomes and compare these with other investments that are less risky.  Make sure you are being paid for the risk that you are undertaking.

<P>
Aquaculture is the fastest growing segment of US agriculture and has been successfully used on small farms as many owners of underutilized water resources like ponds and springs find that it can be profitable with careful planning and marketing.  Success requires appropriate production methods and species.  Production methods can include open ponds, cages, raceways, or recirculation systems.  Species for this area include trout, hybrid striped bass, tilapia, ornamental fish and plants.
<P>
<A NAME="PART1"></A><B>Marketing</B> begins with species selection based on your water resources and location.  For example, a good quality spring located near a population center might be suited for trout in raceways with direct retail sales.  A pond located away from population centers but near outdoor recreation areas might be suited to fee fishing.  In planning, it is important to know your potential customers and their needs.  What fish products do they prefer, what type of processing is required, and how much are they likely to purchase and at what price?
<P>
Small producers in this region have used a variety of outlets to market their products including direct retail sales from the farm, farmers markets, grocery chains, and restaurants.  In addition there has been success in the development of value added products like smoked trout and direct sale through fee fishing ponds.  Fish grown on small farms may be sold whole to be processed by the buyer or as dressed whole fish or fillets.  As part of your planning it is important to consider health department regulations for any processing required to market your product.
<P>
Producers report a diverse customer base ranging from those curious about farmed fish to the health conscious or those with dietary restrictions.  Growers often find they develop a regular clientele who place orders for fish are they are being grown.  Competition is inevitable and even several small producers in an area can lower prices however, high quality products grown locally and carefully marketed can usually be sold profitable.  Growers closer to urban area report that demand for fish often exceeds their supply.
<P>
<A NAME="PART2"></A><B>Getting Started</B> properly is very important.  Early in the planning it is important to answer questions of what to grow, where and how to grow it, and who it is being grown for.  Species selection is important and should be made only after thorough evaluation of markets, facilities, and skills.  Personal interests should be considered.  For example, growers with traditional agricultural backgrounds might be more interested in production of food fish while those with horticultural backgrounds might be more interested in producing ornamental aquatic plants.
<P>
What to grow will be influenced by resources.  A small pond in a suburban area might be best suited to production of ornamental plants, while a large spring in a rural area might be best suited for rainbow trout production.  In food fish, five acres of ponds is generally considered the minimum for small scale commercial aquaculture while a large spring on five acres of land could be developed into a full time business.  Even without water resources on your property you can consider aquaculture.  A production method referred to as water reuse or recirculation aquaculture has been used in tanks, troughs, and pools to raise fish or plants, however these methods can be expensive and difficult to operate successfully.  After evaluating water resources, location, and business goals , some find that their existing facilities are not suitable for aquaculture and look for alternate locations.
<P>
<A NAME="PART3"></A><B>Water Resources</B>, as we have mentioned, are critical to success.  In an aquaculture business water source, quality, and supply are critical considerations.  Sources include groundwater, surface water and fully contained recirculation systems that purify and reuse culture water.  Groundwater may be used via natural springs and well systems.  Springs and wells are usually a good source of pure water, however pumping requirements for wells make springs a more attractive choice.  Surface waters including ponds and streams tend to vary in chemical and physical characteristics.  Most aquaculture species are tolerant or some environmental fluctuation and it is important to note that the successful catfish industry is based upon pond culture.  Aquaculture operations using streams are likely to be limited by discharge and water appropriation permits.  In addition, they can be exposed to contamination from upstream so the grower has limited control over his most valuable asset--water quality.  Let's look at some of the features of water sources and culture methods:
<P>
<A NAME="PART4"></A><B>Pond culture</B> -- This is the most widely practiced form of aquaculture in the US.  Ponds are well suited for the production of a variety of species.  Existing ponds can often be used without modification.  Cage or pen culture is a technique in which fish are grown in enclosures and permits production in ponds that are not well suited for fish culture, such as  where seines cannot be easily used to recover fish.  They also allow for multiple uses of ponds such as for recreation, irrigation, or livestock watering.  New pond construction can be very costly and the returns from a small scale aquaculture business may not justify construction costs for a new pond.  Aquaculture ponds are aquatic systems managed for production that depend on the naturally occurring microbial populations of bacteria and algae for elimination of fish wastes and water purification. Production levels of 2,000 pounds per surface acre are common and increased production can be obtained with more intensive management.
<P>
<A NAME="PART5"></A><B>Flow through</B> -- Includes raceways and tanks with water from a spring or other high quality source continually flowing through.  Fish wastes are flushed through the system by water flow.  Increasingly, treatment of discharge is required to remove wastes before release into the environment.  Many high yielding springs have already been adapted for fish culture and new technology makes the production rates from smaller springs attractive to those interested in a small or part time aquaculture business.  Yields of up to 100 pounds per gallon of flow per minute can be obtained with the best conditions and management.
<P>
<A NAME="PART6"></A><B>Recirculation and reuse systems</B> -- Closed or recirculating systems consist of tanks, particulate filters to remove fish wastes and feed particles, and biological filters to convert toxic ammonia from fish excretion to nitrate which is considered harmless.  Oxygen is critical due to typically high fish density or recirculation systems and is supplied by mechanical aerators or liquid oxygen.  In recirculation systems water is purified and used continually; fresh water is added only to compensate for evaporation and losses in the removal of waste particles.  Water reuse systems use a percentage or their water several times before discharge.  The flow of water through a series of tanks or raceways where each unit is receiving discharge from the preceding one is an example of reuse that is often used in trout culture.  Reuse systems may also use particle and biological filters with aeration to improve water quality.  Recirculation systems are often considered in areas with limited water resources, stringent discharge requirements, or unfavorable environments for species.  Although this is exciting and promising technology, the economics of production have, in many cases, resulted in limited success.  Both recirculation and reuse systems require the grower to have advanced technical skills.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIFs/oyster1.gif" ALT="[crab]">
In addition to the culture system, various items of equipment are required for operation.  Water testing equipment is essential to proper water quality management.  Treatment chemicals are often required to maintain water quality and can include lime, bicarbonate, gypsum, calcium chloride, permanganate, and others.  Smaller growers can often use inexpensive test kits for their water analysis. More sophisticated testing is required in larger operations and particularly in reuse or recirculation systems. Other items include aeration, nets for harvest, processing equipment, scales, and feeding equipment.

<A NAME="REMOTE"></A>
<H2>Sizing A Remote Setting System <BR>
 Don Meritt, Shellfish Aquaculture Specialist</H2>
</CENTER>
Remote setting is a method of producing oyster seed using hatchery reared larvae.  Eyed larvae (those ready to undergo metamorphosis) are placed in a system where they change from a free swimming larval form to an attached spat or juvenile oyster.  The process is called settlement or setting.  Settlement can be enhanced by controlling temperature, salinity, aeration, and food supply.  We will address these issues in future newsletters and a manual outlining the entire remote setting process is being produced by the <A HREF="../index.html">Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program</A>.
<P>
Some of the most frequently asked questions about remote setting concern the actual construction of the setting system.  Questions regarding the size and shape of the tank or what it should be made of are often the first to be asked by potential producers.  However, these are really among the last questions that should be asked.
<P>
It is imperative to understand several factors prior to beginning any setting system design.  First, the grower must determine if there are environmental conditions at the site that are right for setting.  The presence of oysters growing naturally in the area is a good first indication, but is not necessarily indicative of good areas for setting to occur.  Once again, a more complete understanding of these conditions will be found in the Sea Grant Remote Setting Manual.
<P>
Once the oyster grower has determined that the site is acceptable, production goals need to be computed.  Will you be simply producing a few oysters for your own interest or to have a personal supply for the year, or is the intention to produce a large number of spat for growout and subsequent sale?  These are two different situations and require very different approached.  The small producer or hobbyist can set oysters with little equipment.  However, it is probably more economical, and certainly easier, to purchase the spat required from other producers.
<P>
Large growers have several options.  The following example should be used to allow a potential producer to properly size a system to meet his or her needs.  Figures used are only for illustration and will vary from site to site.  Once a grower has completed the exercise, it will be easier to decide on the final design of the setting system.
<P>
The following information is required:

<LI>How many acres of oyster bottom are to be planted each year?<BR>

<LI>How often do you wish to set?<BR>
<LI>What type of cultch material will you use?<BR>
<LI>How many spat per unit of cultch material do you want to produce?
</OL>
<P>
Once these questions have been answered, you can begin to size your system.  For the sake of this exercise, let's use the following data for the questions.  An oyster planter has ten acres to be planted each year and wishes to plant approximately one million spat per acre.  His work schedule dictates that he can only set during eight weeks in June and July.  He will be using oyster shell as cultch material.  By using the following formula, we can determine a good starting point for designing the system:
<P>
number of acres to plant X planting density  /  number of spat per unit of cultch  /  number of weeks to set = bushels of cultch per tank
<P>
So, for this example:<BR>
10 X 1,000,000 / 2,000 / 8 = 625 bushels of cultch
<P>
This system needs to be able to handle 625 bushels of cultch ( in this case oyster shell) per week.  It takes about a week to do an individual setting run.  This can be produced in one large tank or several smaller tanks depending upon the situation and the setting site.  Tanks should be designed to accommodate the cultch material as efficiently as possible.  Every effort should be made to containerize the cultch to make handling as easy as possible and allow the tank to be loaded and unloaded quickly.  By changing any of the factors in the equation, it is possible to estimate the tank requirements for any setting system.
<P>
Remote setting systems can also be used to produce cultchless oysters for use in tray culture or for other specialized uses.  Oyster growers wanting to construct systems for use with cultchless spat should contact the Sea Grant Extension Program representative in their area for assistance.

<H2>Aquatic Vegetation Management Tip<BR>
 Reginal M. Harrell, Aquaculture and Biotechnology Specialist</H2>
</CENTER>
f you have not limed your pond, now is the time to make sure you add the recommended amount and type of lime.  It takes several months for the chemical reactions to work towards bringing your soil to the proper pH and you will need several months before the next plant growing season, which in Maryland usually begins in April.
<P>
Winter is also a good time to try to passively manage your excess aquatic vegetation.  Most aquatic plants go dormant during the winter months with only the root systems remaining viable.  By drawing down your pond to one-third to one-half of its normal depth you will expose a considerable amount of pond bottom to the freezing conditions of winter weather.  Roots and stems exposed to freezing temperatures, even those under several inches of soil, will usually kill most of the plants.  This will help to check spreading and control plant growth during the active season.  You should not have to worry about refilling the ponds as spring rains usually take care of recharging water supply.
<P>
The key is to expose as much of the shallow areas (less than three feet deep) of the pond as possible for a long enough period to allow freezing winter temperatures to kill the unwanted dormant aquatic vegetation.

<H2>Course Overview</H2>
</CENTER>
Marine biotechnology is a rapidly emerging area of great promise for the future.  Potential benefits include advanced in aquaculture, pharmaceuticals, and bioremediation.  However, the general public tends to be confused about and, at times, frightened by the possibilities of biotechnology and are largely unaware of the tremendous advantages and breakthroughs it can offer.  Extension programs have a major role to play in developing lines of communication among researchers, industry, and the public.  However, to do so, extension professionals must be informed and educated.
<P>
In this intensive five day program, SGEP and CES personnel will receive a basic introduction to the concepts of molecular biology and the application to biotechnology.  They will participate in short laboratory exercises demonstrating basic techniques used in the field.  A major focal point for the program will be on fundamental principles and applications of bioremediation. Additional lectures will highlight relevant areas in marine biotechnology including various aspects of aquaculture and marine natural products.

<A NAME="START"></A>
As land use goes, so goes the health of Chesapeake Bay - and, for that matter, the health of estuarine and near-shore waters throughout the world.
<P>
Land in the Bay watershed, as it has been progressively cleared for agriculture and urban development, has become a conduit for eroding soils and contaminants that flow directly into streams and rivers or indirectly through groundwater seepage that leads to the Chesapeake.  An estimate put forward by the Maryland Department of the Environment several years ago held that for every acre of forest cleared for development, some 240 to 420 pounds of sediment enter the Bay.
<P>
The impacts of this runoff on the Chesapeake have been as various as they are many - loss of underwater grasses and habitat for fish, depletion of oxygen and changes in food webs are only a few examples.

<I>Researchers have begun to detail just how different land uses affect soil erosion and nutrient transport to estuaries like the Chesapeake.</I>
<P>
<A NAME="OLD"> </A>
<H3>Old Problems, New Approaches</H3>

That water quality depends on land use is not new news.  A major aim of the Chesapeake Bay Program, like aquatic restoration programs around the nation, has been to stop soil erosion and slash nutrient loading in runoff and groundwater.
<P>
The newer news, however, is that researchers have begun to detail just how different land uses affect soil erosion and nutrient transport to estuaries like the Chesapeake.  In the Rhode River, for example, a sub-estuary of the Bay's western shore, David Correll and his colleagues at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center have for some years been measuring runoff through forests, pastures and crop lands. 
<P>
"Many studies have been done of nutrient cycling and flow through specific ecosystems," says Correll, "but few have analyzed nutrient flows through landscapes containing several different kinds of ecosystems."  Long-term measurements are critical, since flows can vary enormously from year to year.  As Correll pointed out in a recent workshop on Land-Use Effects in the Mid-Atlantic Region, one pasture area on the Rhode River discharged an average of 100 to 200 parts per billion nitrate during  1989-1991; during 1982 and 1992, however, the mean nitrate concentrations discharged from the same pasture were from 1,000 to 1,300 parts per billion.  These wide-ranging variations, the result of annual rainfall differences as well as natural differences in similar-use landscapes, could be missed in short-term monitoring.
<P>
Correll's work in the Rhode River and other watersheds in the Bay basin is providing the kind of numbers that clearly demonstrate how pastures, crop land and forest stands radically affect soil erosion and nutrient flow into the Bay.  Such measurements provide the kind of detail needed to construct mathematical models that can predict impacts of different types of land development on water quality.

<I>The ability to better predict how proposed changes in land use are likely to affect aquatic health could give planners and resource managers new tools for trying to balance economic development, growth and environmental protection.</I>
<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<A NAME="MAPS"></A>
<H3>Of Maps and Models</H3>
<P>
Models, says Robert Costanza of the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, part of the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES), are like maps.  "They are abstract representations of complex territory.  While no one map or model is right for an entire range of uses," he points out, "their usefulness can best be judged by their ability to help solve the navigational problems you are interested in."  What kind of navigational problems?  Perhaps the effect of clearing pasture land for residential and business development in a large river system; or the impact on a local creek of clear cutting a forest stand for a new golf course.
<P>
The ability to better predict how proposed changes in land use are likely to affect aquatic health could give planners and resource managers new tools for trying to balance economic development, growth and environmental protection.  That ability could give a more rational basis for designing zoning regulations or reaching decisions on new roads or waste treatment plants. 
<P>
Costanza and his colleagues at CEES and the University of Maryland's Institute for Ecological Economics have been constructing sophisticated computer-based models that can account for the effect of different types of land uses in a large watershed.  Such modeling depends on the technology of geographical information systems, or GIS.  GIS is a computerized system for digitally storing, manipulating and analyzing "snap shots" of land or water features from maps and, increasingly in recent years, aerial and satellite-based photography. Land features include such information as its use (forest, crop, residential), elevation and slope, and types of soil that can then be displayed in numbers of different ways.
<P>
Costanza and Thomas Maxwell have constructed a "spatial" model that can calculate the flow of water, soil and nutrients through a complex mosaic of different land uses.  The model first divides the landscape into cells of some 100 acres each; based on GIS information, each cell is then assigned a particular use - for instance, forest, cropland, pasture, residential - together with a corresponding set of ecological characteristics.  (The quality of the assigned ecological conditions depends on long-term measurements and analysis, such as those that Dave Correll has been doing in the Rhode River.)<P>
At the heart of such spatial modeling is the ability to simulate the vertical and horizontal movements of water, soil and nutrients.  Using specially designed software programs that Costanza, Maxwell and Ed DeBellvue have been developing, the model can calculate the horizontal exchange of flows among adjacent cells and vertical flows above and below the sediment for different types of land use and climatic conditions.  
<P>
<A NAME="MODEL"></A>
<H3>Modeling the Patuxent River Watershed</H3>

Over the last several years, Costanza, Maxwell and DeBellvue have applied their efforts to a Patuxent Landscape Model and related models.  The Patuxent Model can mathematically mimic the effect of past land-use changes on water quality and then simulate the effects of proposed changes - for example, the clearing of forests or conversion of agricultural lands for commercial development or new roads or residential housing.  They have been using GIS data, produced by the Maryland Office of Planning, data that show striking land use changes between the early 1970s and today.
<P>
The Patuxent River's headwaters originate in Montgomery and Howard counties and meander about 70 miles through seven counties before emptying into the Chesapeake at Solomon's Island.  The 926-square-mile Patuxent watershed is a complex mix of rapidly growing urban and suburban development, agricultural lands and forests - some 46 percent is forested and 32 percent is in farmland.  It is a watershed in which population doubled between 1970 and 1990. With this population growth has come the conversion of agricultural lands and forests for housing, businesses, roads, shopping centers.  The resulting changes in the flow of water and soil off the land make their impact in degraded water quality, loss of underwater grass, and the smothering of fish and shellfish habitat.  
<P>
<A NAME="LINKING"></A>
<H3>Linking Economics to Ecology</H3>

For the most part, ecological models like the Patuxent Landscape Model, while they are used to run different scenarios of land use changes, generally ignore the way human behavior affects changes in land use, says Nancy Bockstael, an environmental economist with the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of Maryland College Park.  Ecologists, she says, might analyze the effects of changes in land by comparing the watershed in 1980 and 1995, or they can assume changes that are likely to occur in the future and run their model to see what the impact will be.  Those models, however, are not designed to analyze behavioral factors that influence land use change - they impose human behavioral change hypothetically.<P>
As Robert Gardner, a landscape ecologist at the CEES Appalachian Research Lab, points out, economic factors "are often a dominant force affecting landscape change." At the same time, "the pattern of resources in a landscape often dominates economic development."  Ecologists, he says, often ignore the connections between economics and ecology.
<P>
With recent support from the Environmental Protection Agency, Bockstael and Costanza have teamed up to connect ecological modeling with economic modeling.  Perhaps the most important contribution of the economists, says Bockstael, is to model human land use conversion and how it is related to both the ecological and economic features of the landscape.
<P>
Working with Ivar Strand and Jackie Geoghegan, environmental economists at College Park, Bockstael is trying to develop a model that will "predict future land use changes in a specific area given such information as its history, zoning and other land use restrictions, features of the surrounding landscape, and its level of regional economic activity."  With such information, she says, "we can predict the probabilities that a parcel of land with certain characteristics will stay in its present land use or convert to alternative uses."  For example, scenarios can be developed which examine how different zoning strategies can affect the probability of land use conversions.
<P>
Such modeling can help us in other ways, says Bockstael.  Suppose nutrient management became mandatory for all agricultural lands - "such a policy could drive more land out of farming, thus increasing the probability of conversion to an alternative use," she conjectures.  The economic model could be used to predict the probabilities of such land conversion; it would then drive the ecology model to assess the affects of that land conversion on water quality.  It could be, she points out, that alternative uses might have a more negative impact on aquatic health. 
<P>
Integrating the ecological and economic models is no simple feat.  To begin with, says Jackie Geoghegan, the Patuxent Land Model operates on a time scale of a day or less.  "The economic models," she points out, "work on an annual basis.  This means that the timing of the exchange of information and these different time scales must be carefully thought out."  There are also issues of geographical scale.  "The ecosystem model divides the study area into cells of some 100 acres each, but for land use conversion decisions, this is much too large relative to individual parcel size," she says. The models are being estimated independently and will eventually be linked in the simulation stage.

<A NAME="FUTURE"></A>
<H3>The Future</H3>

Policies designed to protect the health of coastal waters or other ecosystems are often based on economics, politics and best guesses about ecological impacts of changes in land use.  New modeling approaches aim at giving a firmer ground to best guesses that could influence future development. 
<P>
A major conclusion of the 1991 Governor's Commission on Growth in the Chesapeake Bay Region was the key role of land use to Maryland's environmental future:  "How people use Maryland's land determines the fate of Chesapeake Bay."  The Commission recommended that development be directed away from farms, forests and other important environmental resources and proposed concentrated development as opposed to sprawl.
<P>
According to Ed Rissee of Synergy Planning, Inc., for example, if Fairfax, Virginia (with its suburban sprawl development), were settled like the planned community Reston, Virginia (with its medium density development), two-thirds of Fairfax would likely still be open land available for recreation, agriculture or future planned development. Also, there would have been far less need for extensive roads, new schools or other infrastructures, a potentially large savings for taxpayers.
<P>
What are the specific effects of such different types of development on water quality?  What are the effects on runoff?  On nutrient loading?  On fisheries?  It is such questions that new developments in modeling may be able to help answer.  For planners and policy makers, such capabilities may make it possible to forecast the effects of development and to make better tradeoffs among politics, economics and the environment - achieving a balance that will ultimately save money and help protect the health of the Chesapeake Bay.

<A NAME="START"> </A>
When it comes to seafood, the United States faces a predicament. On the one hand the U.S. is catching the majority of its commercial fish and shellfish species at capacity-or beyond capacity-and on the other hand it still relies on imports to put shrimp, fish and other seafood on the nation's dinner tables. In 1992, for example, over 40% of the seafood consumed in the United States came from foreign fishermen.<P>
According to Bruce Norman, fisheries expert with the Chesapeake Bay Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), there are precious few Atlantic fish species that are not, in the parlance of fisheries scientists, either "fully utilized or over utilized." Of these, says Norman, only the Atlantic mackerel is available in numbers high enough to make a measurable impact on our fishery balance sheet.<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/cook1.gif" ALT=""><P>
The current state of our major fisheries means that, in spite of intense fishing efforts, U.S. demand for seafood exceeds what its fishermen are able to catch. Since our exports of seafood are significantly less than our imports, we are left with a seafood trade deficit. Both Norman and University of Maryland marine economist Doug Lipton agree that the U.S. has faced a deficit for some time and that it is likely to persist.<P>
That deficit is substantial. As recently as 1987 the U.S. deficit in edible fish was close to $4 million, according to Norman. Though that figure had dropped to $2.2 billion by 1992, early figures for 1993 show an upturn to $2.8 billion. "The gap in seafood trade has narrowed in recent years," Norman says, "but it is unlikely to close."<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/cook2.gif" ALT=""><P>
Just how significant is the nation's seafood deficit? In terms of our relative prosperity, according to Norman, the deficit alone may not tell us much. "The deficit is too much of an aggregate indicator," he says, "to serve as the measurement of our accomplishment." Norman points out that the deficit responds to macro-economic policy and exchange rates, and not simply to who is producing or buying more fish. Much of what affects U.S. seafood producers may happen "at the margin." Here the deficit may be affected as we export more fishery products, compete directly with like imported products in our own market, or "sop up" excess domestic demand through marketing and new products. In other words, we can nibble at the edges of the seafood deficit, but far beyond the shores of fishing grounds like the Chesapeake Bay lies a great sea of trade regulations, economic booms and busts, and the uncertain future of a developing world.<P>
Here the deficit may affect us in more indirect ways.<P>
<A NAME="TARIFFS"> </A>
<H3>Of Tariffs and Trade</H3>
What exactly is the effect of trade agreements, such as NAFTA and GATT, on the nation's seafood deficit?<P>
First a word about these two trade agreements. NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect January 1, 1994, represents an attempt to even out trade relations among its partners- Mexico, Canada and the U.S. According to Norman, Mexico, for example, has had a 20% tariff on fishery imports. NAFTA will phase out such tariffs and increase demand - for seafood, for example - in Mexico. NAFTA will also work to eliminate import prohibitions and measures that could restrict trade. "Already, U.S. fishery exports to Mexico are increasing," Norman says, "with the growing prosperity of the Mexican economy." The new trade agreement should help to boost this trend.<P>
For now, Norman says, the U.S. has the comparative advantage. Despite higher wages in the U.S., better equipment, including better processing and canning facilities, gives the American seafood industry the competitive edge. How long this remains the case will, he says, depend on how fast the Mexican economy grows, and how fast it adapts to economic reform and free trade.<P>
NAFTA should open up opportunities for investment in aquaculture in Mexico, including shrimp aquaculture. It will not, however, have much effect on coastal fishing, since the trade agreement liberalizes fishing restrictions only for Mexicans (reducing, for example, the hold of the powerful cooperatives) but it does not ease limitations on foreigners fishing in the Mexican exclusive economic zone (EEZ). But then, the U.S. has not eased restrictions on foreign fishing in its coastal waters either.<P>
The other major trade agreement in recent headlines is called the "Uruguay Round"-seven years of negotiations which led to changes in GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. GATT becomes more important when one thinks of the U.S.'s relationship with Europe and Asia, though it has had some unexpected effects on trade relations with Mexico and Canada as well.<P>
For U.S. seafood dealers Europe is a mixed bag. While it is the U.S.'s second-largest trading partner, the European Union (EU) - which used to be known as the European Community (EC) - is still significantly protected by tariffs. These tariffs, which may hover around 15%, are augmented by a system of other (non-tariff) measures which Norman calls "Byzantine." In addition, according to Norman, European seafood businesses, like other European businesses, may receive significant support from the government, a fact that has caused heartburn among their American competitors.<P>
At present the EU does not export much seafood, and the U.S. does not have major barriers to seafood trade to begin with-and since we do not have barriers, we do not have much to "bargain" with in trade discussions. Still, Norman says, "What happens with Europe will be very important for the American seafood industry, in that it represents the major opportunity for growth."<P>
Asia is another matter. Japan already represents 64%, by value, of the U.S. seafood export market. The Japanese especially like our salmon and crabs, which represent 24% and 13% respectively, by value, of what we export to them. Norman points out that Chesapeake crabbers should not worry which of their Atlantic neighbors are getting rich selling crabs to the orient. Japan buys mostly king and Tanner crabs from Alaska, according to Norman.
The pattern of a limited number of products aimed at a few markets -essentially putting all your crabs in one basket-is common in the seafood industry, though slightly less pronounced in recent years. Signs of change can, for example, be seen in such products as surimi-the raw material for artificial crab meat, generally the main ingredient of "seafood salad." A relatively new product with a proven track record, surimi may begin to challenge crab for second place, according to Norman. But even in the case of surimi, the primary target remains the same market-Japan.<P>
According to Norman, at least in the Pacific Northwest U.S. seafood providers are looking to expand their markets. He feels that smaller markets, such as Korea, Scandinavia, Australia and New Zealand will prove important in the overall mix of a robust export strategy under the new GATT regime. "Further down the road," he says, both China and Russia will be joining GATT, lowering tariffs and other barriers, and adopting new rules against unnecessary restraints. China and Russia, depending how fast and how well their economies expand, could prove to be major new markets.<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to be a major customer at the stalls of the world's seafood market. And the stall we like most is the one where they sell shrimp. Shrimp, almost all of it cultured, represents 35%, by value, of our seafood imports. We get shrimp from all over the world, from Central America, from Ecuador, from Thailand, and increasingly from China. Since we do not have tariffs on shrimp, we have little to bargain there-the U.S. is wide open for shrimp imports . . . which is good news for shrimp lovers.<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/cook3.gif" ALT=""><P>
<A NAME="CHESA"> </A>
<H3>In the Chesapeake</H3>
For those who harvest and process seafood in the Chesapeake region, shrimp is a product we can only dream about. The Bay does not grow commercial species of shrimp, and the weather makes aquaculture of shrimp difficult at best. Competing with warm-weather producers to the south seems out of the question. "The only way we can compete for some of the shrimp market," says Norman, "is to develop a surimi product that is like shrimp."<P>
The problem with producing surimi in the Bay is that we lack the plentiful, cheap, non-oily white-meat fish most popular for making the seafood substitute. Experiments have been tried with menhaden-a very oily fish-but according to Norman, commercialization has been elusive.<P>
Ironically, the very oil that makes menhaden unsuitable for most food applications also makes it a primary export from the Bay region-in the form of fish oil. This oil is sent to Europe, where its main use is in margarine. Other Bay exports include blue crabs and eels. Farm-raised striped bass (rockfish) could become a major export item, Norman says, especially if local markets become glutted. "High productivity can prove to be a problem with farm-raised fish," Norman says. He points to Norway's pioneering salmon aquaculture industry, and to U.S. catfish farmers, who are also actively seeking new markets for their increasing production.<P>
Oysters, the Bayfood that once left towns like Crisfield by the trainload, could re-establish their traditional niche, Norman says, perhaps as a specialty item in the upscale half-shell market. There are, however, two problems. The first is the well-publicized collapse of the Bay's oyster stocks due to overfishing, declines in water quality and most recently, disease. Until the disease problem is solved, for example, bringing oysters back will prove difficult.<P>
The second problem with oysters lies on the demand side. "Substantial declines in production have been paralleled by substantial declines in imports," Norman says. In other words, not only are we producing fewer oysters; we are also importing fewer, perhaps because of health concerns or changes in the American palate. "We could be witnessing an overall decline in demand for oysters in the U.S. market," Norman says.<P>
The best hedge against changing trends and tastes is "product differentiation," Norman says-providing seafood in new and creative forms, not only surimi, but also traditional species in new packages, new recipes. But this brings us back to where we started: to differentiate seafood products there must be product to begin with. The Bay's seafood harvest is ultimately limited by the limits of Bay's production.<P>
"It may be," says Doug Lipton, "that the best way out of the double squeeze of shrinking stocks and increasing consumer demand will be the advent of new technologies, including aquaculture and biotechnology." Without new ways of increasing the availability of seafood on the one hand and protecting native stocks on the other, the nation's seafood deficit may be followed by a seafood collapse.<P>

April 1994, Volume 12, Number 3
<H1>Seafood Trade and the Environment:<BR>
Balancing a Shrinking Resource</H1>

The question arises: even if seafood demand remains moderately strong, will current stocks be able to feed a growing world population?<P>
In a recent Washington Post article ("Today's Catch - and Tomorrow's," Outlook section, Sunday, March 20, 1994), Jessica Mathews, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that 13 of 17 major species worldwide are depleted or in serious decline. The other four are fully exploited, or overexploited. Since 1989, she states, the global fish harvest has been dropping, despite intense effort (and the use of improved technology).
The picture painted by Mathews is bleak indeed: "The catch of 9 of the 12 Atlantic groundfish stocks has collapsed. The take of such species as cod, haddock and flounder is down by 70 to 85 percent. Clam and oyster catches are down by half. Pacific salmon are nearing commercial or biological extinction."<P>
Only rigorous fisheries management, say Mathews and others, can save the stocks. But with world population expected to double by 2035, even brilliant and downright harsh fisheries management will have a tough time preserving stocks and providing seafood to a hungry world. At present seafood accounts for about one-sixth of the world's animal protein, protein which is in short supply - or at least widely unavailable - given that some 800 million people are malnourished.<P>
In addition to concerns about food, there are also other environmental issues which relate to trade agreements such as GATT, according to policy expert Peter Brown, of the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs.<P>
"I don't agree with the world view of which this [trade agreement] is the progeny," Brown says. GATT, according to Brown, places too much emphasis on the old "neoclassical" approach to economics, an approach that has often led us to overexploit natural resources such as fish stocks. GATT, according to Brown, may actually hurt our efforts to address pressing environmental questions.<P>
"Take the tuna controversy," Brown says. In that case the U.S. said that it would no longer import tuna from Mexico, because current fishing practices were inadvertently killing large numbers of porpoises. Mexico complained, through the GATT mechanism, that this constituted a "restraint to trade." Mexico won that round, according to Brown.<P>
The impact of such policies, Brown says, is also apparent in other areas, such as the reforestation program underway in Canada. According to Brown, the U.S. objected that Canada's reforestation efforts constituted an unfair government subsidy to that nation's timber industry. And, he says, the U.S. won.
"The GATT," Brown says, "can potentially interfere with the 'carrots and sticks' we might otherwise use to affect policy, including environmental policy."<P>
We may not, Brown worries, be able to guide the behavior of nations, in the interest of "ecological preservation and stability." Trade agreements like GATT, he argues, may have effects we never intended.<P>

<A NAME="START"></A>
In the final decades of the last century, oyster wars in the Chesapeake pitted watermen against the oyster police and each other as they battled over the riches of the Bay's "winter gold."
No more.
<P>
With those riches gone, oyster wars in the final decade of this century are being fought below water, not by watermen but by poorly defended oysters and marauding protozoans. Known as Dermo (<I>Perkinsus marinus</I>  ) and MSX (<I>Haplosporidium nelsoni</I>  ), these microscopic parasites have been battering oyster populations throughout the Chesapeake. One measure of this onslaught can be seen in commercial harvests - over these last five years, harvests have fallen so low their landed value in Virginia, says Roger Mann of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), "is less than the sale of one median house in Hampton Roads."
<P>
So entrenched is Dermo on bottom grounds in the Bay that even in summers with good sets of new oyster larvae, the chances of oysters surviving to harvest size by the second or third year are at best slim, at worst, nonexistent. According to Eugene Burreson, a scientist at VIMS, Dermo commands all of Virginia's oyster bars except the upper James River. With all the emphasis on Dermo, people have tended to forget MSX, says Burreson - that's a mistake. "This year," he says, "we have had the highest MSX infection since 1959."

<P>
<I>Probing the immune system of the oyster, researchers witness a raging molecular battle between relentless parasites and the mollusc's faltering defense mechanisms.</I>
<P>
Why are oysters so defenseless? Why aren't they able to mount an effective counterattack against Dermo and MSX, as they have against other pathogens? Or conversely, why are these protozoans so successful in eluding defenses the oyster immune system throws at them? And can anything be done to reverse the devastation that these diseases have been wreaking?
<P>
Until five years ago, there were few answers that evoked optimism, and no long-range plan for help. That is no longer the case. In the last several years, says Roger Mann, "we have made quantum leaps in some areas of understanding."  One reason for these rapid advances has been a Congressionally funded program of research on oyster disease that has made consistent support possible on numbers of fronts, from molecular studies on the interaction between protozoans and the oyster immune system, to development of sophisticated techniques for monitoring the presence of Dermo and attempts at breeding strains of oysters that may eventually be able to resist the attacks of Dermo and MSX.

</CENTER>
<I>Once the Chesapeake's most lucrative fisher, the oyster has fallen on hard times.  Maryland's 1994-95 harvest of some 162,000 bushels represents a fraction - about 14% - of the harvests of only a decade ago.</I>
<P>
<A NAME="CELL"> </A>
<H3>The Cellular Front</H3>

Scientists have long known that hemocytes, cells in the oyster's circu-lating fluid, play a major role in fending off invaders. Analogous to the human body's white blood cells, though far less sophisticated, hemo-cytes are the oyster's first line of defense: in general, when a microbe invades, the hemocyte binds, then surrounds the attacker, and engulfs it in a process called phagocytosis.  The cells release bursts of toxic com-pounds, specifically reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) such as hydrogen peroxide, says Robert Anderson of the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES). When Anderson exposes these hemocytes to Dermo, however, the hemocytes engulf the parasite but he doesn't see the ROIs. The question, of course, is why not? Dermo may survive for a number of reasons, says Anderson. The parasite may prevent oyster hemocytes from triggering the ROIs, it may for some reason be able to withstand them, or it may produce substances that are toxic to hemocyte cells. 
<P>
New molecular tools have been making it possible for Anderson and other scientists to better examine the chemical weaponry that both oysters and protozoans deploy. For example, using molecular probes and chemiluminescent analysis to detect and quantify ROI production, Anderson no longer depends on counting cells through a microscope. "You could go blind," he says. "These new methodologies give you a chance to count three million cells, not 300." 
<P>
Many of these studies depend on large amounts of Dermo. Thanks to recent breakthroughs, scientists now have that advantage. The ability to grow Dermo in continuous culture in the lab resulted from a near-simultaneous discovery two years ago by Mohamed Faisal and Jerome F. La Peyre at VIMS, Sharon Shrunk and Stephen Kleinschuster at Rutgers University, and Gerardo R. Vasta and Julie D. Gauthier at the University of Maryland System's Center of Marine Biotechnology (COMB). 
<P>
Before having that capability, it was difficult to obtain Dermo in pure form. Moreover, says Anderson, you could not get enough of it. "Now you can make it by the bucketful - it's duck soup."  Growing Dermo in petri dishes makes it possible to study its life cycle and how different environmental conditions - for instance, salinity, temperature, heavy metals, chemicals - affect its growth and behavior.
<P>
"Culturing the Dermo cell," says Chris Dungen, a research scientist at the Oxford Cooperative Lab, "was a breakthrough whose major benefits we have yet to realize." Two paths of investigation, one in Gerardo Vasta's lab at COMB and another in Mohamed Faisal's lab at VIMS, have been revealing molecular armaments by Dermo that are especially provocative, though the work is in early stages of investigation.
<P>
Mohamed Faisal and Jerome La Peyre are tracking enzymes that Dermo releases when it attacks an oyster cell. Called proteases, these enzymes break down oyster tissue and likely contribute to the oyster's demise. The researchers found that Dermo can grow and divide in hemocytes of infected oysters, suggesting, Faisal says, that "factors other than hemocytes may be important in resistance." 
<P>
While they have observed the presence of Dermo in the Pacific oyster (<I>Crassostrea gigas</I>), that oyster appears more resistant than the Eastern oyster (<I>Crassostrea virginica</I>). Faisal is focusing on the possible presence of special inhibitors in the Pacific oyster. If he can identify these, he could potentially develop "protease blockers" that would act something like antibiotics in fighting the parasite.
<P>
Still another molecular battle may be taking place over iron.
<P>
Iron is critical for growth, both to parasites like Dermo and host organisms like oysters. Because iron is generally much less available than other metabolic needs, competition for iron between the parasite and the host cell is intense, says Gerardo Vasta. Vertebrates have developed strategies against malaria, Vasta points out, by producing iron-binding proteins to reduce the levels of iron available to malarial parasites - "this slows the parasite's growth rate and reduces the pathogenicity of the infection." Recent studies in his lab, he says, "indicate that Dermo has a strong requirement for soluble iron and its growth rates are correlated with iron availability."
<P>
Environmental factors in the Chesapeake may increase the availability of iron. For example, low concentrations of oxygen - or its complete absence (anoxia) - occur in the Chesapeake Bay during summer months and trigger chemical reactions in the sediments that release iron into the water. "This may help explain," says Vasta, "why Dermo is more prevalent during the summer months in oysters that are located in low dissolved oxygen estuaries like the Bay." 
<P>
Vasta speculates that "excessive iron accumulation in the oyster in summer promotes proliferation of Dermo, which may inhibit the oyster from producing the oxygen compounds it needs to defend itself. By better understanding environmental factors such as iron, it may be possible, he says, "to design strategies for blocking their proliferation."
<P>
Both of these investigations, while they hold promise of practical applications, suggest the complexity of uncovering interrelationships between parasitic disease and the oyster immune system. There are other complicating factors. For example, Robert Anderson and Eugene Burreson have shown in lab studies how a pollutant such as tributyltin, a bottom paint for protecting boat hulls, upped the susceptibility of oysters to Dermo. Fu-Lin Chu, also at VIMS, has done comparable studies with poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which, once released from the combustion of fossil fuels, gather in Bay sediments. 
<P>
The interrelated effects of multiple pollutants and the environment remain a complex and tangled web.
<P>
While resource managers await the results of such work in the Chesapeake Bay, the Oyster Disease Research Program has already laid the groundwork for addressing problems in other parts of the country, according to Jim McVey, National Sea Grant Program Director for Aquaculture. "The techniques we have developed for studying Dermo and MSX are being employed to study as yet unidentified microbial diseases that have had severe impacts on oysters in other regions, juvenile oyster disease in the northeast, and summer mortality in Pacific oysters in the northwest."

<A NAME="BREED"> </A>
<H3>Breeding for Disease Resistance</H3>

 "The most important thing we're doing that could make a difference in the relatively near term is a cross breeding program," says Stan Allen of Rutgers University's Haskins Shellfish Laboratory on Delaware Bay. For some years, Hal Haskins and Sue Ford, also at Rutgers, have employed traditional genetic breeding techniques to rear strains of oysters in Delaware Bay that are able to resist the devastating impact of MSX. It is these MSX-resistant stocks, says Allen, which have also gone through one-and-a-half years of Dermo exposure, that will be used in a region-wide planting effort to select for broodstock oysters resistant to MSX and Dermo.
<P>
Working with Ken Paynter of the University of Maryland College Park and Don Meritt, Maryland Sea Grant Shellfish Specialist and CEES scientist, and with Eugene Burreson and Mark Luckenback of VIMS, these researchers are deploying the specially bred oysters in floating trays in the Choptank River on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and in Mobjack Bay, Virginia, and comparing their growth and resistance to disease with local oysters. Surviving oysters will then be sent to the shellfish lab for breeding. "We'll at least get a first read-out on survival," says Allen. "If successful, we'll go from there."
<P>
While Dermo did not appear in strength in the upper Bay until the late 1980s, it  has been an inhabitant of the Gulf of Mexico and other southern waters since about 1950, 
and was spotted in the Chesapeake as early as 1954. Because southern strains of oysters have been subjected to Dermo constantly for so long, these oysters may have developed natural immunities that Bay stocks, which are terribly susceptible, do not have. "The basic assumption," says Paynter, "is that geographically separated oyster populations behave differently with regard to <I>Perkinsus</I>. Some are simply less susceptible." 
<P>
To test that assumption, Paynter is working with Don Meritt and Pat Gaffney from the University of Delaware to try to identify those populations that are less susceptible to 
Dermo and disease progression. Using southern oysters from Texas, Louisiana and Florida and strains from the Carolinas and Delaware Bay, they are placing oysters in floating trays 
at different sites in the Bay, to begin with, in the Wye River, Choptank River and Mobjack Bay. "Our hope," says Paynter, "is to identify popula-tions that are less susceptible to Dermo and disease progression." Pat Gaffney is doing DNA analysis. "If we do find differences," says Paynter, "then we may have a genetic marker to identify resistance."
<P>
As one scientist said, it has taken more than a century to deplete the Chesapeake Bay - it will take consid-erably more than a few years to try to replenish it.

<P><A NAME="FUTURE"></A>
<H3>What's Ahead</H3>

Until the Oyster Disease Research Program, research support on oyster disease had been spotty, largely because funding support had been spotty. It waxed and waned like MSX, which first showed up in 1957 ravaging oyster beds throughout Virginia, moved up into Maryland, then retreated. Only over the last decade have Dermo and MSX dug in for what seems like the long haul. "These diseases are not going away," says Eugene Burreson.
<P>
It is this near-elimination of the oyster fishery that moved Congress to fund the Oyster Disease Research Program. Most scientists and managers agree that in five years it has been a critical factor in spurring rapid progress, not only in expanding our understanding of oyster-parasite interactions and in developing molecular tools to better study such interactions, but also in less heralded advances. "For example," says Steve Jordan, director of the Oxford Cooperative Research Laboratory, a State of Maryland and National Marine Fisheries Service lab, "we now know that Dermo abundance is greatest in the Chesapeake in June, with lower peaks throughout the summer. This is totally new information." Such knowledge could be important for raising and planting seed oysters. "We may be able to develop strategies for better determining where and when we move seed oysters for planting," he says.
<P>
While Stan Allen tempers his enthusiasm because practical applications of research may seem slow in coming, the coordinated oyster disease effort, he believes, has been important in many practical and subtle ways. "Everyone is using the Dermo culture now as the way to deal with handling practices," he says. "There is a unity that has been brought about by the funding source - it represents a core of people who have to function together because the funding and the region are small. It will make a difference," Allen says. "We hope it will make a practical difference."

<H2> Can America Save Its Fisheries?</H2>
Many U. S. fisheries - from coast to coast and in the Great Lakes - are facing historic lows. Will new gear restrictions, limited entry or other management tools be able to turn the tide? Have our fisheries, a public trust resource, become another casualty of the "commons"?
<P>
On September 11, 1995, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., the national network of Sea Grant pro-grams will sponsor a public issues forum entitled, "Can America Save Its Fisheries?" 
<P>
Panelists will include Michael Sissenwine, chief scientist for the National Marine Fisheries Service; Bart Eaton, president of Trident Seafoods; Suzanne Iudicello, vice president of the Center for Marine Conservation; Billy Frank, chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission; William Amaru, a Northeast ground fisherman; Wilma Anderson, executive director of the Texas Shrimp Association; John Magnuson, University of Wisconsin; and many others.

<H2>On Another Front:  Juvenile Oyster Disease</H2>

As if MSX and Dermo were not enough, an apparently unrelated die-off of young oysters begin hitting New England in the late 1980s. Known simply as "juvenile oyster disease," this latest threat adds another culprit to the list of oyster killers. 
<P>
The disease appears to hit hatchery-reared oysters more than those in the wild, according to Steve Jordan, director of the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory. "It's possible that the die-offs are caused by stress," he says, from overcrowding in an aquaculture facility, for example - but he doesn't think that's it.
<P>
"Research has now shown that the disease is transmissible," he says. "We also know that higher salinities cause expression of the disease."  According to Jordan, "Everything bears the earmark of an opportunis-tic infection." 
<P>
"There has been some research that suggests the involvement of <I>Vibrio</I>  species," says Jordan, "but so far that work is still inconclusive."
<P>
Other work, undertaken by researchers like Eugene Small at the University of Maryland College Park, suggests that this juvenile oyster disease may be caused by a proto-zoan parasite, probably a ciliate of the family <I>Ciliaphora</I> . The College Park research team is currently examining oysters to determine the presence of suspect microorganisms.
<P>
 "We recommend that oyster growers work with survivors from stocks that have already been exposed," says Jordan. These survi-vors have the best chance of having developed resistance to the disease, he says. 
<P>
The Frank M. Flower and Sons oyster company on Long Island, hard hit by the disease, is coopera-ting closely with the University of Maryland, the Oxford Lab and others. The approach of using resistant strains seems to be working for the Flower oyster growers, with production once again returning to high levels. This is promising, since at one point the disease was cutting oyster production in some parts of the region by as much as 50 to 90 percent.

<H2>Bay Commission Asks:   <I>Are Blue Crab Stocks Stressed?</I></H2>

Legislators of the tri-state Chesapeake Bay Commission heard a cautionary report on the famed Chesapeake blue crab at their most recent meeting, held May 5, in Piney Point, Maryland. University of Maryland researcher Brian Rothschild told the tri-state body of legislators that while the ongoing Baywide crab survey showed a series of rises and falls, the 1994 data indicated a low harvest, relative to the number of people fishing for crabs. 
<P>
According to Rothschild, in 1994 the blue crab fishing effort was greater than ever, while the catch remained flat. Rothschild pointed out that figures were tentative, since harvest statistics are still being calculated for the Virginia fishery. In Maryland, the 1994 harvest took a strong dive from the very good landings of 1993. 
 <P>
Resource managers often measure catch against effort, with the expectation that more effort should result in higher catches. If, however, stocks are being fished at capacity, additional effort will yield little additional catch. Such appears to be the case for the Chesapeake blue crab in 1994, though researchers and resource managers alike caution against drawing conclusions based on survey results gathered for less than a decade.
<P>
Rothschild and others have been undertaking extensive monitoring of the Chesapeake blue crab stocks since 1991, working with funds from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and others. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources monitors the upper Bay; the University of Maryland Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES) monitors the middle Bay; and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) monitors the southern Bay.
<P>
Monitoring takes place each winter, when crabs are bedded down in the mud and remain relatively stationary. To sample the bottom, researchers use a metal dredge like the one used in Virginia for winter harvesting of crabs (See <A HREF="../Feb-Mar94/index.html">Marine Notes, February-March 1994</A>).  Rothschild noted that the survey gives resource managers data that are independent of harvest statistics (which are affected by variables in fishing effort and success rates).
<P>
W. Pete Jensen, head of Tidewater Fisheries for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, reported that Maryland had established a Blue Crab Steering Committee, and that the state was keeping a close eye on the winter crab survey, the crab harvest and other key indicators. Crabbers, he said, are now required to keep a daily log of their catch, which they turn in each month. "Our thinking is this," said Jensen, "we want to react before there is a crisis."  Waiting until a commercial species drops below critical levels before acting, he said, ultimately costs everyone much more in social and economic impacts.
<P>
Jensen said that he is aware of the ripples created by potential management decisions. "Even discussing additional controls on the crab harvest can cause concern," he said. He described telephone calls from seafood distributors asking whether or not they should be planning to take their businesses elsewhere, if the Chesapeake's blue crab harvest should fall. For now, Jensen said, Maryland is remaining quite cautious about the future. Jack Travelstead, head of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission's Fisheries Management Division, echoed Jensen's concern, and said that his agency had a great deal of confidence in the Baywide winter crab survey now in place.
<P>
At the end of the session, Jensen announced to the Commission that Dr. Brian Rothschild, the University of Maryland researcher who has helped with much of the stock assessment work for blue crabs and other species, would be leaving Maryland. Dr. Rothschild, who has accepted a position with the University of Massachusetts, as director of the Center of Marine Science, Environment and Technology, has served as a faculty member and researcher at the CEES Chesapeake Biological Laboratory since 1980.

<I>Crabs are big business in the Bay - annual harvests of some 100 million pounds bring about $186 million to Maryland and Virginia.  As effort increases, resource managers worry about fishing pressure, especially on female crabs, which are now increasingly making it to market alongside male crabs, or "Jimmies."</I>

<A NAME="START"> </A>
Perhaps the only man legally fishing in Maryland's icy waters for blue crabs early this winter was Tom Maurer. A research assistant with the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, he began his crabbing in mid-December this year, usually meeting up with Lonnie Moore at his workboat on calm mornings and traveling with him out to the mid-Bay mainstem or up some of its major tributaries. Moore is a watermen used to making a living catching blue crabs, but he knows he won't see any of this winter catch ever make it to market.<P>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="GIFs/BlueCrab.gif" ALT=""></CENTER>
For this kind of crabbing, they aren't carrying crab pots or trot lines or long-handled nets-the tools of the summer crab trade. They work instead with an iron dredge -the weapon of choice for winter crabbing. Twenty times a day under leaden skies and light to moderate winds, Maurer has to muscle the dredge up to the stern and heave it overboard. Relaxing, he takes a LORAN reading, then watches the cable whine out until he can feel the teeth bite in and the line go taut. Gunning the engine, Lonnie Moore starts gouging a bumpy swath across 100 yards of Bay bottom. They are dragging a dredge that measures 6 feet wide at the mouth with knife-like teeth 4 to 7 inches long. Inserted in the dredge is a fine net with 15 mm mesh for holding tiny crabs. On more than half the hauls-after clawing through an entire football field of mud-the dredge comes up empty of crabs. The rest of the time, the catch averages about 10 crabs. The highest haul for a single tow in Maryland waters has been 60 crabs.<P>
Since dark comes early these months, the researcher and the watermen are usually tying up at a dock around 4 p.m. From one winter's day on the Bay, they typically bring back only 200 crabs-and a notepad full of numbers.
<A NAME="COUNT"> </A>
<H3>Counting Crabs</H3>
Where do blue crabs go in winter? This question has bewitched biologists for decades. But it's another kind of question that bedevils nearly every waterman every winter, and it goes like this: come summer, how many big, catchable blue crabs will there be in Chesapeake Bay this year? The answer for last year: there were probably 653 million catchable crabs swimming around in the Chesapeake Bay during crabbing season in 1993. The year before there were only 440 million. And the year before that, 1991, there were as many as 893 million. These population estimates include all the crabs in the Bay down to half an inch in size that are overwintering at depths of five feet or deeper. These estimates are among the findings recently reported from the largest survey to date of the Chesapeake blue crab in winter.<P>
Scientists now believe they have more reliable numbers to chart the up-and-down populations of blue crabs in the Bay-thanks in part to all that cold-weather dredging by Maurer and Moore. Their work is just one part of an ambitious Baywide survey. While Maurer continues collecting crabs from the mid-Bay, a crew from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources will start dredging the upper Bay in February, and a crew from the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences will be carrying on their all-winter work in the lower Bay. By the time these three groups wrap their work in March, they will have dug crabs from nearly 1,000 sites in the Bay.<P>
This winter survey is using crude iron dredges and a complex sampling design to address some basic questions asked by biologists and watermen. Directing the project are Brian Rothschild and Jon Volstad of the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory and Rom Lipcius of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, who is coordinating winter work in the southern Bay. With three years of data they say they can now come up with a good answer to the waterman's perennial question: how many crabs this year?

</TD></TR></TABLE>
"The day before the beginning of the season, we could have an estimate of the number of crabs that could be caught on the first day of the season," explains Brian Rothschild, a fishery scientist and chief designer of the sampling scheme. On day one, "we know how many crabs in the Bay are above the minimum size and how many are below the minimum size," says Rothschild. He even has maps showing where all those crabs spent the winter. <P>
He is less confident about describing what happens on day two and after. With the coming of warm weather crabs start moving and growing and dying. As the population starts to change, life gets more complicated for fishery biologists. They are looking for ways to estimate how fast the small crabs grow into legal crabs. "From that," he says, "we would know the rate at which new crabs would be pumped into the fishable population each day."<P>
Figuring out those growth rates for crabs will take more time and perhaps new techniques. Estimating even the age of crabs is notoriously difficult: fish tags tried on crabs usually drop off when crabs moult, and after females stop moulting they stop growing. <P>
Scientists on the survey are hoping to explain and perhaps predict the sudden surge of new crabs that often enters the crab fishery in August and September-sometimes glutting the market and dropping the dockside price, especially after Labor Day when the summertime demand slacks off. "If we had ten years of survey data," says Jon Volstad, "then we could work out better estimates." <P>
For six winters now, the crab survey has been largely experimental, as researchers focused on designing and dredging, then re-designing and re-dredging to devise a sampling plan that would give a good preseason prediction of the Bay's blue crab populations. According to Rothschild the survey is now ready for operational use as an annual management tool.<P>
<A NAME="RUNNING"> </A>
<H3>Running the Numbers</H3>
Scientists go dredging in the dead of winter because they know blue crabs are easier to find. That's the time of year when these beautiful swimmers hunker down in the mud and sand at the bottom of the Bay. "If you are sampling a fish population, you usually have a big problem because they are swimming around," explains Rothschild. "But crabs are like trees, because they are fixed. And it is a lot easier to count the number of trees in the forest than it is to count the birds-particularly if the birds are migrating." <P>
Even with these winter crabs rooted in place, the sampling can get complicated. The key features in the dredging scheme designed by Rothschild and his colleagues include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Random samples dredged from different depths in the mainstem and major rivers of the northern Bay, the mid Bay and the southern Bay.
<LI>Experiments documenting how each dredge tow captures only 15% of the crabs in its path (approximately one in seven).
<LI>Nearly 1,000 tows a year, each running approximately 100 meters as verified by LORAN or GPS readings.
<LI> A variety of statistical techniques to account for the patchy nature of crab settlement patterns (half the tows come up empty; others have hundreds of crabs).
<LI>An annual index giving the average number of crabs dredged out of out of every 1,000 square meters of bottom. For 1991 the index was 13.4 crabs and the Maryland harvest was 91.5 million pounds. In 1992, the winter index was only 6.6 crabs and the year's harvest dropped to 54.7 million pounds.
<LI> Multipliers that convert this annual index into an annual population count.</UL><P>
One result of all that dredging and multiplying has been an index and a population count that roughly tracks with harvest totals over the last several years. (See accompanying box.) Another result has been new insights into where blue crabs go in winter.<P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="GIFs/Crab.gif" ALT="">  <IMG ALIGN=top SRC="GIFs/CrabTable.gif" ALT="">
<A NAME="PLAYING"> </A>
<H3>Playing the Numbers</H3>
These new population counts could become an important part of the growing debate over how best to manage blue crabs in the Chesapeake. There are now at least six crab indexes that help predict blue crab harvests, but this pre-season index and population count may prove among the most helpful for quick management response to changes in the fishery. Because of fears of overfishing, resource managers and lawmakers at both ends of the Bay are considering controversial changes this winter that could cap fishing effort in this historic fishery.<P>
And there is in the winter survey some evidence that a cap could make sense. According to the survey, exploitation rates in the crab fishery are increasing, while crab populations are not.<P>
<UL>
<LI>In 1991, for example, the survey estimated a population of 883 million crabs, and watermen that year caught 274 million of those crabs. That gives an exploitation rate of 30.7% for commercial fishing. Add in another 70 million crabs caught by recreational fishermen-a rough, but conservative estimate -and the rate jumps above 38% for 1991.
<LI>In 1992, when the population count was    only 440 million crabs, watermen caught more than 164 million, giving a commercial rate of 37%. When the recreational catch is factored in, the total exploitation rate climbs above 46% for 1992.
<LI>Final harvest figures for 1993 are not yet finished in Virginia, but the evidence from Maryland shows that exploitation continues to rise. The population came in around 653 million crabs Baywide, a drop of 250 million crabs from 1991, but Maryland watermen by themselves were taking out, 153 million-nearly 10 million more crabs than they caught in the boom year of '91.</UL><P>
Though Volstad warns that exploitation rate is increasing, especially in Maryland, he is leery about adding rough estimates of recreational catch to fairly accurate estimates of commercial catch. "We know there is a substantial sport fishery for crabs because we see so many people out there fishing. But we don't have any realistic estimates (of recreational catch)."<P>
From Virginia Rom Lipcius warns, "There is potential for major decline. We are in a low period right now, and when you continue heavy fishing pressure during a low period, you are in a position to cause a major decline-but not necessarily a collapse."<P>
<A NAME="MEAN"> </A>
<H3>What the Numbers Mean</H3>
Our classic picture of the blue crab in winter has stood largely untouched for nearly 30 years. With the cool weather of fall, mature female crabs begin their passage south, headed for their hatching grounds near the mouth of the Bay where they crowd together waiting for spring. Male crabs, on the other hand, tend to linger in the tributaries and mainstem of the upper and middle Bay until cold weather sends them scuttling for Bay bottom where they can dig in, turn down their metabolism and hibenate over winter. With the new winter data, biologists are beginning to retouch this portrait, filling in empty spaces and even altering the outline with some unexpected findings about the species. <P>
Large numbers of female blue crabs, it turns out, don't finish their fall passage before winter hits. These late-season travelers end up hibernating further north in the mainstem of the mid Bay and even the upper Bay. In the 1993 survey, more than 40% of the crabs found in the deep layers of the mid Bay by the 1993 survey were females who will hatch eggs next season. In the upper Bay nearly 10 percent of the deepwater crabs were maturing females.<P>
Come spring, all those up-Bay females are at risk of capture as they head south for the spawning grounds at the mouth of the Bay. "Those females still have to run the gauntlet - the spring and summer crab pot gauntlet - in order to make it to the lower Bay and spawn," explains Rom Lipcius, a scientist who has studied Virginia's controversial winter dredge fishery. "It's fairly clear that if you want to protect the spawning stock, you cannot just emphasize the dredge fishery in the lower Bay. Many of the females who are going to spawn-sometimes as high as 50%-are still up throughout the Bay."<P>
The winter dredge fishery in Virginia has always been controversial with many watermen in Maryland who read about Virginia dredges scraping up a catch that is 90% females. Virginia watermen, on the other hand, hear that some Marylanders are running between 800 to 1,500 crab pots a boat. During the fall run of sooks headed south and the spring run, all those pots also take a big bite out of the number of females who might end up hatching eggs that season.<P>
The survey's findings about small blue crabs are reinforcing some ancient, instinctual beliefs about the value of seagrass beds. The VIMS crew sampled in shallow beds, not just with dredges, but with suction techniques, and they found high counts of small blue crabs nearly everywhere. "Seagrass is critical for the youngest juveniles, " says Lipcius because that is where they go to escape predators. "Blue crabs would survive without seagrasses, but not in large numbers." <P>
Chesapeake Bay, he points out, is only three or four times larger than Delaware Bay, but the Chesapeake crab harvests are usually 20 times larger. The difference, says Lipcius, is the large seagrass beds that still remain in the lower Bay, beds that offer nursery grounds for millions of young crabs which will eventually enter the fishery. Preserving those habitats, he says, is one of the keys to preserving the blue crab bounty in the Chesapeake. <P>
Insights like these about seagrasses and life cycles are the reasons for annual surveys like this. Winter surveys, with all the cold weather dredging and the number crunching that follows, are perhaps the grunt work of Bay science, justified because they bring new answers to old questions, questions like how many crabs do we have and where do they go.<P>
As the dredges go down, year after year, and the reports come in, year after year, these surveys of the blue crab in winter will keep altering our classic picture of the species, often in small ways, adding details and deeper coloring, illuminating how we need to act to save the Bay's last great fishery.<P>

<H1>The Battle over Blue Crabs:<BR>
<CITE>Capping the Last Great Fishery</CITE></H1>
By Michael W. Fincham<BR>
Maryland Sea Grant College<P>

A major debate about the blue crab fishery has been heating up in the halls of Annapolis and Richmond over the fall and winter. Worried about increasing fishing pressure on fluctuating crab stocks, resource managers and lawmakers at both ends of the Bay have been considering controversial changes in this historic fishery.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=4>

</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
In Maryland these changes could include requiring a license for the first time for any and all recreational crabbing-even for old fashioned Maryland traditions like end-of-the day, end-of-the-dock crab netting. The rough estimate is that up to a half-million Marylanders net a few crabs here and pot a few crabs there. Their total take could equal 25% to 50% of the commercial harvests. In a good year that means 12 to 25 million pounds or more in Maryland alone. Virginia made a start on recreational licenses last year, requiring licenses for any crabber who used more than two pots or caught more than one bushel a day.<P>
There may be more debate about a new recreational license in Maryland where the Department of Natural Resources wants to use the new license to eliminate an oddity called the non-commercial license. Now held by about 10,000 people, the license allowed crabbers to use an unlimited amount of trotline and up to 50 traps or rings-as long as they don't take more than two bushels a day. With all that gear, observers suspect an active black market for blue crabs has been in swing along a lot of the highways and backroads around the Bay.<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
The proposed recreational license would only allow ten traps and 1,000 feet of trotline-a gear allowance opposed as too broad by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. The new license would also set a new limit of one bushel per person per day and two bushels per boat.<P>
Major debates this winter will center on changes proposed for commercial crabbing. In both states fishery managers have started work on "capping the fishery," and that's where the controversy comes in: For a hundred years the blue crab fishery has been open to anyone who could buy a commercial license. Capping the fishery means putting a hard limit on the number of men and women who can go crabbing for money on the Chesapeake.<P>
Why do managers want this limit? Because they think there is a limit on how many crabs can be fished out of the Bay and still leave a healthy fishery-just as there was a limit on how many shad and rockfish and oysters could be fished out. The common tragedy that played out with each of these fisheries went something like this: with early declines in harvests, the laws of supply and demand sent prices rising, spurring more watermen to work longer hours and harder days depleting a dwindling resource at an even faster rate.<P>
With the crash of these mainstay fisheries, the gold rush n more frantic, causing many observers to warn that another crisis could be coming. "There are all these early warning signs that we are teetering close to trouble," warns Jack Travelstead of the Virginia Marine Resource Commission. The clearest sign came two years ago when Baywide crab harvests dropped from 91 million pounds in 1991 to 54 million pounds in 1992. For Virginia "that was one of the lowest levels since the 1950s," explains Travelstead.<P>
Even before the slump of '92, there were other, subtler signs of trouble. For several years more watermen than ever before were entering the crab fishery where they were working longer hours and setting out more crab pots than during any era in Bay history. What the scientists call catch-per-unit effort was cut in half. Compared to earlier years watermen were working twice as hard to catch the same number of crabs.<P>
The harvest clearly had maxed out, but the influx of hard working fishermen just as clearly had not. How long could blue crab stocks hold out under this kind of constantly increasing assault? After the recent crashes of rockfish and oysters, a blue crab crisis would triple the tragedy. "A lot of the watermen are worried," explains Travelstead. "The crab fishery is their last resource. When that is gone, they are gone."<P>
In Maryland capping the fishery starts with the Department of Natural Resources asking the Maryland legislature for authority to limit the sale of commercial licenses. There are about 6,000 watermen holding commercial crab licenses now, plus several thousand watermen holding general unlimited licenses that allow them to fish any commercial species-including crabs. To slow down the flow of crabbers entering an overcrowded fishery, DNR had already set a two-year waiting period for new licenses.<P>
Under the new approach the flow of new entries would halt, and over several years the number of licensed crabbers would change-perhaps even be cut in half. If current legislation passes, DNR would be able to stop selling commercial licenses, thus halting entry into the fishery. "No new licenses would be issued until we come up with a number (of crabbers) that everybody agrees should be in the fishery," explains Steve Early of the Tidewater Fisheries Division in Maryland's Department of Natural Resources.<P>
DNR would also limit the number of crab pots that watermen set out-a move that may stir as much controversy as limited entry. Over the last decade crabbers have dramatically jumped the number of pots they set out each year. According to Tom Horton in Turning the Tide, watermen who once worked perhaps 100 pots were fishing up to 400 by the mid-80s and even 800 pots were not unusual. Now some crews of two or three watermen have been working 1,000 to 1,500 pots per boat.<P>
"Limiting the number of licensees won't do it (cap the fishery) unless you also limit their effort," says Early. "Fishermen are well noted for their ability to be innovative in applying effort to a fishery." DNR is proposing a limit of 300 pots per license, which they estimate is now the average number of pots in use by watermen. They also propose a limit of 900 pots per boat. The legislation asks no authority to set daily catch limits.<P>
At the south end of the Chesapeake, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission has no plans for limiting crab potting this year, but it already moved last fall to begin capping the most controversial fishery in the Bay-the winter dredge fishery for blue crabs. That fishery focuses on the waters just inside the mouth of the Bay-waters crammed with "sooks," adult pregnant female crabs who migrate south during the fall to overwinter along the bottom while their sponge-like egg masses mature for spawning.<P>
Virginians feel protective in a worried way about one of their traditional fisheries, arguing that a fishery that lasted through so many decades of good harvests is probably not to blame for any recent slumps. They cite estimates that only 15% of the Bay's spawning stock are lost here. Eugene Cronin and other scientists put the number near 20%.<P>
After this winter, however, Virginia will sell no new dredging licenses. Watermen have this year as a window for entering the fishery and being grandfathered in for the future. Starting next winter, no new licenses will be available until the number of dredgers drops below 225 through attrition. What worries Virginia experts the most is the same thing that worries Maryland experts-the rapid addition of so many new fishermen into fishery that is not adding enough new crabs.<P>
Managing the blue crab fishery is never simple or noncontroversial in Maryland-and this year the effort could be especially complicated. As legislative proposals move onto the table in Annapolis, lawmakers in a number of committees will probably hear testimony from groups as diverse as DNR, the Maryland Waterman's Association, the Maryland Saltwater Fisherman's Association, the Chesapeake Bay Commission, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, EPA, NOAA, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as well as from university researchers at a number of labs and individual scientists like Eugene Cronin. If, after all the hearings and headaches, the legislature and DNR take the first giant steps towards capping the state's last great fishery, they could surely change forever the way millions of Marylanders go after their favorite shellfish.<P>
By the same token, if no one takes any steps and the fishery fails like shad and oysters and rockfish once did, then the changes that follow could be even more painful for everyone.<P>

<A NAME="INTRO"></A>
Chesapeake Bay means different things to different people -- it is a region of farmers and motel operators, commuters and vacationers. It is a playground for recreational boaters, a dumping ground for sewage wastes, a rich habitat for waterfowl and wildlife, a highway for tankers. It includes cosmopolitan cities such as Baltimore and Washington as well as towns that are distinctively oriented towards the Bay.
<P>
"The Chesapeake," says Mark Sagoff, "really takes its shape in our minds." Not necessarily from ecological forces but from interactions with human beings and from personal memories. Those memories may be connected in varying ways to different places -- our homes, our communities, natural landscapes and the ones we build.  

<CENTER>

<HR SIZE=4>
"Our aim is to provide a framework for understanding the Bay not simply in biological and economic terms, but in cultural and psychological terms."
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
</CENTER>

Sagoff, senior research scholar at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland, College Park, says that with the decline in the economic importance of farming and fishing, the Bay has lost much of its significance as a natural resource from which people wrest their living. "Even though recreational uses of the Bay flourish," he observes, "the regional economy is no longer founded on commercial farming or fishing. As a result, a far smaller proportion of the population feels any economic connection with the Bay's ecological features and systems." 
<P>
This is not to say that you need to make a living from the Bay to derive a strong sense of place and connection to it. But it may be harder to acquire, says David Wasserman, "for the rapidly growing proportion of Chesapeake residents who are commuters, spending most of their waking hours in places that have nothing to do with the Bay." Wasserman is a research scholar also at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy.
<P>
Since so many newcomers are moving into Bay country, just what the Chesapeake means to them becomes an important question for those concerned with its ecological restoration. The population of newcomers will eventually outnumber those whose families remember the days of farming and fishing. These more recent arrivals, Sagoff believes, often "do not have direct ties to the land or the water and, as a result, may not necessarily have strong concerns about what development does to the natural environment."
<P>
The Bay region is always in flux as new people with new interests arrive. Over the nearly four centuries since Europeans came to its shores, says Sagoff, "you could say there have been many different Chesapeake Bays." However, pristine areas and more sparsely populated coastal communities throughout the Bay watershed are perhaps experiencing more change in the last decades of the 20th century than during the entire time since Colonial settlement began. Forested and agricultural lands are rapidly giving way to new housing, new highways, new schools, new businesses, new shopping centers and strip malls. Towns and villages and once-isolated rural communities are expanding rapidly to include people who commute to distant jobs and spend most of their day away from the place where they live.
<P>
Sagoff argues that in order to restore the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, we have to understand the values we wish a restoration to serve, which means reexamining why we and our predecessors have valued the Chesapeake. For example, what do those who live in the Chesapeake region really want? More shopping centers or more woodlands? More roads or less stormwater runoff? More rockfish on their plates or more swimming wild in the Bay?
<P>
What do people feel is most important in the place they call home -- responding to human needs or the needs of the natural system, or to some combination of both?

To probe these questions, Sagoff, Wasserman, graduate student Sara Gottlieb, and journalism professor Larissa Grunig have been bringing Marylanders from varying walks of life together in focus groups, trying to gain a sense of what matters to them about where they live and how that relates to their feelings about the Chesapeake region. "Our aim," Sagoff says, "is to provide a framework for understanding the Bay not simply in biological and economic terms but in cultural and psychological terms."

<A NAME="FUTURE"></A>
<H3>
Looking to the Future
</H3>
The research team chose focus groups because, says Sara Gottlieb, "they enable us to explore a single topic in depth with people who have similar interests and backgrounds." The aim is to gather enough diverse groups to give a representative cross section of society in the Bay region. The team has focused on Calvert County because it is one of the state's fastest growing counties, where new development is burgeoning, from cluster housing to large single-family dwellings to strip malls and shopping centers. 
<P>
To date, the research team has met with three groups. The first comprised people who moved to Calvert County in the past eight years, with income in the middle or upper middle range. "This is the fastest growing group in the county," says Wasserman, "the vanguard of suburbanization." The second group included people born in the county or who had lived there most of their lives. A third focus group, the most recently convened, consisted of African Americans, most of whom had a long history of living in the county. 
<P>
Many of the residents who recently moved to the county were attracted in part by the rural landscape and the presence of nature. As Wasserman notes, "they displayed a keen appreciation of the natural and rural character of Calvert County. But they expressed less interest in, and knowledge of, the details of the county's ecosystem or history, and relatively little involvement in activities related to the Bay." 
<P>
When asked about the loss of oysters in the ecosystem, one recent arrival said, "What's an oyster got to do with where you live?" A long-term resident said that in his discussions with new county residents such attitudes were probably the most prevalent. "They weren't raised with the culture of oysters and mussels and crabs. When I was a kid," he said, "we walked out and picked up oysters and mussels, and these people aren't used to doing that. They don't even think about it." On the other hand, a newer resident said that his concern wasn't the oyster itself but the resources. "Oysters are an indicator of the health of the Bay, [which] is very important because we chose to live down here for the ecology. I think we watch those indicators. We don't go out and harvest the shellfish per se, but the presence or absence of shellfish has broader implications for us."
<P>
For families with children, there is the appeal of good schools, low crime rates and the ease, or friendliness. "The greatest thing about coming down here," said one participant, "is going down the street and seeing people by the side of the road not fighting, but talking. You wave at them as you go by. It's fantastic. You know, you can't buy that."
<P>
And yet, there is also among some of the newer residents a sense of isolation. A number of the participants in the first focus group live in large single family homes, says Wasserman. The combination of limited time at home and physical separation from others appeared to contribute to the feeling of isolation and disconnectedness that several experienced. "One of the things I've found in Calvert County," said one, "is you sort of tend to be isolated in your little pockets of development...I get a feeling I'm not meeting a wide range of people." Another said, "There's been discussion about the damage done by five-acre zoning because it puts people so far away from each other, they don't connect." And a third, "I found down here you really have to make an effort to get out and meet people by going to the churches or getting involved in your community association. All these things take time, and people who work and have children don't really have time."
<P>
As might be expected, native residents -- they make up some four percent of the population -- identify with their memories of the area. For them, the Bay and Patuxent River are central. An 82-year old remembered, "We had a school boat rather than a school bus. You'd go down these peninsulas and pick the kids up to take them to school. The roads were muddy and almost unpassable, so we were told we were the only school east of the Mississippi that had a school boat."
<P>
One man recalled, "Years ago, every community had a store, and that was the focal point of the community. Some communities had more than one store, but they were all little grocery stores with a gas pump out front and a front porch where people came in the evening to sit and talk and find out what went on in the world. But [the community stores are] just about extinct. And those little communities are not there...except in what you see going up and down Route 4. They've become subdivisions."
<P>
Are there any common threads to these groups? A major one, says Mark Sagoff, is that a place, whether for the native or the newcomer, is defined by human relationships. "Everyone seemed to relate to some experience with others in the community. Over and over again it is the personal experience."
<P>
"A place is a location that has been claimed by shared feelings and memories," he says. "And what a place does is draw people together." 

<A NAME="HOME"></A>
<H3>
What Makes a Place Home?
</H3>
To understand some of the issues that influence how people feel about place, one can look to architectural community designers like Andres Duany and Randall Arendt who have made their reputations by designing and promoting attractive cluster development and "neotraditional" towns. Both have recently published books: Duany, together with Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, <I>Designing Open Space Subdivisions, and Arendt, Towns and Town-Making Principles and Rural by Design: Maintaining Small Town Character.</I>
<P>
One of the biggest problems with new housing developments in the Chesapeake region and other places is sprawl development. Often, Arendt says, there is nothing but the dead space of an asphalt road between two houses that confront each other across the vast expanse of their bare lawns. "There is nothing friendly about these spaces," he says.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/photo2.gif" ALT="[geese]">  
<IMG SRC="GIFs/photo3.gif" ALT="[houses]">
</CENTER>
<P>
Duany points to the evolution of sprawl. First, he says, especially after World War II, we built housing developments -- places where people live but do not work or shop. He contrasts the U.S. policy for helping GIs build new homes with the Canadian policy where veterans could also use government funds to renovate and restore older homes. Second, he argues, we built shopping centers -- places where people shop but do not live or work (except in the stores). And finally, he says, we created office parks -- places where people work, but do not live or shop. During the process, we lost the traditional pattern of the town, the traditional glue of the community.
<P>
"In a real town the wealthy can walk out into the street and confront -- imagine -- the teacher of their children, right there on the sidewalk," Duany told a recent audience at a University of Maryland conference on environmental finance. The result, he says, is that both teacher and parent have the chance to discover that they are each human, and not members of some unsympathetic "other" class.
<P>
Even the cluster development espoused by Arendt and Duany cannot solve all of these problems, however. It makes no sense, says land use consultant Michael Siegal, to design a clustered town in an area where there are no services and no infrastructure. Such towns, he says, have been built in the far outlying areas of the Washington megalopolis, and people find that they must drive long distances just to take care of daily errands. Such "towns" will draw additional development their way, ultimately creating more sprawl, perhaps even the "strip development" they were intended to replace. After all, traditional towns took root in a particular area because something logically drew people there: a crossroads, a certain industry or business, a certain geographic feature. If the main criterion for a new "town" is simply to be away from unpleasant sprawl, it may not have the subtle critical mass required to make a town a relatively self-sufficient place to live.
<P>
Mark Sagoff distinguishes between "bottom up" and "top down" development, the first arising from the land (or the water) organically, as a harbor or fishing village might, and the second resulting from an external force, as when a corporation decides to locate in a rural setting, for example. In the first instance, the landscape and the living conditions will reflect the evolution of the people who have lived there and their livelihood, their way of life. In the second case, grocery store chains and discount stores may move in to serve the new clientele, but there will be little in this development to reflect the long history of the land or the people who have gone before.

Sagoff and his team are still completing their project in an attempt to understand what people think and feel about their lives near the Chesapeake Bay. So far, in the focus groups, there appears to be a conundrum: our search for a place to call home -- by the Bay, say, or near the woods -- has taken with it our contradictory desires, for solitude and community, for beauty and convenience, for privacy and companionship. One thing seems clear, says Sagoff. How people come to terms with one another and with their surroundings will profoundly affect the natural environment of the Chesapeake Bay and plans for its ecological restoration.

"It was already obvious in 1970 that we would become a magnet for growth," says Bernie Fowler. "People were looking for peace and tranquility and that's what Calvert County had to offer." That was more than 40,000 people ago.
<P>
In the 1970s, the population of this largely agricultural county had already doubled since 1950. The widening of Route 2/4, Calvert County's major thoroughfare, had begun along with the building of Baltimore Gas and Electric's nuclear power plant at Calvert Cliffs.
<P>
This is the kind of public construction that invites growth, promotes development, and accelerates change. At first, Calvert County was not prepared -- developers came in and started building but there was little in the way of guidelines, for instance, no subdivision regulations, no road specifications. "So much needed to be done," says Fowler, a former county commissioner and recently retired state senator.
<P>
The first step was the Peninsula Plan, a long-range blueprint that involved "bringing county residents together to try and design the best possible growth plan we could," says Fowler. This plan led to the county developing recreational areas, building a new hospital, instituting an agricultural preservation program, and improving schools. All of this progress made Calvert more attractive and even more people came. "It's like a dog chasing its tail," says Fowler. 
<P>
What does this rapid development mean for the future? Is it possible to retain qualities that first attracted people to the county, while still accommodating growth -- and what would it take? These are the kinds of issues that the county continues to deal with.
<P>
In 1992, the Department of Planning and Zoning did a survey of county residents, says director Frank Jaklitsch, to see if "there are physical things we could do to promote a sense of being at home in Calvert County, a sense of identity, as well as opportunities for interaction or involvement."
<P>
"Through forums and workshops," says Jaklitsch, "we evolved several notions dealing with town centers -- identifying a sense of place with town centers, not just [building] strip malls." 
<P>
"We were also interested in [giving guidance to] developers of subdivisions," he says. "Could we come up with some approaches to give people a sense of place, rather than just suburban boxes?" The outcome is a series of guidelines that new subdivisions must meet: they must be buffered from main roads and adjoining properties, they must be clustered, and they must have a "focal point," an area that is central to the cluster and gives some sense of coherence. "We wanted to be flexible," Jaklitsch says, "and not specify what such a focal point should be -- we are looking for innovative approaches." 
<P>
Though it is too early to say how these guidelines are working, Jaklitsch is encouraged by recent innovations in some of the new subdivisions. Still, they are only part of the answer. The big question remains, says Bernie Fowler: can we continue to grow and still sustain the kind of life we have had in Calvert County? 
<P>
Stay tuned to find out.

<A NAME="START"> </A>
Whether flowing off the Chesapeake's vast watershed or falling from the sky in rain and snow, too many nutrients find their way into the Bay's rivers and mainstem.  According to most researchers, these unwanted nutrients, mostly nitrogen and phosphorus, fuel unwanted algal growth and loss of vital oxygen in the estuary.  Because of these consequences, nutrients - from sewage, from fertilizer, from air pollution - have come to represent the estuary's most significant systemic problem (see <A HREF="side1.html">Issue At A Glance</A>).<P>
States in the Bay region, joined by the federal government, have committed themselves to reducing that unwanted load of nutrients by 40 percent (based on 1985 levels) by the year 2000.  But with nutrient-reduction plans taking shape for each of the Bay's tributaries, citizens and decision makers alike have turned their attention to a nagging question:  how much will these efforts cost, and how will we pay for them?<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/envifin1.gif" ALT=""><P>
Throughout the summer and early autumn, a Blue Ribbon Panel, chaired by Eileen Rehrmann, County Executive of Harford County, has struggled with this funding issue, trying to rise above the normal debate about raising or cutting taxes.  Appointed by Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer, the Panel has wrestled with charts and graphs and a pile of information about waste treatment plants, stormwater runoff, agricultural programs and resource protection. <P>
Their assignment:  to come up with creative funding mechanisms to implement a "Tributary Strategies" plan, the state (and Bay Program's) effort to clean up the streams and rivers that feed the Bay.<P>
Their task has not been an easy one.  Estimates are that cleaning up the tributaries could cost an additional $60-90 million a year.<P>
<A NAME="NUTR"> </A>
<H3>The Nutrient Problem</H3>
When the problem of excess nutrients was discovered, the Bay states began working to stem the tide of phosphorus and nitrogen entering the Chesapeake, beginning with waste treatment plants. <P>
"We know how to control most nutrients," says Cecily Majerus, Governor Schaefer's coordinator for Chesapeake Bay programs.  "We already have programs for reducing nutrients from waste treatment plants, for example.  And the level of phosphorus entering the Bay is already down.  The biggest problem is nonpoint."<P>
"Nonpoint" is a term our forebears would not have known, though they would have understood at least part of the problem:  runoff from land that has, for example, lost the protective forest cover. <P>
"If you look at cores from the Chesapeake Bay bottom," says Grace Brush, researcher at The Johns Hopkins University, "you can see exactly when the clearing of land began."  What you see, according to Brush, is an influx of sediment, and a change in pollen type, from oak, maple and ash to crops like tobacco and corn.  "The changes in the Bay began with deforestation," Brush says, "and then became more pronounced with the use of fertilizer." <P>
But the problem of nonpoint pollution has worsened over this last half century:  with population surging in the Chesapeake region - an 18 percent growth is expected in Maryland by 2020 - and with the development of once-pristine areas, suburban communities, streets and highways have also become a sizable source of nutrient loading to the Bay.  With an increase in the problem has come an increase in the need for funding. <P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/envifin2.gif" ALT=""><BR>
<CITE>Maryland is about two-thirds of the way toward funding programs needed to clean up Chesapeake Bay tributaries.  According to natural resource experts, full funding will make possible the 40% reduction of nutrients necessary to turn the tide for the Bay's health.</CITE><P>
<A NAME="FUND"> </A>
<H3>The Funding Dilemma</H3>
According to many mayors and planners in small communities, there are two major funding difficulties connected with nutrient reduction.  The first is the drying up of federal construction grants - especially for waste treatment facilities - and the second is how to finance projects to stem nonpoint pollution, such as stormwater runoff from urban and suburban lands and the runoff of fertilizer from agricultural fields. <P>
"People don't realize that these [nonpoint problems] are structural problems," says Donald Outen, Chief of the Bureau of Water Quality and Resource Management in Baltimore County. "These problems will become more expensive if we ignore them.  This is something the locals will get stung by." <P>
Outen points to erosion and the channelizing of stream beds, for example.  Though the state's Tributary Strategies aim at restoring waterways for environmental reasons, channelized stream beds can, Outen says, cause mechanical problems, exposing pipe lines running beneath the streams, such as sewer lines.  Stream erosion can also cause problems for bridges and other infrastructure. <P>
"It's a massive problem that is not in the public consciousness yet," says Outen.  "It's like taking care of a cavity, before it rots your teeth." <P>
In Baltimore County, according to Outen, his department has adapted a watershed approach, working environmental mandates and a special restoration fund into their normal capital budgeting process.  "Some people raised their eyebrows," he says, when these environmental projects were made part of the capital budget.  "But I talked to the budget committee," Outen says.  "They understand the need.  Paying for water quality is no less important than paying for potholes." <P>
Outen and others often point out that funds are frequently available from Federal and other sources, if one looks hard enough.  In Baltimore County, for example, they are taking advantage of opportunities to work with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service and others who can help fund environmental projects.  "We are not waiting for funds to be passed down through the usual channels," Outen says.  "We are working directly with the Feds."<P>
Despite the availability of some money for nutrient-reduction efforts, Outen expects that their current budget will not be enough, as Baltimore County, like other counties, continues to focus on nonpoint issues.  And beyond this, there are often "institutional problems," according to Outen, which can make money harder to get from the State. <P>
"I see two problems," says Outen.  "One is that many state programs have a cost share element.  And many small counties and localities just can't afford their share of the cost."  This means, according to Outen, that many such programs end up  primarily reaching the larger, richer counties. <P>
The second problem, he says, is that projects are often constrained by the state fiscal year.  "The state expects the locals to spend funds in a year, which locals often cannot do," Outen says.  "It usually takes a minimum of two years for a capital project," he says. <P>
Outen is not alone in wondering whether there could be more flexibility in the way funds are used to address environmental problems.  The Blue Ribbon Panel convened by Governor Schaefer has also been examining ways in which state and local governments could more easily shift funds or otherwise adapt sometimes rigid budget regimes to the more holistic approach appropriate to watershed-wide management. <P>
In order to attack this problem, a number of resource managers and others are teaming up with investment bankers, private financial consultants and bond experts to explore the answer.  At a recent meeting at the University of Maryland, for example, an unusual mixture of financial experts and environmental analysts came together to discuss the problem and urge each other on in the quest for some creative solutions.  Although some have used funding shortfalls created by federal environmental laws (so-called "unfunded mandates") to push the elimination of various environmental programs, others have taken the funding issue as a challenge.  Innovative approaches to finance could help di-fuse what may become an increasingly polarized debate.  (please see <A HREF="side2.html">Environmental Finance</A> and the Ennvironmental Finance Center (<A HREF="../../../EFC/index.html">EFC</A>) for more information.)
<A NAME="SCALE"> </A>
<H3>Economies of Scale</H3>
One question confronting the Blue Ribbon Panel (and others in the state who are puzzling over ways in which to fund nutrient-reduction programs) is whether there are economies of scale - or economies of cooperation - which could loosen constraints on funding or make funding more efficient.  <P>
Currently under discussion by the Panel are a range of possibilities for different groups or even individuals to join together to seek funds.  Farmers in a given region could, for example, jointly fund the building of, say, animal waste containment structures.  Rural counties in a given watershed could pool resources to address the most pressing runoff problems in their river basin.  Counties or municipalities could join together to form "watershed districts" that could charge fees for nonpoint programs, just as they do for more conventional "point-source" projects.  If these or similar ideas found their way into practice,  a solution to the funding of nonpoint pollution programs could be much closer at hand. <P>
Regardless of what ideas may emerge, most Panelists argue that local, state and even federal governments should begin thinking more seriously about funding projects on a watershed basis.  "We need to emphasize this thinking about watersheds," said panelist Deborah Jennings at a recent meeting.  "This should be our most important recommendation." <P>
At least some who work at the county level agree that a watershed funding approach - which accounts for nonpoint sources of nitrogen - would be a step in the right direction. "It does not help us to have access to funds for improving a waste treatment plant," says one planner from Queen Anne County, "if our biggest nutrient problem is coming from farm fields." <P>
New approaches could help relieve the potential burden to farmers of nutrient-reduction programs.  For example, at the recent Environmental Finance Conference at the University of Maryland a roundtable comprised of farmers, economists and financial experts concluded that even though agricultural lands need special attention, this does not mean that farmers should have to foot the bill alone.  <P>
The formation of some form of authority or district, with the power to collect fees and take out loans, could target areas most in need of funding.  Such a district could, some observers have pointed out, enable funds from the State Revolving Fund (SRF) to be more easily used for nonpoint pollution projects. <P>
The Panel is expected to issue its report in November.  The report will contain a menu of funding mechanisms which state and local government and others involved in the Tributary Strategies can use to support nutrient-reduction projects.  "While no one will escape at least some of the responsibility," says Cecily Majerus, "these ideas may help more equally spread the pain." <P>

<H1>Environmental Finance</H1>

For more than two years, the University of Maryland System has operated an Environmental Finance Center, part of the Coastal and Environmental Policy Program (<A HREF="../../../CEPP/index.html">CEPP</A>)  now housed at the <A HREF="../../../index.html">Maryland Sea Grant</A> .  The Center puts on conferences and roundtables in order to attract creative thinking from financial experts, planners and others.<P>
At the First Annual Mid-Atlantic Conference on Environmental Finance, sponsored by the Environmental Finance Center and supported by the Environmental Protection Agency, financial creativity was not lacking.  Financial advisors like Scott Resnick, founder of Commonwealth Development Associates, spoke of "slicing and dicing," and other funding techniques normally considered the purview of Wall Street.  Resnick pointed toward the use of structured municipal bonds that could differentiate risk and result in lower interest rates.  These approaches could be used by small entities that do not normally take advantage of such techniques.<P>
Michael Curley, a private investment banker and a member of the EPA's independent Environmental Finance Advisory Board, asked the audience to consider all the small waterworks around the country, all funded on a small-time basis, paying not-so-great rates to their local banks.  These waterworks, he found, were on the whole extremely reliable investments, yet, he said, only about 5,000 of 60,000 nationwide have investment grade ratings.  "They have simply been overlooked," says Curley.<P>
"Why not," suggests Curley, "have many of these water systems join together, to share a common bond?"  With waterworks from all over the country pooling their resources, he points out, they could negotiate large, long-term bonds at good rates.  The savings on their debt service alone would cover anticipated costs for breakdowns or other predictable problems.  "I estimate an immediate cost savings of twenty-five percent on the debt service," Curley says, "and it hasn't cost the rate payer a thing."<P>
There are, Curley points out, some snags.  Many states do not allow dealings of this type across state lines, or in some cases across county lines.  Laws would have to be changed to make this work.  But he asked the audience to consider the potential. <P>
The Environmental Finance Center plans additional meetings and programs.  For more information, contact Elizabeth Hickey at Maryland Sea Grant, (301) 405-6383.<P>

Does the Chesapeake Bay have a <FONT COLOR="#808080">toxics</FONT> problem?
</H2>
</CENTER>
Are the chemicals that run off the land or the particles that descend from the sky measurably affecting the Bay's food web? Are the effects of heavy contaminant loading in harbors and industrial areas confined to these regions, or do physical and biological processes carry them farther into the Bay? Is oyster disease a signal that toxic chemicals are compromising the oyster immune system? These are the kinds of questions that citizens and scientists throughout the Bay watershed are asking. The answers, however, are far from simple.
<P>
According to ongoing research, there are indicators suggesting contaminants could have important, if sometimes subtle, effects on the Bay's ecology. While these indicators are often ambiguous, a team of researchers, with the support of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Effects Committee (CBEEC), have begun to map the relationship between sources of contaminants and their biological effects.

<H3>A Smoking Gun</H3>

At least as long ago as 1962, when Rachel Carson in her book Silent Spring fingered DDT among other compounds as a random chemical killer, environmentalists and resource managers alike have often searched for a "smoking gun" - a chemical contaminant guilty of causing a significant ecological problem. In the case of the Chesapeake Bay, there have been clear cases of what writer William Styron has called "a murder most foul."
<P>
Styron was referring, in a newspaper article, to the "killing" of the James River by the pesticide Kepone, spilled into the river by Allied Chemical Company and its contractor until authorities closed the Hopewell, Virginia plant in 1975. Because of the spill, authorities worried about contaminated shellfish and other seafood, and scientists were indeed able to track the entry of that poison into the food web. In other cases as well - oil spills, high chemical contaminant loads in the sediments of commercial harbors - the causes and effects of toxic pollution in the Bay are relatively clear.
<P>
But beyond these specific cases, what is the overall impact on the Bay of a steady rain of contaminants on the ecosystem? In order to address this question, the Sea Grant College Programs of Maryland and Virginia, with the support of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Chesapeake Bay Office, and the cooperation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Chesapeake Bay Program, brought together scientists from across the Bay region to meet at the Belmont Center near Baltimore to distill from recent research what we know - and what we don't - about contaminants in the Chesapeake.

<A NAME="2"></A>
<H3>A Contentious Debate</H3>

The issue of toxic contaminants in the Chesapeake Bay is not new. A six-year study of the Bay, supported by the Environmental Protection Agency, culminated in a series of reports in the early 1980s that documented the presence of metals and other contaminants in the Bay and called for a more thorough understanding of how these contaminants move through the Bay and its food web. 
<P>
But, how to begin this discovery process is a problem in itself. There are numerous "camps" of scientific thought that argue for differing approaches. Some researchers call for a greater focus on bioassays that can track chemical contaminants in the tissues of living organisms. Other researchers call for a more ecosystem-oriented approach that studies how contaminants move from one level of the food web to another. Still others argue for close investigation of responses at the cellular level, for example, to see how contaminants might affect an organism's ability to fend off disease.
<P>
Scientists and resource managers meeting at the Belmont Center represented some of these approaches - though by no means all. "Our goal," says Chris D'Elia, director of the Maryland Sea Grant Program, who helped convene the meeting, "was to have researchers in the CBEEC Program assess the status of our knowledge about contaminants in the Bay and to identify information and research needs."
<P>
The scientists' answers to the fundamental questions about contaminants are summarized in a new report, <A HREF="side2.html">Chemical Contaminants in the Chesapeake Bay</A>, highlighted in a sidebar accompanying this article.
<P>
Repeatedly, the scientists at this meeting emphasized that while we know a fair amount about inputs of toxic materials into the Bay, we are still just learning how to measure the effects of those contaminants on Bay organisms, and on the Bay ecosystem itself.
<P>
<A NAME="3"></A>
<CENTER>
<HR SIZE=4>
<H3>
Over the past thirty years, we have seen an evolution from end-of-pipe sources to more diffuse sources. Maybe we need to use the same approach with toxics that we've used with nutrients.
</H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
</CENTER>

<H3>Not Just the End of a Pipe</H3>

Contaminants enter the Chesapeake Bay from a number of sources, according to Joel Baker and other scientists at the Belmont meeting. Says Baker, "Public opinion surveys by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Chesapeake Bay Program show that public perception is out of whack. Most people still believe that industry - big industry - is the problem. But most contaminants do not come out of a pipe." Even in the case of urban runoff, he says, where pollutants may come out of a pipe, the pipe is owned not by industry but by the city.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=4>
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/photo2.gif" ALT="[marina photo]"><P>
</TD>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
"Over the past thirty years," continues Baker, "we have seen an evolution from end-of-pipe sources to more diffuse sources. Maybe we need to use the same approach with toxics that we've used with nutrients." Nutrients also often come from diffuse sources, such as runoff from farms in rural areas or stormwater in developed areas. Baker points out that getting people to understand the real sources of contaminants will take a good deal of public education. He also notes that dealing with diffuse sources requires different management strategies.
<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
Generally, he says, the upper Bay is more dominated by the input of rivers, so it receives more of its relative contaminant load from riverine sources. The lower Bay, where the rivers have less direct influence, sees a greater impact from diffuse sources, including from the atmosphere. 
<P>
The Chesapeake Bay Program's <FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>Chesapeake Bay Basinwide Toxics  Reduction Strategy Reevaluation Report</I></FONT> lists much of what we know about sources of contaminants found in the Bay. For example, the report holds that metal loading to the Bay is highest in the Potomac River, followed by the Susquehanna, the west Chesapeake, the James, the mainstem Bay, the Patuxent, Eastern Shore, York and Rappahannock basins.
<P>
In general, the scientists at the Belmont Center felt confident, from  extensive monitoring data, that environmental legislation - such as the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act - has led to vastly reduced inputs of chemical contaminants into the Bay from business and industry and other "point" sources. Because of these point-source reductions, and because of a growing population in the Bay's 64,000-square-mile watershed, diffuse or "nonpoint" sources of contaminants are becoming more important all over the Bay, and these sources remain more difficult to track and more difficult to control.
<P>
What are these diffuse sources? For one thing, whenever we burn something, we potentially put contaminants in the air. Even before the colonists arrived in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Native Americans set fire to the forests to hold down the undergrowth and to improve their hunting grounds. Now we seldom burn off our forests, but we do burn ancient forests constantly - in the form of heating fuel, coal, diesel and gasoline. This constant conflagration, whether from expansive suburbs burning heating oil all winter or from the endless parade of cars and trucks up and down the region's many highways, sends a cloud of hydrocarbons and other compounds into the air. Wind, rain and other precipitation bring it down again - into the watershed of the Bay and its tributaries. 
<P>
As University of Maryland professor Alan Taylor has said, 90% of the watershed is land, not water, and once contaminants fall on the land, following their path to the Bay "becomes difficult." Clearly contaminants from both burned and unburned (as from oil spills) fuels find their way into the Bay, as PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and other compounds that are listed on the Bay Program's Toxics of Concern list.
<P>
In addition to fossil fuel products, the incineration of garbage, which may contain toxic products such as batteries, can lead to the emission of mercury and other contaminants. Though not as widespread as the fossil fuel problem, such diffuse sources are one of many delivery mechanisms to the Bay. Another poorly understood mechanism throughout the watershed is seepage into groundwater from septic tanks, which may contain traces of solvents and wastes poured down the drains of countless households. From both suburbs and cities, stormwater runoff also delivers an onslaught of motor oil, cleaning fluids, and assorted contaminants from driveways, roadways and parking lots. And from agricultural areas and even forests, the Bay receives pulses of herbicides and pesticides, such as the gypsy moth treatment Dimilin.

<A NAME="4"></A>
<H3>What Happens to Contaminants in the Bay?</H3>

The toxics story becomes more complex once contaminants enter the Bay. Researchers such as scientist Larry Sanford have been tracking their movement. Sanford, of the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies' (CEES) Horn Point Laboratory, has worked with his colleagues to calculate how contaminants move along the surface of the sediment, how they interact with other particles and how they are finally buried.
<P>
According to Sanford, tidal action in the mid-Bay erodes a thin layer of sediment - about 0.1 to 1 mm thick. This thin layer migrates with tidal currents, lengthening the time it takes for contaminants to become buried.
<P>
The key question, and one still under investigation by researchers, is whether contaminants - in or on the sediments, for example - find their way into the food web, and begin to move through Bay's living organisms. Significant evidence has emerged to date that this does indeed occur.
<P>
In the Baltimore Harbor, for example, researcher Jim Sanders and his colleagues at the Benedict Estuarine Research Center (BERC) found that a small fish (the mummichog) took up more contaminants at low tide than at high tide. They concluded that this occurred because fish feeding in the shallows would come into direct contact with contaminated sediments more often at low tide, when very little water covered the tidal flats.
<P>
Beyond these direct contacts with contaminants, scientists are tracking more puzzling possibilities. In the Patuxent River, for example - an area clearly less polluted than Baltimore or Norfolk harbors or the Anacostia River - phytoplankton in the river can concentrate contaminants. Sanders and his colleagues have determined that once concentrated, the contaminants can be tracked to the Bay floor, as the phytoplankton sink to the bottom. There, the contaminants have the potential to enter the food web that thrives on the riverbed.
<P>
Most importantly, Sanders has determined that contaminants may also cause an unwanted shift in the populations of phytoplankton. Arsenic, for example, appears to cause one type of algae to die down while another type takes off. This means that algae blooms can differ widely, especially in their effect on such organisms as copepods and other zooplankton that graze on them.
<P>
"Our findings suggest that the biomass [the overall amount of phytoplankton] doesn't really change," Sanders says, "but the composition of that biomass does."
<P>
For animals that feed on phytoplankton, this change may be crucial. Dan Terlizzi, a Sea Grant Extension Specialist trained in the study of phytoplankton, compares it to a cow eating normal grass versus grass blades the size of a tree trunk. Clearly, he says, in the latter case the cow would go hungry. This is the case with zooplankton that graze on algae. Oysters also feed on algae, and there has been much speculation that they too are finding fewer desirable and nutritious species to eat.
<P>
Since phytoplankton form the very base of the Bay's food chain, any change there affects not only the zooplankton that graze on them, but the small fish that graze on the zooplankton, and the larger fish that eat them. According to CEES researcher Ed Houde, zooplankton (like copepods) make up a major source of food for juvenile species of fish, such as striped bass. Other fish, menhaden, for example, feed directly on phytoplankton, and in turn become a major food source for larger fish, like blue fish. By unintentionally causing shifts at the base of the food pyramid, we may have caused shifts at the top - shifts we still do not fully understand.

<A NAME="5"></A>
<H3>Is the Gun Smoking?</H3>

For many years, Robert Anderson of the CEES Chesapeake Biological Lab has been looking as closely as anyone for a direct connection between chemical contaminants in the Chesapeake Bay and the poor health of species such as the oyster and the striped bass.
<P>
He has been experimenting with low doses of tributyltin and other compounds, to determine whether or not such doses interfere with the immune system. According to his research, the effects are clear. He can document that the immune response  slows and becomes less effective once an oyster has been dosed with TBT.
<P>
But when asked whether he thinks chemical contaminants are responsible for the decline of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay, Anderson refuses to make that leap. To nail down that connection in a truly scientific manner, researchers will have to continue to study the effects of contaminants in the open environment under a range of natural conditions, such as changes in salinity, oxygen and temperature, which alone can affect an oyster's resistance to disease. (See for example, <A HREF="../Sep-Oct96/index.html">"Building Better Predictors of Stress," Marine Notes, September-October 1996</A>.) 
<P>
For now, the researchers who attended the Belmont Center meeting conclude that we have made great strides in understanding where contaminants come from and how they move - physically and chemically - throughout the Bay. Where we have only begun to make progress, they say, is in understanding the biological effects those contaminants can have - not only on large organisms like fish, but also on the microscopic plants and animals that make up the foundation of the Bay's food web.

The following points are among the significant conclusions of a new Maryland Sea Grant report, <FONT="#000000"><I>Contaminants in the Chesapeake Bay</I></FONT>, resulting from a December 1995 meeting of researchers:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Monitoring has shown that contaminants emanating from diffuse sources (e.g., car exhaust and other air deposition, stormwater runoff, household and boating solvents and other chemicals) are becoming relatively more important than industrial sources, which have been dramatically reduced since the passage of Clean Water and Clean Air legislation.  
<P>
<LI>In addition to identified "hot spots" (Regions of Concern) evidence exists that low-levels of contaminants in the Chesapeake Bay have an impact on organisms at several major levels of the food web.
<P>
<LI>Specifically, research shows that oysters exposed to chemical contaminants in the Bay are more vulnerable to diseases such as Dermo. This may be especially significant, given current efforts to restore oyster reefs and oyster populations in the Chesapeake.
<P>
<LI>Exposure to trace metals and other contaminants can affect phytoplankton populations under research conditions, for example, causing shifts in species composition. Since phytoplankton form an important base of the Bay's food web, changes here could have significant impacts throughout the Bay.
<P>
<LI>Studies have indicated that certain chemicals appear to affect both individual species (such as copepods, which can be damaged by Dimilin, a treatment for gypsy moth infestations) and species diversity (as through contact with compounds used as preservatives in wooden bulkheads).
<P>
<LI>Because of the evidence of biological impacts - even at relatively low levels of contamination, and because diffuse sources may be more difficult to control than point sources - it is imperative that we further investigate the effects of contaminants at environmentally realistic levels, on key facets of the Bay's food web.

At least since the large EPA study of the Chesapeake Bay in the early 1980s described toxic chemicals as a threat to the Bay's health, scientists have struggled to understand the impact of various contaminants on the Chesapeake. The issue remains a difficult one.</FONT><P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<H3>Analytical Tools and Methods?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Researchers have been limited by their ability to detect contaminants in tiny amounts and mixed in with other compounds. Recent improvements in technology have allowed researchers to analyze samples with greater accuracy, and to identify smaller and smaller amounts of contaminants.  
<P>
<LI>Previously, researchers were not able to track early biological effects of contaminants, and so could not witness what is generally the first response of an organism to a toxic threat. With new genetic and molecular tools this is now possible.
</UL>

<H3>Experimental Designs</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Researchers must design complex experiments that will allow them to isolate the effects of contaminants. This can be extremely difficult because the levels of contaminants range from trace amounts to major spills and because the ecosystem is so complex.
<P>
<LI>Scientists must be able to account for differing forms or "species" of metals and other contaminants - these forms may change, depending on a number of physical, chemical and biological factors.
</UL>

<H3>Making Connections</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Scientists must design ways of applying results obtained in the laboratory, where they can control conditions, to the open environment, where conditions are much more chaotic.
<P>
<LI>Researchers face a difficult challenge in relating the behavior of contaminants in the environment to the effects they observe; linking environmental effects with human health issues can prove especially difficult.

<H1>MEES Students Receive<BR>Knauss Fellowships</H1>
</CENTER>
Sara Gottlieb and Jill Stevenson, both graduate students in the Marine-Estuarine-Environmental Sciences (MEES) program at the University of Maryland, College Park, are this year's Maryland recipients of Knauss Marine Policy Fellowships. The Fellowship Program, begun in 1979 and coordinated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Sea Grant Office, provides graduate students across the nation with an opportunity to spend a year working with policy and science experts in Washington, DC. Fellows are competitively selected from a list of graduate students recommended by the directors of the 30 Sea Grant programs in individual states.

<P>
For her Fellowship year, Sara Gottlieb will work full-time in the office of Representative Steven LaTourette of Ohio, co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force. She will also help out in the Northeast-Midwest Institute in the office of Senator John Glenn. Gottlieb worked for two years as a Maryland Sea Grant Trainee, first with UMCEES Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) researcher Douglas Capone and then with Benedict Estuarine Research Center (BERC) researcher Cynthia Gilmour. Joseph Mihursky, of CBL, is her major advisor. Currently, she is working with Mark Sagoff in the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy in the UMCP School of Public Affairs. She plans to complete her Ph.D. after her she finishes her Fellowship. Gottlieb received her undergraduate degree, with an environmental science major, in 1994 from the College of William and Mary.
<P>
Jill Stevenson will work in NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, in the Office of Sustainable Fisheries, Division of Highly Migratory Species, with several researchers, including Richard Surdie. Stevenson currently works as a graduate assistant with CBL scientist David Secor doing research on the Atlantic sturgeon. She plans to complete her M.S. in Fisheries Science in the MEES program by Spring 1997. Stevenson received her bachelors degree in 1992 from Columbia University, where she majored in geochemistry.
<P>
Stevenson and Gottlieb first came to the University of Maryland when they received summer fellowships in Maryland Sea Grant's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, funded by the National Science Foundation, and awarded to outstanding students studying marine and environmental science. Stevenson spent her 1991 undergraduate fellowship at Horn Point Environmental Laboratory (HPEL), working with scientist Jeff Cornwell on sediments and biogeochemistry. Gottlieb spent hers in 1993 at CBL, working with Joel Baker to conduct research on the effect of herbicides in the Patuxent River.
<P>
The process for selecting Knauss Fellows begins with the submission of applications by candidates recommended for their excellence by Sea Grant Directors across the nation. The National Sea Grant office then conducts a rigorous review process and awards fellowships to the top candidates. This year the Fellowship program received fifty-five applicants from twenty Sea Grant programs and presented twenty-five awards. Maryland was one of six programs with two Fellowship awards.
<P>
Over the years, Knauss Fellows have worked in the legislative and executive branches of the federal government in locations such as the office of U.S. Senators and Representatives, on Congressional subcommittees and at agencies such as the National Science Foundation and NOAA. Fellowships run from February 1 to January 31 and pay a stipend of $30,000. 
<P>
The application deadline for next year's Knauss Fellowship Program is September 1, 1997. For more information, or an application brochure, contact: Susan Leet, Maryland Sea Grant College, 0112 Skinner Hall, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, phone (301) 405-6375, e-mail: <A HREF="mailto:leet@ umbi.umd.edu.">leet@ umbi.umd.edu</A>.

<I>Traversing the Chesapeake from the Northern Bay to the Virginia capes, researchers seek clues to the Bay's productivity</I>
</TD>
<TD>While there is good reason to be concerned about the healthy recovery of the Chesapeake and its diminished resources, this shallow bay still ranks high among the nation's most productive estuaries. What accounts for this plenitude? What makes it such a rich source of fish, shellfish and other organisms? At least one team of scientists believes that the answer lies in the complex physical forces that link the Bay's chemistry and its biology - a watery circulatory system that nourishes a massive productivity.
<P>
Those physical forces are many - the estuary's sharp layering between outflowing fresh river water and incoming ocean water (the pycnocline) or between cold and warm water (the thermocline), its currents, its waves, its seiches (wind-driven water sloshing back and forth across the Bay), its many types of fronts. Like arteries, these physical forces deliver nutrients and other compounds, and move and attract living organisms - from microscopic plankton to large fish.
<P>
Determining just how this circulatory system interacts with organisms is a central challenge of TIES (for Trophic Interactions in Estuarine Systems), a unique and ambitious research effort by scientists at the University of Maryland System's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES). 
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
They have set a daunting task for themselves - Walter Boynton and William Boicourt admit that they were thrilled and a little scared when they received word from the National Science Foundation that their six-year research project had been funded. With this award they have an opportunity to pull together an unparalleled understanding of one of the world's most productive water bodies, to literally map the way it functions.

<A NAME="PULSE"></A>
<H3>Taking the Pulse of the Bay</H3>

The Chesapeake operates in pulses, says Boynton, pulses of water that may shuttle organisms or even trap them:  hurtling springtime river flows, ocean tides, and jets of scooting bottom water that result from sharp changes in topography. "Pulses play a role in setting up the physics of the estuary," says Boynton. "We would not have the same physics if river flow were constant." 
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=4 >
<TR>
<TD><CENTER>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="GIFs/Marine2.gif" ALT="[rapids]"></CENTER>
</TD>
<TD><I>Each spring, river waters cascading into the Chesapeake encounter salty tidal waters coming up Bay from the ocean.  The density differences betwen fresh and salty water -- influenced as well by winds, tides, gravity, and bottom topography -- result in fronts that scientists believe are highly fertile zones for the production of fish</I>. 
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Pulses help set up physical structures, such as fronts - areas where, as with weather fronts, temperature and density differences create dynamic transition zones. The CEES researchers want to find out if secondary production - of zooplankton and fish - forms around these fronts in the way that primary production (in the form of algal blooms) appears to. 
<P>
One kind of front forms sharp boundaries that result when different water masses meet, lighter layers often lying atop denser layers. Fronts come in different sizes and can last for varying lengths of time. Some may come and go in a few hours - the result of wind, for example - some may last for a few days, others for two or three weeks. The best known example of a long-term front is the so-called "maximum turbidity zone" - a recurring physical structure where freshwater flowing down a river hits brackish estuarine water, the river's single flow mixing with the estuary's more complex tidal flow.
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
"A decade ago we didn't know enough about nutrient cycles or primary production to reasonably attempt this."
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
The maximum turbidity zone serves as the scene for intense chemical and physical activity in a tributary or estuary, with some river-borne particles settling out and others becoming entrained in the frontal zone. In the Chesapeake Bay, the most notable maximum turbidity zone occurs north of the Bay Bridge where the largest influx of freshwater in the Bay flows from the Susquehanna River, entraining sediments, algae and other particles. "It is such zones - both in the rivers and mainstem Bay - that we're interested in," says Boicourt. 
<P>
The researchers hypothesize that seasonal pulses of nutrients from land, air and ocean accumulate in frontal zones and set in motion the processes that produce algal blooms. Are these major zones for secondary production as well - for zooplankton, fish and other organisms that feed on the Bay's plant life? "That's what we're guessing," says Boynton. Their belief is, according to Boynton, that such pulsing systems have an inherently high capability for secondary production. Zooplankton and larvae may be attracted to the algal growth, or they may themselves be caught up in these physical structures. 
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=4 >

<TD><CENTER>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="GIFs/Marine3.gif" ALT="[Sanford]"></CENTER>
</TD>
<TD><I>In the coming year physical oceanographer Larry Sanford (on right) will join the TIES effort to link the Bay's physics with its biological abundance.  Sanford is pictured here with graduate student Weiqi Lin, as they study Bay wave patterns in a current Sea Grant-funded study.</I>. 
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The timing and strength of these pulses shift from year to year because of climatic events - in particular variations in the amount of rain and snowfall - that fuel the flow of freshwater into the Bay. In the spring of 1995, for example, pulses of freshwater came early and were relatively small. Measurements this past spring should give researchers a good baseline for comparisons over the next five years, when there will almost certainly be higher flows, Boynton says, with larger pulses of freshwater at varying times. The researchers wonder, for example, how major forage fish (like anchovies) and their predators will school and behave as the system moves from low-pulse, low-flow years to years with a heavy spring flow. 
<P>
Answers to such questions could tell us a lot about how the circulatory system of the Chesapeake helps explain the productivity of what H. L. Mencken called the Bay's "protein factory." 
<P>
According to Walter Boynton, such an ambitious analysis of the Bay's secondary production would have been impossible before now. "A decade ago we didn't know enough about nutrient cycles or primary [algal] production to reasonably attempt this," he says. Nor did the researchers have the technology to take thousands of rapid measure-ments up and down the Bay system, from the Virginia capes to the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.
<P>
Now, says Boynton, they have both the science and the machine - in the form of the remarkable Scanfish (see sidebar on <A HREF="side1.html">"High Tech Fish"</A>).

<A NAME="PAST"> </A>
<H3>Building on the Past</H3>

As a scientist, what excites Boynton is always the next set of questions. Though we don't have the whole story about nutrients, he says, the programs we've worked on have taught us a lot. For example, extensive monitoring by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and scientific projects such as PROTEUS (for Processes of Re-cycling, Organic Transformations and Exchanges between Uplands and the Sea) have supplied researchers with a wealth of data. PROTEUS in particular (part of the National Science Foundation's Land Margin Ecosystem Research program) expanded on knowledge resulting from the multi-state dissolved oxygen project supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Maryland and Virginia Sea Grant programs. According to Boynton and other scientists, these and related research programs have now positioned us to ask the all-important next set of questions, why is secondary production so efficient 
in the Chesapeake?
<P>
PROTEUS helped researchers establish what Boynton calls the "first-order dynamics" of how nutrient inputs, varying as they do from year-to-year because of climatic effects, drive nutrient cycling and primary production. It showed, says Boynton, that annual changes in such processes as primary production and nutrient recycling are directly related to changes in inputs of nutrients from the watershed. Those shifts in nutrient levels and the timing of their delivery result in turn from annual differences in river flow and other physical factors such as the strength of the pycnocline. The pycnocline forms an invisible boundary - between buoyant, downflowing river water and dense, inflowing saltwater. The strength and extent of the pycnocline, just one of the Bay's fronts, have important effects on ecological processes - such as the delivery of oxygen - throughout the estuary.

While research on dissolved oxygen gathered five years of data at several lateral locations across the Bay between the Choptank and Patuxent rivers, the new TIES project calls for extensive shipboard measurements over the entire length of the Bay for several years. Coordinating with weekly Baywide airborne surveys of algal abundance and distribution by CEES researcher Larry Harding, scientists will gather enough data to further confirm that ecological processes such as the extensive patchiness of algal blooms are driven by pulses of nutrient inputs and the timing of physical forces. 
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
"It may be that 90 percent of the secondary production is occurring in 10 percent of the Bay's area."
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
To date, research suggests that some physical structures recur in predictable regions - for example, gravity currents in what physicist William Boicourt refers to as the "hydraulic control point," the region in the Bay between the Rappa-hannock and Potomac rivers where a steep change in bottom topography accelerates water flow. (The Bay deepens from the Potomac north to Kent Island.) Others, like the turbidity maximum zone north of the Bay Bridge, will shift depending on the strength and timing of spring flow from the dominant Susquehanna River.
<P>
But there are many other physical structures that form as the result of pulses - they may often occur in more limited regions and for shorter lengths of time. Fronts, for example, can form during tidal exchanges, or when a mass of moving water at one temperature meets another mass at a different temperature or salinity. While differences in density segregate these water masses, gravity - along with tides and winds and freshwater flow - drives them through the estuary, often mixing them as water moves in and around the Bay's many twists and turns, over its tidal flats, its narrow creek mouths, its deep river channels.
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
The Chesapeake operates in pulses, says Walter Boynton, pulses of rolling water that shuttle organisms or may even trap them.
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
The more researchers learn about how these different areas behave, the better they may be able to suggest to managers which parts of the Bay are significant in fostering production of fish and shellfish. "It may be," says Boynton, "that 90 percent of secondary production is occurring in 10 percent of the Bay's area. We don't know this, of course. But it's a central question -a hypothesis we're working with."
<P>
If this hypothesis proves to be true, its implications could lead not only to improved management of fisheries but to a more effective targetting of Bay clean-up efforts.

<TD>It is one thing to speculate on interactions between physics and biology in the Chesapeake, quite another to map their complex relationships.
<P>
When researchers intensively studied dissolved oxygen processes in the mid-Bay during the 1980s, they would take a suite of vertical measurements every two meters at 6 locations across a transect be-tween the Choptank and Patuxent rivers. In a day, they might take 36 measurements, among them temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and nutrient levels. 
<P>
These provided them with a series of data points - dots on a graph - from which they drew their mental maps of the Bay's ecology. Now they can, in little more than an hour, take 36,000 salinity measurements, 30,000 dissolved oxygen measurements, 30,000 zooplankton samples. The difference is the advent of new technology, most notably a flying underwater wing called the Scanfish. With this new instrumentation the researchers can see what they could not see before. "The structure of the Bay is much more complex," says researcher Michael Roman. "It surprises you and makes you come up with new theories. It's like seeing satellite photographs for the first time."
</TD>
<TD><CENTER>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="GIFs/side1.gif" ALT="[Scanfish]">
</CENTER>
<P>
<I>Scanfish -- a nw underwater flying vehicle -- is enabling scientists to sweep the entire Chesapeake Bay rapidly, taking thousands of measurements that will help CEES researchers identify whether the Bay has regions of major biological production.</I>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Mechanical fish have been used in the open ocean for some years, says William Boicourt. The most common are the Batfish out of Halifax, Nova Scotia and the Sea Soar out of California - fat jet airplanes with small wings fitted with instruments and towed alongside the research vessel. 
<P>
For the Bay, the researchers needed something more fit for shallow swimming. In the Scanfish, says Boicourt, "we have something like a stealth bomber, a flying wing." 
<P>
As the Scanfish is towed, it rises and falls alongside the research vessel, gathering data on temperature, salinity, oxygen and zooplankton. Though optical counters for counting zooplankton have been available for a while, says Michael Roman, in the last several years their sensitivity has increased remarkably. "We see a ticker tape of zooplankton going through, sizes from tiny Acartia tonsa to fish larvae, pockets of critters even at low oxygen that we missed before," he says. "I get more data now in one cruise than I have in 25 years." 
<P>
Using the Scanfish, the research team covers the Bay twice over ten days, from its mouth to the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, sampling 26 to 28 transects. On the first cruise, the crew uses the Scanfish and fish acoustics, mapping as they go, capturing as many variables as possible, as fast as possible. "Three days," says Boicourt. "And we don't stop."
<P>
Then the ship returns to the CEES' Bay labs at Horn Point and Solomons to change crews. The boat travels again to the Bay mouth, hitting every other criss-cross - now with 12 in the scientific party, as many as the research vessel Henlopen will hold. On this second leg, researchers take process measurements, calibrating production, catching fish to positively identify species. Fisheries scientist Ed Houde trawls for fish - he wants to know species and size distributions, what the fish eat, and if there are correlations between the physical features and the way these fish and their prey are organized. 
<P>
"We want to be able to examine growth rates," Houde says, "to see if fronts promote growth or if they simply aggregate fish and predators together or if there is even a net benefit at all."
<P>
"In the dissolved oxygen project, we learned a good deal," says Michael Roman, "but we were connecting the dots between measurements with our best calculations." The inferences that researchers could draw about small-scale fronts and other circulation features were limited. Now instruments on the Scanfish are filling in the dots with real measurements - and helping CEES scientists to see more than they ever could before.

<TR>
<TD>Ten years ago, Maryland banned the taking of striped bass from its portion of Chesapeake Bay -- at least until clear signs indicated the fishery was recovering, Maryland's controversial action was part of a Congressionally backed restoration plan that required states from Maine to North Carolina to make major changes in striper fishing in their coastal waters. Those changes included raising the minimum catch sizes -- in some cases from 18 inches to 32 inches -- and reducing the daily creel limit. The aim was to allow striped bass to mature so they could return to their native rivers in the Bay to spawn. And they have.
<P>
Today striped bass are back, and the state has declared the fishery recovered. A rare success story -- and a heartening one at a time when the Chesapeake's oyster fishery has been nearly eliminated and concern is mounting over a possible decline of blue crabs. Only recently, however, have questions been asked about the implications of the striper recovery for the productivity of the Bay ecosystem as a whole, for the abundance of other popular species, bluefish and weakfish, for example. Does the increasing abundance of stripers mean anything with respect to the prey they all go after -- anchovy and menhaden and crabs, for that matter?
<P>

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="GIFs/photo1.gif" ALT="[Commercial fish harvest]">

<P>
<I>Bluefish, croaker, sea trout, striped bass, menhaden -- as one species comes and another goes, does this signal the effects of natural cycles of the impact of fisheries management efforts, or both?</I>
</TD>
</TR></TABLE>
Some fishermen have speculated that diminishing crab stocks -- if in fact they are decreasing -- could have more to do with voracious predation by stripers than human predators. This conjecture was based on large numbers of small crabs found in the stomachs of some striped bass.
<CENTER>
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
Does a boom for one species<BR>
mean a bust for others?
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
</CENTER>
There has not yet been evidence to support the argument that stripers have put a dent in the crab population, at least according to studies by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Though those studies are probably right, says Ed Houde, a fisheries scientist at the Chesapeake Biological Lab, part of the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES), striped bass might be having an impact on crab dynamics. "Historically, you would guess that they [stripers] had little impact," he says. "But sea grass habitats have been disappearing in the Bay for years, and young crabs rely heavily on those grasses. Crabs may now be more vulnerable to predation, perhaps far more than they would have been." 
<P>
Whether or not further research turns Up a significant relation between striped bass and crabs, the issue raises a question that offshore fisheries managers from Georges Bank to the Bering Sea have been struggling to answer for years -- namely, does a boom for one species mean a bust for others? How does the harvesting of one fish species affect the abundance and dynamics of other species? And do we need to account for such interactions in fishery management plans in the Chesapeake? 

<A NAME="MULTI"></A>
<H3>Multispecies Management</H3>

Ed Houde and Tom Miller, also at CEES' Chesapeake Biological Lab, have undertaken a literature review and synthesis to ask just that question. With support from the Chesapeake Bay Program's Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), they are focusing on the multispecies nature of Bay fisheries and possible interactions. "The goal," says Miller, "is to ask whether there is even compelling evidence that we need to adopt a multispecies approach in the Chesapeake." 
<P>
Some years ago, Harley Speir of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources examined a set of sportfishing data collected in the same location to see if he could detect an inverse relation between striped bass and bluefish catches. If bluefish catches were up, he asked, were striped bass down or vice versa? He found no such connection. For the most part, though, such investigations in the Bay have been cursory, mostly localized, and they've played no part in fisheries management. "We've primarily considered the effect of removal rates of one species on the abundance of that species," says Speir. "We've never examined to see if removal of that species will affect other ones." Until now, no multispecies studies, let alone management practices based on multispecies models, have been undertaken in major estuaries like the Chesapeake. Most research has been done in offshore fisheries, for example, Georges Bank and the North Sea. In the North Sea multispecies models -- such as the Multispecies Virtual Population Analysis -- have had an impact on how quotas are set.
<CENTER>
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
Multispecies models often predict results contrary to conventional wisdom -- a problem for fisheries managers.
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
</CENTER>
(That commercial fisheries have been collapsing is not a shortcoming of multispecies models, says Miller, as much as the general failure of management practices -- simply too many fish being caught.) 
<P>
"What a multispecies approach should presumably allow you to do," Miller says, "is to modify the catches of individual species based upon the removal of other components in the food web." Are there ecosystems where these ideas are firmly in practice? Not fully, says Miller, who points out that trophic food webs are extraordinarily complex and depend not only on predation and competition among species for a variety of prey, but a host of other factors -- climatic conditions, physical properties, let alone human issues of commercial and sportfishing, together with their political implications.
<P>

<TD><I>What is the effects of the Bay's changing ecosystem on blue crab stocks? Concern over habitat changes and overfishing have led Maryland Governor Parris Glendenning to institute new harvest regulations specially aimed at protecting female crabs.</I>.<P> 
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
A symposium on multispecies management several years ago in The Hague pointed to these problems directly. From a fishery manager's perspective, while species-interaction models may be conceptually more realistic than managing single species alone, their complexity and the results they produce may run counter to conventional wisdom. As Ed Houde points out, multispecies analysis in the North Sea shows clearly "that most fish are killed by other fish" through predation and that "how you manage" top predators such as cod and whiting can have major impacts on other fish in the system." Multispecies models," however, often lack sufficient data, so as realistic as they may be conceptually, they may not adequately represent the ecosystem because of their incompleteness. In the North Sea, for instance, the multispecies model considers only nine species and then only from the post-larval stage -- meanwhile, the model treats the North Sea itself as a single box. 
<P>
Nevertheless, what makes the idea of multispecies management attractive, says Houde, is its taking into account interactions among species and the effects of fishing on relative abundance, predator-prey relationships and competitive relationships among species. For example, the harvest of a top predator (like striped bass or bluefish) may allow numbers of its prey species (like menhaden) to increase, affecting populations not only of prey species, but also of species it consumes in the food chain, what ecologists call a cascade effect.
<P>
If multispecies management has a future for the Chesapeake, the review and synthesis by Houde and Miller could provide a stepping stone. The two researchers will scour historical records in trying to detect trends over the years among important popular and commercial species, among them, striped bass, bluefish, flounder, sea trout, croaker and blue crab. They will be looking for cycles of abundance and occurrences of explosive growth and collapse. "We will look to see if there are clear indications of variations in abundance between species that suggest predator-prey interactions," says Miller. "For instance, if bluefish are abundant, are menhaden less abundant?"
<P>
Menhaden and anchovy are major prey of bluefish, striped bass, weakfish and other finfish -- they are the two most abundant fish in the Bay and on the whole east coast. Unlike anchovy, which travel in small schools and for which there is no commercial fishery, menhaden are the major commercial  finfishery in the entire Chesapeake, some 200,000 tons a year.
<CENTER>
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
Bluefish catches are down along the east coast -- <BR>
multispecies modeling may help to explain why.
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
</CENTER>
Bay harvests of menhaden have remained steady, though there are no limits on those harvests -- on the other hand, bluefish landings along the east coast have declined sharply in recent years. Is there any relationship? Right now, it is impossible to say.
<P>
Teasing out underlying causes is an important goal of their study, says Miller: "Can we find something in the data that suggests we need to consider them in unison rather than in isolation -- if not for the whole Bay ecosystem, at least for key components?"
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="GIFs/photo3.gif" ALT="[menhaden catch]"><P>
<I>The Bay's biggest catch -- beyond striped bass, blue crabs and bluefish -- <BR>
is menhaden, some 200,000 tons a year.</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
For example, he asks, do we see variations in catch related to phytoplankton productivity of the Bay if it is a particularly wet or dry year? "Certain things we can factor in quantitatively," he says, "like river runoff, seasonal water temperature, estimates of productivity and sea grass coverage over time." In other words, not all shifts in abundance will be due to multispecies effects of fishing, predation and competition."We're" not trying to find a single smoking gun," Miller says.
<P>
One problem they face is that the historical data he and Houde will be using -- records of abundance, for example -- weren't collected with their interests in mind. While there are statistics on commercial landings, landings are a measure of catch, not necessarily of abundance. Furthermore, the records on recreational catch are poor to non-existent. "We will have to assume fishing effort [the total fishing gear in use over a period of time] was constant or, in scaling, somehow, convert catch statistics to species abundance."
<P>
For now, that's the best they can do.

<A NAME="FISH"></A>
<H3>Fisheries Management and Ecosystem Stability</H3>

There is another view to multispecies management beyond predator-prey and competitive relationships among fish, one that has to do with the effects of fisheries on the health or the stability of the ecosystem itself. Just how important is the ecological role of certain species -- of oysters, for instance; perhaps of menhaden? Such multispecies management considerations are a first step on a long road that could lead to ecosystem-based management of our fisheries. 
<P>
We have already learned much, in the past two decades, about the interconnectedness of the Chesa peake Bay ecosystem. The widespread decline of underwater grasses and an increase in summer depletion of oxygen in bottom waters, for example -- both attributed to excessive nutrients entering the Bay -- have meant the loss of healthy habitat for young crabs, oysters and other species. Overnutrification has overfertilized these waters and led to explosive algal growth far beyond the Bay's assimilative capacity. Consequently, a major goal in the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay is the reduction of nutrients by 40 percent -- such reductions, it is hoped, will significantly lower algal production and such consequences as oxygen depletion.
<P>
The Bay's poor assimilative capacity, some have argued, may also be due to the near-elimination of oyster stocks and oyster reefs. Several years ago, Roger Newell of the CEES Horn Point Environmental Lab estimated that oyster stocks in the late 19th century could have filtered, on average, the entire Chesapeake Bay in three to five days; in 1988, it would have taken more than a year. With the further decline of oysters since then as reflected in lowered harvests and monitoring, such filtering comparatively would take even longer. Newell's estimates helped catalyze concern over the oyster's ecological role -- and while oysters continue to be managed primarily for commercial use, for the first time resource managers have begun to acknowledge and take into account the oyster's ecological importance.
<P>
Menhaden may also have an important ecological role in the Bay by sequestering nitrogen in the enormous amounts of phytoplankton they consume: since they move out into coastal waters, they become potential exporters of nitrogen. A number of CEES scientists have argued that menhaden could sequester and export much more nitrogen by limiting the commercial catch to fish aged at least three to four years. (Menhaden generally do not reach sexual maturity until age two; the largest menhaden on record, at three pounds, was eight years old.) That is not the case now. "In the lower part of the Bay," says Ed Houde, "a fishery is hammering on them at most of the ages, from juvenile stages through age one and two." 
<P>
We are still a long way from using commercial and recreational landings as a tool for managing nutrient levels or other measures of Bay health. The complexity of trophic food webs, let alone the political and social issues at stake, may make that more an ideal than a reality. But before they can become practical tools, such issues as multispecies and ecosystem-based management must first become part of the ongoing conversation -- and that has begun. The far future may hold surprise connections between striped bass and crabs, between oysters and menhaden that we cannot yet foresee.

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIFs/photo4.gif" ALT="[student researchers]">
Professor Ken Tenore, Director of the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL), one of the laboratories of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies, is trying very hard to bridge that gap, and he is doing so with a sense of mission.
<P>
"So many science students have the most minimal training in the humanities," Tenore says, noting that the kind of well-rounded training that scientists received just decades ago has been missing in the high-tech, narrow focus of current science curriculum. "We have lost a generation," he says.
<P>
Concerned that a generation of scientists have now been trained without the benefit of a study of ethics, of values, Tenore is determined to do something about this -- and he has. Since 1993, with.support from the National Science Foundation, Tenore has overseen the development of a program named "The Solomon's House Project."
<P>
That project helped to bring Chris McClellan, a graduate student from Notre Dame University, to CBL this summer to learn more about the    day-to-day endeavors of working  environmental scientists, and to teach a course to science graduate students in the theories and values of science. "Solomon's House," explains McClellan, refers to more than the location of the laboratory. (CBL is in Solomons Island, Maryland.) It recalls the community of scientists described by the English philosopher Francis Bacon, a community that supplied uncorrupted truth to the inhabitants of Bacon's Utopia, New Atlantis.
<P>
Truth, especially of the uncorrupted variety, is hard to come by, notes McClellan, referring to the increasing complexity of the relationship between science and society. "Bacon envisioned a world where" science would not be corrupted by the influences of society," McClellan says, "but now we understand that this division [between science and society] is a false one."
<P>
"There is still a 'Solomon's House,"' says Tenore, in the goals, values and ethics of the scientific community, though the relationship between science and society is interwoven and complex.

<A NAME="TRUTH"></A>
<H3>Truth, Science and Ethics</H3>

"The life of a good truth," the playwright Ibsen once said, "is about ten years."
<P>
The conscientious science student may argue that some truths have held out much longer than that, though scientists also know that this year's unpopular hypothesis may turn out to be next year's accepted truth. In a recent article about science and the Chesapeake Bay, Don Boesch, President of the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies, referred to a "history of heresies," scientific findings that went against the grain of generally accepted principles, until they were finally incorporated into the public mind. He cites the recognition of nitrogen's importance in the Bay's nutrient budget -- once questioned but now accepted -- as an example.
<P>
How long does it take for such a truth to find its way into the public consciousness? According to Boesch, about ten years. 
<P>
At the University of Notre Dame, Chris Hamlin and Philip Sloan study the history and philosophy of science, and Hamlin heads an undergraduate program in Science, Technology and Values. They both traveled to CBL during the summer to work with Ken Tenore on expanding the "Solomons House Project" to other environmental laboratories.
<P>
"We have been fortunate to have this connection," Sloan says, noting that the connection between those who study the philosophy of science and those who practice the craft of science is not always strong. Sloan notes that the "integration" of scientists and philosophers "will not be easy."
<P>
"For one thing," Sloan says, "science is not a reflective discipline." While philosophers may spend endless hours questioning basic principles, scientists tend to focus on observations -- and collecting data.
<P>
Grant Gross, head of the Chesapeake Research Consortium, feels that much of the current approach to the ocean sciences grew out of funding patterns during and following the World Wars, the majority of which came from military sources with particular needs -- such as mapping the ocean floor.
<P>
In fact, according to Grant Gross, scientists probably spend too much time gathering data, and not enough time thinking about what they mean. "The universities have failed us in this regard as well," he says. Both Tenore and Gross agree that most funding agencies want to see the gathering of new data, not the processing of old data. Says Gross, "We tend to fund 'exploration' rather than 'science.'"

<A NAME="NDC"></A>
<H3>The Notre Dame Connection</H3>

Ken Tenore's interest in ethics and science led him to spend his sabbatical at Notre Dame as a visiting scholar in the Reilly Center for Science, Technology and Values, where he pursued further study in the philosophy of science. "Many of the terms we scientists use to describe such concepts as hypotheses come from the tradition of logical positivism -- about which we scientists know very little," he says.
<P>
Tenore points out that there are elements of science -- so-called "cognitive values," such as elegance, simplicity and grace -- that are just as central to how science works as the scientific method. He feels that marine laboratories, with their transdisciplinary approaches to problems, provide a natural place for an academic melding of science and philosophy to blossom.
<P>
At the same time, Philip Sloan cautions against superficial integrations. "A number of years ago we decided as a society that we had to 'humanize' doctors," he says. The result was not always meaningful -- at times required courses in the humanities only presented prospective doctors with what he calls a "veneer of humanism." The course at CBL taught last summer by Chris McClellan works hard at going beyond the veneer of humanism. Students studied not only the logical underpinnings of science, but also science's social context and the issue of ethics, including fraud and plagiarism. They ended with an examination of environmental ethics.
<P>
"We plan to continue this effort into the future," says Tenore. If courses like these are successful, the next generation of researchers should know much more about ethics and philosophy -- and according to Tenore they should make much better scientists.

<H1>Sturgeon -- Looking Ahead</H1>

By Merrill Leffler<BR>
Maryland Sea Grant
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="GIFs/sturg_l.gif" ALT="[sturgeon]">
That giant 500-pound sturgeons once roamed the bottom waters of the Chesapeake Bay tributaries and were once part of a surprise to those who associate sturgeon caviar with Russia's Caspian Sea. That these ancient creatures are no longer native to the Chesapeake should be less of a surprise, conditioned as we are to the impact of human activities on other once-abundant species -- oysters and shad and herring and submerged grasses.
<P>
Atlantic sturgeon (<I>Acipenser oxyrichus</I>) -- which date as far back as the Cretaceous period 150 million years ago -- have fared even worse perhaps because of their special habitat needs, let alone their peculiar biology, says Dave Spector, a fisheries scientists at the Chesapeake Biological Lab, part of the University of Maryland System's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies.
<P>
Cruising low to the river bottom, their hanging whiskers on the alert for potential food, sturgeon suck up benthic molluscs, worm, gastropods, and other inhabitants of sediment. Yet during spring and summer in the Chesapeake, it is these bottom habitats that are often starved for oxygen, thus making a desert of some sturgeon feeding grounds.
<P>
Then there is the matter of their slow sexual maturity -- for males, 9 to 12 years, females st least 14 years. If they aren't netted by commercial and recreational fishermen before maturity, females are often harvested at first maturity for their valuable roe. That is the case in the Hudson River where a dozen or so sturgeon fishermen operate operate, according to Jill Stevenson, a graduate student working with Secor. A mature female sturgeon may bring a fisherman two or three thousand dollars for the roe; then there is a market for the flesh as well, known in New York as "Albany Beef."
<P>
Even when the sturgeon do reach maturity, they produce a relatively small number of eggs -- ten times fewer than the number of eggs produced by striped bass or shad. Furthermore, unlike striped bass which release fertilized eggs into the water, sturgeon deposit their large, sticky eggs on hard surfaces.  Siltation of bottom habitats and the loss of submerges grasses may have greatly reduced the areas that sturgeon need to successfully reproduce. There is no evidence of reproduction in Bay waters in more than 20 years -- the sturgeon that have been spotted are thought to be visitors from other estuaries where there are still remnant populations.
<P>
Despite these seeming odds against restoring sturgeon to the Chesapeake, Dave Secor is an optimist about the potential for success and has been working with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, with the Hudson River Foundation and with Maryland Sea Grant to try to determine what it will take to bring sturgeon back to the Bay. Such a restoration, he says, will depend on using hatchery-produced sturgeon.
<P>
Since 1993, the USFWS Northeast Fishery Center in Lamar, Pennsylvania, has been producing large numbers of juveniles from large sturgeon captures in the Hudson River. While young sturgeon are already being stocked in the Hudson River, some basic questions need answers if there is to be a good chance of survival. What kind or habitats should juveniles be stocked into? What kind of environments would best promote populations to reproduce? Do we even have sufficient habitats in Bay waters anymore?
<P>
Overfishing may have reduced sturgeon numbers, but have habitat problems prevented them from reestablishing themselves? For example, how does hypoxia (severe oxygen depletion) in vast stretches of bottom waters in spring and summer affect sturgeon behavior? It is questions such as these that Secor is investigating the lab with small hatchery-reared fish.
<P>
Raising young sturgeon has been a new experience and a challenge to keeping them healthy, says Secor. Because they hug the bottom of the tank where everything collects (for instance, uneaten food, feces), they are quite prone to bacterial infection -- consequently, he has had to keep the tanks immaculate, while treating the fish with antibiotics. They are now large enough for the first experiments, which will study the combined effects of fish size, hypoxia and temperature on growth and survival. Similar laboratory experiments will be repeated next year as well, to see if older fish respond differently to similar conditions. These experiments coupled with current monitoring of bottom habitats and the feeding habits for Atlantic sturgeon in the Bay. "Habitats in the Bay could be measured in terms of their potential contribution to sturgeon growth."
<P>
Within the next couple of years, he hopes, it will be possible to determine those habitats appropriate for tagging and release. "Despite the uncertainty about the success of sturgeon reintroduction in the Chesapeake Bay, we will never know unless we try," says Secor. The disappearance of sturgeon from the Bay, he points out, "was brought about by centuries of exploitation and alterations to their habitat. Their recovery would be an important indicator of improvement of water quality, habitat and management of our fisheries resources."

<H1>Student of the Chesapeake</H1>

By Merrill Leffler<BR>

<P>
Jill Stevenson lifts the lid of a freezer at the University of Maryland'.s Chesapeake Biological Lab, releasing the pungent smell of dead fish. "Isn't she beautiful?" she asks, smiling. From the freezer .she takes the severed head of a sturgeon, its mouth agape, breathing frost. 
<P>
"A cow," Jill explains, "from the Hudson River." 
<P>
One can't help but wonder, looking at Jill's bright and enthusiastic smile, what has brought her to this great enthusiasm for sturgeon, even dead ones. 
<P>
The answer begins, no doubt, a long time ago, but one important waypoint between Jill's studies in geochemistry at Columbia University and the staring sturgeon in her hands was the summer of 1991. That summer Jill came to the Chesapeake Bay as part of a Maryland Sea Grant Research Experiences for Undergraduates (<A HREF="../../../Education/index.html">REU</A>) program, sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Student fellows are paired with researchers on Bay-related science projects, mostly at the University's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies and its two Bay laboratories, the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) and the Horn Point Environmental Laboratory (HPEL).
<P>
During that summer Jill worked with research scientist Jeff Cornwell at the Horn Point Lab, near Cambridge. She worked with others as well, who both challenged her and supported her, she says. The work -- on sediments and biogeochemistry -- was not easy. 
<P>
"The exposure to the Bay and the research community was really important. I also got a very good sense of graduate school," she says. "After that, I decided to wait for a couple of years [before going back to school]."
<P>
She did not wait to go back to Nature. Right out of college, Jill worked with the Conservation Career Development Program, taking urban kids into the woods. "I lived in a tent," she says, "at the foot of Old Rag Mountain." In her care were eight young people from Newark, New Jersey. She set them to work on the Old Rag trail with picks and shovels -- for nearly six weeks. "We moved a lot of rock," she says. "There were many erosion problems, due to overuse."
<P>
For her efforts she won an "Excellence Award" from the Shenandoah National Park. Working with young people and living outdoors had great appeal, but, she says, "I missed the water."
<P>
Drawn back to the Bay, Jill worked for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the largest Bay education and advocacy group in the region. She ran a canoe program for middle and high school students and adults, working out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. One important focus was the Susquehanna as it passes through Lancaster County, site of heavy fertilizer inputs to the Bay downstream. "But I still wasn't .seeing enough of the Bay," she says.  Her next move took her into Maryland, where she helped to manage a CBF education program for the northern Bay.
<P>
"I love to watch the changes in the Chesapeake," she says. "The ospreys leaving and coming back. And there are many inspiring people who work on the Bay."
<P>
In January 1995, Jill entered graduate school at the University of Maryland, where she now works with David Secor and others on the Atlantic sturgeon. "My whole day revolves around the Bay," she says, adding, "I don't want to leave."
<P>
Beyond being near the Chesapeake Bay, Jill wants to make a difference. "The ideal job," she says, "is one where I can solve a problem." Graduate school is an important step toward her goal. "Without graduate school," she says, "I couldn't do what I wanted to do."
<P>
One important benefit of the REU program, says Jill, was that it helped her decide what to do with her life. "I asked myself, 'Do I really want to do this?"' she says. "Yes," she answers, "I do."

<A NAME="START"> </A>
Each summer, flotillas of sea nettles invade the Chesapeake Bay. By July they have often grown so thick in the Bay's creeks, rivers and open waters that bathers begin an annual evacuation of the water. Not so for scientists. Stinging nettles and other gelatinous zooplankton have been enticing researchers to get as close as they can to determine just what role these jellied creaturesnot only nettles but also ctenophores or comb jellies - have on the Bay ecosystem.<P>
"For years, researchers worldwide tended to ignore gelatinous animals and their ecological function," says Jennifer Purcell, a scientist at the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies  (<A HREF="http://co.cees..edu/">CEES</A>). "They can be difficult to study and sometimes are simply a nuisance, clogging the nets of researchers trying to get Bay samples of zooplankton or fish."<P>
But research over this last eight years by Purcell and other scientists in the Chesapeake region, Ed Houde at the CEES Chesapeake Biological Lab and Denise Breitburg at the Benedict Estuarine Research Lab, is making it impossible for ecologists to ignore these creatures. They are voracious feeders. "During the summer," says Ed Houde, "sea nettles are probably the most important predator of ichthyoplankton - the fish larvae that are so plentiful in the Bay." Researchers and resource managers alike want to know just how many young fish these jelly-like feeders are taking from the system and how they may affect adult abundance.<P>
<CITE>The Chesapeake Bay's stinging jellyfish, called sea nettles, and their non-stinging cousins, the comb jellies, are both voracious feeders.</CITE><BR>

<H3>Jellyfish In the Chesapeake</H3>
Until the mid-196Os, hardly more was known about the sea nettle (<CITE>Chrysaora quinquecirrha</CITE>) than its basic biology, namely that it has two life stages, one where small, swimming larvae fasten to a surface and develop into fixed polyps, and a second where the mature polyps begin to bud off (strobilate) young nettles (ephyra) which mature into the large bell-shaped medusae that produce eggs and sperm.<P>
The medusa - with its semitransparent bell and streaming tentacles - is easy enough to see. But the polyp proved more elusive. "People knew what the polyp stage looked like back then" says Dave Cargo, "But nobody could actually find them in the Bay."<P>
The problem, he says, is that they weren't looking in the right places. Like others, Cargo began looking for polyps on hard surfaces, primarily oyster shell, but he found those shells crowded with young oysters and other organisms, which left little room for nettle polyps. Only when he looked at the undersides of those shells did he discover them lurking there.<P>
Now retired from the CEES Chesapeake Biological Lab, he began the first extensive field studies of nettles, studies that described the nettles' general habitat needs, their salinity tolerance, and their temperature requirements. Unlike many other jellyfish which flourish at ocean salinities, greater than 30 parts per thousand salt, nettles, he found, do best between 7 and 25 parts per thousand.<P>
Beginning in 1%0, Cargo began what has become a thirty-year monitoring of sea nettle abundance in the Patuxent River. That monitoring was not, he says, very sophisticated: each day at lunch during July and August, he would walk out on the 200-foot pier at CBL and simply count the number of nettles. His aim was to try and correlate sea nettle prevalence with climatic factors-temperature, waterflow, salinity - to see if he could predict the intensity of sea nettle infestations each summer. Though not rigorous by scientific standards, he points out that "after 25 years you have numbers you can hang your hat on." Houde is more emphatic - "Dave Cargo's is the kind of long-term data we rarely have. That's what makes it so important."<P>
<A NAME="FOODWEB"> </A>
<H3>Jellyfish and the Food Web</H3>
Some ecologists have hypothesized that, because of changes that have occurred at the bottom of the food chain, the sea nettle and other gelatinous species may be more plentiful in the Bay than when settlers first arrived in the Chesapeake region. According to one argument, the clearing of land and continued development of shorelines have made the Bay more susceptible to runoff of the soil's natural nutrients and, increasingly, more vulnerable to today's massive nutrient overloading from human, animal and agricultural wastes. The consequence, most researchers agree, has been explosive growth of phytoplankton, the single-celled plants that thrive on nutrients.<P>
But how has massive phytoplankton growth affected the Bay's food web? For one thing, continuing overenrichment of nutrients, known as eutrophication, has been hypothesized to favor production of microorganisms like bacteria and microzooplankton (protozoans and rotifers) that feed on them. Some ecologists have proposed that these microscopic zooplankton support gelatinous species more than the "higher" forms of zooplankton, such as copepods, and fish larvae. Has the Bay's eutrophication meant more nettles?<P>
Denise Breitburg is skeptical. She questions arguments that claim the Chesapeake Bay has a greater prevalence of sea nettles now than several hundred years ago simply because of changes at the bottom of the food chain. Estuarine ecosystems are not that simple, she says. "You have to look at details of trophic . interactions higher up in the food chain," she argues, "and the behaviors of the various species involved." There is some evidence in her recent studies, for example, that nettles can tolerate low dissolved oxygen concentrations better than the larval fish or zooplankton they feed on. Though nettles were impaired, says Breitburg, they continued to feed at significantly high rates.<P>
The prevalence of sea nettles themselves appears to be conditioned by the timing and intensity of spring rains, which in turn affect the budding of ephyrae by polyps. This year, for instance, cold spring temperatures and heavy rains have kept nettle production downthere aren't very many to count at the CBL pier. But these same environmental conditions also affect zooplankton concentrations, larval fish populations and temperature, all of which have ramifications for sea nettle and ctenophore behavior that cascade up and down the rest of the food chain.<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/jelly2.gif" ALT=""><BR>
Teasing out these ramifications has led Breitburg, Jennifer Purcell and Ed Houde to look closely at how these gelatinous species compete for food, what they consume, what they don't consume, and how they behave under different environmental conditions. In effect, they have been working to quantify predation of sea nettles and other jellies on other Bay inhabitants. Purcell, for example, has done painstaking laboratory experiments to determine how sea nettles feed on oyster and other bivalve larvae. Because peak sea nettle abundance occurs in summer during the oyster spawning season, many scientists had assumed that nettles were consuming large numbers of the swimming larval oysters.<P>
Research in Purcell's laboratory, however, has shown that sea nettles may help oysters. Oysters have a larval stage that spends about two weeks swimming in the Bay before they settle to grow into mature oysters. During this swimming stage, they are vulnerable to predators such as sea nettles and comb jellies. Although sea nettles can catch the larval oysters, Purcell discovered much to her surprise, that they spit them out undigested and unharmed. These findings may be the first reported evidence of oyster larvae passing alive through a carnivorous predator.<P>
In contrast, comb jellies catch and digest the larvae readily. However, comb jellies are also a favorite food of sea nettles, and they reduce comb jelly populations to zero in the tributaries during the summer when oyster larvae are most abundant. "Therefore," says Purcell, "sea nettles appear to protect oyster larvae from a major predator."<P>
Gelatinous species also feed on small zooplankton, fish eggs and larval fish. How much these species consume is especially important for bay anchovy, says Houde, which are hunting the same prey. As competitors with the anchovy, which are an important food for striped bass, bluefish and other Bay species, jellyfish could eventually have indirect impacts on their production. But explaining just what those impacts are will depend on experiments that detail predation rates among jellyfish and anchovy. In one related experiment, Houde - working with Jim Cowan, now at the University of South Alabama - found that the gelatinous predators "have the potential to consume 20 to 40 percent of the daily eggs and larvae of bay anchovy in mid-Chesapeake Bay." He also found, however, that when ctenophores and nettles occur in the Bay at the same time, there is a decrease in predation on larvae. This decrease may be due to diminished consumption of fish larvae by nettles because of their heavy consumption of ctenophores.<P>
With sea nettle populations in the Chesapeake down this summer, you would guess, says Houde, that daily mortality of fish eggs and larvae would be down. But, he adds, "things are so variable - there could be compensating factors." In other words, the ever-changing food web may account for the decrease of one predator with the increase of another.<P>
<A NAME="FUTURE"> </A>
<H3>What Does the Future Hold?</H3>
Whether the Chesapeake Bay has more sea nettles now than in the past remains a provocative question, but one that seems too premature to answer. "I could not have predicted some of our research results from theory," says Denise Breitburg. "Our studies have confirmed my feeling - that you have to look at the details of these trophic interactions, the behaviors of the different species involved." In short, there is simply a great deal we do not yet know about jellyfish, says Jennifer Purcell.<P>
As much as we might like to blame the presence of jellyfish in the Bay on increased nutrients or other changes, it will take a good deal of study before we fully understand the role of jellyfish in the Bay ecosystem. <P>

<H1>Neither Jelly nor Fish</H1>

The stinging jellyfish which makes the Chesapeake Bay so inhospitable in the summer is the sea nettle, <CITE>Chtysaora quinquecirrha</CITE>. While sea nettles occur from Cape Cod south along the U.S. East Coast, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico they inhabit the Bay in numbers unequaled elsewhere. They are found most abundantly in the tributaries of the middle Bay where salinities are between 10 and 20 parts per thousand. At those salinities, they are white in color. In the southern Bay, where salinities are higher, they often have red/maroon markings on the long central tentacles and on the swimming bell, or medusa.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="GIFs/jelly3.gif" ALT=""><P>
</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<H3>The Sting: Prevention and Treatment</H3>
The tentacles of the sea nettle contain millions of microscopic stinging cells called nematocysts that inject toxins to capture and paralyze prey as well as to defend the jellyfish from would-be predators. When a swimmer brushes against a tentacle, the resulting sting is painful and annoying. Lightweight protective clothing, like a Lycra "swim skin" or panty hose, or a layer of petroleum jelly spread on bare skin will protect a swimmer against stings.
<P>
There are several things that you can do if you get stung. If bits or pieces of tentacles are still on the skin, pour alcohol or baby powder on the area. Alcohol will stabilize the nematocyst so that it will not be triggered. Powders do the same by drying the cells out. Without such treatment, tentacles which are disturbed may release additional nematocysts, causing additional irritation and swelling.<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
Next, apply diluted ammonia, sodium bicarbonate, vinegar or meat tenderizer to the area to relieve pain. Meat tenderizer is one of the best sources of relief from stings. Add a small amount of water to the meat tenderizer to make a paste and smear it on the inflamed area. Meat tenderizer is an enzyme which breaks down proteins. Jellyfish venom is made of protein and is consequently destroyed by the meat tenderizer.

<H3>Few Predators, No Good Controls</H3>
The sea nettle is unusual in its ability to live in low salinity water. Most jellyfish species live at ocean water salinity, about 35 parts per thousand, while the sea nettle prefers waters with as little as 12 parts per thousand salinity. This means that it usually has estuaries like the Chesapeake Bay to itself without serious competition from most other jellyfish. In fact, sea nettles eat their most abundant competitors in the Bay, comb jellies, or ctenophores.<P>
Adult sea nettles have few natural predators in the middle reaches of the Chesapeake Bay. Sea turtles, which are known to eat Portuguese man-of-war and some other jellyfish, rarely come far into the Bay. And fish species (harvestfish and butterfish) observed feeding on sea nettles prefer waters of higher salinity.<P>
A lot of effort was spent on jellyfish control in the Bay in the 1960s, but no method was very successful. Nets and bubble screens were used to keep them away from swimming areas. The jellyfish tended to clog the nets and to break into pieces that continued to sting. The bottomliving polyp stage also was targeted. Chemicals that killed the polyps also killed many other organisms, and so were unsuitable. Researchers found a small species of sea slug that ate polyps, but culture methods to produce large numbers of the sea slugs were unsuccessful and they also did not live well at the low salinities favored by the polyps.<P>
The only thing known to reduce jellyfish populations is an influx of fresh water. Experiments have shown that sea nettles reproduce poorly at less than 7 parts per thousand salinity. Hurricane Agnes in 1972 caused the greatest reduction of jellyfish populations in recent years. <P>

<A NAME="START"></A>
On Martha's Vineyard, the new scallop season opened with high skies, bouncing sunlight and blustery winds but only modest hopes that a good harvest would be had this winter out of the harbors, bays and tidewater ponds of this picturesque island. 
<P>
So Mike Picciandra spent this windy first morning fishing for scallops - and in the afternoon he went fishing for green crabs. Picciandra has a daily limit on scallops: as soon as he catches three bushels he has to quit. On a good day he may get $8 a pound for his scallops. 
<P>
On green crabs, however, he has no season, no limits - just as green crabs have no season, no daily limit on scallops: they keep eating scallops all day, every day. And that's one reason Picciandra goes out after green crabs. The other reason is money: the green crab is so unpopular up here, it carries a price on its head. "The town puts a bounty on these crabs," he explains, "and I as a bounty hunter, I go out and catch the crabs." He'll only get 40 cents a pound for his green crabs, and most of them will end up on a compost pile, but he reasons that by the end of the day there'll be fewer 40 cent crabs eating up $8 scallops.
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
Most scallop fishermen think of the green crab as a local pest, but few realize it is actually a transplant from European seas.
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
Only four years ago, the scallop fleet that motored out of Edgartown harbor on opening day numbered more than 100 boats. This year the winds are so high and the hopes are so low that the "fleet" totals less than 20 boats. For several weeks, Picciandra and other fishermen had been motoring out to Cape Pogue Bay and Edgartown Harbor and Sengekontacket Pond to check on this year's crop, and by opening day the word has gone round the island: another off year for scallops.

<A NAME="BOUNTY"></A>
<H3>An Unwanted Bounty
</H3>
Green crabs are probably not the primary culprit in the scallop decline - but they stand accused as accessories to the crime. Most scallop fishermen think of the green crab as a local pest, but few of them realize this small green predator is an immigrant into these coastal waters, a transplant from European seas like the North Sea and the Baltic. 
<P>
For marine scientists, green crabs are a prime example of yet another successful invasion of American waters by an exotic species. That makes them an instructive case study for  the developing science of "invasion ecology."
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
Green crabs are probably not the primary culprit in the scallop decline -- but they stand accused as accessories to the crime.
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
Green crabs may be exotics, but you catch them much the same way you catch blue crabs, their larger, more popular cousins. Picciandra uses a technique familiar to any Chesapeake Bay waterman: he builds pyramid-shaped wire mesh traps, baits them with fish and sets them in the water attached to crab buoys. Every two or three days, he checks his pots and makes his haul. "I weigh them up, tag them, and then once a week I submit a voucher to the town treasurer and they pay me." 
<P>
That bounty on the green crab is paid by the town of Edgartown, the scenic village on Martha's Vineyard where Hollywood filmed the blockbuster movie Jaws 20 years ago. In that epic, a great white shark slid around eating hapless swimmers and hard-drinking fishermen. In Edgartown today, green crabs are leaving people alone, but they are attacking scallops and other native shellfish.

<I>Food for crabs or food for people? Paul Bagnall, a shellfish biologist, checks seed scallops at a nursery run by the Martha's Vineyard Shellfish Group.  Lat year the group planted 600 thousand seed scallops in the harbors, bays and ponds around the island.</I>

</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
"Green crabs are a problem in our ponds because they eat soft shell clams, quahogs and oysters - as well as scallops," explains Paul Bagnall, the shellfish biologist for Edgartown and the man responsible for putting a bounty on green crabs. He wants to protect the scallop fishing in Sengekontacket Pond, a two-mile saltwater embayment shared by Edgartown and the neighboring town of Oak Bluffs. 
<P>
Over the last year, he placed more than a quarter million seed scallops in the pond from the town's small shellfish hatchery. He hopes most of those scallops are caught by fishermen rather than green crabs.
<P>
Bounty programs are somewhat controversial as a predator control technique. Proponents like Paul Bagnall make this simple argument: every time you catch a crab, you save a number of scallops, clams and oysters. Opponents to bounties argue that crab populations in a tidewater pond reach a steady state equilibrium. Every time you catch a crab, you simply open up space for another crab to move in. The bounty is wasted money and effort.
<P>
The arguments for and against are largely theoretical, the evidence mostly anecdotal. As a result, a number of New England towns have sporadically tried bounties in hopes of protecting their shellfish beds. And most have abandoned them without knowing whether they worked or not.
<P>
Good evidence might come from the work of Greg Ruiz, an ecologist who has been setting a lot of traps for green crabs along the Atlantic coastal marshes of Connecticut and along the Pacific coastal bays north of San Francisco. As a graduate student, Ruiz worked with Jim Carlton, one of the country's leading researchers in invasion ecology, and his early research centered on San Francisco Bay, this country's hottest site for invasive exotics. Now with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center on Maryland's Chesapeake Bay, Ruiz has been studying the history and pattern of green crab immigrations. His question: can we predict the ecological impacts of future invasions?

<A NAME="CLAWS"></A>
<H3>Claws II
</H3>
According to Ruiz, there have been two major green crab invasions of American waters: one on the east coast, one on the west coast. The green crabs of Martha's Vineyard are descendants of the first influx that began more than 150 years ago. Their ancestors reached the Atlantic coast under sail, riding along in the dry ballast of wooden ships or clinging to the mossy crevices of heavily fouled outer hulls. 
<P>
Those green crabs first found suitable habitat in coastal embayments from New Jersey to Cape Cod. In the early 1900s, they began spreading northwards, ranging up through Maine and the maritime provinces of Canada, all the way to Cape Sable, Nova Scotia. Their arrival in Maine in the 1950s coincided with dramatic declines in the soft clam fishery, setting off an earlier search for predator control strategies.
<P>
The second great invasion of green crabs was discovered as recently as 1989 in San Francisco Bay. First a fisherman found a large male crab in his gill net. The next summer bait trappers began finding green crabs in lagoons along the west side of the bay. Since scientists were able to track this west coast episode nearly from the start, this second invasion has revealed much more about the green crab's migratory strategy.
<P>
These recent immigrants probably arrived as stowaways in the ballast water of big commercial ships hauling televisions, trucks and cars - and the oil to run them. According to Jim Carlton, now an ecologist with Williams College, there are also a number of other less obvious routes. Green crabs, like their ancestors, could also be hanging onto the fouling found in seawater pipes of big ships. Or they could have come west directly from New England, tucked in with the seagrass and kelp used for packing and shipping Maine lobsters and Atlantic bait worms.

<A NAME="WEST"></A>
<H3>On the Western Front
</H3>
The green crab invasion, according to Ruiz and Carlton, works something like this. Young green crabs thrive best in fairly protected coastal ponds and lagoons and embayments. There they eat molluscs, crustaceans, polychaetes and green algae. Though they have trouble cracking a hard clam, they can dig out soft clams buried six inches deep. In these food-rich coves and ponds and marshes they can grow and reproduce in sufficient numbers to create a "beachhead population." On the west coast, green crabs took three years to establish a beachhead in San Francisco Bay. 
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="GIFs/greencrab4.gif" ALT="[California invasion map]">
<P>
Their first major foray beyond the Golden Gate came in 1993 when they reached Bodega Harbor 75 miles north. According to Ruiz, it was not grown crabs but crab larvae, offspring of the beachhead crabs, that made the trip, gliding northwards at five miles a day on the current. These excursions probably occurred during short windows of opportunity lasting five to fifteen days when the normal northerly winds die down. Since 1993, green crabs have been building up a new beachhead in Bodega Harbor from where a new crop of larvae can travel north towards Oregon, Washington and Canada.

<A NAME="GLOBE"></A>
<H3>On the Global Front
</H3>
As the entire globe becomes a free trade zone and shipping traffic continues to increase, green crabs will invade other estuaries - and so will other species. "What we've seen over the last few decades is really an explosion in the amount of commercial traffic that is bringing in ballast water to different parts of the world," explains Ruiz. "At an any one time, there may be tens of thousands of vessels moving around the world carrying ballast water. The effect has really been to open up a conduit for the transfer of species from one part of the world to another part of the world."
<P>
Whether bounty programs work remains an open question. In Edgartown, Paul Bagnall claims his bounty program is helping green crabs, scallops and fishermen coexist. "We have removed over 15,000 pounds of green crabs over the last five months from this pond," he says. "We have reaped the benefit of this by having a scallop harvest up here this year. It isn't the best the pond has ever seen, but there are certainly plenty of nice healthy scallops to be harvested."

<I>Mike Picciandra ponders yet another exotic threat.  The local name for this immigrant is Japanese grass, but is actually an alga </I> (Codium fragile) <I> that roots itself to the bottom, much like seagrass.  It can replace eelgrass beds that scallops like to set on.</I>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Will Edgartown - beset by green crabs and a growing population - ever see great scallop harvests again? Picciandra, for one, says it could happen - but only if the town deals with problems like reseeding, redredging, rising nitrogen levels, spider crabs, green crabs and the influx of yet another non-native species: <I>Codium fragile</I>, a bottom-rooting alga that locals call Japanese grass. In many parts of the pond Japanese grass is replacing the eelgrass beds that new scallops like to set on.
<P>
Though the threat of more invasions looms large with the approach of every tanker and container ship across the horizon, marine exotics remain a small, nearly invisible blip on the environmental radar screens of most Americans. "Look at the problems it is causing us," laughs Picciandra, the bounty hunter. "I'm killing this green crab for two years, and seeing it all around - and I didn't know that it didn't belong here."

<H1>To Catch as Bay Scallop</H1>

On the opening day of scallop season Mike Picciandra spent the morning on his knees in his small green, home-made skiff. This is the position he assumes for "dipping" - one of the odder, older ways to catch a bay scallop here on the tidewater ponds of Martha's Vineyard.
<P>
The "dipping" position looks a lot like the praying position. On his knees, he leans against the gunnel, glances at the heavens, then bends over and peers down at the bottom of the pond. Wielding a long-handled net, he plucks scallops off the bottom of the pond - one scallop at a time. 
<P>
To find his prey, he buries his face in his "peeper," a home-made, four-sided funnel with a plate of glass on the bottom, a viewing port on top and a lot of duct tape in between. 
<P>
By placing the glass on the water, he flattens out the surface chop. And voila: he has a clear view of the bottom of the pond and whatever scallops are growing there. He also calls his contraption a "Buck Rogers," because it looks sort of space age. Sort of.
<P>
In the "dipping" position, peering down through his "peeper," Mike Picciandra looks like an ancient oracle trying to decipher the future by reading the entrails of animals or the tea leaves at the bottom of his cup. What he sees through his peeper is enough to drive a man to prayer or to drink. "It looks like the surface of the moon down there," he groans. 
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="GIFs/scallop1.gif" ALT="[looking for scallops]"> 
<P>
</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
'Twas not always so. When he is not trying to read the future, Picciandra reads up on the past, and finds it a happier story. "In 1945 and 1946, right after the war, we had 260 fishermen in the town, in the ponds. Four years ago we had 280 fisherman, and now we have 80 licenses with 60 of them given out to people over sixty. And I'm right in line for mine."
<P>
Those great days could come again, says Picciandra, an optimist by nature, who dreams of peering down at a pond bottom paved over with shellfish. Edgartown's seed planting program is helping, and so is its bounty on predators like green crabs and spider crabs. But he would also like to see redredging and reductions of nitrogen from the sewage treatment plant. 
<P>
"This pond does two things for the people of this country. It provides a place for those little bay scallops to spawn, and it is also a catcher, a fisherman. If the pond is environmentally sound, it has the ability to catch spat," he argues. "And there is more shellfish spat in this pond right here than there are pennies in the national debt."

<A NAME="INTRO"></A>

How threatened is the blue crab fishery in the Chesapeake Bay? Could crabs plummet like the Bay's once bountiful oyster fishery? Or the striped bass fishery before its rescue?
<P>
In 1995 reports based on an annual Baywide monitoring of blue crabs spurred anxiety over a possible decline. Some newspapers reported a decline of adult crabs as high as 62 percent, compared with the previous five years, a number that was quickly corrected and revised downward to 34 percent. Scientists and resource managers alike scrambled to understand not only the short-term but the long-term trend of Chesapeake crab stocks.  
<P>
The cause for public unease appears to rise not only from scientific reports, but from an underlying intuition that we may be too fond of the blue crab. With consumer demand growing for hard and soft shell crabs, and with seafood processors competing for the picked crab market, many Marylanders and Virginians worry that a vast array of pots, trotlines, dredges and dipnets are taking too many blue crabs out of the Bay. 
<CENTER>
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
Last year annual Baywide monitoring of blue crabs showed a 34-percent drop in abundance compared with the average of five previous years.
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
</CENTER>
For Bay researchers and resource managers, the question became this: Was the 34-percent drop the first sign of a crisis, or was it merely a low point on the chart of booms and busts that characterize most fishery harvests - more the result of natural processes, such as storms, winds, rains, and temperature shifts, all of which affect the number of young crabs that inhabit the Bay each year? Or did it indicate some other problem as well - such as the loss of underwater grass beds, a key habitat for crabs?
<P>
"We had been identifying a number of developing problems," says W. Pete Jensen of Maryland's Department of Natural Resources. An increase in fishing effort, for example. That was one reason, says Jensen, for limiting entry into the commercial fishery in 1994 and for putting limits on fishing hours and numbers of crab pots. 
<P>
In January 1995, at the annual East Coast Fisherman's Expo in Ocean City, Anne Lange of the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office presented a graph suggesting a decline. As this and other data emerged, Jensen grew especially concerned about "a declining trend in mature female crabs." These were signs, says Jensen, that meant Maryland had to act: "We have a very valuable fishery, and we are just not going to wait for a crisis to occur."
<CENTER>
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
Based on the 1995 survey, the subcommittee started from the position that there was a stock collapse.  But after an analysis of long-term monitoring and other data, they "simply were not picking up the problem."<BR>
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
</CENTER>
Maryland did act, by imposing in the fall of 1995 a temporary set of emergency crabbing restrictions. Additional, though less stringent, regulations have been proposed for 1996 (see Sidebar, "<A HREF="side2.html">The Summer of 1996</A>").
<P>
The actions by fisheries managers in Maryland and Virginia, says Bill Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, represent a historical shift from crisis management to conservation. "However," he says, "it means that if we're going to act to avoid a crisis, we're acting with less definitive information. If we want more perfect information, we'll have to wait for a collapse. So it's a matter of being sensitive to warning signs - even if they're not definitive."

<I>Although Chesapeake watermen harvest nearly 100 million pounds of blue crabs a year, the number of crabs available for catching fluctuates.  According to CBSAC scientiest, crab stocks peaked during the 1980's, then declined in the 1990's.  While the 1995 winte dredge survey showed a 34-percent decline of adult crabs, preliminary results from the 1996 survey appear to show a rebound.</I><BR>

<A NAME="STOCK"></A>
<H3>Taking Stock of Blue Crabs</H3>

<P>To get a better handle on the status of blue crab stocks, the Chesapeake Bay Stock Assessment Committee (CBSAC) Technical Subcommittee brought together available data from blue crab research and monitoring efforts in order to do an analytical stock assessment. According to fisheries scientist Louis Rugolo of the Maryland DNR, who chairs that subcommittee, stock assessment is a mathematical tool that can give managers a quantitative idea of whether the fishery is being harvested above or below its highest sustainable rate. As Rugolo points out, the mathematics are only as good as the quality of data that are available, including basic assumptions about crab biology.
<P>
Such an assessment had not been done for the blue crab, says Bess Gillelan, chief of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Chesapeake Bay Office in Annapolis and chair of CBSAC, because long-term Baywide monitoring information wasn't available. "We realized the limitations of that data on blue crab in the '80s," she says, "and that was a major reason for beginning the annual winter dredge survey." 
<P>
The Baywide dredge survey is a comprehensive monitoring effort covering crab stocks in Maryland and Virginia (see "<A HREF="../Feb-Mar94/index.html">Blue Crabs in Winter</A>," Marine Notes, Vol. 12, no. 1). 
<P>
Rugolo's technical subcommittee gathered statistics from commercial harvests and from state monitoring efforts, in addition to laboratory and field studies reported in the scientific literature (see Sidebar, "<A HREF="side1.html">Counting Crabs</A>"). The committee included representatives from Maryland and Virginia and the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office, as well as from outside the Bay region: Vic Crecco of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and two scientists from the National Marine Fisheries Service - Mark Terceiro from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center at Woods Hole and Douglas Vaughn of the Southeast Fisheries Science Center at Beaufort, North Carolina.
<P>
"When our subcommittee met last July in Beaufort," says Rugolo, "we were starting from the position that there was a stock collapse. After the announcement of the blue crab's 34-percent decline, we believed that we were going to find a stock problem."
<P> 
As the subcommittee members went through the data and finished a preliminary analysis, they were "stunned and flabbergasted," says Rugolo. "We simply were not picking up the problem."

<A NAME="LIVE"></A>
<H3>How Long Does a Blue Crab Live?</H3>
"The first order of business in doing an assessment is literally to define the characteristics of the species," says Rugolo. For the blue crab, like other species, this means identifying its life history, how soon it matures, how fast it grows, how long it lives - these are examples of biological reference points that can then help scientists calculate levels of catch or exploitation that will leave enough crabs to sustain stocks at a desired level.
<P>
The blue crab's natural longevity is an important factor here and one still disputed by scientists. So far, no reliable method exists for calculating the age of  blue crabs, a process made difficult by molting, where the crab leaves its shell - and evidence of its age - behind. 
<P>
The question of aging is crucial. According to John McConaugha of Old Dominion University, if the crab reaches maturity quickly, only living to age three, as many scientists have believed, then one could argue that fishermen may as well harvest them, since market-sized crabs will have already reproduced and will die anyway. If, on the other hand, crabs can live to age six or seven or eight, then fisheries managers may want to establish regulations based on longer lives. For instance, females are thought to mate only once, though they can spawn more than once - a second or third spawning could depend on how much sperm she is still carrying from the original mating. 
<P>
If larger (and, therefore, older) male crabs carry and deliver more sperm, one management consideration may focus on protecting large males. Jacques van Montfrans of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science argues that protecting females is also important since larger females produce more eggs. An important management issue, then, would be to protect the largest spawners, not just the egg-carrying females, known as sponge crabs. "Fishing on them [the large males and females]," he says, "could potentially have a great impact on the crab population."
<CENTER>
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
The question of age is crucial.  Stock predictions depend on the life span fisheries modelers assume for blue crabs, and that can vary from 4 to 6, or even 8 years.
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
</CENTER>
Clearly, the age used in stock assessment models can significantly influence a model's projections. While long-time Bay scientists like Eugene Cronin and Willard Van Engel have taught for years that crabs live three, at most four, years, there have been recent indications that they may live five or six or even eight years. Though one tagging study from the 1940s showed that blue crabs lived to at least five years, that study took place farther south, in Albemarle Sound, North Carolina. 
<P>
Are such results applicable to the Chesapeake Bay as well? According to some researchers, new information is causing scientists to rethink several basic assumptions about blue crab biology - not only the natural life span of a crab, but multiple spawnings by females, and possible molting after reaching sexual maturity, what had traditionally been considered the "terminal" molt.

<I>Jimmies or sooks -- which are more important for maintaining blue crab stocks?  Some believe that protecting egg-bearing females is more important, but others argue that size may be as important as sex, and that we should protect older, larger crabs.  This is complicated by the fact that scientists do not yet have an accurate means for determining the natural life span of the blue crab.</I><BR>

</CENTER>
<P>
In 1989 and 1990 McConaugha was funded by CBSAC to conduct a tagging study to try to determine the longevity of female crabs. His group tagged 17,000 female crabs and got about a thousand back, most in the first and second years. When he received calls of tag returns five years later, in 1994 and 1995, he remained skeptical because he never saw the crabs himself. This spring, however, a female crab aged seven or eight years was returned from a source considered reputable.
<P>
In the face of changing information Rugolo's committee assumed a longevity of, at first, six years - a biologically conservative age limit - and then in response to scientific reaction, of four years - a more traditional assumption. In their analyses an assumption of six years led to the conclusion that crab stocks were "close to being [fully] exploited." When an assumed longevity of four years was used, the model pointed to "no evidence of overfishing."  
<P>
Then again, if one assumes that blue crabs can live to seven or eight years, the model may imply that current harvesting could be at the edge - or over the edge - of what blue crabs need to successfully reproduce.
<P>
The CBSAC report caused a good deal of controversy: some in the public media focused on the lack of a crisis and downplayed the call for strong conservation measures. Some scientists criticized the assumptions about blue crab age estimates and questioned the stock assessment analysis itself. According to Don Boesch, President of the University of Maryland System's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies, "The stock assessment should have had more inclusion of blue crab biologists from the start, more factoring in of the uncertainty involved in stock assessment models, more review and quality control, and more direct communication with managers." 
<P>
"It is difficult to get consensus," says van Montfrans. "There are things we don't know and things we don't agree on - people tend to think scientists ought to have a unified view."
<P>
The stock assessment subcommittee continues to refine its analysis, which will be reviewed by scientists before its release this fall.
<P>
For fisheries managers, stock assessment analysis is only one measure of the state of a fishery and only one tool in gauging its health. They have to consider other issues in setting regulations to ensure a sustainable fishery. Bess Gillelan points to the importance of bi-state consistency between Maryland and Virginia, to the need for long-term stability for the industry in the face of fluctuating stocks, and to the overall economics of the fishery - all significant considerations in addition to the question of age and abundance.

<A NAME="FUTURE"></A>
<H3>Future Management Issues</H3>

While a better understanding of blue crab biology and population dynamics is critical to manage the fishery more effectively, there are unquestionably social, cultural and economic considerations as well. Doug Lipton, a marine economist with the Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program, points out that whatever decisions managers make will have large economic impacts. And, adds Lipton, we need to consider the potential economic impacts of that decisionmaking from the outset. 
<P>
Lipton and economists James Kirkley at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and Leonard Shabman of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute are beginning to pose the kinds of questions that could influence the future of blue crab management in the Chesapeake Bay. For example, asks Lipton, are there less costly ways of controlling the fishery? Are we achieving our biological goals of sustainability in an efficient manner? For example, declining trends in the effort it takes to catch crabs (the catch per unit effort) could be due to too much fishing gear - if so, every additional pot or trotline results in everyone harvesting fewer crabs.
<P>
We need to ask hard questions, Lipton says, questions that in the Chesapeake Bay are likely to be controversial. For instance, some fisheries in other coastal areas have instituted Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs), a limited entry system in which fishermen are given quotas on how much they can harvest. This system of management eliminates the race to harvest crabs that can lead to what Lipton calls "excessive use of gear" and a waste of resources. With ITQs, he says, the crabber is free to harvest his or her quota at the lowest possible cost.
<P>
For example, says Lipton, every year some 40 million pounds of crabs are being harvested from the Maryland portion Chesapeake Bay, on average. "How many pots do we need to catch that?" he asks, adding that "every pot over that is a waste."
<P>
In addition to all these questions are questions about the impact of regulations on Bayside fishing communities, and on those who depend on the blue crab for a livelihood - not to mention the half a million recreational crabbers who spend their free time chasing crabs.
<P>
Already a Fisheries Management Plan is being finalized for the Chesapeake blue crab, though important gaps in biological information still remain. In particular, researchers are considering new analytic tools - such as the measurement of lipofuscins, compounds that accumulate over time - to accurately age blue crabs. Meanwhile, resource managers will continue to adjust regulations according to the best information that fisheries science can provide. In the end, there is no doubt that decisions about the blue crab fishery will provide a fascinating history of how scientists, citizens and decision makers interact to manage a much sought-after public resource.

<H1>The Summer of '96:<BR>Maryland Blue Crab Regulations</H1>

"The crabs need a day off as much as we do," says a waterman in Tom Horton's new book about Smith Island, where there is traditionally no fishing on Sunday. As of June 17, new Maryland regulations call for just that, a day to give the crabs a break. Commercial crabbers will have to choose either Sunday or Monday as a no-crabbing day, and they will have to affix a sign (SUN or MON) to let everyone know which day they are taking off.
<P>
Recreational crabbers using collapsible traps or trotlines will have to take Wednesday off, to relieve some of the pressure on blue crabs. (Exceptions for both commercial and recreational crabbers will be granted on State and Federal holidays.) The regulations form part of new efforts by Maryland and Virginia to regulate rising fishing pressure on the popular crustacean.

May-June 1996, Volume 14, Number 3
<H1>Counting Crabs</H1>

In 1968, when the Baltimore Gas and Electric (BG&E) Company began construction of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, George Abbe began setting crab pots offshore in the Chesapeake Bay. Abbe, a scientist at the Benedict Estuarine Research Center, also set pots up-Bay at Kenwood Beach and three miles down-Bay at Rocky Point. Working with support from BG&E, he wanted to determine if the discharge of heated water from the nuclear plant would affect crab populations.
<P>
Though support from BG&E has slowed, he is still baiting pots in the same locations, tracking the year-to-year fluctuations of crabs per pot (called catch per unit effort), taking weight and size measurements, and distinguishing between the numbers of males and females. His data set - one of the most comprehensive and long-term measures of crab stocks that researchers in the Chesapeake Bay have - has the added advantage of consistency: he has set pots in the same locations and has only varied the number of days fished during the year.
<P>
Twenty-eight years of setting pots and more than 113,000 crabs later, here are some of his findings: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>From 1968 to 1982, the annual percentage of males in pots decreased significantly; since 1983, annual percentages have fluctuated but there have been no further decreases.
<P>
<LI>Mean width and weight of males have decreased significantly.
<P>
<LI>Percentage of legal males (5 inches across) decreased from 56% in 1968 to 19% in 1995.
<P>
<LI>Catches of female crabs have remained relatively steady, declining only slightly in the in the last few years.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Between 1968 and 1980, Abbe's counts averaged 3.6 legal-size crabs per pot, very close to the 3.7 average between 1986 and 1995. However, between 1981 and 1985, the average shot up to 8.1 crabs per pot, a number that was especially high because of the 1981 average of 13.
<P>
How representative are Abbe's findings for the rest of the Chesapeake Bay? He and Cluney Stagg of the Maryland DNR calculated a number of comparisons with other data - for instance, the annual record of commercial landings in Maryland and Virginia, as well as the statistics that Maryland gets on the harvesting efforts of commercial crabbers. The researchers also compared Abbe's data with the winter dredge survey sponsored by the Chesapeake Bay Stock Assessment Committee. In general, says Stagg, the records from survey data, from commercial catch statistics and from Abbe's records all seem to track.

For the last ten years, Abbe's pots have turned up crab numbers similar to those between 1968 and 1980 - but sizes of males are smaller. "If you look at the percentage of legal crabs that we caught over time, the average size of all males, and the average size of legal males, you see downward trends. To me," he adds, "that says we've put so much effort into the fishery that we're pulling out males as soon as they hit the minimum legal size. We're getting males primarily between five and six inches and males over six inches have declined precipitously."
<P>
Whether the decline in large males is representative Baywide and what that might imply for the blue crab fishery remains unknown. If the largest male crabs continue to be harvested, could this have an effect on the reproductive capacity of future stocks? So far, there is no consensus for predicting a future decline - surveys of the incoming numbers of young crabs (recruitment) have been steady or rising for the last five years. Meanwhile, Abbe's results are being incorporated into the CBSAC stock assessment effort, and for now at least, Abbe plans to keep catching crabs, and to keep counting them.

<A NAME="START"> </A>
Tony Mazzaccaro is up to his armpits in striped bass. Literally. Standing in a pond brimming with stripers, he tugs on a buoyed line, corralling fish into a net, like any good fisherman. But the fish that thrash in this net are hybrid striped bass, a cross between stripers (rockfish) and white bass - and unlike fish in open waters, Mazzaccaro already owns them. Today he is moving the fish from one pond to another, only one of many acts of husbandry he must undertake before the fish are finally ready for market. (The net he holds guides the fish to a mechanized fish ladder, which turns like a giant screw and lifts the fish into another pond.)<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/Aqua1.gif"><P>
With the filling of his new ponds, Mazzaccaro has joined the ranks of fish farmers in the Mid-Atlantic, and he has done so in a big way. His farm in Somerset County, Maryland, which he has named "HyRock," represents one of the best financed operations in the region, according to Don Webster, Sea Grant Extension agent for the University of Maryland. "It's state of the art," Webster says. And, he says, "A lot of people are watching Tony."<P>
People are watching HyRock Farm in the same way that they have been watching aquaculture in Maryland and in the U.S. for more than a decade, with some skepticism, some curiosity, and considerable anticipation about its future.<P>
<A NAME="CHANCE"> </A>
<H3>Taking a Chance</H3>
The outlook for aquaculture in Maryland is promising, according to the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA). The value of Maryland aquaculture products increased from $7 million in 1990 to $10.3 million in 1991 to $12.8 million for 1992, with an unofficial estimate of some $18 million for 1993, according to Roy Castle at the MDA's aquaculture once.<P>
So far, hybrid striped bass still remains a relatively small player in Maryland's growing aquaculture industry. In 1992, finfish aquaculture - including hybrid striped bass, catfish, trout and tilapia - represented about 14 percent (or about $1.8 million) of Maryland's aquaculture products. The king and queen of aquaculture in Maryland remain ornamental fish and aquatic plants, which together account for nearly 70 percent of the value of the state's aquaculture industry.<P>
Even counting ornamental fish and plants, aquaculture as a whole occupies a small niche in the state's economy, representing only a fraction (about one percent) of the gross income from Maryland agriculture, which in 1990 was estimated at some $1.35 billion.<P>
Still, according to Reggie Harrell, researcher at the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies and a Sea Grant aquaculture specialist, raising hybrid striped bass may be a chance worth taking. "The production of hybrid striped bass [in the U.S.] has gone from 1 million pounds in 1992 to 4 million pounds in 1993 to a projected 6 to 10 million pounds this year," he says.<P>
<A NAME="CHOOSE"> </A>
<H3>Choosing Different Paths</H3>
Exactly how the finfish aquaculture industry will grow in Maryland remains open to debate. "Most growers on the Eastern Shore," says Harrell, "will use ponds." Many land owners already have farm ponds or could construct them without too much difficulty. In addition to ponds, Harrell expects to see net pens - nets that aquaculturists could float not only in ponds but also potentially in the open waters of the Bay and its tributaries - and closed systems that recirculate and filter water like giant aquariums.<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/Aqua2.gif"><P>
Both netpens and closed systems have their "pluses and minuses," according to Yonathan Zohar, researcher and aquaculture coordinator at the Center of Marine Biotechnology (COMB) in Baltimore - one of five centers in the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute. Zohar runs an experimental closed system aquaculture facility in Fells Point, where he delights in growing fish right in the city of Baltimore.<P>
"That's the beauty of closed systems," Zohar says. "You can put them anywhere. We are growing fish in the best water possible," he says.<P>
According to Zohar, water that leaves the aquaculture facility is also "very clean." The system exchanges about 15 percent of the water every week, he says. Suspended solids can be gathered on fine screens and then collected as sludge that can be used as fertilizer on farm fields.<P>
The difficulty with closed systems, Harrell points out, is that they are expensive. "They are capital and technology intensive for the average person," he says. According to Harrell, there are likely to be only a few large businesses interested in sizable closed system operations in Maryland.<P>
That may be true, says Zohar, but he points to examples in other states that are already up and running, like AquaFuture in western Massachusetts. "AquaFuture is the best I've seen," he says.<P>
Western Massachusetts may not seem like fish country, but it is just fine for growing hybrid striped bass, according to Roscoe Perham at AquaFuture. "We're two hours from Boston and four hours from New York," he says. "We can supply live fish to an arc that stretches from Toronto around to somewhere south of Washington, D.C." Mobility is important, he says, since no single market can "absorb" their output of hybrids.<P>
AquaFuture's output amounts to some 1.2 million pounds of hybrid striped bass a year, says Perham. Using giant tanks forty feet long, AquaFuture raises its hybrids in densities of about one half pound per gallon. The closed system allows for control of temperature, water quality and other environmental factors, but there have been some disease problems.<P>
"We have had some disease introduced from fish that come from the wild," he says. Those fish come primarily from fish growers in Arkansas and Texas. According to Perham, AquaFuture would like to spawn fish on site and have complete control of their broodstock. "We are working on closing the life cycle," he says.<P>
At present, researchers and aquaculturists alike generally seek spawning stripers in coastal rivers each spring, stripping them of the eggs and sperm they will use to hatch fry in controlled conditions. The conventional method involves shocking fish with electric probes dangled from an open boat. But like any fishing expedition, the results can be hit or miss. "This was not a good year," Harrell says, referring to his and others' attempts to capture brood stock in the Chesapeake this spring.<P>
To avoid this uncertainty, Zohar and other researchers are developing means to induce spawning in captive stocks. "We want to be like chicken farmers," Zohar says. "Imagine if you were a chicken farmer and you had to go out into the woods and fields and hunt for wild eggs before you could raise your chickens." This, he says, would be ridiculous. "We need to get away from reliance on wild brood stocks."<P>
Closed systems can switch to support other species as well, such as mahi mahi or salmon - by lowering the temperature, for example. "The growers said they were interested in black sea bass," Zohar says, "so we're going to look at that species as well." And flounder could be another fish on the horizon. "With any fish, we have the same needs," says Zohar, "to spawn regularly, and not depend on the wild stocks."<P>
<A NAME="OPEN"> </A>
<H3>In Open Waters</H3>
For most fish growers in Maryland, especially those who do not plan to spring for large closed system operations, growing hybrid striped bass in ponds remains one of the best bets - or, potentially, in netpens, as they do with salmon in Chile, Norway, Scotland and elsewhere.<P>
Reggie Harrell is among those examining the potential for pond culture and netpen culture in Maryland. And while closed systems like those at AquaFuture aim at densities of one-half pound per gallon, Harrell says he wants to aim for three-quarters to one pound per gallon. That, he says, will assure a more stable profit.<P>
Zohar has worked with netpens as well, in Maine. "The water is very cold and stormy, and regulation is tough," he says. "It's hard to get permits."<P>
Getting permits in Maryland for netpen culture could also prove tricky. Right now, according to Webster and Harrell, the state has awarded only two permits, including one for Pintail Point Farm. At Pintail, Sea Grant Extension specialists and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources have undertaken a project to study not only the practicality of raising fish in open water pens, but also to document the effects such intensive culture could have on water quality and on the health of the Bay bottom.<P>
Potential effects on open waters like the Bay are what led Zohar to concentrate on closed systems. "You already have a nutrient problem in the Bay," he says. He feels that closed systems are best, especially in the U.S., where environmental concern is strong. He points out, however, that culturing oysters, with their large filtering capacity, may actually help remove excess nutAents that can lead to Bay-fouling algae blooms.<P>
But exactly what effect netpen culture may have in an ecosystem like the Chesapeake Bay remains largely unknown. "We just don't have data for estuaries like the Chesapeake Bay," Harrell says. The information generated by the Pintail Point project will be extremely valuable for helping us understand what those effects may - or may not - be.<P>
Both Zohar and Harrell are optimistic about the future of aquaculture in this country. There is one way in which Zohar feels that aquaculturists may have chicken farmers beat, and that is "diversification," he says. Chicken (and turkey) farmers have a limited range of species to choose from, but there are many kinds of fish and seafood appropriate for aquaculture. "Diversification of species is essential," says Zohar. "Striped bass will top out, then people will look to other species as well. And," Zohar adds, "though we are using hybrids now, this may not be necessary in the future, once we perfect the genetic selection of pure striped bass."<P>
For Zohar and Harrell, the question is not whether aquaculture will be done, but when and how much. For fish farmers like Tony Mazzaccaro the time, they hope, is now.<P>

<H1>Aquaculture In the Mid-Atlantic:<BR>
 A 20-Year Perspective</H1>

<A NAME="START"> </A>
When Don Webster came to Maryland in 1974, he had fish on his mind. The first Sea Grant Extension agent to arrive in the state, he brought a range of experience on the seafood docks of the Atlantic coast, especially Rhode Island. He had not only worked the docks, he had also worked aboard trawlers, including one that overturned and left Webster and other members of the crew sitting on the bottom of the ship, as the sun went down and the temperature dropped. Fortunately a passage-making sailboat happened by, and plucked them off, almost certainly saving their lives.<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/Aqua3.gif" ALT=""><P>
Once in Maryland Webster began working with commercial fishermen  - he had his own feeling boat for a while - but before long he began to see the writing on the wall.<P>
"How could we increase seafood production? That was the question that faced us."<P>
One way to increase production, Webster felt certain, was through aquaculture. "Even in the 1970s we were seeing reproduction problems," he says. Webster and his colleagues began working on improving the reproduction of oysters, helping oyster growers set spat on shell before placing it on the Bay bottom to grow out.<P>
Webster's work with oysters was the beginning of what would become an extensive aquaculture outreach effort.<P>
"We started with a conference for oyster growers in 1979," he says. Then in 1981 we had a conference that went to two days, with the second day focused on finfish." The conference gradually expanded to include other species such as crawfish and clams, and other states -  Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. Now titled the "Mid-Atlantic Aquaculture Conference," the gathering covers everything from testing the acidity of fish ponds to marketing farm-raised seafood.
But aquaculture was not always the topic of polite conversation.<P>
<A NAME="AGAINST"> </A>
<H3>Going Against the Grain</H3>
"The biggest change in aquaculture in Maryland," says Webster, "is that now you can talk about it.<P>
In the early days of Webster's work, aquaculture remained a contentious subject. Despite growing aquaculture industries such as catfish in the South and oysters in the Pacific Northwest, in Maryland aquaculture had become entangled in the controversy over leased bottom in the Bay. To grow oysters, aquaculturists have to lease the underwater ground for planting them. For many watermen, leased bottom meant private control - namely ownership of a traditionally wild and open fishery. Still others doubted whether finfish aquaculture that relied on pond construction would be possible in a state like Maryland, where land values may often be higher than, say, in Mississippi.<P>
Unfortunately, the debate over leased bottom and the traditional fishery has largely been diffused, if not decided, by two microscopic interlopers: MSX and Dermo, parasitic diseases which have devastated an already stressed oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay. Many of the oysters planted by watermen in the Nanticoke River in the early 1980s had died by the mid-80s, when these diseases made a sudden and disheartening appearance. It didn't matter whether the oysters were on public or private grounds. They all died.<P>
"At this point," Webster says, "the oyster will probably not be able to make a comeback without aquaculture." He points to the possibilities of breeding a disease-resistant oyster, of refining a genetically engineered oyster, or of introducing a new species of oyster to the Bay, one that, unlike the Eastern oyster may be resistant to parasitic disease. Even reconstructing the once prolific reefs of native Bay oysters will likely depend on aquaculture. Already growers are moving oysters around the Bay, from high-salinity waters to low-salinity waters and back again in an attempt to out-maneuver the generally salt-loving parasites.<P>
Anyway you look at it, says Webster, some form of aquaculture will likely be needed to bring back the Eastern oyster.<P>
<A NAME="WITH"> </A>
<H3>Going With the Flow</H3>
Besides the once-plentiful and much-touted oyster, there are other fish in the sea, and the fish most popular in the sea's arm known as the Chesapeake is the rockfish, or striped bass. In an effort to protect its official state fish, Maryland instituted a complete moratorium in 1985 which prohibited even possessing a rockfish - a law which caused problems for Webster and his colleagues as they explored options for spawning and raising the fish. At one point University personnel were intercepted at the airport for sending fish to Germany as part of a cooperative aquaculture experiment.<P>
"Thank goodness all that is over," says Webster.<P>
There is more than one reason to be thankful. According to researchers and resource managers alike, the moratorium and the tightly controlled fishery that followed have resulted in a comeback for the striper. Even so, some argue that (with striped bass as with so many other species) even healthy natural stocks may not be able to supply numbers great enough to meet growing demands for seafood.<P>
The striped bass presents a likely species for aquaculture in Maryland, says Webster, because people know it here and they like it. As a result, there is a better market for striped bass than for catfish in the Mid-Atlantic.<P>
Most fish are grown in ponds, though according to Webster the state has issued two permits for netpen culture in the Bay on an experimental basis. "We're working with Pintail Point Farm," says Webster, "to study the impacts of netpen culture on water quality."<P>
The Bay is a shallow body of water - the netpens at Pintail Point are in less than ten feet of water, says Webster - and resource managers want to know what kinds of effects intensive culture might have on the Bay bottom, on dissolved oxygen levels, for example. Prior studies have focused on very different water conditions, he says, and on different species, such as salmon.<P>
"Ten years ago I would not have thought that we would be as far along as we are," Webster says. "Recent production of hybrid striped bass (usually a cross with white bass) have far exceeded projections." Harvests of cultured striped bass hybrids have risen from 4 million pounds a year to 7 million and, estimates Webster, perhaps to 10 million this year.<P>
"It's fascinating," says Webster, "what new species people are looking at. Cod. Halibut. Black sea bass. Sturgeon."<P>
It may be that aquaculturists of the future will raise a range of species, species now in serious decline. "This winter I visited some of the old commercial fishing ports in New England," says Webster, "and they are in dire straits. The government is even providing funds to train fishermen in aquaculture - quite a change from the old days."<P>
Webster traces his interest in aquaculture back to courses he had at the University of Rhode Island, but he never would have predicted that it would become his life's work. In fact, he never intended to settle on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay. "I came to Maryland for three or four years," he says, "and stayed. That was twenty years ago."<P>

May-June 1994, Volume 12, Number 4
<H1>The Regional Economics of Aquaculture</H1>

In 1992, according to a recent report from the Northeastern Regional Aquaculture Center, aquaculture products in the Northeast were valued at over $146 million. Oyster harvests in Connecticut accounted for 42% of this value and salmon netpens in Maine accounted for 29%, with quahogs principally in Massachusetts accounting for 11%. Hybrid striped bass represented only 2%, trout 9% and other finfish (tilapia, catfish, ornamental, baitfish) 5%.<P>
Most aquaculture operations in Maryland are relatively small, says Roy Castle of the Maryland Department of Agriculture, and they will probably continue to be so. "It's like running chicken houses. Businesses are family-owned and, in general, growers are not looking to expand  - they might raise 20,000 to 50,000 pounds of fish a year, enough to make a profit. That's it." There are a number of reasons for this, according to a recent University of Delaware report, <CITE>The Potential for Aquaculture in Delaware and Maryland</CITE>.<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/Aqua4.gif" ALT=""><P>
Though hybrid striped bass, catfish, tilapia and other species account for a small percentage of the aquaculture market, a growing industry means more than merely the value of fish at wholesale and retail markets. The nascent business benefits local economies and means added economic impact by what economists call "multiplier effects," for instance, increased need for feed stocks such as soybean, corn and cottonseed; new equipment; construction. Estimates based on the catfish industry in the South suggest that for every 10 million pounds of fish produced, approximately 220 jobs were created. In South Carolina in 1992 sales exceeded $4 million - with multiplier factors the economic impact to the state was estimated at nearly $7 million.<P>
Land may be relatively expensive in the Mid-Atlantic region, and startup costs may be high, but with proper marketing, growers of hybrid striped bass - the fish of choice for current growers and potential growers in the Delmarva region, according to the University of Delaware survey  - can expect to increase market share. But just how much that share will continue to increase - particularly with the comeback of commercially harvested wild striped bass -  remains uncertain.<P>
According to the University of Delaware report, which based its Maryland information on interviews and economic data from the Maryland Department of Agriculture, gross sales of aquaculture-grown finfish are projected at $16.8 to 20.9 million with a total economic impact from $30.3 to 62.7 million. Though a small part of agricultural production, the potential benefits to local economies could be significant.<P>

<H1>Underwater Grasses Increase 85% Since 1984</H1>

According to a recent issue of the Chesapeake Bay Barc,meter, a fact sheet produced by the Chesapeake Bay Program, suhmerged or underwater grasses have begun to make a comeback in the Chesapeake Bay. While the underwater grasses, which are essential as shelter and food for many aquatic Bay species, remain well below their former abundance, they have shown a steady recovery in comprehensive surveys performed in 1978 and from 1984 to the present. In 1992, over 70,000 acres of underwater grasses were recorded, an increase of 85% from the low of 38,000 acres observed in 1984. Researchers believe that water quality improvements over the last several years have influenced their recovery.<P>
Bay grasses are flowering plants rooted to the ground which grow underwater and often reach up to the water's surface. They are important to the Bay's ecosystem in a number of ways. They provide shelter and nursery areas for fish, crabs and other aquatic life; serve as food for a variety of Chesapeake Bay life, especially certain migratory waterfowl; absorb nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen; and trap sediments, reduce erosion and help make the water clearer by lessening the impacts of wave action.<P>
The Chesapeake Bay Program, the multigovemmental partnership committed to restoring the Bay, is working toward an "interim" recovery goal of 114,000 acres for the Bay's underwater grasses, according to the fact sheet. If current rates of recovery continue, the Bay Program expects to reach that goal by the year 2005. This goal, agreed to by the Chesapeake Bay Program partners (the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia) last year, represents the areas in the Bay watershed that have supported vegetation at one time or another since the early 1970s when complete mapping of grasses in the Bay began.
Chesapeake Bay Program scientists and managers estimate that grasses might once have covered 400,000 to 600,000 acres of the Bay watershed. Based on this potential, the Chesapeake Bay Program is developing new underwater grass recovery goals beyond the initial goal of 114,000 acres.<P>
For a copy of this fact sheet or others, call the Chesapeake Bay Program, 1-800-YOUR BAY. For general information about the Bay, call the Chesapeake Regional Information System (CRIS), 1-800-662-CRIS.<P>

<H1>On-Line Database for Bay Issues</H1>

Five environmental, government and public interest groups have begun to construct an on-line public access database called the <A HREF-"http://web.gmu.edu/bios">Chesapeake BIOS</A> (Bioregional Information On-Line Service) to make information about the Chesapeake Bay and the related Susquehanna and Potomac River basins available through the Internet computer network.<P>
The Chesapeake BIOS is designed to promote cooperative efforts between environmental organizations, community groups and local officials. The database will provide an on-line environmental database with reviews and updates on the region's physical and biological resources; current information on regional environmental activities and organizations; and free access to government environmental repositories, including EPA's on-line library and the U.S. Geological Survey's on-line database.<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFs/bios1.gif" ALT=""><P>
BIOS sponsoring groups include the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay, the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District, the Northern Virginia Environmental Network, the Potomac Watershed Network and the George Mason University Global Change Computing Facility.<P>
The <A HREF="http://web.gmu.edu/bios">Chesapeake BIOS</A> is housed on a special "gopher" in the Biology Department at George Mason University. For those unfamiliar with Internet terminology, a "gopher" is a place where Internet users from anywhere in the world can stop off and browse through information made available by a local sponsoring computer system, in this case George Mason University.<P>
The Chesapeake BIOS is a database under construction. The organizers are looking for publications, fact sheets and other information they can make available about the Bay region, including the Susquehanna and Potomac River basins. They are also inviting organizations and individuals to contribute their suggestions, information, time or financial resources to building the BIOS gopher. Dan Sklarew, a computing specialist for life sciences in the Biology Department, is coordinating the Chesapeake BIOS project. To become involved in BIOS, or to find out how to use it, contact Sklarew via Internet at dsklarew@gmu.edu or at (703) 993-1043 (voice), (703) 9931046 (fax) or by writing: Department of Biology, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia 22030-4444.<P>

<H3>FOCUS ON PAST SPOTLIGHT ARTICLES</H3>
<H1>Managing Striped Bass</H1>

<CITE>In response to our November 1993 Spotlight story, "Striped Bass Success Story: A Model for Fisheries Management," we received the article below highlighting the important role of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in bringing back the striped bass.</CITE><BR>
<HR>
By Linda Andreasen<BR>
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<P>

For the Fish and Wildlife Service, the success of the Striped Bass program comes as a profound reward for many years of research and effort. The Service began work on striped bass restoration in 1985. Under the Emergency Striped Bass Restoration Act, Congress designated the Service as lead federal agency to determine the cause of the fishery's decline. <P>
Towards that end, water quality problems on spawning grounds were evaluated. Concurrently, a coast-wide striped bass tagging and hatchery program was initiated to estimate rates of exploitation and natural mortality, and to determine if hatchery-reared fish could supplement wild stocks in severely depleted rivers. <P>
A central database, designed and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, stores coast-wide stocking information, fishery dependent and independent survey data, and migratory data from tag returns, upon which management decisions have been based. <P>
Since 1984, nearly 8 million marked hatchery-reared striped bass fingerlings have been released into the wild. In 1988, hatchery fish comprised 50% of Maryland young-of-the-year striped bass in some rivers. Today, as hoped, hatchery fish are far outnumbered by wild fish. While evaluation studies continue on the potential contribution of hatchery fish to depleted wild stocks, hatchery-reared striped bass marked with coded wire tags are used primarily to gather information on population dynamics and migratory patterns to answer management questions. <P>
The Service, encouraged by the success of the striped bass program and the increased support from ASMFC in enforcing management plans, is beginning restoration work on coastal populations of American shad and Atlantic sturgeon.<P>

<font size=2><b>HERE IS JUST A SAMPLE OF WHAT YOU HELP US ACCOMPLISH.....</b></font>
<br>
<IMG SRC="accom.gif" border=0>
</center>
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2"><b>YOU HELP US CARE FOR CANCER PATIENTS</b></font><br>
Virginia Mason is dedicated to early detection and treatment. As one of the top 25 cancer treatment centers in the U.S., we diagnose more cancer cases than any other healthcare facility in the Northwest.
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2"><b>YOU PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETES.</b></font><br>
The Benaroya Diabetes Center at Virginia Mason is the oldest and largest diabetes program in the Northwest. Each year, specialists help more than 2,500 people.  Hundreds of patients complete an advanced five-day diabetes education program, including some who attend on scholarships funded by gifts to the Medical Center.
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2"><b>GIFTS FROM THE HEART, FOR THE HEART.</b></font><br>
Virginia Mason Heart Center physicians are working closely with researchers to find safer, more cost effective procedures. We were one of the first medical centers to use cardiac catheters to treat abnormal heart rhythms, which can now be cured without open heart surgery.
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2"><b>YOU MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR KIDNEY PATIENTS.</b></font><br>
Virginia Mason surgeons have performed over 1,000 kidney transplants, more than all other Northwest hospitals combined. Our kidney transplant program is regularly ranked among the top 20 in the U.S.
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2"><b>YOU FUND IMPORTANT NEW RESEARCH.</b></font><br>
Scientists at the Virginia Mason Research Center are expanding the boundaries of human knowledge in fields such as genetics, diabetes, cancer and rheumatology research. They are involved in exciting new work in the search for causes and cures of autoimmune diseases. Grants and donations help fund nearly 100 ongoing research projects.
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2"><b>YOUR GIFTS MAKE NEW SURGICAL PROCEDURES POSSIBLE.</b></font><br>
Virginia Mason surgeons today are performing surgeries unheard of just a few years ago. Nuclear medicine, lithotripsy, stereotactic needle breast biopsy, lung volume reduction surgery and cochlear implants were all introduced to this region under the auspices of Virginia Mason. As a non-profit institution, VM relies on the generosity of its donors to stay on the leading edge of medicine.
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2"><b>YOU OFFER HOPE TO PEOPLE WHO NEED A HELPING HAND.</b></font><br>
We believe in community service. With your help, Virginia Mason provides more than $17 million each year in uncompensated care for the general public. Some of the ways we help promote a healthier community include Tender Loving Care, a day care program for mildly ill children in the community; midwifery coverage in community clinics; and community partnerships that help provide for the most pressing health needs of at-risk youth.
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2"><b>YOU HELP ENSURE QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN.</b></font><br>
Virginia Mason continues to offer a holistic approach to treating women. We were the first medical center in Seattle to have a core needle breast biopsy machine, which significantly reduces the pain and trauma of breast biopsies. Our Women's Health Center is committed to providing a caring, comfortable environment where women can count on getting the top-quality care they deserve.		</TD>

<font size=4 color="#2222c2">A</font>s a non-profit organization, Virginia Mason Medical Center relies on the generosity of more than 3,000 individual, corporate, and foundation donors to provide the essential funding necessary to purchase state-of-the-art medical equipment, to create endowed support funds and chairs to retain the top physicians and researchers, and to support annual medical program and research costs.  While operating revenues provide much of the needed funds, philanthropy makes the critical difference in enabling Virginia Mason to continue as leader in the delivery of healthcare for the people of the Pacific Northwest.

<font size=5 color="#2222c2">The beauty of volunteering isn't only what it gives to others, but what it brings to you.</font>
<p>
<IMG align=right SRC="vol.jpg" border=2>
All of us can think of someone who helped or encouraged us along the way with a simple act of kindness, never to be forgotten.
<p>
Have you ever stopped to think, you weren't the only one who benefited?  The person who gave so willingly also received a very special reward.  It was your gratitude, and often that is enough.  For that is the essence of volunteering.
<p>
<font size=5 color="#2222c2">What you gain is immeasurable.</font>
<p>
Few people ever get the chance to be a Rhodes scholar, perform at Carnegie Hall or play in the World Series. But for a few hours a week, you can be part of a world class team -- regardless of your age or education.
<p>
Virginia Mason has earned a national and international reputation for advances in medical treatment and research. Virginia Mason scientists were the first to discover the primary genetic marker for diabetes. With over 400 physicians and providers, a hospital, research center and regional clinics, Virginia Mason is the most comprehensive, unified medical facility in the Northwest.
<p>
Throughout its 75 year history, volunteers have been an important part of Virginia Mason. They come for many reasons, from all walks of life, but they all have something in common. By helping others, they gain something in return.
<p>
As a volunteer at Virginia Mason you can learn while you serve, with a chance to expand your horizons and grow as a person, while working with some of the best and brightest medical professionals in the country.
<p>
But most of all, you'll have the opportunity to make a difference. To reach out and touch the lives of others. To find beauty in acts of kindness.
<p>
<font size=5 color="#2222c2">Never stop learning - volunteer.</font>
<p>
It is often said that helping others is its own reward. While that is true, there are also many additional benefits and opportunities for volunteers of all ages. Here are just a few:
<p>
<IMG SRC="drop.gif" border=0>Make new friends and participate in educational and  social activities throughout the year.
<p>
<IMG SRC="drop.gif" border=0>Work alongside healthcare professionals as important  members of the Virginia Mason team.
<p>
<IMG SRC="drop.gif" border=0>Gain a greater perspective on life and enhance your  sense of well-being.
<p>
<IMG SRC="drop.gif" border=0>Earn service credits for school, build a resume, and  get a head start on your future.
<p>
<IMG SRC="drop.gif" border=0>Learn about different healthcare positions and  employment opportunities.
<p>
<IMG SRC="drop.gif" border=0>Develop new skills, broaden your talents and gain  real-life experience.
<p>
<IMG SRC="drop.gif" border=0>Make the most of your time by giving something back  to the community.
<p>
<font size=5 color="#2222c2">Put your talents to work in areas that interest you.</font>
<p>
Each volunteer receives a general hospital orientation and at least 15 hours of supervised training. After receiving training most volunteers make a six month commitment of at least four hours one day a week, with flexible schedules tailored to your availability.
<p>
We try to place volunteers in areas consistent with their skills and interests. There are many opportunities to choose from, including:
<p>
<b>Patient services</b> -- enhancing patient stays on the nursing units by delivering mail or flowers, reading or writing letters, running errands or fluffing a pillow. Whatever it takes to bring a smile to someone's face and brighten their day.
<p>
<b>Clerical services</b> -- putting your office and organizational skills to work in the administrative and clinical offices. Opportunities may include use of business machines and computers, calling patients with appointment reminders, mailing announcements, entering data and other clerical tasks.
<p>
<b>Family and guest services</b> -- working with the public at the Information Desk or as a Concierge, providing comfort, support and information to patients and guests.
<p>
<b>Satellite services</b> -- assisting in clinics throughout the region and providing support for a variety of departments. Opportunities include physical therapy departments, information desks and clerical work in other specific areas.
<p>
<b>Special projects</b> -- helping with fund raisers, running errands, delivering gifts and supplies to departments, shopping for patients or escorting them to the bank or local shops. Utilize your creative skills to help others in imaginative ways.

<font size=4>Estate Planning Vehicles Can Reduce Your Taxes<br>And Provide Charitable Giving Opportunities</font>
</center>
<p>
By selecting any of the following planned giving  opportunities, you will join hundreds of Virginia  Mason Medical Center donors who have already  discovered how to maximize the value of their  estates, maintain financial security, and ensure  the future of the important work carried out at Virginia Mason.
<p>
<font size=4>Wills:</font> A will is a written document that carries out  your wishes at the time of death.<br>
<font size=4>Benefits:</font> Giving to Virginia Mason, a non-profit  organization, in your will may lower your estate  taxes (which can be up to 55%), since the assets  or amount are deducted before the estate tax is  calculated.
<p>
<font size=4>Charitable Gift Annuity:</font> Charitable Gift Annuities  may be established at Virginia Mason Medical  Center in the amount of $10,000 or more.  Annual or quarterly payments are distributed to you  for the remainder of your life. The funds left in the  account at the time of your death benefit programs  at Virginia Mason. <br>
<font size=4>Benefits:</font> If an appreciated asset is used as the  gifting source, you may reduce capital gains taxes  on that asset substantially, in addition to receiving a life income and income tax and estate tax deductions.
<p>
<font size=4>Charitable Remainder Trust:</font> Charitable Remainder  Trusts may be established at Virginia Mason for  $50,000 or more. A Charitable Remainder Trust  may be set up in annuity form, so that you receive  a fixed income for life, or in unitrust form, so that  you receive a set percentage of the value of the  trust, determined annually. <br>
<font size=4>Benefits:</font> You receive a life income and a substantial income tax deduction and may avoid capital gains and estate taxes.
<p>
<font size=4>Charitable Lead Trusts:</font> Charitable Lead Trusts are similar to Charitable Remainder Trusts except you retain the principal for yourself or your family, and Virginia Mason receives the income from these assets for a set number of years. <br>
<font size=4>Benefits:</font> Donors with large estates are able to maximize the amount they pass on to their families by minimizing gift and estate tax. You may also receive an income tax deduction.
<p>
<font size=4>Life Estate:</font> A Life Estate contract specifies Virginia Mason as the recipient of your home at the time of your death. <br>
<font size=4>Benefit:</font> You are entitled to a charitable income tax deduction for the value of your home today while continuing to live in the home for life.
<p>
These are only a few of the many ways planned gifts can benefit you, your family, and Virginia Mason. Your attorney or financial advisor can provide you with details on how charitable planned gifts can work for you. Please call the Virginia Mason Foundation at (206) 583-6083 for additional information.

<blockquote>

	<b>Welcome to the Department of Anesthesiology at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, Washington.</b>  We are a unique department which offers a distinctly different training opportunity (from the large university model) for medical graduates (and fellows) pursuing a career in the specialty of Anesthesiology.  We are known nationally and internationally for our practice and expertise in regional anesthesia.  Sixty-five percent of our cases involve a regional anesthetic as a component or as the sole source of anesthesia.  This tradition prepares our graduates to offer unique skills and expertise in regional anesthesia and post-operative pain management.  This coupled with the growing awareness, interest and outcome data demonstrating regional anesthesia and post-operative analgesia's contribution to lower morbidity and mortality rates, reduced length-of-stay and hospital costs has resulted in a high demand and competitive edge for our residents and fellowship-trained graduates in pursuing other opportunities (both private and academic) as they leave Virginia Mason.  
<p>
	At Virginia Mason, we are committed to the training of consultants and leaders in the field of Anesthesiology.  Thus, Virginia Mason training promotes the following skills in our graduates:  expertise, creativity, individualization in analysis and management of complex and changing situations (adaptability), teamwork, as well as clarity of expression.
<p>
	Other characteristics of our department which recommend it for your careful consideration include:
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li> a nationally recognized core faculty with diverse interest and expertise that supplement the expertise in regional anesthesia and round out the training so that it is complete in all aspects of anesthesiology

<li> a small class and faculty size that permits close supervision and guidance as the resident progresses through his/her training

<li> a value-driven department that strives to teach cost-effective care, as well as practice management in a real-world setting

<li> a history of securing outstanding residents (e.g. in 1995 we filled our residency program through the NIRMP match--one of only 19 out of 139 programs to do so)

<li> a track record of outstanding performance on the written and oral board exams

<li> a long-standing high rating from the Residency Review Committee for Anesthesiology

<li> opportunity to participate in relevant clinical research

<li> a close and friendly relationship with the University of Washington's Department of Anesthesiology (though, we are free-standing)

<li> located in a highly desirable city---Seattle
</ul>

<h4>We appreciate your interest and look forward to the chance to discuss this training opportunity with you.</h4>

<blockquote>
The Virginia Mason Medical Center offers a complete Anesthesia Residency Program approved by a commission of the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) and the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association.  The Medical Center has a 233 bed hospital with 11,902 admissions annually and 17,292 emergency room visits.  There are also residencies in Internal Medicine, Surgery, and Radiology.
</blockquote>
<h4>Clinical Base Year</h4>
<blockquote>
The base clinical year requirement of the ABA can be fulfilled by either the "Complete Anesthesiology" First Postgraduate Year or a "Transitional" year at the Virginia Mason Hospital.  The positions designated as "Complete Anesthesiology," along with the transitional positions, are filled through the National Resident Matching Program.  Students may also match at the CA1 (R-2) level through the <a href="mrnp96.htm">NRMP</a> (known as the "Advanced Anesthesia" Program).  We currently fill four positions as "Complete Anesthesia" and two others from the "Advanced Anesthesia" match, for a total of six residents per year.  All six positions were filled in 1995and 1996.
</blockquote>
<ul>

</ul>

<h4>Clinical Anesthesia Training</h4>
<blockquote>

The Clinical Anesthesia Training Program consists of three years (CA-1, 2, and 3) after the base year.  Although Virginia Mason is well-known for its regional anesthesia emphasis, all of the subspecialty tracks are well represented in the CA1 and 2 years, including obstetrics, neuroanesthesia, cardiothoracic anesthesia, recovery room management, and outpatient anesthesia.  Training includes a 3-month pediatric anesthesia rotation at Children's Hospital, a month on a diagnostic/therapeutic pain-block service, and a two-month rotation in Critical Care at the Harborview (County) Medical Center.  All residents case experiences exceed the minimum requirements in all areas specified in the recently revised standards of the Anesthesiology Residency Review Commission.
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="caseloa1.htm">table of case loads</a>
<li>See <a href="caseloa2.htm">Graph of case loads</a>
</ul>
<blockquote>
Advanced anesthesia training (CA-3) is available in all the tracks required by the ABA:
</blockquote>
<ol><ol>  
	 <li>Advanced Clinical,  
	 <li>Subspecialty Clinical,  
	 <li>Clinical Scientist.
</ol></ol>
<blockquote>
The only requirement at the CA-3 level is a 2 month rotation at Harborview Medical Center, the regional Trauma and Burn Center.  Otherwise, the CA-3 rotations are flexible.  Most residents choose the Advanced Clinical Tract, which emphasizes advanced challenge and responsibility including management of major vascular and other complex cases.

<li> <a href="pain4.htm">Pain Management</a>, and
<li> <a href="cardanes.htm">Cardiac Anesthesia</a>
</ul>
See additional pages for further information in these specialty areas.

<h4>Training Experience</h4>
<blockquote>
All residents participate equally in the operative caseload by rotating through all operating rooms.  Training of residents is based on exposure to a large, balanced volume of surgical cases averaging 450 per resident annually.  Regional anesthesia is a part of the anesthetic plan in over 60% of these procedures, which makes the Virginia Mason anesthesia experience unique.  Virginia Mason is a well established HMO organization, as well as a referral center for the Northwest and is currently expanding its patient base by affiliation with the local Group Health Cooperative.  As a result, residents see a large variety of routine surgical cases as well as complicated neurological, cardiac, vascular, orthopedic and other procedures.  A first call resident stays in the hospital each night and is usually relieved for a "library day" the next morning, normally providing two or three study days monthly.
<p>
Practical experience is enhanced by a structured didactic program which includes weekly basic science lectures, "critical incident" conferences, and a general medical conference.  There is an active monthly Journal Club and regularly scheduled visiting professors.  Attendance is encouraged at the quarterly Washington State Society of Anesthesiologists meetings as well as the ASA Annual Meeting.  All residents are required to take the ABA in-service training exam each July and are expected to achieve certification by the American Board of Anesthesiology at the completion of their clinical training.  For the thirteen classes 1982 -95, the average score of the graduating class was in the 95th percentile on the written exam.
</blockquote>
<h4>Faculty</h4>
<blockquote>
The keystone of resident education is daily contact with one of the staff anesthesiologists in the operating room.  The eighteen operating locations are covered by seventeen staff.  Each staff covers no more than two residents, and coverage is one-on-one during the first month of residency.  The staff provide a varied background with extensive involvement in research and national society activity.  Three of the staff are junior associates.  The 12 senior staff all trained elsewhere, and average ten years of participation in the training program.
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>See<a href="faculty6.htm"> Faculty description</a>
</ul>
<h4>Research Activity</h4>
<blockquote>
Though the department's primary interest lies in comprehensive clinical training of residents, there are ongoing clinical research projects and resident involvement is encouraged.  The Department has a Research Nurse to assist with these projects.  For each of the last ten years, a Virginia Mason resident has presented an abstract at the annual ASA meeting.  Residents and Fellows have participated in multiple publications in the last several years.

</center>

<p><br>

The Mason Clinic has a distinguished history of excellence in regional anesthesia. The commitment to teaching regional techniques remains a core aspect of our mission. As such, we offer three different fellowships in regional anesthesia.<p>

	<h4>I.  Regional Anesthesia Fellowship</h4>

	This program trains fellows in operating room applications of regional anesthesia. Over two thirds of anesthetics at VMMC are performed with a regional technique. The fellow becomes experienced in lumbar and thoracic epidurals, subarachnoid blocks, intercostal blocks, and a variety of upper and lower extremity, and other peripheral nerve blocks. Fellows share an equal amount of call with residents. Opportunities for involvement in clinical research projects abound. About one third of fellows go on to enter academic practice. The fellowship is offered for six or twelve months, with most positions being filled with fellows requesting twelve months of experience. Didactics include a specific  fellowship lecture schedule.<p>

	<h4>II.  The Moore / Bridenbaugh Research Fellowship in Regional Anesthesia</h4>

	The Department of Anesthesia offers this two year clinical / research fellowship for those interested in an academic career who wish to develop their research skills.<p>

	<h4>III.  The Astra Fellowship in Regional Anesthesia</h4>

	This three to six month fellowship is designed specifically to train current academic anesthesiologists who desire to upgrade their own regional anesthesia skills. In addition, the program seeks to train the Astra Fellows in techniques for enhancing residency training in regional anesthesia at their home institution.<p>

	  <h4>Stipend and Benefits</h4>

Per annum salary in 1995 is approximately $35,000. Washington State training license, health and dental insurance, and parking are provided. Twenty days are allocated for vacation and professional time.<p>

<img src="pain.jpg" alt="FELLOWSHIP OPPORTUNITIES IN PAIN MANAGEMENT">

</center>
<br>
<br>
<ul>

<li>Thank you for inquiring about the Pain Management Fellowship at Virginia Mason Medical Center.  We offer a 12 month experience in pain management which is organized through the department of anesthesia, and certified by the American Board of Anesthesiology.  One or two pain fellows are selected each year, depending upon the demand within our CA-3 class for a subspecialty pain tract.  We have two openings for the positions starting in July of 1997.  We are committed to providing a top quality experience for the fellow, with a balanced exposure to acute and postoperative pain management, chronic benign pain management, and cancer pain management.   Each fellowship is further taylored with outside rotations, OR experience and clinical pain research to meet individual objectives.

<h3>Acute and Postoperative Pain Management</h3>
<li>Virginia Mason is a tertiary referral center for the Pacific Northwest.  Anesthetics are administered for many complicated surgical cases, and regional anesthetic techniques are utilized in the majority of these cases.  As a result, we have a busy postoperative pain service.  Opportunity for research in the area of perioperative pain management is vast, and the fellows are encouraged to participate.
<li>Virginia Mason is not a major trauma center, so the proportion of accident victims is very low.  The acute pain service does not provide routine intravenous PCA management.  We have a highly regarded anesthesiology training program, with twenty residents.  In addition, we have an average of five CA-4 fellows obtaining additional training in regional anesthesia.  Overall, this makes for a congenial, and stimulating academic environment.
<h3>Chronic Benign Pain Management</h3>
<li>Chronic benign pain is optimally managed via a multidisciplinary approach.  The Anesthesiology Pain Service at VMMC sees a large number of these patients referred for diagnostic or therapeutic nerve blocks.  The vast array of psychological, social, and occupational issues that these patients present with dictates a level of staffing and commitment which is beyond the scope of the Anesthesiology Pain Service alone.  However, within our multispecialty clinic, we have a highly developed and very busy group of physicians who see these patients on a daily basis.  Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation operates both inpatient and outpatient facilities for pain management at Virginia Mason.  The Anesthesiology Pain Service works in conjunction with physical medicine and rehabilitation, when appropriate, in the management of chronic benign pain.  Most importantly, the Anesthesiology Pain Management Fellow rotates for a month with this group, learning the practice and business of chronic pain management from a perspective not typically available in anesthesiology training programs.
<h3>Cancer Pain Management</h3>
<li>Virginia Mason operates a Cancer Center, and our liaison with the medical and radiation oncologists provides a steady flow of patients with advanced cancer pain.  Most of these patients are candidates for neurolytic blocks, or implanted devices to deliver neuraxial pain medication.  Our Cancer Center continues to expand, and in conjunction with the Anesthesiology Pain Service, is developing an organized and comprehensive approach to pain management in all their patients.
<h3>Outside rotations and OR experience</h3>
<li>In addition to pain management at VM, several rotations to local institutions may be available, depending upon the fellow's individual interests.  These inlcude pediatric pain management at Children's Hospital, and private practice experience with a well known practitioner at Swedish Hospital.  One month of dedicated research time is planned for each fellow.  Other excellent local rotations are also possible.
<li>Many CA-4 fellows are interested in keeping their OR skills tuned up.  Indeed, we find that it is important to have the fellow rotate into the OR at the beginning of the fellowship year.  This allows them to get to know the anesthesia department and residents, as well as to gain experience in providing regional anesthesia the "VM way."  Typically, the Pain Fellow has no other OR duties for the remainder of the year; however, if he or she wants to provide some anesthetics so as not to get rusty, this can be easily arranged.
<h3>Stipend and Benefits</h3>
<li>Per annum salary in 1996 is approximately $38,500. Washington State training license, health and dental insurance, and parking are provided. Twenty days are allocated for vacation and professional time.

<p>The Department of Anesthesiology at Virginia Mason Medical Center is what it
 is--a unique blend of private and academic practice for which there is no stereotype. Its primary 
mission is the education of anesthesiology residents and fellows. We have trained over 300 
private anesthesiologists and university faculty members. Celebrating our 50th anniversary in 
1998, the Department maintains an international reputation for excellence in regional anesthesia. 
And while The Mason Clinic has been providing tertiary care in
 the Pacific Northwest for over 75 years, our community-based practice demands efficiency and value for today's 
reality of managed care.

<p>There may be some misperceptions regarding this thing called the Virginia Mason 
Department of Anesthesiology. One is that teaching and research are not consistent with efficient 
anesthesia care and cost containment. In reality, our economic past and future is rooted in 
efficient practice. Another misperception is that a non-university faculty cannot be academically 
productive, yet our scholarly output easily competes with the top ten university programs. 
We are especially proud that our residents and fellows participate in and contribute to both our 
efficient practice and our scholarly pursuits. Whereas participation in research and administration 
is not a requisite of our program, residents frequently avail themselves of these opportunities. 
Let us share with you some of their accomplishments.

	Virginia Mason has been a leader in bladder replacement 
surgery in the Northwest since 1988. Patients who would be 
considered for bladder replacement surgery would be those 
who will need to have their bladders removed as treatment for 
bladder cancer. Also, patients with neurogenic bladders or 
congenital anomalies requiring them to have their urine bypass 
from the bladder would be considered. Many existing patients 
with a standard ileal conduit urinary diversion can also be 
successfully converted to a continent bladder replacement.
<p>
	The initial bladder replacement surgery done at Virginia 
Mason was that of the continent ileal reservoir, which is 
called the Kock pouch. This pouch required construction of 
two one-way values, one to prevent urine from washing backwards 
towards the kidneys, and one to prevent the urine from 
leaking out of the small, dime-sized stoma at the abdominal wall. 
With this, patients catheterized four or five times per day to 
empty their pouches, and the rest of the time they wore small pads 
over the stoma. Unfortunately, the Kock pouch procedure to 
the skin does not hold up well over a long time period. 
Fortunately, most patients who need their bladders replaced 
can now have them replaced and connected back to the urethra so 
that they can urinate normally and not have an opening on 
their abdominal wall (stoma).
<p>
	The ileo-bladder replacement procedure, which some people 
term the Kock pouch diversion to the urethra, offers the 
advantage of nearly perfect daytime urinary continence and 
rare problems with nighttime urinary control. Most patients--both 
men and women--can urinate without the need for 
catheterizing to empty their urine.

	Virginia Mason Medical Center has one of the largest, most 
active impotence programs in the United States. Diagnostic 
tests are tailored to the individual, avoiding unnecessary, 
expensive testing. Diagnostic tests range from simple blood 
studies to state-of-the-art digital penile arteriograms and 
dynamic infusion canvernography and canverosmetry to plan 
vascular reconstruction in suitable individuals.
<p>
	Treatment options range from counseling to many of the newer 
oral and intrauretheral agents available only through  FDA 
trials. A full-time nurse clinician manged the largest 
pharmacologic erection program in the Pacific Northwest with 
more than 400 patients. Upon entry into this progrm, the 
patient and his partner receive in-depth training and 
instruction on inection vasoactive agents into the penis to 
allow a physiologic erection. The patient and partner 
complete this program with the knowledge and confidence to make this 
treatment option successsful.
<p>
	Newer surgically implanted inflatable devices are now a very 
safe, reliable means of correctiong erectile impotence in 
many individuals. Because the devices are inflatable, the 
patients looks completely normal in the flaccid state, and thus has 
no problems with concealment or activities. When inflated, the 
devices give a completely normal-appearing erection. 
Virginia Mason Medcial Center places more of these devices than any 
institution in the Pacific Northwest. The majority are 
treated on an outpatient basis and our success rates are some of the 
highest in the United States.
<p>
	Occasionally, although rare, a specific arterial or venous 
problem can cause impotence in a young, healthy individual. 
Cutting edge diagnostic and surgical procedures are 
available to diagnose and correct these difficult problems in suitable 
individuals.
<p>
	Members of the Urology Department at VM frequently lecture 
nationally and internationally on various topics related to 
impotence. A short list of recently published papers on 
impotence-related topics follows below.

	Urinary incontinence in females is very common, affecting up 
to one in four patients over the age of 60. Its causes and 
treatments vary widely, from a simple urinary tract 
infection to complex neurologic problems. The Department of Urology 
and Renal Transplantation at Virginia Mason Medical Center 
offers the latest in diagnostic studies and all forms of treatment 
for both male and female urinary control problems. The 
diagnostic testing required varies with each patient, but ranges from a 
simple examination to the latest in video urodynamic 
studies. Within the Urology Department, we have a full-time nurse 
clinician who works closely with physicians to tailor 
urodynamic testing that can accurately assess all phases of urinary 
storage and emptying. This instrumentation and X-ray equipment--valued at over $500,000--is used to test patients 
on an outpatient basis.
<p>
	Treatment options vary and each patient will be given a 
range of options, starting with the more conservative therapies 
and moving to more complex surgical procedures, when necessary.  Some of the simpler options are described here:
<ol>
<li>Pelvic floor retraining. Pelvic floor retraining and 
biofeedback can be performed by specially trained physical 
therapists within the the medical center.</li>

	Virginia Mason Medical Center has the largest kidney 
transplant program in Washington state. The most recent data 
from the United Network for Organ Sharing show actual 
one-year kidney graft and patient survival of 92.1 percent and 97.7 
percent respectively. These excellent results (from May 1992 
through April 1994) demostrate the superior outcomes 
possible by our collaborative approach. The 50 busiest kidney 
transplant centers in the United States annually perform 90 to 100 
kidney transplants from cadaveric donors, living-related and 
living-unrelated donors. The Virginia Mason team includes 
the transplant surgeon, nephrologist, coordinator, experienced 
transplant nurses, social workers and dieticians. In 
addition, the referring nephrologist, an important member of the team, 
is kept abreast of the transplant recipient's progress in 
preparation for the patient's recovery.

<strong><h3>Pancreas Transplantation</h3></strong>
	Virginia Mason Medical Center has a long-standing commitment 
to the care of diabetic patients. The first use of insulin 
west of the Mississippi in the 1920s occured here, and ever 
since, Virginia Mason healthcare providers have emphasized patient 
care, diabetes education, use of the latest techniques an 
basic research into the prevention of diabetes. Nearly one-third 
of the patients receiving kidney transplants here have diabetes 
and some of these individuals will benefit from a pancreas 
transplant as well. After the simultaneous transplantation 
of both a kidney and pancreas (for its insulin production), the 
patient can be free of dialysis as well as insulin 
injections. Many complications of diabetes can be stablized or improved 
by this approach.

<strong><h3>Renal Sparing Surgery</h3></strong>
Avoiding renal failure is one of the most important goals in Urology.  Renal sparing surgery can effectively remove some kidney cancers without removing the entire kidney.  The patient with a tumor in his or her only kidney (or significant disease in the opposite kidney) can face a difficult decision: Inadequately treat the tumor or face renal failure.  Recent experience, however, shows that partial removal of a kidney is appropriate for some patients.  At Virginia Mason Medical Center, renal sparing surgery sometimes involves the use of transplantation techniques, including kidney preservation, back-table dissection and auto-transplantation in advanced or diffucult cases.

	Peyronie's disease is a nonspecific inflammatory process 
that involves the tunica albuginea of the penis. The patient 
ususaly notes the onset of penile pain with an erection, 
followed by curvature of the penis. The majority of patients 
identify no trauma and the cause of the inflammatory 
reaction is unknown. While various medications, injection of the 
plaque, and raditation treatments have been tried, non have been 
found to be beneficial and some may cause the process to worse. In 
approximately 70 percents of patients, the disease fortunately 
is self-limited and will never require therapy. The pain 
resolves and the bend either improves or is not sevre enough 
to affect intercourse.
<p>
	In about 30 percent of patients, the bend is secure enough to 
preclude intercourse or the inflammatory process extends into 
the penile cylinders and causes vascular damage, so that the 
rection will not be firm enough for penetration. The 
mainstay of treatment in this 30 percent is surgical. A variety of 
surgical procedures and/or prosthetic options allow the 
majorty of these patients to return to normal function.
<p>
	As a tertiary referral center, Virginia Mason Medical Center 
managed a larger number of patients with Peyronie's disease. 
Little diagnostic testing is usually required and in 
general, after a simple history and physical examination, your 
physician can outline possible options for correction of this 
sometimes devastating process.

      <h3><strong>Prostate Cancer at Virginia Mason</strong></h3>
<em><strong>Robert P. Gibbons, M.D.</em></strong>
<p>
	Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men in 
the United States, with an estimated 240,000 new cases 
diagnosed in 1995, which is an increase of 18 percent above 
1994. Additionally, the mortality from prostate cancer in 
1995 was estimated to be 40,400. Some of the increased incidence 
undoubtedly has occurred as a result of improved detection 
derived in part from an increased awareness of prostate 
cancer by patients and physicians using an annual prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) blood test (in use at Virginia Mason since 
1987) in combination with digital rectal examination (DRE). As a 
result of such early detection efforts, there has been a 
shift toward the identification of more clinically localized 
tumors with the greatest potential for cure.
<p>
	The Virginia Mason experience with prostate cancer mirrors 
the national trends. Prostate cancer was the most frequently 
diagnosed primary cancer seen at Virginia Mason in 1990 and 
1994, whereas it was secondary to lung cancer in 1980. There 
were 285 new analytic (a case is considered analytic when 
the patient is initially diagnosed and/or treated at VM) cases 
of prostate cancer seen in 1994, and nearly half (49.5 percent) 
were diagnosed elsewhere but referred to Virginia Mason for 
treatment. This compares with 249 new analytic cases at 
Swedish Hospital and 96 at the University of Washington Hospital in 
1994. The most favorable and positive trend attributable to 
early detection efforts is that only 5 percent of patients 
in 1994 had advanced systemic disease (Stages D-1 and D-2) 
compared to 11.5 percent in 1990 and 21.2 percent in 1980. 
One concern regarding early detection efforts was that an 
increase in "insignificant" (Stage A-1) prostate cancer would be 
detected that would not require treatment, but would be a 
source of anxiety to the patient. There has actually been a 
decrease in the percent of these "insignificant" Stage A-1 cancers 
detected, from 10.2 percent in 1980 in  9.1 percent in 1990, 
and 4.6 percent in 1994.
<p>
	For more than 30 years, Virginia Mason has been a leader in 
the definitive treatment of localized (Stages A-2, B and C) 
prostate cancer with surgery, radiation therapy, or 
combinations of both. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the overall 
survival up to 10 years in patients treated in 1980 and up 
to five years following treatment in 1990. These illustrate the 
importance of early detection. Figure 3 is the Virginia 
Mason experience with 463 patients with Stages A and B prostate 
cancer treated with surgery with or without radiation 
therapy, and represents the percentage of patients who died of 
prostate cancer following treatment. For example, 15 years following 
treatment, only 11 percent had died of prostate cancer.
<p>
	The lifetime risk for a newborn male to develop prostate 
cancer is 13 percent, and his risk of dying of the disease 
is 3 percent. Currently in the United States, a man is diagnosed 
with prostate cancer every three minutes, and one dies of 
prostate cancer every 15 minutes. Effective treatment is 
available if it is detected early.

	Virginia Mason Medical Center's Department of Urology and 
Renal Transplantation has a long and rich history in the 
diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract stone disease. 
While we are a primary referral center in the Pacific Northwest for 
the management of difficult and challenging stone problems of 
the kidneys, ureters and bladder, our stone center, called the 
Lithotripter Unit, is designed to handle single or multiple 
uncomplicated stones in an efficient, timely, 
patient-focused manner. Because the Lithotripter Unit is a dedicated stone 
center encompassing an array of technologies, our ability to 
deal with a patient's stone problem in a single, outpatient 
visit is greater than 95 percent. Open surgical intervention 
for stone problems has fallen to less than 2 percent.
<p>
	The following technologies and expertise are available in 
the Lithotripter Unit:
<ol>
<li>Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (ESWL) via a Dornier 
HM3 unit fractures kidney and ureteral stones into passable 
fragments. This procedure requires outpatient anesthesia, 
but no surgical incision.</li>

<li>Our on-site cystoscopy suite allows a urologist to 
perform appropriate manipulations of the stones just prior to ESWL 
therapy, including passing of tubes into the kidney via the 
bladder. These tubes (called stents) are helpful in keeping 
the kidney draining while stone fragments pass. Alternatively, 
many stones may be as effectively treated in the cystoscopy 
suite without the aide of ESWL by a variety of options:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basket extraction.</strong> The physician passes a tiny wire 
basket into the lower ureter via the bladder, grabbing and pulling 
the stone free. This is an outpatient procedure with--or 
without--the need of a stent.</li>

<li><strong>Ureteroscopy.</strong> This allows the urologist to actually look 
up the ureter, visualize the stone and remove it using the 
basket under direction vision. If the stone is too large or 
impacted in the ureter, it can be fragmented with energy 
directly applied to it via a laser (Candella pulsed dye 
laser), ultrasound (high frequency sound waves) or electrical energy 
(electrohydraulic lithotripsy). This too is an outpatient procedure usually requiring a stent.</li>

<li><strong>Cystopscopy.</strong> This procedure used to remove bladder stones 
is also an outpatient surgery.</li></ul>

<li>Percutaneous ultrasonic lithotripsy is reserved for 
patients with very large kidney stones (too large for ESWL). 
This involves placing a special scope within the kidney 
through the patient's side under X-ray control. While directly 
visualizing the stone, high frequency sound waves break up 
and suction removes the stone. This requires a general 
anesthesia and a two- to three-day hospitalization, but a short 
post-hospitalization recovery.</li>

<li>In complicated situations, open surgery may still be 
necessary and remains a valued skill in our institution.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Urology Clinical Fellowship - July 1998</h2>
</center>
The Section of Urology and Transplantation at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, is accepting applications for a one-year clinical fellowship in adult urology.  The fellowship offers an extensive operative experience in all areas of urology, including onocology, renal and pancreas transplantation, reconstructive surgery, urinary incontinence, female urology, urolithiasis, prosthetics and infertility.
<p>
The fellowship is designated to provide four days a week in the operating room, with one protected day a week for reading, writing and preparation for talks.  The fellow also helps supervise resident activity at the Viginia Mason Hospital.  There are seven full-time faculty.
<p>
We are now accepting applications for this fellowship, which starts July 1998.  Applicants should have completed a formal urology residency in the United States, as approved by ACGME, by July 1998.

<b>Heart disease is America's number one killer.</b>  More people die each year from heart disease than from any other disease.
<p>
At Virginia Mason, a <b>non-profit</b> medical center, we want to enable our community to fight this disease before it strikes, and to save the lives of those it has already stricken.  Donors to Virginia Mason's Healthy Heart Fund have helped us to support crucial life-saving techniques, research, and preventitive services that keep hearts healthy.
<p>
Virginia Mason physicians use the latest technologies to diagnose, treat, and prevent dangerous heart conditions.  Our physicians use high-tech Echocardiographic Imaging Systems (echo-machines) to take ultrasonic images of the heart, which can eliminate the need for more invasive procedures.
<p>
<blockquote>
<i>
A school teacher in town for a math convention was brought to Virginia Mason exhibiting signs of a stroke.  Virginia Mason cardiologists performed a trans-esophageal echocardiogram and found a very small hole in her heart where a blood clot had formed, broken loose, and traveled to her brain, causing a stroke.
<p>
During a trans-esophageal echocardiogram, a probe is inserted into the esophagus, allowing the image of the heart to be taken without the obstruction of ribs and muscles, as it would be in a conventional echocardiogram, which is performed externally.  <b>Without a trans-esophageal echocardiogram, a hole of that size would not have been located.</b>  Virginia Mason Cardiothoracic surgeons repaired the tiny hole, possibly saving the teacher from additional strokes.
</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Virginia Mason physicians also use these versatile echo-machines in open-heart surgeries, as well as to pinpoint areas where strokes have occured, and to locate embolisms.  Donors helped to purchase a new echo-machine and new trans-esophageal probes.
<p>
Advances in interventional cardiology have allowed patients with advanced coronary artery disease to be treated with catheter techniques rather than open heart surgery.
<p>
<blockquote>
<i>
A commercial fisherman from Alaska was transferred by plane to VMMC for evaluation of a threatening heart attack.  An angiogram of the coronary vessels revealed two vessels critically narrowed by atherosclerosis.  With a combination of balloon angioplasty, rotational atherectomy (also known as "coronary roto-rooter"), and stainless steel stent placement, his symptoms were resolved and he traveled home a few days later.
</i>
</Blockquote>	
<p>
To help guide therapy within the three-millimeter diameter coronary vessel, a one-millimeter diameter ultrasound device was used to observe the amount of cholesterol-filled plaque in the vessel. This ultrasound device was available thanks to a generous Virginia Mason donor.
<p>
Donors make a difference. Virginia Mason was able to establish its Electrophysiology Laboratory thanks to a generous donor. The Electrophysiology Lab uses sophisticated technology to evaluate heart rhythms that are too fast or too slow. The physicians and nurses in the lab also treat heart rhythm disorder patients using highly specialized cauterization techniques, pacemakers, and implantable defibrillators.
<p>
<blockquote>
<I>
A 29-year-old man was referred to Virginia Mason from a local hospital where he was diagnosed with a heart condition that caused his heart to beat too fast (atrial fibrillation).  During the patient 's evaluation at Virginia Mason, an echocardiogram uncovered a very large aortic aneurysm as well. Guided by a trans-esophageal echocardiogram, Virginia Mason Cardiothoracic surgeons removed the aneurysm. Following recovery, Virginia Mason's Electrophysiologist successfully treated the patient's heart condition and he no longer experiences atrial fibrillation.
</blockquote>
</I>
<p>
Donations to the Healthy Heart fund have supported vital research conducted at Virginia Mason. Researchers are continually learning more about heart disease and the effects of certain types of treatments by conducting clinical research that benefits patients and healthy hearts alike. Virginia Mason physicians conducted 18 clinical cardiology research projects in 1995. Research conducted today could save your life or the life of a loved one tomorrow.
<p>
Rehabilitating patients who have heart conditions is an important step in the healing process. Virginia Mason's Cardiac Rehabilitation Center provides patients with supervised exercise, heart monitoring, and education about lifestyle and dietary changes. Our rehabilitation center is a vital resource for patients. Your gift will help provide additional heart monitors, exercise bikes, and treadmills for these patients.
<p>
With an increasing number of patients coming to Virginia Mason for treatment of heart-related illnesses, Virginia Mason relies on philanthropy to help us provide life-saving, efficient procedures for the people of the Northwest.

Virginia Mason Foundation embarked on a long-term program to find support to replace this equipment with a new multi-place hyperbaric chamber, which will increase our capacity by up to 400% and allow us to treat emergency cases (2/3 of our current caseload) without interrupting regularly scheduled patients.  In 1995, donors contributed more than $150,000 towards this fund.

<font size=4>Hyperbaric Program -- Facts</font>
</center>
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2">WHY IS VIRGINIA MASON'S PROGRAM SPECIAL?</font>  VM's Hyperbaric Department, directed by Dr. Neil B. Hampson, has been in existence for over 27 years.  It is the only 24-hour, critical care, multi-person, non-private, patient-care based center in a five-state area.  In addition to patient care, VM's doctors also promote disease prevention through public education -- for example, since 1992 when Dr. Hampson published an article in <i>The Journal of American Medical Association</i> (summarized in <i>Reader's Digest</i>) detailing the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning for children riding in the back of pickup trucks, no additional victims have been seen (the caseload had been running at 5 to 6 patients per year).  VM's Hyperbaric Department is also the regional coordinating center for the Divers' Alert Network.
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2">HOW MANY PEOPLE USE VM'S HYPERBARIC PROGRAM EVERY YEAR?</font>  As hyperbaric oxygen therapy has become an increasingly accepted therapy for a core group of 12 illnesses, and as more research is being done to support these treatments, VM's caseload has increased dramatically, from 164 patients treated just 5 years ago, to 273 in the last year (35 of them children, the youngest just 3 months old).  Almost 3,000 people have received hyperbaric treatment at VM since 1969.
<p>
<font size=2 color="#2222c2">WHY DOES VM NEED NEW EQUIPMENT?</font>  The positive results shown by VM's hyperbaric oxygen treatment have led to a rapidly increasing number of referrals, so that the program is operating at full capacity using current equipment (installed in 1969).  VM doctors estimate we could increase capacity by up to 400% by installing up-to-date equipment, which, because of its greater efficiency, would also reduce the cost of medical care for both patients and insurers.  Perhaps the most crucial need for new equipment, however, relates to how many patients we can treat, and on what time schedule.  In 1994 and 1995, more than two-thirds of our cases were emergencies.  Because we currently can treat only one critical care patient at a time, we must interrupt any regularly scheduled patients to accommodate critical care patients or emergencies.

<font size=4 color="#2222c2">A</font>t Virginia Mason Research Center (VMRC), our scientists target disease at its core - - at the molecular and cellular level. Our researchers focus on the human body's immune system to determine genetic patterns, links, and codes in the hope of interrupting the pattern to prevent the onset of disease.

<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">B</font>y focusing on the cellular biology of the human immune system, VMRC has built depth and expertise in diseases of the human immune system, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer.

<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">I</font>n addition to VMRC's core staff of principle investigators, post-doctoral scientists, and pre-doctoral and technical staff members, our scientists work hand-in-hand with their physician colleagues at Virginia Mason Medical Center on almost 100 ongoing research projects focusing on diabetes, heart, arthritis, cancer, ataxia, and other diseases. These clinical trials focus on turning "basic science" breakthroughs into practical applications for patients - - bringing the benefits of medical research from "bench to bedside."

<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">T</font>o expand the impact of this work even further, VMRC scientists collaborate with universities throughout the United States, as well as with local biotechnology companies and medical researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington.


<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">A PROVEN TRACK RECORD</font><br>
<i>HARD WORK, INNOVATION AND RESULTS.</i>

<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">R</font>esearch at Virginia Mason began in the 1920s. For the first three decades, much of that research took the form of clinical reports and statistical analyses. In the early 1950s, a team of distinguished scientists, physicians and leaders founded the Virginia Mason Research Center to focus on basic research. In recent years VMRC researchers have identified genes that contribute to diabetes and arthritis and are working on disease prevention.

<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">Highlights of recent VMRC accomplishments and awards include:</font>

<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">1995</font> The National Institutes of Health and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International name VMRC as one of only eight centers worldwide to receive their Centers of Excellence Award for VMRC's diabetes research program.
<br>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">1994</font> The National Institutes of Health appoint Dr. Gerald Nepom, VMRC's Director, as chairperson of NIH's prestigious Immunological Sciences Review Group.
<br>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">1993</font> The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation gives its Living and Giving Award to Dr. Gerald Nepom in recognition of VMRC's breakthroughs in the genetics of diabetes and Dr. Nepom's leadership of VMRC's internationally-known research program.
<br>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">1992</font> A new inpatient clinical research unit is established at Virginia Mason Medical Center.
<br>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">1991</font> VMRC researchers discover the blueprint that will lead to attempts to "switch off" the gene that makes some people susceptible to diabetes.
<br>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">1989</font> VMRC scientists identify an important genetic marker for the most prevalent form of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
<br>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">1989</font> In 3 major publications, VMRC scientists describe for the first time the use of genetic engineering techniques to manipulate and modify the function of molecules that account for susceptibility in diabetes.

<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">T</font>hese and many other scientific breakthroughs at VMRC have meant a vast improvement in the quality of life for thousands of people. With your help, VMRC will continue to search for the causes and cures of many disabling auto-immune diseases.<p>

<br>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">F</font>or more than 75 years, Virginia Mason Medical Center physicians have consistently introduced leading edge medicine to the Northwest, beginning with the use of insulin to treat diabetes in the early 1920s. Nuclear medicine, mammography, lithotripsy, stereotactic needle breast biopsy, lung volume reduction surgery, open heart surgery, no-scalpel vasectomy, and cochlear implants all came to this region first under the auspices of Virginia Mason. Because we were the first to introduce these innovations -- and because so many new surgical techniques have been developed  -- Virginia Mason constantly strives to maintain the most up-to-date equipment.
<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">V</font>irginia Mason surgeons have consistently been ranked among the country's leaders in the areas   of general surgery, gynecologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthopaedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic and reconstructive surgery, and urology and renal transplants. Our kidney transplant program, for example, is regularly ranked among the top 20 in the US, and our cardiac surgery program has mortality rates significantly below the national average. Virginia Mason has done more kidney transplants than all other Northwest hospitals combined. As a leading referral center for Northwest hospitals, it is crucial that Virginia Mason have state-of-the-art surgical equipment to use for our patients. One of Virginia Mason's highest priorities is to find philanthropic support to assist in the purchase of this vital equipment.

<font size=4 color="#2222c2">Telemedicine at VMMC</font>
</center>
<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">A</font>s a continuation and expansion of VMMC's decades-long practice of taking a leadership role in the delivery of healthcare services throughout the Northwest, VMMC recently established a telemedicine studio clinic at our main campus in Seattle. Integrated with this base site are "studio clinics" located in outlying communities in Alaska and rural Washington. A live, interactive connection between the two sites gives the VMMC consulting physician the ability to examine a patient at the remote location as if the patient were in their office. VMMC's telemedicine program is unique in that it is the only operational studio of its kind in the Pacific Northwest and it uses the quality, integrated specialty services of Virginia Mason. In just the short time this project has been operating, the response from physicians, nurses, and patients who have benefited from these studio clinics has been overwhelming. For example, at a recent nursing oncology forum, one Juneau nurse remarked that for the next forum they would have to reserve their largest conference room -- since so many nurses wanted to attend.
<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">S</font>uccessful pilot telemedicine projects in Sitka, Alaska, and Forks, Washington, led the way for new studios in Juneau, Alaska and in Port Angeles, Washington. Indeed, VMMC's pilot teleradiology program in Sitka was so successful that Sitka Community Hospital was able to recruit an on-site radiologist, predicated on the support provided by the continuance of the VMMC teleradiology link. Just recently a generous Alaska couple made it possible for us to purchase the telemedicine equipment needed to equip appropriately the Sitka and Juneau hospitals (the equipment we had been using there during the pilot projects was on loan).  A recent grant from the U.S. Dept. of Commerce will enable us to provide pain management and rehabilitation services to people in Forks, Washington, as well as in the Makah and Quileute tribal areas.  We are researching the opportunities to establish future studios in Petersburg, Craig, and Wrangell, Alaska, and elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest. With these existing and new studios, we anticipate serving significantly more patients and doctors in the near future.
<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">R</font>emote patients in Sitka, Juneau, and elsewhere have received consultation and direct care from VMMC specialists in Allergy, Cardiology, Dermatology, Neurology, Orthopaedics and Hand Surgery, Pain Management, Psychiatry and Mental Health, Radiology, Rheumatology, and Speech Therapy. Physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers in these areas have participated with VMMC health-care professionals in Tumor Boards, Diabetes Health Forums, Administrative Conferences, Cardiology Conferences, Oncology Nursing Forums, and Continuing Medical Education Forums.
<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">A</font> wide variety of individuals, corporations, and foundations have provided support for the equipment and operating costs of our telemedicine program. Significantly, more than 40% of the individuals who have supported VMMC's telemedicine program have been Alaska donors. Additional support for the program has been provided by the remote sites themselves (which have committed facilities and staff to this project and are paying for local telephone network services), VM donors, and by VMMC physicians, who are not directly reimbursed for telemedicine consultations. VMMC is committed to working with the remote sites to find or provide the additional financial support needed to cover non-billable patient care fees, staff support, network service, and telemedicine equipment, so that this program can continue to serve an increased number of remote patients, nurses, physicians, and other providers.
<p>
<center>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">Conclusion</font>
</center>
<p>
<font size=4 color="#2222c2">V</font>MMC has a deep desire to continue serving the educational and consultative needs of the Northwest's rural and remote medical community and their patients. However, with changes in healthcare financing challenging the Medical Center's ability to support regional outreach programs, VMMC must rely on philanthropic assistance from private donors, corporations, and foundations to develop and maintain these linkages to Alaska healthcare providers and their patients.

<blockquote>
	Virginia Mason Medical Center is a major referral center for the Pacific Northwest including Alaska; consequently, our house staff are exposed to the complex problems of tertiary care medicine.  In addition we provide for the continuing health needs of the Seattle community resulting in a large volume of patients admitted with common medical problems, such as GI bleeding, myocardial infarctions, diabetic ketoacidosis, and acute abdominal surgical emergencies.  The quality of our patient material is a major strength of our training programs.  Our patients represent a wide variety of diseases and come from all socioeconomic backgrounds.  Annually there are 11,902 admissions and 17,292 emergency room visits to the 233 bed Virginia Mason Medical Center.
</blockquote>
<h4>Faculty</h4>
<blockquote>
	The teaching faculty is comprised of physicians from the Virginia Mason Clinic which is contiguous with Virginia Mason Hospital.  The attending staff in all departments work well together permitting an efficient team approach to all patients.  The close relationship developed between house staff and teaching faculty permit expanded house staff responsibility to a degree unusual in most private hospitals.  The 270 Virginia Mason Medical Center physicians, representing all specialties of medicine and surgery, see 372,022 outpatient visits per year.  This wealth of clinical material becomes the teaching service of the Hospital when these patients are hospitalized.  The Clinic staff, most of whom retain academic appointments at the University of Washington, have come from full-time academic positions.  The opportunity to teach house staff is one of the major reasons these physicians have chosen to practice at Virginia Mason Medical Center, and they are deeply committed to providing an outstanding educational experience.  Although every section continues to do research, the primary responsibility of the teaching faculty is patient care, seeing patients daily in offices adjacent to the Hospital or in one of the nine satellite primary care clinics.  This environment provides highly skilled clinicians as teachers and, in addition, a unique opportunity for house staff involvement in a large ambulatory practice.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	The combined collegial efforts of teaching and attending staffs at Virginia Mason Medical Center provide outstanding medical care, evidence of which was provided in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Virginia Mason Medical Center was among the 100 hospitals (out of 3100 studied) with the lowest 30 day risk-adjusted mortality rates.   In fact, it was one of only 35 hospitals with "exceptionally low mortality rates" in both 1986 and 1987.  The prototype hospital for low mortality rates observed by Hartz et al* accurately describes Virginia Mason Hospital, i.e. a private, not-for-profit, teaching hospital with a high percentage of board-certified specialists, a high occupancy rate, technological sophistication, and a greater percentage of nurses who are R.N.s.
</blockquote>
<h4>Support</h4>
<blockquote> 
	Virginia Mason Medical Center has superb state of the art diagnostic laboratory radiology and pathology departments, which provide 24-hour coverage for emergency studies.  The expedient service furnished by these departments provide an excellent learning environment for the house staff.  Therapeutic interventions available include cardiac catheterization with PTCA, cardiothoracic surgery, hemodialysis, renal and pancreatic transplantation and renal lithotripsy.
<p>
	The library subscribes to more than 400 medical journals, employing two full-time librarians devoted to assisting the staff in reference searches.  The library has Medline access and has developed a close working relationship with the University of Washington Medical Library.
<p>
	The Virginia Mason Medical Center campus includes the Virginia Mason Research Center.  A staff of over 50 people, including 10 M.D.s and Ph.D.s, is actively engaged in clinical and basic research ranging from immunology to hyperbaric medicine.
</blockquote>
<h4>House Staff</h4>
<blockquote>
	The first graduate year program at Virginia Mason Hospital draws top applicants from many medical schools across the country.  Applicants who match at Virginia Mason Hospital rank in the upper one-third of their classes, many having attained high academic honors. The Transitional Year Program at Virginia Mason Medical Center fulfills the recommended year of basic clinical training.  It is designed to provide a year of broadly based clinical experience for first-year medical school graduates.  The cooperative relationship between the departments of Medicine, Surgery, Radiology and Anesthesia at Virginia Mason Medical and the Children's Hospital and Medical Center allows us to provide a top quality multi-disciplinary Transitional Year Program.

<h1>What is a vasectomy?</h1>
	A vasectomy is a surgical procedure that makes a man 
permanently sterile. Virginia Mason urologists are skilled 
in the "no-scalpel vasectomy" procedure, which can be completed 
in about 15 minutes during an office visit. Virginia Mason is a 
leader worldwide in this outpatient surgery.

<h1>Will a vasectomy affect a man's masculinity?</h1>
	Absolutely not. The operation has no effect on the amount of 
sperm produced, the sex drive, the ability to have an 
erection, the amount of semen ejaculated during sex or other male sex 
characteristics. The only effect is that sperm is stopped from 
being ejaculated. 
<p>
In fact, most men find the quality of their sex life is the same or better because they no longer have to worry about pregnancy during sex.

<h1>Who should have a vasectomy?</h2>
	Men who want to enjoy sex without worrying about pregnancy. 
You should be sure you don't want any more children before 
having a vasectomy. 
<p>
If you are considering a vasectomy, it's 
vital to thoroughly understand that this surgery is 
permanent. (Under certain circumstances, a vasectomy can be surgically 
reversed, but the success of this is not 100 percent 
reliable). Before making the decision, you should discuss it with your 
partner to be certain she won't want children in the future.
<p> 
Proceed with the surgery only when you're confident that it 
is a life-long decision that you will be happy with. Before 
surgery you'll be asked to sign a consent form stating that 
you are aware of the permanence of this surgery.

<h1>How does a vasectomy work?</h1>
	As you know, millions of sperm cells are produced in the 
testicles. These sperm then flow to the prostate gland 
behind the penis where they combine with semen, the sticky fluid 
that is ejaculated from the penis during an orgasm. The drawing 
shows how the sperm travel from each testicle by way of a 
tube known as the vas deferens. 
<p>
After a no-scalpel vasectomy, the testicles continue to produce sperm, but the route by which they travel to the penis has been blocked. The sperm are 
simply absorbed by the body.

<h1>What happens during a vasectomy?</h1>
	First, the scrotal area is cleaned and shaved. (You can do 
this at home yourself, if you prefer.) The diagram shows the 
area that needs to be free of hair. 
<p>
Then, the doctor will inject a local anesthetic. When the area is numb, the doctor makes a small puncture in the scrotal skin, then draws out 
and blocks (cauterizes) the tubes, one at a time.
<p>
During the procedure, there is no knife, no incision and no 
stitches. A simple gauze bandage is placed loosely over the 
site. 
<p>
The puncture, virtually invisible after the procedure, 
heals by itself. You'll experience less pain, fewer 
complications and quicker healing than with a conventional 
vasectomy.

<h1>And following the surgery  . . .?</h1>
	Although the vasectomy takes only a few minutes, you may 
still feel more comfortable having someone else drive you 
home.
<p>
	Lie down for the evening when you get home. This helps 
reduce the swelling. When needed for discomfort, you can take 
aspirin, acetaminophen such as Tylenol, or ibuprofen such as 
Advil or Nuprin.
<p>
	Apply an ice pack to the area for 10 minutes at a time that 
evening.
<p>
	The first few days following the procedure, you should wear 
an athletic supporter or snug-fitting jockey shorts to help 
support your scrotum.
<p>
	For the week following the vasectomy, don't lift items 
 heavier than 15 pounds--and avoid strenuous exercise or 
activity.

<h1>What signs should I be aware of?</h1>
	There may be some swelling and bruising in the genital area. 
The is part of the normal healing process. Some aching in 
the testicles can occur for three to twelve weeks. This is due 
to pressure from the trapped sperm and usually resolves itself 
automatically.
<p>
	If you have any questions following the surgery, we invite 
you to call. We also ask you to call if you have a fever or 
severe pain or swelling that is getting worse rather than 
better. This can be a sign of infection or internal 
bleeding.

<h1>Can I immediately stop using birth control?</h1>
	No. Sperm can remain in the upper part of the vas deferens 
and may still be ejaculated for a period of time after the 
surgery. That's why you absolutely must continue to use 
birth control methods until tests conclusively show that your 
sperm count drops to zero.

	Eight weeks and 20 to 25 ejaculations after your vasectomy, 
a sperm count will be obtained from your semen sample. When 
there is no evidence of sperm in two samples, you are sterile and can stop using birth control. If there is still evidence of sperm in your first specimen, you will be asked to wait a month and bring in another sample for analysis.

<h1>Are there risks involved in having a vasectomy?</h1>
	As with any procedure, there can be some risks. However, 
vasectomy is commonly performed without serious side 
effects. Very rarely complications occur, such as bleeding or 
infection. Up to one percent of patients may develop testis pain, which 
usually resolves on its own.
<p>
	A painful lump may develop at the site where the vas 
deferens are blocked--this is called a sperm granuloma. The lump 
normally resolves itself, but occasionally requires 
antibiotics or surgery.
<p>
	There are no proven long-term health risks from vasectomy. 
Heart disease, prostate cancer and other diseases have been 
looked at, but no conclusive link with vasectomy has been 
found.
<p>
	Sometimes the tubes try to grow back together again. The 
tubes, however, rarely reconnect. (The odds of this 
happening are about one in 1,000.) If the tubes were to reconnect, it 
would usually be discovered on your semen analysis, and your 
doctor would repeat the procedure without charge.

For more than 30 years, Virginia Mason has been a leader in 
the definitive treatment of localized (Stages A-2, B and C) 
prostate cancer with surgery, radiation therapy, or 
combinations of both. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the overall 
survival up to 10 years in patients treated in 1980 and up 
to five years following treatment in 1990. These illustrate the 
importance of early detection.

<strong>Before a man decides to have a <a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a> reversal</strong>, a 
<a href="glossary.html">gynecologist</a> should examine his partner to make certain that 
his partner's fertility is normal.
<p>
In 80 percent to 90 percent of patients who have a <a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a> 
reversal, male reproductive cells (sperm) return to the 
<a href="glossary.html">semen</a>. The patient's partner becomes pregnant in 55 percent to 65 
percent of these cases.
<p>
Reversals performed within seven to eight years after the 
<a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a> have the highest success rate. Many males, 
however, 15 to 20 years after reversal are able to impregnate their 
partners.
<p>
The success of this procedure is based on several factors, 
such as findings at surgery (presence of <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a>), the 
microscopic equipment and instruments used, and the 
surgeon's skill and experience.

<h3><strong><a href="glossary.html">Vasectomy</a>: Interrupting the <a href="glossary.html">Vas</a></strong></h3>
	The <a href="glossary.html">vas</a> is a 14-inch muscular tube that propels the <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a> 
into the <a href="glossary.html">ejaculatory duct</a> in the penis. After a <a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a> the <a href="glossary.html">testes</a> still produces <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a>, but due to the blockage, or 
interruption, in the <a href="glossary.html">vas</a>, the <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a> die and are reabsorbed.
<p>
	The part of the <a href="glossary.html">vas</a> coming directly out of the <a href="glossary.html">epididymis</a> is 
thin and tightly coiled. Farther on, the <a href="glossary.html">vas</a> becomes thicker and eventually straightens. Surgery on the thick, straight 
portion of the <a href="glossary.html">vas</a> is easier than on the thin, coiled part. Surgery on the <a href="glossary.html">epididymis</a> is the most difficult.
<p>
	The <a href="glossary.html">epididymis</a> is one continuous, tightly coiled 15- to 18-foot tube. Any disease in any part of this tube may block 
the <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a>, keeping them from traveling along the reproductive track.

<h3><strong><A Href="Glossary.Html">Vasectomy</A> Reversal</strong></h3>
	This procedure, first popular in the 1980s, utilizes a 
microscope, which magnifies the delicate structures up to 40 
times their actual size. While viewing through the 
microscope, the surgeon cuts away the scarred ends of the <a href="glossary.html">vas</a> (resulting 
from the previous <a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a>). Fluid from the lower 
testicular end is then examined for the presence of <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a>. If <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a> are 
present in the <a href="glossary.html">vas</a> fluid, the surgeon realigns the freshened 
ends of the <a href="glossary.html">vas</a> and reconnects them with stitches finer than 
human hair. The most successful reverse <a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a> procedure 
is a two-layer technique shown in FIGURE 2.
<p>

</pre>
<h3><strong><a href="glossary.html">Bypass Procedure</a></strong></h3>
If <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a> are not present, the surgeon must decide whether to 
perform a reverse <a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a> or a <a href="glossary.html">bypass procedure 
(vasoepididymostomy)</a>. The longer it has been since the 
original <a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a>, the greater the back-pressure behind the point at 
which the <a href="glossary.html">vas</a> was interrupted (due to the blockage in the 
vas). This back-pressure may cause a "blowout" of the duct system 
at its weakest point, which is in the epididymal tube. If this 
single continuous tube breaks at any point, it becomes 
blocked at that point. In such a case, a reverse <a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a> would 
fail, because the <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a> would be blocked in the <a href="glossary.html">epididymis</a>. By 
using the <a href="glossary.html">bypass procedure</a>, the surgeon connects the <a href="glossary.html">vas</a> to the 
single epididymal tube. The success rate of this procedure 
has improved remarkably during the last several years with the 
use of the end-to-side technique show in FIGURE 3.

</pre>
<h3><strong>Why a Reverse <A Href="Glossary.Html">Vasectomy</A> May Fail</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 30 percent of men who have had vasectomies 
develop a reaction against their own <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a> (<a href="glossary.html">sperm 
antibodies</a>). High levels of these antibodies may completely impair the 
patient's fertility or delay the onset of his partner's 
pregnancy. Treatment options include steroids, such as 
prednison, intra-uterine <a href="glossary.html">insemination</a>, or <a href="glossary.html">in vitro 
fertilization</a> (test tube baby).</li>
<li>Occasionally, scar tissue develops at the site where the 
<a href="glossary.html">vas</a> is reconnected, causing a blockage. This is rare and can 
usually be corrected with repeat surgery.</li>
<li>If a blowout has occurred and is not found, the reverse 
<a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a> will fail. A <a href="glossary.html">bypass procedure</a> would need to be 
performed.</li>
<li>In certain patients, when the <a href="glossary.html">vas</a> has been blocked for a 
long time, the <a href="glossary.html">epididymis</a> is adversely affected. In these 
individuals, <a href="glossary.html">sperm count</a>s may be normal, but <a href="glossary.html">sperm</a> movement 
may be poor. Over time, most patients gradually recover from 
this epididymal dysfunction.</li>

<h3><strong>Recovery</strong></h3>
	After surgery the patient will recover at home in bed for 24 
hours. A small amount of swelling in the <a href="glossary.html">scrotum</a> (sac below 
the penis), discomfort and bruising are normal. Infrequently, 
bleeding or infection may occur. The patient should remain 
home for two to three days and should be able to return to work 
on the third or fourth day. While sexual function remains 
normal, intercourse should be restricted for three weeks after 
surgery to promote healing. Also, the patient should avoid heavy 
physical activity at work or during sports for three weeks.
<p>
<h3><strong>Follow-Up</strong></h3>
	Initial <a href="glossary.html">semen</a> testing is obtained by masturbation six weeks 
after surgery and again three months after surgery. Patients 
should abstain from <a href="glossary.html">ejaculation</a> for three days prior to 
<a href="glossary.html">semen</a> testing.
<p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
	Because surgeons have a better understanding of the changes 
that occur in the <a href="glossary.html">testes</a> following a <a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a>, they have 
been able to increase the success rates of <a href="glossary.html">vasectomy</a> reversals. 
In addition, advances in equipment (microscope, instrument and 
stitches) have improved the technical success of this 
procedure.

<strong>Efferent Duct</strong><br>
Several tubes that connect the testes to the first part of the epididymis.
<p>
<strong>Ejaculation</strong><br>
The expultion of semen from the urethra at the time of male climax.
<p>
<strong>Ejaculatory Duct</strong><br>
A duct formed by the joining of the seminal vesicle with the vas defernes.
<p>

A tightly coiled system of tiny tubing where sperm collect after leaving the testicle.  The epididymis covers the top and back side of the testicle.
<p>
<strong>Gynecologist</strong><br>
A medical doctor who specializes in disorders of the female reproductive tract.
<p>
<strong>Insemination</strong><br>
A technique used to artificially place sperm in either the female vagina at the opening of the cervix or the uterus itself (intra-uterine insemination).
<p>
<strong>In Vitro Fertilization</strong><br>
Assisted reproduction that involves surgically removing an egg from the woman's ovary and combining it with sperm in a laboratory dish.  If the egg is fertilized, the resulting embryo is transferred to the woman's uterus.
<p>
<strong>Microsurgery</strong><br>
Surgery performed while viewing through a microscope and using very delicate instruments.
<p>
<strong>Scrotum</strong><br>
A sac that lies below the penis containing the two oval sex glands in the male.

<p>
<strong>Semen Analysis</strong><br>
The examination of a semen sample for volume, count, motility and morphology.
<p>
<strong>Sperm</strong><br>
The male reproductive cell that fertilizes a woman's egg. The sperm head carries chromosomes; the mid-piece produces energy for movement; the long tail wiggles to propel the sperm.
<p>

<p>
<strong>Urethra</strong><br>
The tube leading from the bladder and carrying both urine and semen to the end of the penis.
<p>
<strong>Vas (Vas Deferens)</strong><br>
The muscular tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.
<p>
<strong>Vasectomy</strong><br>
Procedure in which the vas deferens is interrupted.  Usually a small portion of the vas is removed, and the ends are either cauterized or tied.
<p>
<strong>Vasoepididymostomy (Bypass Procedure)</strong><br>

<TD>The Arthritis Clinical Research Unit is concentrating on the above
three rheumatic diseases with one of this unit's goal being to &quot;bring
the bench to the bedside&quot;. In the larger context of clinical pharmacology
and pharmacokinetics, the Arthritis Clinical Research Unit (ACRU) seeks:</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" >
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><FONT SIZE=+1>1. </FONT></TD>

<TD>To rationalize the therapy of rheumatic diseases, using the tools of
clinical pharmacology. At present rheumatic disease therapy relies principally
on an empiric base; with a better understanding of the pharmacology of
drugs used in the rheumatic diseases, it is hoped that more rational approaches
to rheumatic disease therapy will be possible. In this context the pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics of therapy and disease, respectively, are being investigated.
Further, examining the interface between these two areas should make prediction
of therapeutic success and minimization of toxicity more likely.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><FONT SIZE=+1>2.</FONT></TD>

<TD>To use medications such as genetically engineered proteins and xenobiotics
as probes of disease pathogenesis. With therapies whose mechanism of action
is quite specific (e.g., block IL-2 receptors, or prevent TNF action),
one can test specific mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><FONT SIZE=+1>3.</FONT></TD>

<TD>To improve methods to measure change and compare relative efficacy/toxicity.
Without improved methodology, discerning the efficacy of a therapeutic
intervention becomes very difficult. The ACRU seeks to examine and improve
the methods to measure activity or change in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
sclerosis and osteoarthritis.</TD>

<h2>The Research Center at Virginia Mason</h2>
World-class medical research focused on diagnosing,<BR>
treating, and curing auto-immune diseases.
<P>

<b>AN INVITATION TO BE A PARTNER IN THE CREATION<BR>
OF LIFE-SAVING KNOWLEDGE.</b>
</CENTER>
<p>
<blockquote>
<B>S</B>upporting medical research is one of the most rewarding of all philanthropic
activities. As your gift leads to breakthroughs in understanding the
fundamental nature of a disease, you will literally have helped add new
knowledge to the medical community.
<p>
This knowledge can lead to earlier diagnosis, more effective treatment, and
ultimately <em>a cure for a disease.</em> When this occurs, countless generations of
people will benefit from an advancement you helped make possible.
<p>
We invite you to join our research efforts at the Virginia Mason Research
Center and discover how rewarding it can be to help save lives.
<p>
<CENTER>
<b>RESPECTED INTERNATIONALLY AMONG ITS PEERS,<BR>
THE VIRGINIA MASON RESEARCH CENTER<BR>
IS COMPRISED OF A WORLD-CLASS TEAM.</b>
</CENTER>
<p>
<B>A</B>t Virginia Mason Research Center (VMRC), our scientists target disease at its
core -- at the molecular and cellular level. Our researchers focus on the human
body's immune system to determine genetic patterns, links, and codes in the
hope of interrupting the pattern to prevent the onset of disease.
<p>
By focusing on the cellular biology of the human immune system, VMRC has built
depth and expertise in diseases of the human immune system, such as diabetes,
rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and cancer.
<p>
In addition to VMRC's core staff of principle investigators, post-doctoral
scientists, and pre-doctoral and technical staff members, our scientists work
hand-in-hand with their physician colleagues at Virginia Mason Medical Center
on almost 100 ongoing research projects focusing on diabetes, heart, arthritis,
cancer, ataxia, lupus, and other diseases. These clinical trials focus on
turning "basic scientce" breakthroughs into practical applications for patients
-- bringing the benefits of medical research from "bench to bedside."
<p>

<b>A PROVEN TRACK RECORD:<BR>
<em>HARD WORK, INNOVATION AND RESULTS.</em></b>
</CENTER>
<p>
<B>R</B>esearch at Virginia Mason began in the 1920s. For the first three decades,
much of that research took the form of clinical reports and statistical
analyses. In the early 1950s, a team of distinguised scientists, physicians and
leaders founded the Virginia Mason Research Center for focus on basic research.
In recent years VMRC researchers have identified genes that contribute to
diabetes and arthritis and are working on disease prevention. 
<p>
<b><em>Highlights of recent VMRC accomplishments and awards include:</em></b>
<p>
<b><em>1995</em></b>  The National Institutes of Health and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation
International name VMRC as one of only eight centers worldwide to receive their
Centers of Excellence Award for VMRC's diabetes research program.
<p>
<b><em>1994</em></b>  The National Institutes of Health appoint Dr. Gerald Nepom, VMRC's
Director, as chairperson of NIH's prestigious Immunological Sciences Review
Group.
<p>
<b><em>1993</em></b>  The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation gives its Living and Giving Award to Dr.
Gerald Nepom in recognition of VMRC's breakthoughs in the genetics of diabetes
and Dr. Nepom's leadership of VMRC's internationally-known research program.
<p>
<b><em>1992</em></b>  A new inpatient clinical research unit is established at Virginia Mason
Medical Center.
<p>
<b><em>1991</em></b>  VMRC researchers discover the blueprint that will lead to attempts to
"switch off" the gene that makes some people susceptible to diabetes.
<p>
<b><em>1989</em></b>  VMRC scientists identify an important genetic marker for the most
prevalent form of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
<p>
<b><em>1989</em></b>  In 3 major publications, VMRC scientists describe for the first time the
use of genetic engineering techniques to manipulate and modify the function of
molecules that account for susceptibility in diabetes.
<p>
These and many other scientific breakthoughs at VMRC have meant a vast
improvement in the quality of life for thousands of people. With your help,
VMRC will continue to search for the causes and cures of mahy disabling
auto-immune diseases.

Although we know that HLA genes are implicated in 
many autoimmune diseases, we do not yet understand 
the molecular mechanisms responsible 
for such genetic associations.  Nor do we understand 
how to use this information to design better 
diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics for clinical 
applications.  In my laboratory, we use a combined 
structural, genetic, and functional approach to study 
the interaction between MHC molecules, peptides, 
and T cell recognition, focused on the HLA molecules 
associated with autoimmune disease.  We would like 
to understand what are the unique features which lead 
to the expression and function of these molecules 
contributing to autoimmunity, and gain some practical 
insight into opportunities to modulate or block the 
specific molecular pathways in disease pathogenesis.

<b>HLA and disease.</b><br>
Vivian Gersuk, Sharon Kochik, Susan Masewicz, 
Helena Reijonen, Niecey Meldrum<p>

Identification of specific HLA genes associated with autoimmune diseases 
such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis leads to a series of hypotheses 
and predictions about disease mechanisms and clinical course.  We are 
investigating the use of HLA genetics as predictive markers of disease 
progression and prediction, and using HLA genetics to stratify patients 
for further studies of disease mechanisms and response to therapy.  We are 
developing rapid DNA diagnostics for routine clinical use to help improve 
differential diagnosis, prognosis, and selection of therapy.<P>

<b>Transcriptional regulation of class II genes.</b><br>
Jon Beaty, Linda Shewey, Teresa Sukiennicki<p>

HLA genes are polymorphic.  That is, they exist in multiple allelic forms 
in the population.  We investigate the structural and functional 
consequences of polymorphisms in the coding region (see below), but we 
also have discovered and are investigating DNA polymorphisms in the 
promoter and regulatory regions of these genes.  Regulatory region 
polymorphisms modify specific DNA protein interactions which modulate 
transcriptional levels.  Thus, the unique ways in which specific HLA genes 
are transcriptionally regulated may provide important clues to understand 
gene inducibility, tissue specificity, and expression in immune-mediated 
and autoimmune diseases.  A multidisciplinary approach is used for these 
investigations, including analysis of DNA-protein binding interactions, 
reporter gene transcriptional assays, measurements of endogenous gene 
expression, and analysis of functional consequences of disregulated gene 
transcription.<P>

<b>The MHC peptide complex as a flexible structural unit for T cell 
recognition.</b><br>
Jane Buckner, Mary Ellen Domeier, Ben Falk<P>

The principal known function of HLA class II molecules is to bind and 
present peptides for T cell recognition.  This is accomplished by specific 
molecular interactions within a binding pocket on the HLA class II 
molecule which recognizes specific amino acid side chains on peptides 
generated during antigen processing.  The unique genetic polymorphisms 
which characterize disease associated class II molecules create a set of 
distinct motifs for binding to some but not all possible peptides.  We are 
characterizing the structural rules which control this interaction and 
using it to predict and analyze the nature of the HLA-peptide complex in 
autoimmune diseases.<P>

Research in Dr. Concannon's laboratory focuses on the 
genetics of several different human disorders. These include ataxia
telangiectasia (AT), a rare cancer susceptibility/radiation sensitivity 
disorder, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
(IDDM), an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-secreting islet cells
of the pancreas are destroyed, and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
(NIDDM), a metabolic disorder in which the ability to secrete in the pancreas
and the ability to respond to insulin in peripheral tissues are both 
disrupted. Additional, non-disease related projects in the laboratory focus
on the structure and function of human T cell receptors for antigen.

Studies in my laboratory address questions aimed at understanding how 
the human B cell repertoire is generated and selected, with the intent 
of asking how variation in the B cell compartment contributes to 
disease resistance or susceptibility. Recent observations made in 
the laboratory are that 1) the number of heavy chain variable region 
(VH) genes contributing to the adult repertoire is smaller than generally 
thought, and the VH3 and VH4 components of the repertoire are dominated by 
a few elements, 2) the antibody repertoire is limited to a relatively few 
elements as early as the pre-B cell stage of differentiation, 3) bone 
marrow transplant recipients exhibit a markedly reduced level of somatic 
mutation that is consistent with a maturational arrest at a fairly late 
stage of differentiation. Current efforts are addressing questions that 
have arisen during the course of this work and which concern somatic 
diversification of the repertoire.

Research in Dr. Barbara Nepom's laboratory is focused on HLA class II genes
and their contribution to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, 
particularly adult and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Current studies are 
directed towards understanding the structural requirements for antigen
binding to disease-associated polymorphic HLA molecules. Antigens which may
be relevant to the initiation and maintenance of adult and juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis are also under investigation. Other studies include
the transcriptional regulation of HLA-DRB genes, particularly disease-associated
alleles; and investigation of factors allowing "non-professional antigen 
presenting cells", such as breast cancer cells, to become immunologically 
functional.

<b>Triggering antigens in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</b><br>

Laboratory contributors:<br>
Pauciarticular onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is the most common
pediatric rheumatic disease, and accounts for significant morbidity from 
both musculoskeletal and ocular complications. The etiology is unknown. 
Unique and complex HLA associations with this condition include DR8, DR5, 
and DPB2.1. Some evidence of oligoclonal T cell receptor usage is also
emerging. The triggering antigen, however, remains a crucial factor in 
disease pathogenesis about which very little is known. We are utilizing
molecular approaches to begin to identify such antigen(s) in pauciarticular
JRA. Specifically, we are detailing the structural requirements for peptides
which bind well to disease-associated alleles, using molecular modeling and 
experimental peptide binding assays. Using those motifs, we will identify 
potential binding peptides from known sequences of candidate triggering 
antigens and test these directly for binding. As a complementary approach,
we are attempting to identify DR8- and DR5-binding peptides that are 
expressed in JRA synovial samples, using novel molecular expression methods.
Finally, we plan to test these peptides directly for reactivity with patient
synovial T cells. This project tackles a critical gap in our understanding
of this disease, and potentially will provide the basis for novel 
therapeutic or preventive strategies.

Studies in Dr. Kwok's laboratory are focused on two areas: (1) Structural 
polymorphism of the HLA-DQ molecule is implicated in the pathogenesis of 
autoimmune diseases, including IDDM. Binding of diabetogenic peptides to 
highly polymorphic DQ molecules may trigger the initial events that lead 
to the disease. Peptide binding studies are used to identify specific
peptide motifs. The ability of these DQ-peptide complexes to initiate DQ
restricted T cell activation is also investigated. (2) The study of molecular
mechanisms of T cell unresponsiveness includes biological stimuli that lead
to partial T cell responses and biochemical pathways that lead to 
unresponsiveness.

<td><b>The DQ-peptide/TcR complex in DQ associated autoimmune diseases.</b>
<P>

The principle function of class II molecule is to bind and present 
antigenic peptide. Structural polymorphism of the DQ molecule will affect 
peptide binding and thereby influencing the potential immune repertoire.  
Analysis  of the ability of DQ molecules to bind and present antigenic 
peptide should aid in understand the role in immunity and in development 
of HLA-DQ-associated autoimmune disease. In the case of IDDM, it is 
proposed that binding of a diabetogenic peptide to the DQ3.2 molecule 
trigger the initial events that lead to the disease.<P>

However, the nature of this diabetogenic peptide remained unidentified. 
Identification of the DQ3.2 ligand is critical for understanding the 
pathogenesis of IDDM.   Binding assay will be established to examine the 
effect of  DQ polymorphism on peptide binding. Peptide analogs will be 
used to establish the binding motif of  DQ3.2  binding peptides. Peptides 
with the predicted motifs from potential autoantigens will be synthesized. 
The ability of these peptides to function as antigenic peptide will be 
examined. T cells that recognize this DQ/peptide complex will be generated 
and characterized.  Similar approaches can be extended to predicted DQ 
restricted T cell epitopes of other DQ alleles. These studies address an 
important and poorly understood area of immunogenetics and diabetes, 
namely, the specific nature of peptides with are preferentially bound to 
DQ molecules associated with disease. This information is essential for 
the rational design of immunotherapeutic directed at the trimolecular 
complex in IDDM.<P>

<b>Molecular Mechanism for T cell unresponsiveness.</b><P>

T cell receptor engagement with an MHC/peptide complex does not necessary 
lead to induction of IL-2 secretion and T cell proliferation.  A wide 
spectrum of response can be observed. These included  T cell anergy, 
apoptosis or partial T cell activation.  Our focus will be the 
identification of MHC/peptide complex that can induce T cell 
unresponsiveness in human T cells. We proposed that both peptide analogs 
and mutagenized class II molecules can induce T cell unresponsiveness. 
The biochemical pathways that lead to the generation of a negative signal 
which triggers unresponsiveness will also be identified.

<h2>THE A-T SYNDROME</h2>
<img src="graphics/arrow.gif" width="550" height="368" usemap="#arrow">
</center>
<P>


The ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) syndrome varies little from family to family when seen in its late stages.  Its primary features include: 
1) progressive gait and truncal ataxia with onset from 1 to 3 years of age, 
2) progressively slurred speech, 
3) oculomotor apraxia, i.e., an 
inability to follow an object across the visual fields, 
4) oculocutaneous 
telangiectasia, usually by six years of age, 
5) an elevated serum 
alphafetoprotein, 
6) frequent infections, with accompanying serum and 
cellular immunodeficiencies, 
7) cancer susceptibility, usually leukemia 
or lymphoma,  
8) hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, contraindicating the use of conventional doses of radiation therapy for cancer and 
9) reciprocal translocations that involve chromosomes 7 and 14 almost exclusively.  Other features include premature aging and endocrine 
abnormalities.  This figure highlights some of the major features of 
this complex syndrome and its underlying pathogenesis.  The information 
that follows is excerpted from "Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited 
Disease" Seventh Edition.  Eds. CR Scriver, AL Beaudet, WS Sly, and 
D Valle.  McGraw-Hill, publishers.  New York 1996 (also available on CD-ROM).
Readers interested in more detailed information about the syndrome and 
relevant references should consult this source.<P>  

<a name="ataxia">
<h3>Ataxia</h3></a>
The most obvious and troubling characteristic of the A-T syndrome is the 
progressive cerebellar ataxia.  Shortly after learning to walk, A-T 
children begin to stagger  By ten years of age, they are confined to a 
wheelchair for the remainder of their lives.  The ataxia begins as purely 
truncal but within several years involves peripheral coordination as well.  
Deep tendon reflexes are decreased or absent in older patients; plantar 
reflexes are upgoing or absent. Slurred speech and oculomotor apraxia are 
noted early on.  Both horizontal and vertical saccadic eye movements are 
affected.  Writing is affected by 7 or 8 years of age.  Choreoathetosis is 
found in almost all patients.  Myclonic jerking  and  intention tremors 
are present in about 25%.   Drooling is a frequent complaint; this can 
sometimes be helped with medication. All teenage patients need help 
dressing, eating, washing, and toiletting.  The neurological status of 
some patients appears to improve from 2-4 years, then begins to progress 
again; this is probably due to the rapid neurological learning curve of 
young individuals.  Muscle power is normal at first but wanes with disuse, 
especially of the legs.  Arm strength generally remains.  Contractures in 
fingers and toes are common in older patients but may be preventable 
through rigorous exercise. <P>

The typical patient with A-T is of normal intelligence, although slow 
responses make it difficult to support this by timed IQ testing.  Many 
American and British patients have finished high school with good grades; 
some have finished college or university.  A few do seem minimally retarded.<P>

The most obvious lesion in the central nervous system at port-mortem 
examination is the paucity of Purkinje cells (PC) in the cerebellum.  
About ten years ago, we wished to determine whether these cells were 
absent from birth or whether they degenerate thereafter.  Knowing that 
Basket cells only form around preexisting PC, we sought to visualize 
Basket cells by Bielschowsky silver staining.  We showed that normal or 
near-normal numbers of Basket cells were present.  We concluded, 
therefore, that PC numbers must also have been normal at birth and that 
they degenerate after birth. <P> 

PC migration and arborization are not completely normal.  A significant 
number of ectopic PC can be found in cerebellar sections from A-T 
patients, both from undermigration and overmigration.  PC make their last 
cell division at about 13 weeks of gestation and then begin to migrate 
towards the pial surface.  Following the tracts of climbing fibers, they 
arrive at the single cell PC layer during the fifth to seventh months of 
gestation.  Thus, this lesion of ectopic PCs would most likely be 
expressed by the last trimester of pregnancy.  This is the earliest known 
manifestation of the A-T defect.<P>  	

It remains possible that PCs are not the primary A-T lesion and that the 
observed PC defects are due to other factors, such as an absence or 
abnormalities of supporting cells like Basket cells, mossy fibers, 
parallel fibers, climbing fibers or glial cells.  Anteriograde or 
retrograde degeneration of PCs would then occur, with the underlying 
lesion being either afferent or efferent to the PCs.  We have recently 
been able to demonstrate the presence of ATM message in PCs, as well as in 
cells of the internal and external granular layers, and in neurons of the 
dentate nucleus.  We see ATM mRNA in both healthy and affected tissues.  
Even mRNAs containing serious ATM mutations are apparently stable in A-T 
cells.  Thus, the primary site of action for the ATM protein in the 
cerebellum remains undetermined at this writing.<P>  

Changes have also been noted in the dentate and olivary nuclei. 	
The medulla shows neuroaxonal dystrophy.  Degenerative changes are seen in 
the substantia nigra.  Diffuse demyelination in the posterior columns of 
the spinal cord was noted in some of the original autopsies and is a 
progressive change.  For further details of post-mortem changes in A-T 
patients, the two lengthy reviews authored by Segdwick and Boder in the 
Handbook of Neurology should be consulted.<P>

Throughout the tissues of the body of A-T patients, nucleomegaly is a 
universal finding.  This is best seen in organs where nuclear morphology 
is usually very regular, such as in the hepatic cords or renal tubules.  
Here, it is obvious that the size of the nucleus is extremely variable in 
A-T tissues, as compared to normal.  Some nuclei are very large, 
hyperchromatic (dark-staining) and irregular in shape.  Nucleomegaly  is 
also seen in association with aging and in viral lesions.  However, 
numerous studies have failed to demonstrate virus or viral particles, 
including an attempt by Gadjusek to inoculate primates with brain tissue 
extracts from two A-T patients.  It is entirely possible that the 
nucleomegaly seen in A-T tissues results from defective cell cycle 
checkpoints leading to mitotic division without cell replication in 
random cells.  Naeim et al  have demonstrated polyploidy (4N and 8N) in 
lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from A-T patients by flow cytometric 
cell-cycle analysis.<P>  
	

<h3>Telangiectasia</h3>

Telangiectasia are composed of dilated small blood vessels that can be 
observed over the ocular conjunctiva, the bridge of the nose, the pinnae 
of the ears, or sometimes even behind the knees or in the ancubital 
fossae.  Telangiectasiae do not usually appear until 4-6 years of age, 
well after the onset of ataxia in most cases.  In a few families, 
telangiectasia is not apparent even in older patients with all of the 
other characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease.<P> 

<a name="pulmon">
<h3>Pulmonary Infections</h3></a>

At post-mortem examination, virtually every A-T homozygote has a small 
embryonic-like thymus.  In the late 1960s and again in the early 1980s, 
many attempts were made to characterize the immunodeficiencies of A-T 
patients.  No single consistent abnormality could be identified in all A-T 
patients affected sibs often differ in the degree and profile of their 
immunodeficiencies.  In a recent review of British patients, Woods and 
Taylor noted normal immunological function in 27 of 70 patients.  
Only 10% had severe immunodeficiencies.<P>  

When the genomic arrangement of the IGH V, D, J and H gene subfamilies was 
first described, we noted that the immunoglobulin (Ig) classes that were 
most frequently decreased in A-T patients were those with the greatest 
distances between the variable genes and the respective heavy chain genes; 
roughly 60-80 percent of A-T homozygotes manifest an IgA, IgE and/or IgG2 
deficiency, whereas serum levels of IgM, IgG1 and IgG3 are usually normal.  
This suggests that B cells from these patients have a maturational problem 
with Ig class switching, perhaps based on a recombinase deficiency.  On a 
similar note, an increased proportion of T gamma/delta cells noted in one 
early study suggested a maturational delay in T cells; however, this was 
before normal T gamma/delta cell ranges had been clearly defined and has 
not been generally confirmed.  IgM levels are occasionally extremely high; 
this could be based on a similar defective maturational mechanism that 
arrests some B cells at the IgM-producing stage.  On the other hand, when 
V(D)J recombination was examined in A-T cells, both signal and coding joint 
formation were normal.<P>  

Approximately half of A-T patients with immunodeficiencies have T cell 
deficiencies.  CD4+/CD45RA+ (naive) T cells are decreased in some patients.
Responses to antigens are poor, especially allogeneic antigens.  T cell 
cytotoxicity to influenza-infected target cells is reduced.  T lymphocytes 
show abnormally fast capping of FITC-labelled Concanavalin A.  Markedly 
elevated cyclic AMP levels have been observed in T cells from A-T patients.
Neutrophil chemotaxis was reported to be decreased in some studies and 
normal in others.  Similarly, NK cell activity and NK cell levels have 
been described as normal, decreased, or increased in various studies.  
Some of these discrepancies no doubt reflect the transient immune status 
of patients with active infections.   Although 91% of Costa Rican A-T 
patients had diminished PHA responses, recall that 65% of this patient 
cohort have the same mutation; thus, this sample would be skewed against 
some features and in favor of others and these might have little bearing 
on patients around the world with other mutations.  Further analyses of 
this cohort are underway.<P>

<a name="chrom">
<h3>Chromosomal changes</h3></a>

A-T homozygotes show non-random chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes, 
such as translocations and inversions, which preferentially involve 
chromosomal breakpoints at 14q11, 14q32, 7q35, 7p14, 2p11 and 22q11.  
These appeared to correlate generally with the regions of the T cell 
receptor (TCR alpha, beta, and gamma) and B cell receptor (IGH, IGK and IGL)
gene complexes.  Since these six sites contain the only gene complexes in 
the genome that are known to require site specific gene 
rearrangement/recombination prior to expressing a mature protein, it was 
logical to examine V(D)J recombination mechanisms in A-T cells.  As noted 
above, signal and coding joint formation are both normal.  When we 
examined the chromosomes of fibroblasts from eight A-T homozygotes, all 
with typical 7:14 translocations in their lymphocytes, the fibroblast 
aberrations were totally random.  In addition, Hecht studied almost 50,000 
amniotic fluid cell metaphases; of 37 translocations in that sample, none 
involved chromosomes 7 and 14.  This is intriguing when one also considers 
that fibroblasts and amniotic cells do express the radiosensitivity defect.
Heterozygotes show t(7;14) translocations in lymphocytes but only in 1-2% 
of metaphases.<P>

In some patients, cell clones with the above breakpoints expand, sometimes 
accounting for 100% of the lymphocytes that are karyotyped.  Despite this, 
lymphocyte counts remain within normal range for years thereafter.  
Some of these clones have been followed for 10 to 20 years, by us and by 
others.  These clones tend to progress, with subclones adding new 
rearrangements, such as: inv(14;14)(q11;q32), i(8q), and 6q-, in addition 
to many other smaller clones.  Eventually, such patients develop T cell 
prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), previously referred to as T-CLL (T cell 
chronic lymphoblastic leukemia).  Affected sibs are usually not concordant 
for developing such clones.<P>

These clonal expansions have recently allowed the breakpoint sites to be 
analyzed by molecular techniques.  Three types of patients have been 
studied:  1) A-T patients with non-leukemic clones, 2) A-T patients with 
leukemic clones, and 3) non-AT patients with similar cytogenetic 
translocations and T-PLL.  Thanks to many years of perseverance by Taylor 
and coworkers in trying to pinpoint the breakpoints of these 
translocations or inversions, a fascinating story is now emerging that is 
quite similar to that of myc in Burkitt lymphoma.  The A-T expanded clones 
always involve one of the TCR sites, usually TCR-alpha, being juxtaposed 
to another family of genes that are located proximal, but not actually 
within, the B cell receptor gene complexes.  The most common and best 
studied translocations are those involving 14q11 (TCR-alpha) and a 
breakpoint cluster region ~10 Mb proximal to the IGH locus at 14q32.  
Within ~400 kb, at least eight such breakpoints have been identified in 
A-T patients with and without leukemia, and in several non-AT patients 
with T-PLL.  This region centers around the TCL-1 (T cell leukemia-1) 
gene, the 1.3 kb transcript of which is preferentially expressed in 
immature (and leukemic) B and T cells.  Circulating mature lymphocytes do 
not express this gene.  Leukemia cells without the t(14;14 or inv(14;14) 
do not express TCL-1.<P>

An occasional A-T patient has a large t(X;14)(q28;q11) clone, including at 
least two who have developed T-CLL/T-PLL, and one without leukemia when 
last studied.  The breakpoints at Xq28 cluster to within a few kilobases, 
in a region of ~70 kb proximal to the Factor VIII gene.  This region 
contains the genes c6.1A and c6.1B.   The latter gene is believed to be 
the crucial one in these translocations since two of the breakpoints fall 
within the first exon of c6.1B (also know as MTCP1 for "mature T cell 
proliferation-1").  Most interesting, c6.1B has homology with TCL-1 (40% 
identity; 60% similarity) and is a mitochondrial protein .  TCL-1 and 
MTCP-1 also share three-dimensional structure.  TCL-1 prevents apoptosis 
and is p53 independent.  Since TCR/TCL-1 translocations do not by 
themselves cause leukemia, another factor must interact with the protein 
product(s) resulting from the translocations.  This factor could very well 
be the ATM gene product.  If this proves true, it would suggest that 
non-AT patients with T-PLL may also be A-T heterozygotes in whom the 
normal ATM gene has been disabled or deleted, as in a "two-hit model".<P>
	
Constitutional cytogenetic defects involving translocations or deletions 
at 11q22-23 have not been observed in A-T homozygotes, even though 
karyotypes of >500 patients have been examined worldwide.  Many 
cytogenetic reports on children with suspected A-T return: "insufficient 
metaphases for analysis".   This is because the lymphocyte response to 
mitogens, such as phytohemagglutinin (PHA), is often weak or very slow in 
A-T patients, and when cell cultures are harvested routinely at 48 hours, 
few cells are dividing.  Harvest results can be improved by using a double 
dose of mitogen and harvesting at 72 hours or at several time points.<P>  

Telomeric fusions are observed frequently in A-T patients.  Tumor cells 
and senescent cells of normal persons can also show such fusions.  Further 
understanding of this observation was limited until, in 1988, the DNA 
structure of the telomere and the mechanisms of its maintenance were 
elucidated.  When the role of telomerase in telomere stability was first 
introduced, it was logical to examine telomerase levels in A-T cells.  
Pandita et al showed that although the telomeres of A-T cell lines are 
shorter than normal cells, telomerase activity was normal.<P>

Metcalfe et al have recently demonstrated significant telomere shortening 
in A-T peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL).  PBL from 20 A-T patients 
showed an average loss of 95 +23 bp/year of age, as compared to a loss of 
35 +9 bp/year in normals.  The preleukemic T cell clones described above 
showed an even greater loss of 158 +9 bp/year, and are especially prone to 
show telomeric fusions.<P>  
	
Accelerated telomeric shortening is probably a characteristic of all 
rapidly-dividing A-T cells.  It is of further interest that telomeric 
shortening is associated with senescence of CD28-/CD8+ T cells in AIDS 
patients and in centenarians; in both situations this may account for a 
waning T cell immunity.  A similar mechanism might explain the abnormal 
development and function of the immune system in A-T patients.  Thus, the 
precocious onset of cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma 
and T-PLL, may reflect: 1) the basic propensity of their cells to 
accelerate telomere shortening, and 2) a waning immunity.  This would also 
provide a p53-independent, radiation-independent pathway, to cancer 
susceptibility in A-T patients.<P>

When the ATM gene was isolated and sequenced, it was noted to have strong 
homology to the yeast tel1 gene, primarily through sharing a region of 
PI-3 kinase homology, and secondarily through sharing weak homology with 
rad3. Rad3 is a  fission yeast gene containing helicase motifs and 
required for G2 arrest after DNA damage.  Of the large family of genes 
sharing PI-3 kinase homology with ATM, only tel1, mec1 (another yeast 
gene) and mei41 (of Drosophila) also share some rad3 homology.  (The rad3 
homology of tel1 is admittedly weak.)  A growing body of evidence suggests 
that tel1, mec1 and ATM perform overlapping functions.  Of the three, only 
mec1 is an essential gene.  In yeast, mec1 (mitosis entry checkpoint) is 
required for regulation of the S/M and G2/M checkpoints, the rate of 
ongoing S phase in response to damage and meiotic recombination.  Cells 
with mutations in mec1 (also called ESR1 or SAD3) proceed directly to 
mitosis when DNA replication is inhibited with hydroxyurea and are unable 
to delay the onset of mitosis (G2/M) on induction of DNA damage.  RAD53 is 
also regulated by MEC1 and TEL1.  Although tel1 mutants not are 
radiosensitive and mec1 mutants are, tel1/mec1 double mutants somehow 
synergize to increase the sensitivity to DNA damage from ionizing 
radiation and radiomimetic drugs. The human homologue of mec1, FRP1 
(FRAP-related protein), has recently been cloned and maps to chromosome 
3q22-q24; it is called ATR (AT-related, rad3-related).  Using antibodies 
to either ATR and ATM, it has been possible to show that these two 
homologous molecules form part of synaptonemal complexes during meiosis 
and bind in a complementary pattern, with ATR binding to non-synapsed 
chromosome pairs and ATM binding to synapsed pairs.<P>   

<a name="cancer">
<h3>Cancer susceptibility</h3></a>

During their shortened lifetimes, 38 percent of A-T homozygotes develop a 
malignancy.  This represents a 61-fold and 184-fold increase in Euro-
American and Afro-American patients, respectively.  Roughly, 85% of these 
malignancies are either leukemia or lymphoma.  In younger patients, an 
acute lymphocytic leukemia is most often of T-cell origin, although the 
pre-B common ALL of childhood (HLADR+, CD10+, CD5+, and CD19+) has also 
been seen in A-T patients.  When leukemia develops in older A-T 
homozyogtes, it is usually an aggressive T cell leukemia with a morphology 
similar to chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, hence the old name of "T-CLL"; 
T cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is the equivalent modern 
nomenclature.  The leukemic cells often contain a translocation and/or 
inversion involving the T cell receptor alpha chain gene complex at 
14q11-12.  Myeloid leukemia has not been reported in A-T patients.  
Lymphomas in A-T homozygotes, in contrast to leukemias, are usually B cell 
types, although T cell lymphomas have also been observed.  As A-T patients 
are living longer, more non-lymphoid cancers are being observed.  Several 
of our older patients have developed breast cancer and melanoma.  Cancers 
of stomach and ovary have been reported.  When fibroids or leiomyomas are 
found in A-T females, a special effort should be made by the pathologist 
to quantitate high power fields for mitotic figures since leiomyosarcomas 
of precocious  onset have been reported.<P>

A-T heterozygotes are also believed to be cancer-prone, perhaps accounting 
for as many as 5% of all cancer patients under 45 years of age in the 
United States.  They are not clinically distinguishable from normal 
individuals.  An increased incidence of breast cancer in female A-T 
heterozygotes has been reported from the United States, England and 
Norway.  In the U.S. study, the risk of breast cancer was found to be 
5-fold higher among the mothers of A-T homozygotes than in a comparable 
female population.  Based on this observation, Swift et al estimated that 
between 8 and 18 percent of all breast cancer patients may be A-T 
heterozygotes.  This would imply that ATM is the most common cancer 
susceptibility gene in the general population.  While the issue is far 
from settled, several recent genetic studies of breast cancer patients 
have failed to produce convincing evidence in support of Swift's 
predictions.  Croce and coworkers looked for ATM mutations in tumor tissue 
from 38 breast cancers.  They first screened this material by single 
stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) gels and then sequenced any 
regions suspected of harboring mutations.  They found no significant 
mutations.  We similarly screened cDNAs from nine breast cancer patients 
who had been radiation technologists, using a combination of protein 
truncation testing (PTT) and conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis 
(CSGE).  We found no significant mutations.  Spurr and coworkers looked 
for linkage to BRCA1 and BRCA2 in 63 early-onset breast cancer families; 
55 percent linked to BRCA1 and 45 percent linked to BRCA2.  This implied 
that none linked to 11q22-23, as Wooster et al.  and Cortessis et al. had 
reported earlier.  The Spurr et al data also suggest that late-onset or 
sporadic breast cancers may still be related to ATM mutations.  This 
interpretation would be compatible with the epidemiological data from A-T 
families showing that breast cancer seen among A-T mothers (who are 
obligate heterozygotes) peaks in the age group of 45-54, not really an 
early-onset pattern.  Another study by van t'Veer et al, still in 
progress, has so far found two truncating ATM mutations among eight women 
who developed breast cancer following radiation therapy for Hodgkin's 
disease.   Recent reports describing ATM knockout mice are confirming the 
extreme cancer susceptibility of the homozygotes; virtually all of the 
homozygous mice died with massive, widely-metastasized, malignant thymic 
lymphomas.  Heterozygous animals have not yet shown tumors.  Another 
report by Carter et al found significant loss of heterozygosity in 
sporadic breast cancers across chromosome 11q22-23.  Although this region 
includes the ATM gene, it measures ~35 cM and probably includes more than 
1000 other genes as well.  Thus, the contribution of ATM mutations to 
familial breast cancer is likely to be low, with ATM perhaps playing a 
more important role in a sporadic, low-penetrance form of breast cancer.<P>

The most frequently reported cancers in American heterozygotes 
have been: breast, trachea/bronchus/lung, stomach, prostate, melanoma, 
gall bladder.  In Italy and in Costa Rica, gastric cancer has been 
especially noteworthy.  Among 64 A-T parents and grandparents in Costa 
Rica, half of the 12 cancers reported were gastric cancer.  (On the other 
hand, Costa Rica ranks among the top three countries in the world for 
stomach cancer in the general population, making it difficult to interpret 
these observations.)  In Italian families, 7 of 20 cancers in grandparents 
were gastric cancer.  Stomach cancer has been reported in homozygotes as 
well, including two families in which both affected sibs developed stomach 
cancer.  Morrell et al failed to note any increase in stomach cancers in 
A-T homozygotes.<P>  

<a name="radio">
<h3>Radiosensitivity</h3></a>
	
Almost thirty years ago, radiation therapists observed that when A-T 
patients with cancer were treated with conventional doses of ionizing 
radiation, they developed life-threatening sequelae characteristic of much 
higher doses.  This radiosensitivity was later demonstrated in vitro using 
fibroblasts from A-T homozygotes, which are not only sensitive to ionizing 
radiation but to a variety of radiomimetic and free-radical-producing 
agents.<P> 

Early radiosensitivity assays for A-T measure colony formation efficiency, 
i.e., cells are irradiated, then cultured, and the number of colonies that 
grow are scored after a measured time period.  Fibroblasts from A-T 
heterozygotes form colonies with an efficiency that is intermediate 
between A-T homozygosity and normal; the same observation can be made 
using neocarzinostatin.  In general, however, colony forming efficiency is 
not a reliable way to detect individual heteroyzotes.  Many other methods 
have been tested for identifying A-T heterozygotes; none are reliable 
because the normal and heterozygous datasets overlap.<P> 

Now that A-T heterozygotes (carriers) can be identified more easily by 
genetic testing, in families with prior affected patients, physicians are 
confronted with the dilemma of having to advise carriers about the risks 
of radiation exposure.  Unfortunately, there are as yet no clinical 
studies upon which to base such advice.  For example, data are lacking on 
whether the in vitro radiosensitivity of heterozygotes has any clinical 
correlate, i.e., unusual reactions to standard radiological procedures.   
One can only make the general recommendation that exposure to all types of 
ionizing radiation should be minimized in persons suspected of being A-T 
carriers, remembering that two-thirds of the sibs of A-T patients are 
likely to be carriers, as well as the parents.  Whether routine dental 
X-rays should be recommended in A-T patients is also an unresolved 
issue.<P>
	
ATM knockout mice that are heterozygous (ATM+/-) do not show any abnormal 
response to total body irradiation.   Swift's epidemiological data suggest 
that exposure of heterozygotes to myelograms and other diagnostic x-rays 
may increase cancer risk.  There is also cause for concern about 
mammograms in female A-T carriers, who appear to be at an increased risk 
of breast cancer. The recommendation at this writing is that mammograms be 
continued on the same age-dependent schedule as for non-carriers, but that 
the most up-to-date mammography machines be employed to minimize exposure 
to only a few rads.  The added risk of cancer to such women is only 
slightly increased [from 1.5/100 from annual mammography screening doses 
in non-carriers to perhaps 2/100 in A-T carriers] and this should be 
compared to a 1/9 natural lifetime risk and the 30% reduction in mortality 
from annual mammography screening in women over 40.<P>

Epidemiological and radiosensitivity studies on A-T family members further 
suggests that many cancer patients in general may be receiving the wrong 
doses of radiotherapy: too much for A-T heterozygotes, and too little for 
non-carriers.  Considering that 5 percent of cancer patients under 46 
years of age may be A-T carriers and intermediate in their 
radiosensitivity, this issue could involve many thousands of patients 
annually.  Some x-ray dosage regimens are first tested empirically on 
cadres of cancer patients and if these cadres contain up to 5 percent A-T 
carriers, one can easily imagine how radiation sequelae might be more apt 
to appear in the A-T carriers, thereby lowering the "safe" dosages defined 
for everyone else.  Hopefully, once A-T carrier testing can be implemented 
on a wide scale, these issues will be resolved.<P>

Although radiation damage to DNA has been used for many years as a 
laboratory tool for characterizing the phenotype of A-T cells, it should 
be remembered that A-T cells are not usually exposed to irradiation in 
vivo!  Thus, the radiosensitivity of A-T cells is a laboratory artifact.  
Despite this, the complex A-T syndrome develops quite uniformly in most 
affecteds.  From this, one might conclude that the substrate for the ATM 
protein is ubiquitous in our bodies and that whatever DNA damage occurs 
must result from some naturally recurring insult to all cells.  Oxidative 
stress and the normal production of DNA-damaging free radical products of 
metabolism are certainly good candidates for the naturally-recurring 
insult.  Although many attempts have been made to demonstrate defective 
DNA repair in A-T cells, none has been convincingly demonstrated.  Recent 
observations suggest that it is the inability to sense this damage that is 
defective in A-T cells, not the actual mechanisms of repair.<P>  

<a name="cycle">
<h3>Cell cycle checkpoints</h3></a>

Important checkpoints monitor the progress of the cell cycle and prevent 
mutagenic damage to DNA from being fixed into future cell generations.  
The G1 checkpoint prevents replication of a damaged DNA template; the G2 
checkpoint prevents segregation of damaged chromosomes.  Kastan et al have 
shown that A-T cells have a delayed radiation-induced increase in p53, as 
compared to normal cells.  P53, dubbed the "guardian of the genome", acts 
to suppress normal cell cycle progression at G1 until DNA repairs have 
been completed.  It accomplishes this by binding DNA at sequence-specific 
sites, thereby transcriptionally activating a signal-transduction 
cascade.  In so doing, p53 functions as a tumor suppressor.  Cells from 
p53 knockout mice, lacking both normal alleles of p53 (p53-/-), fail to 
observe the G1 checkpoint; they do not experience G1 arrest after 
irradiation; nor do these mice show neurological abnormalities, immune 
defects or problems with sterility.  The phosphorylation of replication 
factor A (RPA) is similarly delayed in A-T cells post-irradiation.  Lavin 
and coworkers have confirmed the p53 expression delay and further 
demonstrated cell cycle defects upstream from p53, at PKCepsilon.  The 
fact that the newly-cloned A-T gene has a putative kinase domain supports 
the significance of these studies.  Given the strong association of 
multiple types of cancer with p53 deficiency further suggests that 
involvement of this pathway in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of A-T 
may help to explain the increased frequency of cancer.<P> 

Interestingly, p53-/- mutants are not radiosensitive.  Thus, 
another mechanism must account for this facet of the A-T syndrome. Much 
work still needs to be done before the role of ATM proteins in 
intracellular signaling can be understood.  For example, despite much 
evidence for the inefficiency of G1/S, S and G2/M checkpoints in A-T 
cells, holding A-T cells in Go for up to seven days, does not improve 
their post-irradiation survival, suggesting that even these checkpoint 
defects may not be the crucial common denominator underlying A-T 
pathogenesis.  Recent evidence presented by Jung and Dritschilo implicates 
the NF-kappaB and IkappaB-alpha proteins in ATM function; the ATM protein 
appears to phosphorylate IkB-alpha, thereby activating the transcription 
factor NF-kappaB.  These findings would also support observations of 
increased radiation-induced apoptosis in cell lines derived from A-T 
patients.<P>  

When DNA synthesis of irradiated fibroblasts is measured, A-T homozygotes 
show a characteristic dose response curve, one that is diagnostic of the 
disease.  This phenomenon is called "radioresistant DNA synthesis (RDS)" 
because, unlike normal cells that temporarily halt the synthesis of new 
DNA after irradiation damage, A-T cells simply continue into S phase of 
the cell cycle.  Later experiments that attempted to complement RDS by 
transfecting cDNA transcripts or microcell-mediated chromosome transfer 
and other radiomimetic features of A-T cells found, however, that the two 
phenomena often were dissociated.  Thus, RDS most likely reflects a cell 
cycle checkpoint failure at S phase that is independent of other 
radiosensitivity phenotypes of A-T cells.  Using RDS, heterozygous cells 
cannot be distinguished from normals.<P> 

The shape of the RDS curve for A-T cells has been insightfully interpreted 
by Painter as having two components: one reflecting replicon initiation, 
and the other reflecting chain elongation.  The second component is 
determined by the slope of the curve above 2 kilorads, and this slope does 
not differ from normal to A-T fibroblasts.  The early component, however, 
is essentially missing from the A-T curves, suggesting that replicon 
initiation is quite abnormal.  Painter further suggested that while in 
unirradiated normal cells initiation occurs synchronously at the origins 
of a cluster of about five replicons and in irradiated normal cells damage 
to one replicon inhibits the entire cluster of five, in irradiated A-T 
cells damage to one replicon inhibits only that one replicon, i.e., the 
damage is not sensed or translated to the rest of the cluster and chain 
elongation near the growing forks is not curbed.  Thus, radiation to A-T 
cells blocks initiation of only individual replicons rather than blocking 
the initiation of clusters of replicons.  Hand and Gautschi provide 
evidence that one single-strand break may inactivate the initiation of as 
many as a hundred replicons!  Although Painter's interpretation of the RDS 
curve was put forth over ten years ago, it remains a very attractive 
hypothesis for explaining one facet of the pathogenesis of A-T.<P> 

<h3>Genetics</h3>

The disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive.  The incidence of 
A-T has been estimated at 1 in 40,000-100,000 live births, while the gene 
frequency is believed to be as common as 1-3% of the general population.  
All races are affected.  Despite the fact that the A-T gene impacts upon 
so many different and apparently unrelated systems, the disease is 
inherited in each family as a single autosomal recessive gene defect.  It 
is unclear why, for an autosomal recessive disorder, so many of the 
parents of British, Italian, and American patients are unrelated.  This is 
borne out by the recent finding that most A-T patients, worldwide, are 
compound heterozygotes, i.e., they have two different mutations.  The 
large size of the gene certainly provides a large target for new 
mutations.  Recent studies also suggest that gametogenesis is abnormal in 
ATM knockout mice and that both mitotic and meiotic recombination is 
increased in A-T patients.  Furthermore, the newly cloned ATM gene shares 
homology with mec1 in yeast and mei41 in Drosophila, and both are meiotic 
recombination defective mutants, as discussed above.  Whether this would 
affect the heterozygous parents in A-T families sufficiently to influence 
the incidence of some affected fetuses remains to be clarified.<P>

Claims that "A-T is not always a recessive disorder" are misleading and 
belie the consortium experience of having localized the ATM gene to within 
less than 0.5 cM based on a model that assumed autosomal recessive 
inheritance in 176 families from eight countries.  Families that do not 
link to 11q22-23 will have mutations in other genes and other names will 
have to be given to those "AT-like" disorders.<P>
  
The rate of spontaneous mutations is unknown.  However, of the 176 
consortium families, all but five linked to chromosome 11q23.1.  (A sixth 
family with two affected children now links.)  Since linkage rules out 
spontaneous mutations, only these five could harbor spontaneous 
mutations.  Using the ratio of 5/176 and a gene frequency estimate of 
0.01, mutation rate estimates approximate 1.5 x 10-4.  This is rather 
high, even for a large gene.  Of course, if the ATM gene product really 
affects gametogenesis, it may not even be appropriate to apply standard 
genetic algorithms, based on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, to the existing 
epidemiological data.  It may also be that some young patients succumb to 
malignancies before a diagnosis of A-T can be recognized, further skewing 
the data.<P>

<h3>AT-related Syndromes.</h3> 
 
The related Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) and Berlin Breakage Syndrome 
(BBS), respectively assigned to complementation groups V1 and V2, do not 
have ataxia and do not link to chromosome 11q23.  They found their way 
into the A-T literature because they also manifest the 7;14 translocations 
and radioresistant DNA synthesis.  NBS further includes cancer 
susceptibility and immunodeficiency.  Telangiectasia are absent and the 
serum AFP level is normal.  NBS further includes "bird-like facies", 
microcephaly and mental retardation (A-T patients typically are not 
mentally retarded.)  BBS very closely resembles NBS and may not represent 
a different syndrome or a different gene.  However, NBS cells complement 
the RDS of BBS, implicating a second gene.  Only a handful of BBS patients 
have been described in the literature.  They include most of the signs and 
symptoms of NBS, with the possible addition of syndactyly, anal atresia, 
hypospadias and prominent nose.  Most of the reported NBS and BBS families 
have been of Eastern European origin.  Efforts are underway to localize 
and clone the gene(s) for both syndromes.<P>

ATFresno (ATF) combines the classical A-T syndrome with NBS, including an 
elevated AFP.  Whenever microcephaly and mental retardation are seen in an 
otherwise classical A-T patient, an ATF diagnosis should be suspected.  On 
the other hand, since ATF families link to chromosome 11q23.1 and ATM 
mutations have been found in some patients, it is unclear what the 
clinical importance of this diagnostic distinction will be.  Meanwhile, we 
have found both ATM mutations in one patient suspected of ATF, and one of 
the two expected ATM mutations in three other patients.  It may be that 
ATF is associated either with particular ATM mutation sites or perhaps 
these patient carry mutations from two different, but closely linked, 
genes that interact.  The nearby CAND3 gene could be a candidate for the 
second modifier gene.<P>

<h3>A-T Variants</h3>

There is an abundant literature describing patients who do not meet all of 
the diagnostic criteria discussed above.  Many of these describe very 
young patients, transient ataxias, probable A-T patients without 
telangiectasiae, patients with normal AFP levels or those with near-normal 
immunological parameters.  Recent screening for ATM mutations of such 
"variant" families in the international consortium (families that were 
categorically excluded from the linkage analyses) would now suggest that 
most of these are A-T.  In several families with classically affected 
patients, prominent telangiectasiae have been noted in members who do not 
have ataxia and do not carry the two affected ATM haplotypes.  Some of 
these are bonafide A-T heterozygotes.  Conversely, we have one family in 
which both affected alleles appear in a teenager with full-blown 
telangiectasia but without ataxia. (This family was one of six non-linking 
families in the consortium linkage analyses.)  Other families have been 
described with intermediate radiosensitivity, a parameter that is 
difficult to quantitate; nonetheless, in some hands this must be 
considered a reliable finding that will probably relate in some way to the 
sites of ATM mutations in those families .  No doubt there is also a 
sizable population of radiosensitive individuals whose symptoms partially 
overlap the A-T syndrome.  It will be interesting to learn whether these 
patients have ATM mutations or mutations in other genes that interact with 
the ATM protein.   In some families with later-onset ataxia, 
telangiectasiae often do not become very prominent.  On the other hand, we 
have recently found ATM mutations in several of these families, thus, 
confirming them as bonafide A-T patients.<P>

<h3>Prenatal diagnosis</h3>

With the fine-mapping of the ATM gene, a set of highly informative genetic 
markers was developed that now allows accurate haplotyping within 
families, with basically 100% risk of the fetus either being affected or 
not being affected.  The finding of only a single A-T gene for all 
complementation groups also simplifies this diagnostic approach.  This is 
in contrast to earlier attempts to perform prenatal diagnoses by trying to 
quantitate spontaneous chromosome breakage, radiation-induced chromosomal 
damage of amniocytes or fetal fibroblasts, and RDS -- all of which were 
misleading at one time or another (personal communications).  Hopefully, 
these approaches have now been abandoned.<P>

Prenatal diagnosis by haplotyping relies upon a prior affected child to 
identify the two affected chromosome 11q23.1 segments (i.e., haplotypes) 
carrying the ATM gene.  Having DNA from a prior affected child in the 
family is a prerequisite for prenatal diagnosis by haplotyping, while 
consanguinity is not.   The markers used today are all within 1% 
recombination of the ATM gene: D11S1817, D11S1819, NS22, D11S2179, and 
D11S1818.  Two of these markers are within the ATM gene itself, thereby 
circumventing the need for even reporting the risk of recombination 
separating the testing markers from the actual ATM gene.  Most of this 
testing can be performed prior to conception and continued once the mother 
is pregnant, so that once a DNA sample is available from the fetus -- 
either from growing amniocytes or from a chorionic villous biopsy -- the 
entire haplotyping can be completed within a week.  Because abortion 
guidelines vary with the country or state of residence of the mother, we 
ask not for the due date or for the date of last menses, but for the 
referring laboratory's own deadline for reporting the results of prenatal 
diagnosis to the family.  The testing laboratory director must also insist 
that the prenatal testing results be conveyed to the family by a genetic 
counselor.<P> 

Determining whether two mutations exist within the ATM gene of a child suspected of A-T would certainly be the most definitive way of establishing the diagnosis.  
Unfortunately, at this writing, such an approach is not feasible, with rare exceptions, i.e., in families of certain ethnic backgrounds, a limited number of rapid DNA assays are now available. 
However, unless the patient is homozygous for that mutation  -- which is very unlikely unless the parents are consanguineous -- a second mutation must still be sought. 
This requires a great deal of effort, either by mRNA/cDNA/RT-PCR-based screening assays or by a systematic genomic search of the 66 exons of the ATM gene.  
Even this approach is not 100% effective in finding all mutations at the present time since some lie deep within introns and others are deceptive.  
Eventually, we hope to determine the mutations of most A-T families worldwide.  
Only then will it be possible to perform prenatal diagnosis.<P>

With their offices located adjacent to the hospital, guidance in patient care issues occurs, formally and informally, on an ongoing basis with every admission to the teaching services.  Many of these faculty have chosen clinical practice at Virginia Mason because of the opportunity to participate in the residency program. Most of the faculty hold teaching positions at the University of Washington and positions of distinction in their regional and national medical organizations such as the American College of Physicians, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, and the American Lung Association.

 typical ward team consists of one senior resident (R-2 or R-3) and two interns.  Medical students may also be a part of a ward team.  Ward teams admit patients three out of six days. A typical census for a hospital ward team is 6 - 10 patients per intern.  Overnight call is every sixth night.  Because the team approach is an important aspect of the practice of Internal Medicine, residents work with all members of the health care team: other residents, medical students, attending physicians, physician consultants, nursing staff, and ancillary health care workers.
<br><br>
First year residents have initial and primary responsibility for decision-making, care planning, record keeping, and continuing management for all inpatients, subject to review and approval by supervising residents and the managing attending physician. Housestaff write all orders for patients under their care.  Residents are granted independent decision-making and care planning commensurate with their demonstrated abilities to provide excellent patient care.
<br><br>
The Critical Care team consists of one senior resident (R-2 or R-3) and one intern.  Two Critical Care teams cover the medical patients in the Critical Care Unit. A typical census for the Critical Care Unit is 8 to 12 patients.  The teams take overnight call every other night for a two week block. Board certified subspecialists in Critical Care Medicine, Pulmonary Medicine,and Cardiology teach and help with patient care management in the Critical Care Unit as their primary activity for their assigned month.</td></tr>

The Virginia Mason surgical residency is the oldest approved surgical residency in the Pacific Northwest.  It was instituted in 1920 when Virginia Mason Clinic first opened its doors and is now a five-year residency in General Surgery that qualifies the resident for examination by the American Board of Surgery. Candidates who have completed the full program have been uniformly successful in gaining certification by the American Board of Surgery and in developing active surgical practices or going on for advanced fellowships in surgery.  Since 1978, 64 percent of our graduating residents have entered practices in general surgery.  The remainder completed fellowships in vascular, cardiac, plastic, pediatric and colorectal surgery, and subsequently, entered practices in their respective fields.<BR>
<BR>

Eight positions are available at the first-year postgraduate level; four of which are designated for categorical or five-year general surgical training. Four appointments are made for students interested in two years of general surgery training prior to subspecialty training.<BR>
<BR>	
The first two years of the surgical residency are organized to provide the trainee with a basic core of knowledge, stressing a physiologic approach to pre- and postoperative care.  Clinical rotations include general/thoracic surgery, vascular surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, gynecology, neurosurgery, plastic/head and neck surgery, transplant and urology.  First-year residents in surgery are on call every third or fourth night and cover his/her own and other surgical services.  The second-year surgery resident who is on call at night is the most senior surgeon in the hospital and evaluates emergency room problems, takes care of patients in the intensive care units, and serves as a consultant for the first-year surgical residents.  The senior resident and the attending staff on call serve as back-ups for the in-house second-year surgery resident.<BR> 
<BR>
An excellent interchange and camaraderie exists between the surgical and medical services at Virginia Mason Medical Center.  This is fostered by the first-year surgical residents' rotation in the various medical services.  Patients in Virginia Mason Medical Center often have a medical as well as a surgical team involved with their care.  This tradition at the Clinic, fostered by the residency program, leads to excellent communication with the medical residents and the senior medical attendings and is a strong part of our program.  The relationships with Pathology, Radiology, and Anesthesia are also excellent. Experience in the treatment of severely injured patients is provided by Emergency Room, Trauma, and Burn Service rotations at Harborview Medical Center during the R-1, R-2, and R-3 years.  A Pediatric Surgery rotation is provided at Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle for third-year residents designated to complete the General Surgery Residency.  Elective rotations are also available in Anesthesia, GI Endoscopy, Surgical Pathology, and Radiology.  Research opportunities are available on an ad hoc basis with no formal research year required.  For residents interested in surgical subspecialties (e.g., Orthopedics, Urology, ENT), individual schedules are prepared allowing extra rotations in these areas during the R-1 and R-2 years. <BR> 
<BR>
Each of the seven general surgery services at the Virginia Mason Medical Center is under the direction of only one attending surgeon.  An average of 40-50 operations per month are performed on each service.  Surgical residents in the R-1 through the R-5 years have the opportunity to work closely with a single attending rather than with a group of surgeons.  Fourth- and fifth-year residents have senior responsibility on general surgery services.  The senior resident is assigned to one staff surgeon and works with that surgeon in the operating room, on hospital rounds, and in the surgeon's private offices in the clinic.  This close apprenticeship experience, especially in the outpatient setting, is one of the unique aspects of our residency training at Virginia Mason Medical Center.  Another unique aspect of our surgical residency training program is the operating room experience of the junior housestaff.  Junior housestaff are not relegated to ward duties while the senior surgeons are in the operating room. First and second year residents scrub on all operations upon patients on their service.  They are the primary surgeons on all appropriate operations, depending on their level of expertise.  Typical daily schedules will vary depending upon operating room responsibilities.  While on general surgery services, houseofficers perform operations three out of five days.  While covering specialties, operating room time is increased to about 70 percent of the day.  Representative schedules are listed below.<BR>

Daily conferences are integrated to present both didactic and practical coverage of surgical problems.  The conferences and ward rounds are directed toward resident education and are delivered both by the staff and the residents.  Surgical Journal Club is held 2 times a month, based on the "SELECTED READINGS" Series from Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and a monthly installment of current journal articles.  These papers are provided for all categorical surgical residents.  In addition, residents are provided with SESAP (Surgical Education and Self-Assessment Program), the learning program written by the American College of Surgeons.  Each year, all residents are required to take the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE).  Our faculty also holds mock oral examinations for the surgical housestaff in order to prepare them for the American Board of Surgery Oral Examination.  Each Tuesday morning, a multiple choice test is administered by the Chief Resident to all residents. The test is based on readings from a current textbook of surgery and covers the entire field of surgery.  In addition, residents are encouraged to prepare individually for each case by reading a textbook description, a surgical atlas and an anatomy text.  
<br><br>
During the residency, each resident is expected to co-author scientific papers with attending surgical staff and to present research at local, regional, and national surgical meetings.  A travel policy for residents presenting papers is an integral part of the program.  A list of recent publications and presentations by our surgical residents is enclosed.

Virginia Mason Medical Center currently offers a Transitional Year Program for six positions approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. The program provides a maximum breadth of experience in all aspects of patient care.  Required rotations include: 5 blocks of Medicine; 3 blocks of Surgery; 1 block of ER and 1 block of Pediatrics at Children's Hospital and Medical Center.  The remaining 3 blocks are electives.
<BR><BR>
The Transitional Year Program is designed for individuals with an interest in Radiology, Anesthesiology, Psychiatry, Emergency Room Medicine, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Orthopedic Surgery, and those residents who will go into the armed services.  The flexibility of the year's experience is well suited to all of these careers and, after completion, the individual can proceed directly to the appropriate residency program.
<BR><BR>
In addition, the Transitional first year is excellent preparation for a career in Family Practice or Internal Medicine.  Historically, many Virginia Mason medical residents have been selected from individuals completing this program.
<BR><BR>
The resident rotating through the medical and surgical services assumes the same responsibility given to a resident in one of the categorical programs.  The R-1 is a key figure in the management of patients on all services with responsibilities that include initial workup, initial orders, progress notes and diagnostic tests.
<BR><BR>
On all rotations, the R-1 works directly with an R-2 or R-3 in Medicine and with an R-4 or R-5 in Surgery who is available for teaching, advice and assistance in procedures.  Representative daily schedules are listed under the medicine and surgical training programs.
<BR><BR>
All residents must spend a four-week rotation covering the Emergency Department. A resident assumes primary medical responsibility for emergency visits, which average 40 per day.  Teaching and supervision in the Emergency Department is under the direction of five full-time teaching staff.  These individuals are board certified Internists and have demonstrated excellent teaching interest and ability.
<BR><BR>
The Transitional Year Program is designed to provide the greatest possible individualization of assignments.  After an appointment through the National Resident Matching Program, the new house officer is sent a list of possible rotations and asked to state a preference for assignment.  Every effort is made to fill this request, as it is the belief of the Office of Housestaff Affairs that the individual is in the best position to recognize his/her most important needs at this level of training.
<BR><BR>
Candidates who have performed credibly in the first postgraduate year are given preferences for opening in the R-2 year in categorical problems.  Those who seek specialty training elsewhere are aided by letters of recommendation from the teaching faculty.
<BR><BR>
A representative schedule for the Transitional Year is listed below. Each rotation is of a four week duration with the night call averaging every fourth night.

Through the National Resident Matching Program, we offer a complete Diagnostic Radiology Residency including a transitional year internship at Virginia Mason Medical Center.  We havetwo residency positions for each of the PGY-1 through PGY-5 years.  Doing  the internship at Virginia Mason allows exposure to all the other housestaff and clinicians.  This makes the transition to Radiology much easier since one is already familiar with the workings of themedical center.  The small size of our residency allows a very close working relationship between residents and attending staff.

schedule will vary slightly.<BR><BR>

During the first six months of radiology training (PGY-2), the resident completes rotations in GI, CT, Ultrasound and Nuclear Medicine.  .  The resident is on call with a senior resident beginning in September and begins taking call with attending back-up in December.The remainder of the year is spent on Chest, Neuroradiology, Angio/Interventional, Mammography,MRI and GU.<BR><BR>

                     During the second year of radiology residency (PGY-3) there is an eight week rotation at 
                     Children's Hospital for Pediatric radiology and an eight week rotation at Harborview Medical 
                     Center for Trauma radiology.  Training also continues in all modalities at Virginia Mason.  By 
                     the latter part of this year, the resident accepts progressive responsibility in the department 
                     and eventually performs major portions of all exams independently.<BR><BR>

                    In the third year (PGY-4), the final rotation at Harborview Medical Center is completed.  
                    There is also a second eight week rotation at Children's Hospital.  During this year each 
                    resident attends the Radiologic Pathologic Correlation Course at the Armed Forces Institute
                    of Pathology in Bethesda, Maryland.<BR><BR>  

                    In the last year of training (PGY-5) the residents have primary responsibility for diagnostic 
                    procedures, under the supervision of a supporting staff person.  Senior residents have five 
                    elective rotations.  These can be arranged on any service and one can be designated for

                 Most of our residents enter private practice either directly after residency or after completing
                 a fellowship but a number are in academics.  Examples of practice choices in the last five years
                 include:

                 1996     Large (30 radiologists) private practice in North Carolina

                 1995     Small private practice group in Port Angeles, WA.
                              Larger private practice in Seattle

                 1994     Large private practice group in California
                              HMO (Group Health) in Seattle area

     <td><h4>
                At the end of each rotation the residents are asked to fill out evaluation forms on both
                the attending staff and the rotation itself.  The Program Directors then compile these
                evaluations and review them annually with the appropriate teaching coordinators.  We
                value our residents' feedback and utilize this information to continually improve our
                program.  Changes are implemented quickly and the response time to residents' suggestions
                is quite short.

                Radiology residents meet formally with the Program Director at least every six months to
                review their performance evaluations.  Residents are evaluated after each rotation by the
                faculty.  A summary of his or her evaluations is discussed with each individual resident.
                Learning goals for the next six months and long term professional goals are discussed at 
                these sessions.

<CENTER><B><H1>Standard Ethernet</B></H1></CENTER>
Traffic on the ethernet used in our network consists of serial data transmissions controlled by a communications protocol named Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).  Basically, one network node at a time can broadcast a carrier signal and data packets with the network address of the intended destination embedded in the packet header. The network interface card in the computer listens for other carriers and when the line is free, initiates a transmission. Each of the nodes on the LAN look at the address in the packet and either receives or ignores the transmission as appropriate.   If two nodes attempt to transmit simultaneously, a "collision" is detected by the interface and the nodes back off for a random amount of time and then retry the transmission. The data packets range in size from a minimum of 64 bytes to a maximum of 2048 bytes (2KB).The "bandwidth" or maximum data capacity for standard ethernet is 10 Megabits per second (Mbps) (or about 1.25 Megabytes/sec). In shared ethernet this capacity must be divided among all of the active nodes in a given segment on the LAN. 
<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet connections were originally made with coaxial cable routed from node to node in what was called a "bus topology" or "10base2" after the ANSI standard. There were reliability problems with this method because a malfunctioning interface card or broken/bad cable or connection could adversely affect a large portion of the network. This type of problem was difficult to isolate and repair without taking the whole network down. The "star topology" (AKA 10baseT) was developed to overcome some of these limitations using two twisted pairs of unshielded wires routed from each node to a central connection point. Inexpensive telephone cable (known as Level 3 cable) is commonly used for standard 10Mbit/s ethernet. In fact, some facilities have used existing telephone wiring (sometimes referred to as "POTS" - plain old telephone service) for their network interconnections. A "hub" or "concentrator"  is used at the central connection, and it is common for modern hubs to monitor network traffic, looking for excessive collisions and illegal sized packets. These hubs can automatically identify and partition (shut down) a malfunctioning node connection without affecting the rest of the network. It is then relatively simple to identify the bad component and correct the problem.<BR>
<center><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="vmbbarw.gif"></center>
<h4>Due to the bandwidth limitations of the ethernet, it is often desirable to break up the network into a hierarchy of logical work groups called segments. These segments can be interconnected by one of three types of devices:</h4>
<CENTER><TABLE  WIDTH="90%"><tr><td><H4>
<CENTER><B><H1>Bridge</B></H1></CENTER>
The basic purpose of a bridge is to separate (filter) the network traffic unless the destination of a data packet is in another segment. They either learn or are told (through software) all of the network addresses on at least one side. The destination of each data packet is checked and the device determines whether or not it is necessary to pass (forward) the data out of the work group through the bridge to reach it's intended destination. Bridges are usually only a single port and often do no more than check the address of a packet and consequently do not slow down the apparent speed of the network.
<CENTER><B><H1>Router</B></H1></CENTER>
A router generally has multiple ports, not necessarily all utilizing the ethernet protocol and learns all of the addresses on the network. The router looks at the packet destination, decides what is the best path to that destination and can convert the packet to different network protocols such as Token Ring or FDDI (or one of many others) if necessary.  It can also isolate networks by controlling data flow bidirectionally.   Because the router stores the entire packet before operating on it and/or forwarding, it is slower than a bridge by an order of magnitude. However, since it stores the entire packet, data integrity can be checked before forwarding, preventing the propagation of corrupted and truncated packets through the network. This is an important feature because these errors are generated during normal network operations as a result of collisions. Some devices combine features of a bridge and a router into a single unit.
<CENTER><B><H1>Switching Ethernet Hubs</B></H1></CENTER>
A switching ethernet hub is basically a group of bridges connected in a cross-point matrix that can filter addresses and forward the packets to the appropriate port at full bandwidth ("wire speed") independently of the activity of the other ports in the switch. There are several different vendors of switching hubs; some basically utilize bridge technology, others have many of the features of a multi-port router.
</h4>
<td></TR></TABLE></center>
A telecommunications analogy is often used to describe the difference between shared and switched ethernet hubs. A shared ethernet hub is like being on a party line; only one conversation can be carried on at a time. Switched ethernet is like a PBX where multiple conversations can occur simultaneously. However, you can still get a busy signal if the person you call is already on the line. Consequently, switched ethernet is most appropriately used where there are a significant number of peer to peer conversations going on as opposed to several clients primarily communicating with a single server.<BR>
<center><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="vmbbarw.gif"></center>
<CENTER><B><H1>Full Duplex Ethernet</B></H1></CENTER>
<BR>
This is a proprietary (non-standardized) implementation that permits simultaneous bi-directional operation of standard 10Mbps ethernet, yielding 20Mbps. Useful when there is a need to handle substantial traffic flowing in both directions. Primary applications would be for file servers and for interconnecting LAN segments. Full duplex ethernet requires the use of specialized hubs and network interface cards.

<CENTER><B><H1>Fast Ethernet</B></H1></CENTER>

This is also a proprietary protocol. In fact, there are two very different proposals in the category. One referred to as 100baseT, is being supported by Cabletron, SynOptics, and Sun Microsystems. It retains the current architecture of 10baseT ethernet on better cable (Level 5) and the afore-mentioned standard ethernet CSMA/CD communications protocol. The other, called 100VGanyLAN, is supported by AT&T, HP, IBM, and Proteon. It is significantly different from the current ethernet in that it uses a completely different communications protocol called Demand Priority Method Access, which as you might guess from the name supports several different priority levels for an interface card to use in obtaining access to the network. In addition, the interconnection architecture utilizes 4 pairs of wires instead of the two pairs used by 10baseT. This is not as great a problem as it might seem due to the fact that Level 5 cabling consists of four pairs of wire of which two pairs are not (generally) used. It would also seem significant to note that HP developed the communications protocol specifically to provide support for real-time video and voice processing. Fast ethernet also requires the use of vendor-specific, specialized hubs and network interface cards.

<CENTER><B><H1>Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)</B></H1></CENTER>

100Mbps FDDI initially was developed for fault tolerance with a dual redundant "counter-rotating" ring (point  to point) topology utilizing two pairs of fiber optic cables. Devices on the ring are referred to as dual-attach stations, and must be operating to complete the network circuit unless equipped with electrically-operated optical by-pass switches. The cabling is expensive and difficult to terminate. FDDI star topologies have been developed utilizing a single fiber optic pair from a hub (referred to as a concentrator for FDDI) to the devices on the network, known as single-attach stations. As with 10baseT, problems on an individual port does not normally adversely affect the rest of the network. Most recently, FDDI has been implemented on shielded and unshielded twisted pair cable in this star topology. This has been standardized as Twisted Pair - Physical Media Dependent (TP-PMD) FDDI. Network equipment from different vendors will general work together with little risk of incompatibility.

<CENTER><B><H1>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)</B></H1></CENTER>

This is the newest development in network technology, still (a year?) away from wide commercial availability. Virtually every aspect of the network communication protocol has been redesigned from packet size ("cells" in ATM-ese) to destination addressing. Even bandwidth is supposed to be scalable from 25Mbps to 250Mbps and higher. ATM has been optimized for transmission efficiency and simple switching/routing that can be implemented entirely in hardware (like some ethernet bridging technologies). Essentially, each ethernet packet must be directed to it's destination, one step (bridge/router) at a time. ATM transmits a "scout" to determine the best route and establish a "connection" with the destination. This routing information is then included in the header of subsequent cells. These connections can be set up by a network administrator as a Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC) or on demand by the network as a Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC). ATM also uses a fixed size cell (53 bytes) compared to ethernet's variable 64 to 2048 byte packet, which allows the ATM network to manage traffic through Quality of Service (QoS) requests. This ability to allocate bandwidth permits delay-tolerant traffic to be intermixed with time-sensitive traffic like voice and video.<BR>

<CENTER><B><H1>TCP/IP and the DICOM Standard</B></H1></CENTER>

TCP/IP is part of a networking protocol that governs the communication between computers. Refering to the "OSI model", the universal framework for communications between computers, the protocols corresond to the Network and Transport layers, between the user interface and the physical network operations. :

TCP/IP was probably chosen as part of the DICOM specification because of several factors; automatic routing capabilities inherent to the equipment addressing scheme, independence from specific types of physical network structures, and the popularity  of UNIX (of which TCP/IP is an integral part) in research and engineering applications. <BR><BR>

The DICOM standard defines most of the parameters necessary for computers from different manufacturers to exchange and manipulate various types of data. In addition to transfer and display parameters, there are parameters for filming and a Hospital/Radiology Information System interface. <BR>
<center><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="vmbbarw.gif"></center>
<CENTER><B><H1>Design considerations for Diagnostic Imaging</B></H1></CENTER>
Several factors impact the design of our Imaging Network, beyond the obvious roadblocks presented by the compatibility (or lack thereof) of image file formats between multiple vendors. We must assume that the ACR-NEMA DICOM 3.0 standard will eventually provide the basis for that connectivity. <BR><BR>Technolgically outdated and/or proprietary computer architectures used by some imaging vendors must be accomodated, as well as the huge traffic loads present in exams consisting of 10 to 20 Megabytes of data. Imaging Nodes, particularly workstations, will eventually be widely distributed throughout the medical center, satellites, and perhaps even to client facilities.  <BR>

<CENTER><B><H1>Building Blocks</B></H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><TABLE  WIDTH="90%">
<tr><td>
<CENTER><B><H2>1. Network Interface Cards (NIC):</B></H2></CENTER> This is the base on which the network is built. We predict that we will be tied to 10 Mbps ethernet for propriatary devices (such as CT, MR, DSI, DECUS, Lasers) for several more years. The aquisition modalities have generally not utilized "state of the art" computer hardware because of the time and investment required to develop and certify the systems. Along with card availability, NIC driver software must also be available that is compatible with the respective operating systems and be transparent to application software. High speed NICs will be available for the systems that utilize off the shelf computer hardware (such as workstations and archival systems), but we must ensure that compatible, industry standard cards and driver software are available for all of these platforms. <Br> 

<CENTER><B><H2>2. Network Cabling:</B></H2></CENTER> There are established standards for cable types and hardware specific to the various types and speeds of network interconnection. All of the wiring components and techniques used in the current network project are intended to meet the requirements of "Level 5", which should be adequate for at  least 100Mbps. There is no established theoretical bandwidth limit for the fiber optic cabling interconnectiong the 5th Floor South Pavillion to the North Pavillion, MRI, and Hospital buildings; the telephone switch room and the link to the Metro Building in the Clinic Basement.  The rationale behind our wiring plan is to provide flexibility by permiting installation or migration of any computing device at any point of our network. Specifically, we anticipate that the IdxRad serial terminals will soon be replaced by either diskless PCs or Graphics Workstations. PCs or workstations will also be more widely utilized in the physician's offices. Additional digital image acquisition devices will be added as DICOM standards are implemented and deployed into the marketplace.  <BR><BR>

Initially, the fiber optic cables will be utilized not for their potential speed advantages, but for extended range. The Level 5 wiring will function out to approximately 328 feet. The fiber optic cables are rated for more than 1640 feet, and is necessary for the network extensions to the other buildings.

<CENTER><B><H2>3. Connections:</B></H2></CENTER>
<center><B><I> Phase One:</i></b></CENTER>
 We have purchased six, 12 port 10 BaseT (10 Mbps twisted pair) Shared Ethernet Hubs and a 16 port, store and forward Ethernet Switch to provide the connectivity for our computers. Please refer to the attached diagram. The acquisition devices, work stations, and file servers will be connected to the workgroup hubs, organized for the most part by section or modality. Each hub will in turn be connected to a port on The Switch, which will serve as a bridge to restrict normal traffic to their respective segment. Traffic specifically intended for destinations outside the segment will be passed. Several devices will be plugged directly into the switch to take advantage of the dedicated 10Mbps bandwidth provided between switch ports. These particular devices were selected for direct connection to the switch because of the predicted load and traffic patterns between them. The connection to the existing Medical Center Ethernet will also be through one of the switch ports. Initially, the equipment installed in the North Pavillion will be directly connected via fiber optic cables and ethernet transceivers (transmission media adapters) to their logical modalities. <BR><BR>

Telecommunications has made a commitment to share the T-1 (dedicated 1.44 Mbps) phone lines to several of the VM satellite clinics. Via the fiber optic cables to the Telephone Switch Room, we will have access to 684KBps (approximately  7% of ethernet bandwidth) per satellite for establishing a wide-area network (WAN). Through these connections, we will be able to accomplish such tasks as providing workstation services and importing Ultrasound, CT, and MRI images from the remote sites. Information Systems is in the process of selecting new modular equipment and there is a chance that Radiology may acquire routers and communications/data service units (CSU/DSU) from IS. <BR><BR>

<CENTER><B><I>Phase Two:</I></B></CENTER>
 Eventually, it will be necessary to connect more than six devices in the North Pavillion to our Radiology Imaging Network. At this time, a second Ethernet Switch will be installed with a high speed (FDDI or perhaps ATM) interswitch link to the existing Ethernet Switch. The network traffic will be able to connect with their modality segments through the high speed link and switch ports with little or no degradation in speed over the discrete connections implemented in Phase One. <BR><BR>

<CENTER><B><I>Phase Three:</I></B> </CENTER>
We will be locked in to 10Mbps ethernet for many of our acquisition and printing devices for several years. But the modality segments will be relatively small and automatically pushing images to file/print/archival servers not particularly time-sensitive as there will seldom be a person waiting for the images to arrive. However, we anticipate that many of the workstations will not be modality-specific. In fact, multi-modality image envelopes are expected in conjunction with the Idx project workstations, and there will definitely be a person awaiting the arrival of images when they are called up as part of a referring physician's review of the exam interpetation or a radiologist's consultation. Logically, these multi-use workstations should reside on their own segment, and this segment will be a high-speed protocol as determined by the selection of the inter-switch link in Phase Two. 

<CENTER><B><H2>4. Network Management:</B></H2></CENTER>
 All of the equipment being purchased is compatible with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SMNP) software, which we have also purchased. We will be able to collect statistical data on network activities, tune, configure, and troubleshoot hardware from a network workstation. We will be able to analyze and document the growth and traffic patterns, placing and purchasing hardware in a logical manner. We currently have an assigned block of Internet addresses on which we will organize the network structure, perhaps opening our system to the exchange of images and information from outside VMC. <BR><BR>

<tr><td align=top width=50%><H5>In 1990, the department started replacing its older fluoroscopic units with new digital units.  One important condition of purchase was that all units were to be completely digital with no "add on" digital divices manufactured and installed by a third party.  Having a totally integrated single vendor system is a very important consideration. <BR><BR>
The Digital Fluoro network consists of each fluoroscopy unit interconnected by a 10mb/s ethernet
hub.  The Hub is connected to the High Speed Switch for rapid transmission of images to a laser printer.  There is also an ethernet to a server/workstation for viewing of fluroscopic images.<BR><BR>
In early 1997, the fluorscopy section hopes to be the first test of an HL-7 interface to the operators console of the x-ray equipment for the purpose of uploading demographic data.  If successful, this eliminate double entry of patient demographics, and insure the integrity of our future archival system.  It is our opinion that the RIS/PACS interface has to be completed before an archival system is installed.<BR><BR>

The Radiology Departments <a href="mission.htm">mission</a> is to provide accurate, efficient, cost effective, timely diagnostic information and therapeutic procedures which enable medical care providers meet the needs of their patients. <br><br> 

Our reputation for excellence stems from our ability to arrive quickly at an accurate diagnosis with minimum diagnostic testing.  We work closely with our referring providers to correlate clinical information and create a diagnostic plan that will lead to the diagnosis efficiently without the need for patients to return for additional imaging tests.  We strive to complete the diagnostic imaging workup in one day whenever possible.  <br><br>

Virginia Masons Radiology department is well situated for <a href="pacs.htm">digital imaging</a> through an installed Ethernet network.   As all modalities become DICOM compatible, we will be able to move images from one modality to another, and view the images on diagnostic workstations.   At some point we intend to move images and reports to the clinical side of the medical centers networks.

<center><table width="85%"><tr><td>
I want to take a moment to comment on the unique educational opportunities offered by our residency program.  Our satellite system provides the program with  a large primary care base. Because we are a regional referral, or tertiary care center, we have the opportunity to care for large numbers of patients with extremely complex medical problems.  Virginia Mason is a multispecialty clinic that prides itself on the very close working relationships developed between its clinical colleagues. We have the opportunity to learn from them, while at the same time provide better patient care.<br><br>  

The residency training program is small, with a high faculty to resident ratio that allows residents and staff to have a close working relationship.  Interesting clinical material is discussed formally or informally by residents and staff.  There are no fellows in our program, so residents have access to all patient volume and are one on one with staff.  Our residents do extremely well on national board examinations, and more importantly in obtaining fellowships and jobs once residency training is complete.  Our curriculum has a unique feature of an additional focus on the business side of radiology and the implications of our nations changing health care environment on diagnostic imaging.<br><br>

Again, I extend a personal welcome to our Internet pages.  We sincerely appreciate your interest.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>

<PRE><H4> <B>FINDINGS:</B>  Images through the upper abdomen demonstrate a 5 cm left adrenal mass, 
                       and a large, irregular mass in the mesenteric root with strand-like extensions 
                       into the adjacent fat.  This appearance is consistent with a desmoid tumor.


  DIAGNOSIS:  Gardner's syndrome, with  
                                                   a.) mesenteric desmoid
                                                   b.) a left adrenal neoplasm   
</H4>  </PRE>
<PRE><H4> <B>DISCUSSION:</B> Gardner's syndrome is familial polyposis coli in association with a variety of
                            extraintestinal manifestations including osteomas, soft tissue tumors (including desmoids
                            and sarcomas), and an increased incidence of ampullary carcinoma.  More recently, an
                            association with the Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndromes has also been recognized.
                            This probably accounts for the co-existing left adrenal mass in our patient.  Patients with
                            Garners (unlike those with familial polyposis coli) are at higher risk for the developing
                            desmoid tumors, peritoneal adhesions, and keloids in surgical sites.  This places these
                            patients at increased risk of retroperitoneal fibrosis, and ureteral or bowel obstruction due
                            to the desmoplastic response they mount following surgery.

construction of a "Central Cable Plant" room in order to consolidate  our connections to one
central location.  <BR><BR>
The network consists of each modality interconnected by 10mb/s ethernet
hubs all of which in turn are connected to an ethernet switch.  The CR system
from ICU and CCU, the physician workstations and laser printers 
are all connected directly to Hi Speed Switch ports.<BR><BR>
Our cabling consists of twenty two miles of Level 5 unshielded twisted pair.
There are a minimum of two RJ45 connections in every room of the Radiology Department, one connected to the imaging network, the other to the IS network. <BR><BR>

<LI>Recently a paper was copied from the site without the author's, and Winn Schwartau's permission regarding the E-Bomb.  It was used in a TV broadcast in Europe by Thema televison.  Our global readers wrote us in mass regarding this because parts of the broadcast were in question as being accurate.  We asked for a right of reply.  No reply to inforwar.com  has been received from ARTE-Thema.  This is a classic example of disinformation.... information warfare.

McNulty presents a clear picture at what we are actually prepared to do; to what degree are we willing to be other than "nice guys", and to what degree
are we willing to give up aspects of our own freedom in the name of security.<BR>

No reply to inforwar.com  has been received from ARTE-Thema.  This is a classic example of disinformation.... information warfare.

mind of its own and will do what they think is best.</P>

<P>We prefer submissions attached in a decent format, like Word 'cause they're 
easier to massage. If you really, really have no other choice, then TXT is OK, but 
it goes to the bottom of the list due to time constraints. Sorry.

<H4>List Servers</H4> 
 
<P>
In the next few weeks, Infowar.Com lists will begin fullfilling all of our on-line discussion needs in the following areas. </P> 
<UL> 
<LI>Infowar - The Big Picture<BR>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<DL><DT>
<DT><FORM ACTION="http://www.infowar.com/cgi-shl/discuss.pl" METHOD="post">
<Input type="hidden" Name="list" value="infowar"></DT>
	<DD><INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="join_type" VALUE="digest" CHECKED>Digested list -- 1 Digested group of messages per day</DD>
	<DD><INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="join_type" VALUE="join">Undigested list -- each post is forwarded separately</DD>
    	<DD>E-Mail Address: <INPUT NAME="email" SIZE=30> <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="  Join  "></DD>
</FORM>
	<DD> 
This is the first list that will begin. Shortly, and based upon interest, we will commence with the following
discussion groups. Note:  To change delivery format, rejoin your selected list with the same E-mail address with the selected option. 
</DD>
</DL>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
<BR> 
 
<LI>Terrorism, To be Moderated by Matt DeVost<BR> 
 
<BR> 
<LI>Hackers, To be Moderated by Chris Goggans<BR> 
 
<BR> 
<LI>OSINT - Open Source Intelligence, To be Moderated by Robert Steele<BR> 
 
<BR> 
<LI>Internet Security/Firewalls <BR> 
 
<BR> 
 
</UL>
 
But it doesn't end there. We will add more of what <B>you want</B>. More lists to focus on those areas and topics that make sense to Information Warriors and Information Security Professionals everywhere. 
 
If when you registered for Infowar.Com, you chose to be on our mailing list, you will be automatically notified how to subscribe to each group. We will maintain on line archives of the raw feeds to the lists as well as the digested version. Both will be available for searches. 
 
If you have ideas on future list servers, please <a href="MAILTO:webwarrior@infowar.com">let us know</A>. 
<BR> 
 
<h4>Bulletin Boards</H4> 
 
Infowar.Com will also open internal real-time discussion groups in use-net fashion, sometime later this year. If you'd like to assist or have any ideas, please do let us know. 
<BR> 
<h4>Conferencing</h4> 
 
Not today, not next week, but soon, Infowar.Com will install complete audio and video conferencing facilities so Info-warriors world wide can communicate in human ways at no more cost than sending email. Once we all get the hang of it, we hope to use it for broadcast of events as they occur.

<P>We've always been interactive minded and we will count upon our users and sponsors to guide us to provide better and better service.

<H4>Our Sales Pitch</H4>

We want you, and you hopefully see the value we offer and the audience we bring; ergo  you want us. Partners. Win-win. 

<P>Your banner ads will permeate the entire Infowar.Com site where ump-teen thousands of your audience will come day in and day out. Not only the home site but on major sub-Home pages. Link them to your site or, if you prefer, we'll give you between 5MB - 20MB of space on our site to save browsing time and effort. Not only will your WWW site be linked from high profile locations, but Infowar.Com search engines will pick up your information right here - where it belongs.
</P>

<P>And, we will include sponsors names and links elsewhere, too. On articles, list servers, downloads; anywhere to put your name in front of your customers.</P>

<P>So, to encourage you to sign up early and advertise in the early days (or maybe the correct term is sponsor? yeah, sponsor is so much better . . .) we're gonna offer tremendous incentives. Call <a href="MAILTO: Betty@infowar.com">Betty@Infowar.Com</a> and find out the advantages of signing up now - early - while the getting is good, and we'll rate lock you no matter how much traffic Infowar.Com generates. No matter how many hits you get, 50,000 or 500,000, the rates are guaranteed for those who rate-lock and Sponsor us early. Plus, we'll give you first right of refusal on all new promotions and sponsorship opportunities. (In order of sign up.)<BR>

UK: CONNECTED - COUNTING ON FINGERTIP PRECISION.<BR>
By PATRICK HOOK.
</h3>
</center><BR>
<p>December 31, 1996</p>


<P> Police will be able to compare marks found at the scene of a crime with 4.5
million others.
 
<P>AN AMERICAN space exploration company is hoping to ensure that many more British
criminals are caught and convicted. As part of a $100 million contract, TRW, a
systems integration company that was largely responsible for providing the
high-technology input to the Apollo space programme, is now busy designing a
computer system that, it hopes, will provide all police forces in England and
Wales with the ability to identify the fingerprints of known criminals within
seconds.
<P>The scheme is expected to go "live" in September 1997, with the last forces
getting their equipment by the year 2001.
<P>The new system will, according to Home Office sources, be capable of checking
more than a million fingerprints a second from any of the 50 or so fingerprint
bureaux in England and Wales.
<P>The National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS) is expected to
be the most advanced system of its kind anywhere in the world, enabling police
to compare marks found at the scene of a crime with the 4.5 million sets of
<P>"10-print" fingerprints in the national collection at Hendon, a procedure that
is not routinely carried out except in the most serious cases.
<P>"Even for quite serious offences, the police service does not currently have the
ability to compare marks found at the scenes of crimes against the national
fingerprint collection," said John Hoddinott, Chief Constable of Hampshire.
<P>"To do so would take weeks, and even with our current automated system we search
only against our own, local fingerprint collection."
<P>The Home Office specification nearly doubles the existing ability of computer
software to match accurately fingerprints found at the scene with those taken
from prisoners, and has demanded a response time of less than one hour.
When it was first announced in September 1991, the Home Office originally
intended that the system should follow in the footsteps of a similar project
being developed in America for the FBI, but which is now 18 months behind
schedule and $119 million over budget.
<P>Standing in the wings is the British AFR Consortium of 32 UK police forces,
which, at the end of November, completed the roll-out of its own system,
covering about 75 per cent of the population in England and Wales.
Although tight-lipped in public, the consortium is known to be interested in
providing the national fingerprint identification system if the TRW solution
should collapse.
<P>"You may wish to draw the conclusion that the AFR Consortium is ideally placed
to provide a national AFR system in the event that TRW fails," said Mr
Hoddinott, "but I could not possibly comment."
<P>Meanwhile, the NAFIS project continues, apparently on time and on course. If it
achieves what is expected, it will mean that officers will, for the first time,
have access to the identity of prisoners within an hour of arrest, will know the
identity of a burglar within seconds of arriving at the scene of a crime and
will, again for the first time, be able to link suspects to crimes committed
anywhere in England and Wales.

<P>     MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

 <P>    WEINER, J.

<P>     NOVEMBER 4, 1996

<P>     These cases present the novel issue of whether, under the
     First Amendment to the United States Constitution, one private
     company has the unfettered right to send unsolicited e-mail
     advertisements to subscribers of another private online company
     over the Internet and whether the private online company has the
     right to block the e-mail advertisements from reaching its members.

<P>     The question is important because while the Internet provides the
     opportunity to disseminate vast amounts of information, the
     Internet does not, at least at the present time, have any means to
     police the dissemination of that information. We therefore find
     that, in the absence of State action, the private online service
     has the right to prevent unsolicited e-mail solicitations from
     reaching its subscribers over the Internet.

<P>     The cases have their genesis in a letter dated January
     26, 1996, in which America Online, Inc. ("AOL") advised Cyber
     Promotions, Inc. ("Cyber") that AOL was upset with Cyber's
     dissemination of unsolicited e-mail to AOL members over the
     Internet. AOL subsequently sent a number of "e-mail bombs"' to
     Cyber's Internet service providers ("ISP").

<P>     On March 26, 1996, Cyber filed Civil Action No. 96-2486
     in this Court against AOL in response to AOL's "e-mail bombing" of
     Cyber's ISPs. The Complaint alleges that as a result of AOL's E-
     mail bombing", two of Cyber's ISPs terminated their relationship
     with Cyber and a third ISP refused to enter into a contract with
     Cyber. The Complaint asserts a claim for violation of the Computer
     Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030, as well as state law
     claims
     for intentional interference with contractual relations, tortious
     interference with prospective contractual relations and unfair
     competition. The Complaint seeks certain injunctive relief and
     damages.

<P>     On April 8, 1996, AOL filed a ten-count Complaint against
     Cyber in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
     of Virginia, alleging service and trade name infringement, service
     mark and trade name dilution, false designation of origin, false
     advertising, unfair competition, violations of the Virginia
     Consumer Protection Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act,
     the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Virginia Computer Crimes

<P>     -----------footnotes----------

<P>     1. In past submissions, Cyber has stated that AOL's "e-mail
     bombs" occurred when AOL gathered all unsolicited e-mail sent by
     Cyber to undeliverable AOL addresses, altered the return path of
     such e-mail, and then sent the altered e-mail in a bulk transmis-
     sion to Cyber's ISPs in order to disable the ISPs.

<P>     --------end footnotes---------

<P>     Act. AOL seeks various injunctive relief and damages.

<P>     On May 8, 1996, Cyber filed a First Amended Complaint in
     Civil Action No. 96-2486 in which it asserted the same four claims
     it asserted in its original Complaint and added a declaratory
     judgment claim (Count V). Cyber seeks, inter alia, a "declaration
     that [it] has the right to send to AOL members via the Internet
     unsolicited e-mail advertisements." Amended Complaint at p. 21.
     Cyber also asks the Court to "permanently enjoin[] AOL ... from ...
     directly or indirectly preventing AOL members from receiving
     [Cyber's] e-mail messages." Id.

<P>     On June 17, 1996, AOL filed a First Amended Complaint in
     the Virginia action in which it added claims for misappropriation,
     conversion, and unjust enrichment.

<P>     By Order dated July 24, 1996, the judge in the Eastern
     District of Virginia to whom AOL's action was assigned, transferred
     that action to this Court, finding that it arises from "the same
     nucleus of operltive facts" as Cyber's action and that therefore
     "the two cases should be consolidated for trial." Upon transfer to
     this Court, AOL's action was assigned Civil Action No. 96-5213. The
     parties have agreed that the First Amended Complaint in that action
     will be treated as setting forth AOL~s counterclaims in Civil
     Action No. 96-2486.

<P>     AOL has vehemently argued throughout the brief history of
     these suits that Cyber has no right to send literally millions of
     e-mail messages each day to AOL's Internet servers free of charge
     and resulting in the overload of the e-mail servers. Indeed, the
     court has received a plethora of letters from disgruntled AOL
     members who object to having to receive Cyber's unsolicited e-mail
     whenever they sign on to AOL despite repeated attempts to be
     removed from Cyber's lists. Cyber, on the other hand, has contended
     that without the right to send unsolicited e-mail to AOL members,
     it will go out of business.

<P>     Recognizing that Cyber's contention that it has the right
     to send unsolicited e-mail to AOL members over the Internet
     implicates the First Amendment and therefore is a threshold issue,
     the Court directed the parties to brief the following issue:
     Whether Cyber has a right under the First Amendment of the United
     States Constitution to send unsolicited e-mail to AOL members via
     the Internet and concomitantly whether AOL has the right under the
     First Amendment to block the e-mail sent by Cyber from reaching AOL
     members over the Internet. In response, AOL has filed a document
     entitled "Motion for Partial Summary Judgment of America Online,
     Inc. on First Amendment issues." Specifically, AOL seeks summary
     judgment on Cyber's declaratory judgment claim asserted in Count V
     of Cyber's First Amended Complaint. Cyber has filed a document
     entitled "Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of its First Amendment
     Right to Send Internet E-Mail to Defendant's Members."

<P>     The Court also directed the parties to enter into a
     Stipulation of Facts solely for the purpose of resolving the First
     Amendment issue. Pursuant to the Court's directive, the parties
     have stipulated to the following facts:

<P>     1. Cyber is a corporation organized and existing under
     the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, having a place of
     business at 1255 Passmore Street, 1st Floor, Philadelphia,
     Pennsylvania 19111.

<P>     2. AOL is a corporation organized and existing under the
     laws of the State of Delaware with its principal place of business
     at 22000 AOL Way, Dulles, Virginia 20166.

<P>     3. AOL was and is a private online company that has
     invested substantial sums of its own money in equipment, name,
     software and reputation. AOL is not owned in whole or in part by
     the government.

<P>     4. AOL is owned by shareholders, and its stock trades on
     the New York Stock Exchange.

<P>     5. AOL is not a government entity or political subdivision.

<P>     6. AOL's members or subscribers pay prescribed fees for
     use of AOL resources, access to AOL and access and use of AOL's e-
     mail system and its connection to the Internet.

<P>     7. AOL's e-mail system operates through dedicated
     computers known as servers, which consist of computer hardware and
     software purchased, maintained and owned by AOL. AOL's computer
     servers have a finite, though expandable, capacity to handle e-
     mail. All Internet e-mail from non-AOL members to AOL customers or
     members and from AOL customers or members to non-AOL members
     requires the use of AOL's computer hardware and software in
     combination with the hardware and software of the Internet and the
     hardware and software of the non-AOL members.

<P>     8. Private companies compete with AOL in the online business.

<P>     9. There has been no government involvement in AOL's
     business decision to institute or reinstitute a block directed to
     Internet e-mail sent by Cyber to AOL members or subscribers.

<P>     10. Although the Internet is accessible to all persons
     with just a computer, a modem and a service provider, the constitu-
     ent parts of the Internet (namely the computer hardware and
     software, servers, service providers and related items) are owned
     and managed by private entities and persons, corporations,
     educational institutions and government entities, who cooperate to
     allow their constituent parts to be interconnected by a vast
     network of phone lines.

<P>     11. In order for non-AOL members to send Internet e-mail
     to AOL members, non-AOL members must utilize a combination of their
     own hardware and software, the Internet and AOL's network.

<P>     12. To obtain its initial access to the Internet, AOL
     obtained an Internet address and domain name from IANA, a clearing-
     house that routinely and ministerially assigns Internet addresses
     and domain names.

<P>     13. Cyber, an advertising agency incorporated in 1996,
     provides advertising services for companies and individuals wishing
     to advertise their products and services via e-mail.

<P>     14. Cyber sends its e-mail via the Internet to members of
     AOL, members of other commercial online services and other
     individuals with an Internet e-mail address.

<P>     15. AOL provides its subscribing members with one or more
     e-mail addresses so that members can exchange e-mail with one
     another and exchange e-mail (both sending and receiving) over the
     Internet with non-AOL members.

<P>     16. AOL has attached to its Memorandum of Law in Support
     of its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on First Amendment
     Issues three sets of examples of e-mail messages sent by Cyber to
     AOL members. The first set (Tab 1) consists of a multi-page set of
     advertisements; the second set (Tab 2) consists of an exclusive or
     single-advertiser e-mail; and the third set (Tab 3) consists of a
     document called by Cyber an "e-mag." Under each tab are two
     examples, the first selected by AOL and the second selected by
     Cyber. The Court has reviewed all of the examples and notes that
     many of the ads include get-rich-quick ads, weight loss ads, health
     aid promises and even phone sex services.

<P>     17. To attract membership, AOL offers a variety of
     services, options, resources and support, including content-based
     services, access to stock quotes, children's entertainment, news,
     and the ability to send and receive Internet e-mail to and from
     non-AOL members.

<P>     In addition to the parties's Stipulation of Facts, it is
     necessary for resolution of the issue before us to relate some of
     the factual findings about the Internet itself made earlier this
     year by our court in American Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 929
     F.Supp. 824 (E.D. Pa. 1996). They are as follows:

<P>     18. "The Internet is...a unique and wholly new medium of
     worldwide human communication." Id. at 844.

<P>     19. The Internet is "a giant network which interconnects
     innumerable smaller groups of linked computer networks." Id. at
     830. In short, it is "a global Web of linked networks and comput-
     ers..." Id. at 831.

<P>     20. "The Internet is an international system." Id. It is
     "a decentralized, global medium of communications -- or 'cyberspace'
     --
     that links people, institutions, corporations, and governments
     round the world. This communications medium allows any of the
     literally tens of millions of people with access to the Internet to
     exchange information." Id.

<P>     21. "No single entity -- academic, corporate, governmen-
     tal, or non-profit -- administers the Internet. It exists and
     functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of thousands of
     separate operators of computers and computer networks independently
     decided to use common data transfer protocol to exchange communica-
     tions and information with other computers (which in turn exchange
     communications and information with still other computers)." Id. at
     832.

<P>     22. Computer users have a wide variety of avenues by
     which to access the Internet. Id. One such avenue is "through one
     of the major national commercial 'online services' such as [AOL]...
     Id. at 833. These online services offer nationwide computer
     networks (so that subscribers can dial-in to a local telephone
     number), and the services provide extensive and well organized
     content within their own proprietary computer networks. In addition
     to allowing access to the extensive content available within each
     online service, the services also allow subscribers to link to the
     much larger resources of the Internet." Id. (emphasis in original)
     "The major commercial online services have almost twelve million
     individual subscribers across the United States." Id. Approximately
     six million individuals are subscribers of AOL.

<P>     23. There are a number of different ways to communicate
     over the Internet. One such way "is via electronic mail, or 'e-
     mail', comparable in principle to sending a first class letter. One
     can address and transmit a message to one or more other people."
     Id. at 834.

<P>     24."[T]he content on the Internet is as diverse as human
     thought." Id. at 842.

<P>     25. "Communications over the Internet do not "invade" an
     individuals's home or appear on one's computer screen unbidden.
     Users seldom encounter content 'by accident.'" Id. at 844.

<P>     26. Unlike a radio or television, "the receipt of
     information on the Internet requires a series of affirmative steps
     more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial." Id. at
     845.

 <P><B>    STANDARD OF REVIEW</B>

<P>     Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary
     judgment may be granted when, "after considering the record
     evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, no
     genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is
     entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Turner v. Schering-
     Plough Corp., 901 F.2d 335, 340-41 (3d Cir. 1990). For a dispute
     to be "genuine," the evidence must be such that a reasonable jury
     could return a verdict for the non-moving party. Anderson v.
     Liberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Williams v. Borough
     of Chester, 891 F.2d, 458, 460 (3d Cir. 1989). To establish a
     genuine issue of material fact, the non-moving party must introduce
     evidence beyond the mere pleadings to create an issue of material
     fact on "an element essential to that party's case, and on which
     that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex v.
     Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). The burden of demonstrating the
     absence of genuine issues of material fact is initially on the
     moving party regardless of which party would have the burden of
     persuasion at trial. First Nat'l Bank of Pennsylvania v. Lincoln
     Nat'l Life Ins., 824 F.2d 177, 180 (3d Cir. 1987). Following such
     a showing, the non-moving party must present evidence through
     affidavits or depositions and admissions on file which comprise of
     a showing sufficient to establish the existence of every element
     essential to that party's case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. If that
     evidence in, however, "'merely colorable' or is 'not significantly
     probative,' summary judgment may be granted." Equimark Commercial
     Finance Co. v. C.I.T. Financial Corp. 812 F.2d 141, 144 (3d Cir.
     1987) (quoting, in part, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50).

<P>     In view of the parties' Stipulation of Facts and the
     prior factual findings of this Court in ACLU v. Reno, supra., the
     Court finds there are no genuine issues of material fact as to the
     First Amendment issue and that that issue is suitable for summary
     disposition.

<P>     In its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, AOL contends
     that Cyber has no First Amendment right to send unsolicited e-mail
     to AOL members over the Internet because AOL is not a state actor,
     AOL's e-mail servers are not public fora in which Cyber has a right
     to speak, Cyber's right to use AOL's, service free of charge, does
     not substantially outweigh AOL's right to speak or not to speak,
     and that AOL's restrictions on mass e-mail solicitations are
     tailored to serve a substantial interest. Motion for Partial
     Summary Judgment at 6. Because we find AOL is not a state actor and
     none of its activities constitute state action, we need not
     consider AOL's remaining First Amendment contentions.

<P>     The First Amendment to the United States Constitution
     states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment
     of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
     the freedom of speech, or of the press." The United States Supreme
     Court has recognized that "the constitutional guarantee of free
     speech is a guarantee only against abridgement by government,
     federal or state." Hudgens v.NLRB, 424 U.S. 507, 513 (1976). Only
     recently, the Supreme Court has stated that "the guarantees of free
     speech ... guard only against encroachment by the government and
     'erec[t] no shield against merely private conduct.'" Hurley v.
     Irish-American Gay Group of Boston, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 2344 (1995)
     (citation omitted).

 <P>    In the case sub judice, the parties have stipulated that
     AOL is a private online company that is not owned in whole or part
     by the government. Stipulation of Facts at p. 3. (emphasis added).
     The parties have further stipulated that "AOL is not a government
     entity or political subdivision." Id. at p. 5. They have also
     stipulated that there has been no government involvement in AOL's
     business decision to institute or reinstitute a block directed to
     Internet e-mail sent by Cyber to AOL members or subscribers. Id. at
     p. 9.

<P>     Despite these stipulations, Cyber argues that AOL's
     conduct has the character of state action. As a general matter,
     private action can only be considered state action when "there is
     a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged
     action of [the private entity] so that the action of the latter may
     be fairly treated as that of the State itself." Blum v. Yaretsky,
     457 U.S. 991, 1004 (1982). Recently, our Court of Appeals observed
     that the Supreme Court appears to utilize three distinct tests in
     determining whether there has been state action. Mark v. Borough of
     Hatboro, 51 F.3d 1137, 1142 (3d Cir. 1995). First, we must consider
     whether "'the private entity has exercised powers that are
     traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state.'" Id.
     (quoting Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. at 1004-05. (emphasis in
     Mark)). This test is known as the exclusive public function test.
     If the private entity does not exercise such powers, we must
     consider whether "'the private entity has acted with the help of or
     in concert with state officials.'" Mark, 51 F.3d at 1142 (quoting
     McKeesport Hospital v. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
     Ed., 24 F.3d 519, 524 (3d Cir. 1994)). The final test is whether
     "'[t]he State has so far insinuated itself into a position of
     interdependence with ... [the acting party] that it must be
     recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity.'"
     Mark, 51 F.3d at 1142 (quoting Krynicky v. University of Pitts-
     burgh, 742 F.2d 94, 98 (3d Cir. 1984)).

<P>     With regard to the first test, AOL exercises absolutely
     no powers which are in any way the prerogative, let alone the
     exclusive prerogative, of the State. In ACLU, supra, this Court
     previously found that no single entity, including the State,
     administers the Internet. ACLU, 929 F.Supp. at 832. Rather, the
     Court found that the Internet is a "'global Web of linked networks
     and computers" which exists and functions as the result of the
     desire of hundreds of thousands of computer operators and networks
     to use common data transfer data protocol to exchange communica-
     tions and information. Id. In addition, "the constituent parts of
     the Internet ... are owned and managed by private entities and
     persons, corporations, educational institutions and government
     entities, who cooperate to allow their constituent parts to be
     interconnected by a vast network of phone lines." Stipulation of
     Facts at p. 10. As a result, tens of millions of people with access
     to the Internet can exchange information. AOL is merely one of many
     private online companies which allow its members access to the
     Internet through its e-mail system where they can exchange
     information with the general public. The State has absolutely no
     interest in, and does not regulate, this exchange of information
     between people, institutions, corporations and governments around
     the world.

<P>     Cyber argues, however, that "'by providing Internet e-mail
     and acting as the sole conduit to its members' Internet e-mail
     boxes, AOL has opened up that part of its network and as such, has
     sufficiently devoted this domain for public use. This dedication of
     AOL's Internet e-mail accessway performs a public function in that
     it is open to the public, free of charge to any user, where public
     discourse, conversations and commercial transactions can and do
     take place." Cyber's Memorandum in Support of its First Amendment
     Right to Send Internet E-Mail to Defendant's Members at 13. Cyber
     therefore contends that AOL's Internet e-mail accessway is similar
     to the company town in Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946), which
     the Supreme Court found performed a public function and therefore
     was a state actor.

<P>     In Marsh, a Jehovah's Witness was convicted of criminal
     trespass for distributing literature without a license on a
     sidewalk in a town owned by a private company. The Supreme Court
     found that since the private company owned the streets, sidewalks,
     and business block, paid the sheriff, privately owned and managed
     the sewage system, and owned the building where the United States
     post office was located, the company, in effect, operated as the
     municipal government of the town. Marsh, 326 U.S. at 502-03. "[T]he
     owner of the company town was performing the full spectrum of
     municipal powers and stood in the shoes of the State." Lloyd Corp.
     V. Tanner, 407 U.S. 551, 569 (1972). The Court observed that "[t]he
     more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by
     the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed
     by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it."
     Marsh, 326 U.S. at 506. As a result, the Court found state action
     in "the State['s] ... attempt[] to impose criminal punishment on
     appellant for undertaking to distribute religious literature in a
     company town..." Marsh, 326 U.S. at 509. Our Court of Appeals has
     noted that "Marsh has been construed narrowly." Cable Investments.
     Inc. v. Woolley, 867 F.2d 151, 162 (3d Cir. 1989).<2>

<P>     By providing its members with access to the Internet
     through its e-mail system so that its members can exchange
     information with those members of the public who are also connected
     to the Internet, AOL is not exercising any of the municipal powers
     or public services traditionally exercised by the State as did the
     private company in Marsh. Although AOL has technically opened its
     e-mail system to the public by connecting with the Internet, AOL

<P>     ---------footnotes-----------

<P>     2 Indeed, our Court of Appeals has observed that the exclusive
     public function test itself "rarely could be satisfied." Mark, 51
     F.3d at 1142. "Thus, in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419
     U.S. 345 (1974), the Court held that a private utility company,
     extensively regulated by the state, and apparently holding at least
     a partial monopoly in its territory, did not act under color of
     state law, in part because the state where the utility was engaged
     in business had 'rejected the contention that the furnishing of
     utility services is either a state function or a municipal duty.'
     (citation omitted). Similarly, in Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S.
     830 (1982), the Court held that a private entity engaged in the
     education of maladjusted high school students did not perform an
     exclusively public function because '[the state's] legislative
     policy choice [to fund the public school] in no way makes these
     services the exclusive province of the State.' (citation omitted);
     see also Black v. Indiana Area Sch. Dist., 985 F.2d 707, 710-11 (3d
     Cir. 1993) (private contractor providing state school bus program
     at state expense not performing exclusive state function)." Mark,
     id.

<P>     ---------end footnoes-----------

<P>     has not opened its property to the public by performing any
     municipal power or essential public service and, therefore, does
     not stand in the shoes of the State. Marsh is simply inapposite to
     the facts of the case sub judice.

<P>     Cyber also argues that AOL's Internet e-mail connection
     constitutes an exclusive public function because there are no
     alternative avenues of communication for Cyber to send its e-mail
     to AOL members. As support for this proposition, Cyber directs our
     attention to the decisions of the Supreme Court in United States
     Postal Service v. Greenburgh Civic Assn's, 453 U.S. 114 (1981);
     Lloyd Corp v. Tanner, 407 U.S. 551 (1972) and Amalqamated Food
     Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U.S. 308 (1968). Of
     these decisions, only the Lloyd decision is helpful to Cyber.

<P>     In Greenburgh, a civic association challenged a federal
     statue which prohibited the deposit of unstamped "mailable matter"
     in a letterbox approved by the United States Postal Service. The
     civic association contended that the First Amendment guaranteed
     them the right to deposit, without postage, their notices,
     circulars, flyers in such letterboxes. The Supreme Court upheld the
     constitutionality of the statute, finding that neither the
     enactment nor the enforcement of the statute was geared in any way
     to the content of the message sought to be placed in the letterbox.
     The Court also noted that the statute did not prevent individuals
     from going door-to-door to distribute their message or restrict the
     civic organization's right to use the mails. Greenburgh, however,
     did not involve the issue of whether there was state action. It
     therefore is inapplicable to the issue of whether AOL's conduct
     constitutes state action.

<P>     In Logan Valley, a case involving peaceful picketing
     directed solely at one establishment within a shopping center, the
     Court reviewed the Marsh decision in detail, emphasized the
     similarities between a shopping center and a company town and
     concluded that a shopping center is the "functional equivalent" of
     the business district in Marsh. As a result, the Court held that
     the picketers had a First Amendment right to picket within a
     shopping center. Logan Valley, however, was subsequently overruled
     by Lloyd,supra. Hudgens v. National Labor Relations Board, 424 U.S.
     507 (1976). ("[W]e make clear now, if it was not clear before, that
     the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive the Court's decision
     in the Lloyd case.")

<P>     In Lloyd, a group of individuals sought to distribute
     handbills in the interior of a privately owned shopping center. The
     content of the handbills was not directed at any one establishment
     in the shopping center but instead was directed at the Vietnam War.
     The Court noted that, unlike the situation in Logan Valley where
     the protestors had no other alternative to convey their message at
     the single establishment in the shopping center, the protesters in
     Lloyd could distribute their message about the Vietnam war on any
     public street, sidewalk or park outside the mall. The Court
     therefore found that "[i]t would be an unwarranted infringement of
     property rights to require [the protesters] to yield to the
     exercise of First Amendment under circumstances where adequate
     alternative avenues of communication exist." Lloyd, 407 U.S. at
     567. The Lloyd Court went on to reject the individuals' functional
     equivalency argument, finding that the private shopping center
     neither assumed the full spectrum of municipal powers nor stood in
     the shoes of the state, as did the private company in Marsh. The
     Court held that, "[t]he First and Fourteenth Amendments safeguard
     the rights of free speech and assembly by limitations on state
     action, not on action by the owner of private property used
     nondiscriminatorily for private purposes only." Lloyd, 407 U.S. at
     567 (emphasis in original).

<P>     Cyber has numerous alternative avenues of sending its
     advertising to AOL members. An example of another avenue Cyber has
     of sending its advertising to AOL members over the Internet is the
     World Wide Web which would allow access by Internet users,
     including AOL customers, who want to receive Cyber's e-mail.
     Examples of non-Internet avenues include the United States mail,
     telemarketing, television, cable, newspapers, magazines and even
     passing out leaflets. Of course, AOL's decision to block Cyber's e-
     mail from reaching AOL's members does not prevent Cyber from
     sending its e-mail advertisements to the members of competing
     commercial online services, including CompuServe, the Microsoft
     Network and Prodigy.

<P>     Having found that AOL is not a state actor under the
     exclusive public function test, we evaluate whether AOL is a state
     actor under the remaining two tests, i.e. whether AOL is acting
     with the help of or in concert with state officials and whether the
     State has put itself in a position of interdependence with AOL such
     that it must be considered a participant in AOL's conduct. These
     tests actually overlap one another.

<P>     In its Memorandum, Cyber does not specifically argue that
     AOL is acting in concert with state officials. Indeed, the two
     major cases from the Supreme Court which have found state action
     under this test are clearly distinguishable from the case sub
     judice. See, Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144 (1970)
     (finding a conspiracy between a private actor and a state official
     to engage in unlawful discrimination constituted action under color
     of law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil
     Co., 457 U.S. 922 (1982) (finding private creditor's pre-judgment
     attachment petition upon which clerk of state court issued a writ
     of attachment and sheriff executed the writ on property of private
     debtor was state action under Sec. 1983).

 <P>    Rather, Cyber relies on the "joint participation"
     doctrine and contends that "AOL's use of the Court to obtain
     injunctive relief and/or damages [which it seeks in its prayer for
     relief in its counterclaim] and its assertions of federal and state
     statutory law, which if applicable to Cyber's activities, would
     violate Cyber's First Amendment rights." Cyber's Memorandum at 15.

<P>     In Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614
     (1991) the Supreme Court refined the joint participation test by
     announcing that courts must ask "first whether the claimed
     constitutional deprivation resulted from the exercise of a right or
     privilege having its source in state authority; and second, whether
     the private party charged with the deprivation could be described
     in all fairness as a state actor." Edmonson, 500 U.S. at 620. Under
     the first prong, the inquiry is "under what authority did the
     private person engage in the allegedly unlawful acts." Mark, 51
     F.3d at 1144.

<P>     In the case sub judice, the parties have stipulated that
     "[t]here has been no government involvement in AOL's business
     decisions with respect to e-mail sent by Cyber nor in any AOL
     decision to institute or reinstitute a block directed to Internet
     e-mail sent by Cyber to AOL members or subscribers." Stipulation of
     Facts at p. 9. As a result, Cyber is unable to satisfy even the
     first prong of the joint participation test.

<P>     In addition, our Court of Appeals has stated that
     "[m]erely instituting a routine civil suit does not transform a
     litigant's actions into those taken under color of state law."
     Tunstall v. Office of Judicial Support, 820 F.2d 631, 634 (3d Cir.
     1987). The Tunstall Court concluded that the filing of a quiet
     title action in state court by a purchaser of land to complete the
     seizure of plaintiff's property did not involve state action since
     the suit "did not attempt any seizure of property with the
     cooperation of state officials as in the Lugar line of cases." Id.
     In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
     Circuit has found that a regulated utility did not act under color
     of state law when it obtained a temporary restraining order from a
     state court. Cobb v. Georgia Power Co., 757 F.2d 1248 (llth Cir.
     1985). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
     has held that the mere filing of a state law contempt proceeding
     does not constitute joint participation so as to satisfy the color
     of state law requirement under 42 U.S.C. sec. 1983. Dahlberg v.
     Becker,
     748 F.2d 85 (2d Cir. 1984).

<P>     Perhaps recognizing the futility of its argument, Cyber
     contends in its Reply Memorandum that "[i]t is not Cyber's position
     that the mere filing of an action provides a party with the
     requisite state action to assert a First Amendment violation.
     Rather it is the Court's participation with the litigant in issuing
     or enforcing an order which impinges on another's First Amendment
     rights. Grandbouche v. Clancey, 825 F.2d 1463, 1466 (10th Cir.
     1987)." Reply Memorandum at 7. In Grandbouche, the United States
     Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated that the first
     Amendment "may be applicable in the context of discovery orders,
     even if all of the litigants are private entities." The Court found
     government action present as a result of a magistrate's order
     compelling discovery and the trial court's enforcement of that
     order.

<P>     We are troubled by the Grandbouche decision because it
     has the effect of creating government action every time a magis-
     trate simply signs, and a trial judge enforces, a discovery order.
     Therefore, even if this Court had enforced a discovery order (which
     we have not), we would not follow the Grandbouche decision.

<P>     In sum, we find that since AOL is not a state actor and
     there has been no state action by AOL's activities under any of the
     three tests for state action enunciated by our Court of Appeals in
     Mark, Cyber has no right under the First Amendment to the United
     States Constitution to send unsolicited e-mail to AOL's members. It
     follows that AOL, as a private company, may block any attempts by
     Cyber to do so.

<P>     Cyber also contends that its practice of sending e-mail
     advertisements to AOL's servers is also protected "under state
     constitutional law, which in many instances, affords even broader
     protection than federal First Amendment guarantees which this Court
     can enforce." Cyber's Memorandum at 17. Specifically, Cyber refers
     to the state constitutions of Pennsylvania and Virginia. 3 Although
     this argument is beyond the scope of the issue the Court directed
     the parties to brief, we will nevertheless consider it at this
     time.

<P>     The theory that a state constitution's free speech
     provisions may afford broader rights than similar provisions of the
     United States Constitution was first recognized by the Supreme
     Court in PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980).
     The PruneYard Court held that, while the First Amendment did not
     grant the defendants the right to solicit in a privately owned
     shopping center, state (California) law might grant that right. The
     Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has itself recognized that "Pennsyl-
     vania may afford greater protection to individual rights under its
     Constitution" than the Constitution of the United States. Western

<P>     -------footnotes------

<P>     3 Cyber contends it is entitled to the protection of the
     Pennsylvania Constitution because Cyber's e-mail originates from
     Pennsylvania and that it is entitled to the protection of the
     Virginia Constitution because AOL's blocking actions occur in
     Virginia.

     Commonwealth v. Tate, 432 A.2d 1382 (1981).

<P>     Article 1, Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution
     provides:
<UL>
<P>     The free communication of thoughts and opin-
     ions is one of the invaluable rights of man,
     and every citizen may freely speak, write and
     print on any subject...
</UL>
<P>     In Tate, the only case on which Cyber relies, the Supreme Court of
     Pennsylvania overturned convictions for defiant trespass stemming
     from a group of protester's refusal to desist from distributing
     politically oriented materials in a peaceful manner on the campus
     of a privately owned college. The court found that the college had
     created a public forum by opening the campus to the public to hear
     the director of the FBI to speak in a campus building. Because the
     college had become a public forum and because the defiant trespass
     statute had provided a defense to a charge of defiant trespass in
     those circumstances <4>, the Tate Court held that the protesters had
     a right to speak freely without fear of criminal conviction under
     Article I, Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.

<P>     Tate was subsequently clarified by the Supreme Court of
     Pennsylvania in Western Pennsylvania Socialist Workers. supra. In
     that case, a political committee, its chairman, a gubernatorial

     of the public and the actor complied with all
     lawful conditions imposed on access to or
     remaining on the premises.

<P>     candidate and a campaign worker claimed they had the right under,
     inter alia, Article 1, Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution
     to collect signatures for the gubernatorial candidate~s campaign at
     privately owned shopping malls, including one owned by Connecticut
     General Life Insurance Co. Connecticut General had a policy which
     uniformly prohibited all political activities including solicita-
     tion at its mall. The Court distinguished Tate, by observing that
     "[B]y adhering to a strict no political solicitation policy,
     [Connecticut General] has uniformly and generally prevented the
     mall from becoming a public forum." Western Pennsylvania, 515 A.2d
     at 1337. Rather, the Court noted that Connecticut General had only
     invited the public into the mall for commercial purposes. Since
     Connecticut General had not invited the public into the mall for
     political purposes, the Court held that Article 1, Section 7, was
     inapplicable.

<P>     The Western Pennsylvania Court also rejected attempts to
     analogize the mall to the company town in Marsh v. Alabama. supra
     by stating:
<UL>
<P>     A shopping mall is not equivalent to a town.
     Though it duplicates the commercial function
     traditionally associated with a town's busi-
     ness district or marketplace, the similarity
     ends there. People do not live in shopping
     malls. Malls do not provide essential public
     services such as water, sewers roads, sanita-
     tion or vital records, nor are they responsi-
     ble for education, recreation or transporta-
     tion. Thus, the Marsh analysis is not applica-
     ble to the instant case.
</UL>
<P>     Western Pennsylvania, 515 A.2d at 1338.

<P>     The case sub judice is more similar to Western Pennsylva-
     nia than it is to Tate. AOL's e-mail servers are certainly not a
     traditional public forum such as a street, park or even the college
     in Tate. Instead, AOL's e-mail servers are privately owned and are
     only available to the subscribers of AOL who pay a fee for their
     usage. Moreover, unlike Tate, AOL has not presented its e-mail
     servers to the public at large for disseminating political messages
     at a certain event. Indeed, AOL has never presented its e-mail
     servers to the public at large for dissemination of messages in
     general as AOL's servers have a finite capacity. Stipulation of
     Facts at p. 7. As noted above, AOL's e-mail system simply provides
     a means for its members to communicate with those members of the
     public who are connected with the Internet.
     Cyber also does not have the right under the Constitution
     of Virginia to send unsolicited e-mail over the Internet to AOL
     members. Article I, Section 12 of the Virginia Constitution
     provides:
<UL>
<P>     That the freedoms of speech and of the press
     are among the great bulwarks of liberty, and
     can never be restrained except by despotic
     governments; that any citizen may freely
     speak, write, and publish his sentiments on
     all subjects, being responsible for the abuse
     of that right; that the General Assembly shall
     not pass any law abridging the freedom of
     speech or of the press, nor the right of the
     people peaceably to assemble, and to petition
     the government for the redress of grievances.
</UL>
<P>     There are no decisions which interpret this provision in a manner
     which would be helpful to Cyber. The decisions Cyber cites,
     National Capital Naturists. Inc. v. Board of Supervisors, 878 F.2d
     128, 133 (4th Cir. 1989); Leachman v. Rector & Visitors of the
     Univ. of Virginia, 691 F.Supp. 961, 964 n.5 (W.D.Va. 1988), aff'd,
     915 F.2d 1564 (4th Cir. 1990); Robert v. Norfolk, 188 Va. 413, 49
     S.E.2d 697, 700 (1948) all merely recognize the principle enunciat-
     ed by the Supreme Court in PruneYard that states have the "sover-
     eign right" to give their constitutions an expansive interpreta-
     tion.

<P>     Although we have found that Cyber has no right under the
     First Amendment of the United States Constitution or under the
     Constitutions of Pennsylvania or Virginia to send unsolicited e-
     mail to members of AOL, we will not, at this time, enter judgment
     on Count V of Cyber's First Amended Complaint for declaratory
     relief. This is because Cyber contends in its Reply brief that
     "many more issues ... have to be addressed since there are numerous
     reasons beyond the First Amendment which will permit Cyber to send
     e-mail to AOL members." Cyber's Reply-Memorandum at 1. Therefore,
     we will simply declare that Cyber has no right under the First
     Amendment to the United States Constitution or under the Constitu-
     tions of Pennsylvania or Virginia to send unsolicited e-mail over
     the Internet to members of AOL. We will allow Cyber ten days from
     the date of this Memorandum Opinion and Order to submit a list of
     the theories other than the First Amendment it believes entitles it
     to send unsolicited e-mail to members of AOL.
